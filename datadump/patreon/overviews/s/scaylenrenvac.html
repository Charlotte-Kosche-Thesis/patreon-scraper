    "summary": "Hello there! Thanks for finding your way here and having a look at my stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Scaylen, or Scay for short. It\u0027s a pen name I\u0027ve been using ever since I first started writing and drawing all the way back in middle school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ford1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s960x960/13995581_952045164907231_3352017828889980_o.jpg?oh=db4b5692d8b24818956c5fb0e6923b7c\u0026amp;oe=59A9E0F9\" style=\"width: 211px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long while, writing has been that hobby thing that I only really did erratically and unpredictably, whenever a character became so persistent about telling me their story that\u0027d I\u0027d start writing it down just to get them to leave me alone. It\u0027s resulted in a lot of story ideas, lots of random scenes, some partially written books, and a few rather frustrating characters who like to lurk in the back of my mind, but refuse to tell me where they came from or what happened to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently however, I\u0027ve started writing more seriously, and last year, managed to self-publish my first book, called Dying Tigers: A Strange Love Story. It hasn\u0027t gotten much attention, but what little attention it has received has given me some really positive feedback and made me feel like I want to work harder at getting some of my character\u0027s stories out in the world for people to read. The hardest\u00a0 part is deciding whose story to tell first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second hardest part is motivating myself to sit down and actually write. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is where Patreon hopefully comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love talking about my characters and story ideas. The more I talk about them, the more I ask questions about the characters and their worlds, the more I want to write down what I learn about them and tell their story. I hope by being on here I can find some more people who will be interested in my stories and will want to help me breath life into them. Maybe I can even find some more beta readers for those stories I manage to get finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll probably notice I talk about my characters like they\u0027re living people inside my head. That\u0027s because that\u0027s usually how they feel to me. I know I\u0027m the one creating them, but the way I create hem is by asking questions about them, and seeing what answer comes back to that question. What would they do if this happened? Or that happened? Why do they react a certain way? Why do they have this quirk or that bizaar behavior. I\u0027m always looking to try and understand my characters history and motivation and a lot of times, they end up taking me down story paths I hadn\u0027t intended because that\u0027s just how their personality is. There\u0027s not much I can do about it unless I just don\u0027t want to tell their story anymore. Sometimes it takes me a while to get a character properly figured out and fully understand what makes them tick, but that\u0027s part of the fun of writing, learning about all the crazy characters you\u0027re going to be writing about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://scaylenrenvac.webs.com/IMG-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 212px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eNow about the stories I like to write. I tend to favor fantasy and sci-fi stories (and usually even my \"fantasy\" stories have more of a sci-fi psuedo-science feel to them). But I also dabble in romance, mystery and other just general fiction stories. While my stories aren\u0027t adult content per say (they aren\u0027t erotica, and usually don\u0027t have explicitly graphical sex scenes), they are adult content in that I don\u0027t shy away from including sex as part of the story when it makes sense for the characters to behave that way, and many of the topics my stories deal with are very ideologically sensitive, or even controversial. I like asking hard questions, and writing about difficult and complicated characters, in settings where I can fully explore the possibilities of trying to answer those questions. Some themes that run through many of my stories are abuse, tragedy, morality, equality, ethics and many other more specific themes. I also have a tendency to write characters that range the spectrum of orientations (gender, sexuality, romantically). With the exception of Dying Tigers, this isn\u0027t usually a main focus or point to the story, it\u0027s just something the characters are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDying Tigers is the only story I\u0027ve completed so far, and it was a contemporary gay romance story, following two up and coming male models/actors as they work to overcome a traumatic past. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story I\u0027m currently mainly working on is Strange Ones, which features the odd creatures shown in the picture above, called Demziens. They\u0027re bred as supposedly mindless biological weapons\u00a0 used in a war, and the story focuses on one group of them that is found to be capable of human-like intelligence. So far I\u0027ve got a pretty solid outline of the trilogy done, though it still needs a bit of work before I start actually writing out any more scenes than the ones I already have done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe number of other story ideas I\u0027ve got jotted down, but haven\u0027t fleshed out yet, numbers somewhere in the dozens. If you\u0027re interested in seeing some more of them, and encouraging me to settle down and finish writing some of them, I\u0027d appreciate the support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to offer comments and suggestions on any of my story ideas! Hearing feedback helps me figure out how to better write my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Info:\u003cbr\u003eMain Story (story I\u0027m working on the most) - Strange Ones\u003cbr\u003ePublished -\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Tigers-Strange-Love-Story-ebook/dp/B01M2BTWPM/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003eDying Tigers: A Strange Love Story\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Its-Short-Story-Scaylen-Renvac-ebook/dp/B00VX7PSNS/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003eIt\u0027s: A Short Story\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinks to my other social media sites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://scaylenrenvac.webs.com/\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/scaylenrenvac/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://scaylen.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantArt \u003c/a\u003e- I\u0027ve got a lot of artwork here that\u0027s accumulated through the years, though I\u0027m not good about posting regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://scaylenrenvac.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr \u003c/a\u003e- I\u0027m not super active on this\u003cbr\u003e"
