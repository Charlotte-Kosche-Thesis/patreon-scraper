I\u0027ve made over 250 videos and been doing it for two years now and I haven\u0027t regretted it once. It\u0027s my passion, I love chatting with you guys and meeting like-minded people, and I would love to be able to do more of it, donating would help me to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny donations would be thankfully accepted and would help in general to improve the quality of my videos. For example, I\u0027d be able to buy more props so my roleplays are more realistic.\u00a0Also, I\u0027d be able to invest more time into making better quality videos such as the videos in this playlist:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-6JtTIDr0WVdIXNO0Psqc8O_YaOyC15K\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSebastianASMR\u0027s Best Videos\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYou may have noticed that since my break, I\u0027ve started 2018 making better and better videos. A huge reason for that is my Patrons here on Patreon, you guys have helped me to get licensing for high-quality sound effects for my videos, enrol in courses to help stretch my video and audio editing skills, and purchase props that add just an extra level of realism to my videos. And of course, the more support I have on Patreon, the more time I can put into my videos to keep making them better and better for you guys :3 Creating ASMR videos is not only my passion, but my need, it keeps me healthy and energised, and I love seeing how much it helps. So if you want to support me in this, I can never thank you enough, although I will keep trying to say thank you as much as I can with some of these perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get for donating?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the rewards I offer are\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eEarly-access to videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour name at the end of every video\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonalised MP3s (monthly)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLive ASMR calls directly to you (monthly)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA monthly personalised ASMR video\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out these perks and their descriptions at the side of this page \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
