    "summary": "I am an ex-highschool-maths-teacher and current stand-up comedian and mathematics author. In addition to my occasional appearances on the BBC, Discovery and Numberphile (all of which I love and will keep doing), I believe that my own regular videos and the online community which nucleates around them are a valuable resource for getting people into mathematics and keeping them there. If you believe that as well, you can help make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMathematics videos on youtube are important because they inspire proto-mathematicians who are otherwise being ground-down at school. And they give people bored at work something to watch during lunch. But making good videos is time-consuming and expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I have cobbled my Stand-up Maths youtube channel together with old equipment I already had and whatever free-time I could afford. Which has grown quickly to 150k+ subscribers. But to make it sustainable, I need help. Put simply: d(quality)/d(cash) \u0026gt; 0.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith money I can get better equipment, dedicate more time and ultimately do more ambitious projects. But as always, watching and sharing the videos is the best support, so don\u0027t feel peer-pressured into giving me money you don\u0027t have. The videos will always be free for everyone, and with as few ads as possible.\u003cbr\u003e"
