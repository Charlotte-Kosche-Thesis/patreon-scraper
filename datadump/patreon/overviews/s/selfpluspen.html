    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s this all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, and thanks for stopping by! I\u2019m D. G. Clark, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.selfpluspen.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSelf + Pen\u003c/a\u003e is my website. I\u2019m a writer, among other things, and the site is a showcase for what I do\u2014poetry, stories (chiefly sci-fi and fantasy), song parodies, whatever strikes my fancy\u2014and hopefully yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you can support my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCool. So what\u0027s your deal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGood art knocks the wind out of me; it uplifts me, makes me cry, laugh, shout, cheer. I like being moved like that, and I want to do the same for you, too. Sometimes with a poem or a story, sometimes with something else. And I like to talk about how it\u2019s done, maybe help you (and myself) understand that a little better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGot it, so what do you want from me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour attention, and your support. Come on in and have a look around. Take your shoes off, kick your feet up, stay a while. And if you like it here, consider doing two things:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e1- Become a patron. Your support means a great deal to me; it goes a long way toward making this possible. (More precisely: it\u0027s my dream to make a living off of my writing. If you support me, you help me do just that!)\u003cbr\u003e\n2- Spread the word. If you like what you see, share! Tell your friends, your family, your coworkers, lovers, employers, your enemies, your therapist, your favorite hot dog vendor. The more people know, the more readers and potential patrons come my way, and with a bit of luck, the more time, energy, and mystic mojo I can put into this for you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOk, awesome!  Where does my money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight, transparency. Well, to be honest, it all goes toward supporting me. Every dollar, euro, rupee, kroner, peso, or whatever helps me pay the bills and gives me time to create. In short: any money\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.selfpluspen.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSelf + Pen\u003c/a\u003e earns on Patreon means that I can spend less time working at my other job and more time creating cool content for you. Eventually, some of it will get channeled into things that help me improve what I\u2019m doing\u2014a better website, tools (and actors and recording time and\u2026) for some awesome audio plays and videos I\u2019ve been incubating, stuff like that. But that\u2019s further down the line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you\u0027ve probably noticed, some of my content\u00a0(that\u2019s poems, stories, songs, craft critiques and art criticism, among other things)\u00a0is already freely available to anyone via the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.selfpluspen.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSelf + Pen\u003c/a\u003e website, in basic blog-post format. So of course you get that\u2014you would have, anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut here, as a patron, you\u2019ll also get access to nifty little goodies like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive content for your eyes only!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigh-quality, e-book versions of free content,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea peek at some of my drafts (so you can see how works evolve),\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe ability to look into the future and see what I have planned to work on,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea glimpse at my ideas and inspirations,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea view of the various worlds I come up with,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eearly access to novel chapters, performance videos, and audio play episode scripts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigh-level patrons will even get special thank-yous, like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ea custom broadside of a favorite poem or other short work,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ean e-book version of my MFA thesis. (How nerdy-cool is that?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, these rewards may change somewhat over time, as this whole project evolves. But I\u0027ll try to keep it fair for you and workable for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo anyway, welcome!"
