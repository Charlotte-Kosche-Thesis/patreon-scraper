Ever since she was exposed to the world of comic books, the desire to make her own has always been with her but she did not start working on that dream until 2011. She made her debut as co-creator, writer, and colorist for the web comic \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.undeadnorm.com/\"\u003eUndead Norm\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.
