I\u2019m really so grateful. If this is the first time you\u2019re seeing anything about Siouxsiequeue\u2019s, welcome, and thank you too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2006 Jeremy and I went to Starfest in Denver and it changed our lives. We\u2019d gone for the afternoon, to hear the panels, see the guests, a regular day at the Con. I bought a bracelet in the vendor\u0027s\u2019 room, and promptly began to obsess over it. I wanted to know what it was made of, how it was made, what kinds of tools were needed, did they put the larger rings in first or the smaller\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started asking friends who knew about chainmaille where to get supplies, how to work certain patterns, in short, I was being an annoying pest. There was even an early and ill-fated attempt to work from supplies acquired from the local hardware store. As things fell into place, our very little house became overrun with tools, supplies, and finished pieces. Then the first craft show, then the first website...Imagine an \u201880s sort of training montage here. Smaller shows led to larger shows until, in 2011, we found ourselves back where it all started, at Starfest in Denver. Only this time, I was selling the bracelets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u2019s 2017, we\u2019ve been working as Siouxsiequeue\u2019s for the past 11 years and thing have only gotten better. We\u2019ve not only been at Starfest for the past 6 years, but we have also been part of Denver Comic Con for the past 5 years. We\u2019re looking forward, making plans to take Siouxsiequeue\u2019s on the road, making new pieces, and revamping our website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are actually some of the reasons Jeremy and I decided to create this Patreon campaign. We thought we\u2019d like to do wacky things like pay the other artist who are helping us (\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gregfreeland\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHi Greg\u003c/a\u003e!), buy supplies, tools and equipment as the need arises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unfamiliar with Patreon, here\u2019s how things work: you may choose to become a Patron by supporting me and other independent creators by donating a set amount each month. In return, Patrons get access to exclusive content and rewards based on the amount donated. Patrons are billed on the first day of the month, may change pledges at any time, or stop donating entirely.\u003cbr\u003e"
