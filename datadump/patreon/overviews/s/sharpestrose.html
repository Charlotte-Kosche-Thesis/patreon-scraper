This is a writer who will go farther than perhaps even she imagines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u2013 L.J. Smith, author of the Vampire Diaries series\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWords are great! I write them in all sorts of different contexts. As you can see if you have a look at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.maryborsellino.com/mary/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0027ve tried my hand at everything from romance novels to punk zines to video games to comics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo tell the truth, when I was a kid and I\u0027d say that I wanted to be a hairdresser or a doctor, I assumed that everyone else always had an unspoken \"as well as being a writer\" along with their own stated ambitions. I can\u0027t remember a time when I didn\u0027t want to be a writer. Ever since I first understood that books were created by people, I wanted to be one of those people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love my work. I find it personally and creatively fulfilling.\u00a0Freelance writing can be an unpredictable income source, however, even when I\u0027m in a position to take on multiple projects at once -- which is not always the case. I have bipolar disorder, which often leaves me unable to work for weeks at a time. And just to make things even more exciting, in early 2016 I had to undergo neurosurgery to remove a brain tumour, which has left me with very little stamina and further reduced my ability to work at the kind pace I\u0027d prefer to work at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the urging of friends and readers I\u0027ve set up this page in the hope of generating a small regular cash flow to help me make ends meet as I continue to create new works. I\u0027ll be sharing these creations, both in-progress and in their finished form, with those who become my patrons. That is such a great pair of words to type, I gotta say. \"My patrons\". I feel like I should be painting cherubs for rich Italian families or something. Rad."
