I\u2019m a nutrition coach and educator and self-professed geek of health and human performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy approach stems from a mix of my scientific background (I have a masters degree in nutritional sciences) and my practical application of this knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to struggle with knowing what advice and recommendations would maximize my health and performance and which would hurt it. I dug deep into the scientific research and what I discovered was game-changing. And those findings (and what I continue to discover) is what I want to breakdown and present to people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world of nutritional advice can be an annoyingly confusing and manipulative one.\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t want you to take it that I\u2019m right and everyone else is wrong. That\u2019s not the case. I don\u2019t know everything and I never will. But I do work hard to learn constantly and then report what I am learning along this lifelong journey. Hopefully something I say resonates with you at some point and makes a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do want is to give you the tools to be able to accurately separate the brilliant from the misleading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been on the other side of this too. I\u2019ve struggled to work things out and truth be told I still  struggle with some things. But it\u2019s all about that constant journey of learning and discovery. Sigma Nutrition allows me to bring others in on that journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e",
