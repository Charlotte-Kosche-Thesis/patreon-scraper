    "summary": "Hey there, stellar human! This is Scrapt, and we just wanna make dope sh*t.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOkay, maybe that sounds vague. Maybe slightly rude. Let\u2019s try again - \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nScrapt is creating original video series...serieses?...series\u2019?...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nScrapt makes original video programming about culture, entertainment, history, food, and other stuff that connects us as people. Our drive to make quality content comes from a desire to create awesome things, and wanting to see other awesome things out in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShared among all of our shows is something unique that we strive for: community. After making content for over a year, we have developed such a sense of community with our guests and our viewers that they eventually become our friends. Whether it\u2019s drinking a pint over dope conversation, delving into the meaning and message of music or learning from different cultures, we have made truly memorable relationships. We are beyond thankful to all of you who have watched our shows!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u2019s the part where we hit you up for money. Scrapt is not a full-time gig because, well, it doesn\u2019t pay. A ton of work goes into producing, shooting and editing all of our content, but the more time we invest in Scrapt, the more it distracts us from actual paying work. You know the struggle; we all have bills. So honestly, the more outside support we receive, the less we have to stress about stuff like paying off that credit card debt that we tallied up on Amazon Prime day. And the power bill.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease do not feel like this is an obligation. The last thing we want to do is take advantage of our friends. But choosing to support our Patreon helps us maintain and even upgrade the quality of programming we put out. Contributions go toward such expenses as production gear, hiring crew, platform maintenance and bar tabs...seriously. We have a show called Drinking While Interviewing. Those beers are not free.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile Scrapt is delving into other endeavors, anything submitted through Patreon will strictly go toward our digital content. We are grateful for anything and everything we receive. For realsies.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nY\u2019all are the best. We love you."
