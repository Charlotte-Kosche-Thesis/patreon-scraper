    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFor about two years, I have been experimenting with various applications for 3D printing.  Since the beginning of 2018, I started embedding materials into my 3D prints (i.e. fabric/metals).  In these months, I\u0027ve been tracking how different materials interact with different filaments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of my Patreon page is to share my findings with other curious minds interested in the embedding process.  Already, in my endeavors, I have found reliable methods of integrating 3D prints onto fabric that I want to incorporate into cosplay.  I\u2019m currently known for printing dragon-like scales that will make for intricate scale armor.  The aesthetic of scales on fabric have been pleasing, but why stop at cosplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther examples of media mixing are printing on wood, glass, metal, carbon fiber, and fiberglass to see how those materials serve as a structural base for my prints.  My creations, such as printing on mesh fabric to serve as dragonfly wings, are mainly proof-of-concept, and I look to utilize these mixed media prints in a more industrial fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon page will serve as a resource for those who want to dive deeper into mixed media printing and integration.  What I want people to take away from my Patreon page is to realize that what I do is very accessible.  People will see that the process is not intimidating, as they won\u2019t have to know how to sew or worry about gluing their fingers together.  Patrons also will find an array of resources that come in the form of videos of my successes/failures and a database that will break down which materials were used in a project.  I want to take care of the logistics behind the creation process so people can just go and explore their creativity.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
