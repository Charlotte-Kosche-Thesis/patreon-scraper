    "summary": "Hello, thank you for reading and considering being my patron. I have only recently discovered this site/opportunity and I look forward to your feedback and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer with one published novel on Amazon. The title is \"Quiet Dog Bites Hard\" and it is a Science Fiction/Action Adventure novel. Back when I was still submitting my work to publishers it was picked up and published by the now defunct Pandora Publishing under the original title \"The Wino\". They took a huge percentage and did very little to market my book. I was so jazzed that someone published me that I accepted this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce they went out of business I rewrote the book, an improvement in my opinion, and self-published it with a new cover from Semmick Photo. I made more money off the book in the first six months than I did all the years (I forget how many now) that Pandora had it. Now that money, it was more, but it still wasn\u0027t much, and so I still have to spend the majority of my productive time earning (in various ways) in order to support myself and this takes away time I could devote to my writing which is all I want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to generate a monthly income that will allow me to write full time so I have chosen the monthly payments option.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is difficult to know what to offer a patron as a reward. I went with what I saw some of the other successful Patreons offering their fans, but I am open to suggestions and more than willing to comply within reason. If there is anything I have not thought of yet that you would like from me, please inquire and I will endeavor to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for your interest and consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you need any additional information to nudge you toward becoming a patron please don\u0027t hesitate to reach out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- Sisco\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS -- If you like the photos I am using you can see more and contact the photographer at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://semmickphoto.pixels.com/\"\u003ehttps://semmickphoto.pixels.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
