    "summary": "I\u0027m a\u00a0 new female rap artist on the scene. Much like logic and NF, I focus on original songs about mental health awareness, LGBT, and what its like in a life after sexual assault. Rebuilding yourself, rebuilding your relationships, and dealing with all the hate that will always come.\u00a0 I\u0027m what I like to call and all other survivors, a phoenix.\u00a0 Like many men and women I was given a bad deal.. However I channeled my pain. My wounds are slowly healing. Circumstances and choices piled up to result into me being a twenty year old woman with PTSD dealing with triggers everyday, social anxiety and other things we dont even need to get into. My point is, Ive worked through my depression with the help of my fellow PHOENIX\u0027S (survivors) and after two years of bottling up what happened to me, I learned that having a support system.. having someone that genuinely cares and knows.. it can save lives. Now, i cant stand hearing music that means nothing. I write from my heart. From my past, my experiences. About my girlfriend of 6 years, my love for being a performer, my hate for bigots like president trump, and my drive and passion to make music something that means something. Something that speaks to someone enough to change there life like I am.\u00a0 I cant thank you enough for your support in my journey , Its truly a new start to my life and with all of you showing your love i can afford the equipment, rights to beats, and enough to make amazing music videos to start to inspire you guys visually. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"its time we rise.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eSky\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Born Hannah DeMarino, on the eastern shore of Virginia to Mark and Sherri DeMarino. Hannah has been performing all  her life and began at the ripe age of 5 years old performing in plays and musicals at her tiny local theatre. Despite financial situations, and lack of places of entertainment Hannah always found a way to express her passion through music. Hannah dealt with bullies and homophobia soon after she came out having fell in love with her girlfriend Meghan Walpole. After graduating high school, Hannah was sexually assaulted at the age of 18 and she soon began to write music taking from the pain and experiences of the aftermath of her sexual assault. While in college in NYC she spiraled down until financial situations caused her to drop out of AMDA. When she returned to her hometown of Virginia and dealt with her first trigger she went into depression, without eating, and shut out her entire family. \"Your support system is your greatest tool. Talking about what makes you feel broken is the first step to healing yourself.\" Hannah says in an interview with us. After having the strength to come out about her sexual assault to meghan and her family, reteaching herself to eat, and learning medical marijuana was the best medicine compared to numbing herself on pills.. she soon moved in with her girlfriend in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. Where like a lesbian version of Lucious Lions and Cookie from Empire they work tirelessly to  bring Hannahs (now skydxddy)s vision and the songs she wrote about her obstacles to life. . You can purchase her album \"When the Smoke Clears\" here or on any music platform. If enough copies are purchased, Meghan and Skylar will take to the road and go on a #StopTheSilence! tour xx Don\u0027t lose hope in yourself or your dream. You could inspire millions by a simple act of truth and kindness.",
