I can talk to you in nauseating CDIA+ detail if you desire. ;)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://segaretro.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSega Retro\u003c/a\u003e is a long-standing member of the video game research community, with our sister site \u003ca href=\"http://www.sonicretro.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSonic Retro\u003c/a\u003e being one of the oldest and most respected video game communities with a lineage spanning more than a decade. We are not a fly-by-night operation; we have already spent years acquiring magazines for this project and we assure you of our continued dedication.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost video game magazine scanners are amateurs who are scanning on their own time and effort, which leads to slow release and highly variable quality. By streamlining the process, we aim to reduce turnaround time and provide rare magazines we couldn\u0027t otherwise offer.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Sega magazines\u2014and why international magazines?\u003c/h3\u003e\nBy focusing on Sega-related media we avoid any legal issues that would arise from working with current publications. It should be noted that certain regions (specifically in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South Asia) there are usually only multiformat magazines before 2002, and so these may also be considered for inclusion to the project.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also believe that the amateur video game scanning community has and will do a sufficient job documenting magazines from the US/UK and thus would like to use our collective bargaining to attain less common magazines.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow do you decide what magazines and countries from which to buy?\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe have a process for determining the highest value to the general public corresponding to the price being charged, but do not plan to announce what magazine issues we are acquiring until they have been publicly released as to not artificially inflate the used video game magazine market.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSpeaking of money\u2014what are your costs for magazines?\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe aim to spend less than USD $10 per magazine and to aggressively buy lot magazines when possible. We calculate shipping costs to even out to about an additional $5 - $10 per magazine, and our raw scanning costs are an additional $10, leaving a total cost of $30/magazine. This is reflected in our goals for release per month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is the scanning process like after acquiring a magazine?\u003c/h3\u003e\nFirst, the magazine is manually reviewed to ensure that it is a quality candidate for scanning\u2014there is no writing on pages, there are few-to-no tears on pages, etc. From there, the magazines are delivered to a secure scanning facility. Magazine issues will either have their spine cut or stapling removed depending on the binding type, then flatbed scanned at 600DPI. There is a two-pass OCR with human review (for English/Japanese-language magazines) conducted, and then scans are reviewed to ensure skew, overlap, cropping and other issues are addressed before approving.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat happens to a magazine after it is scanned?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn order to correctly scan a magazine without destroying the binding \n(using a Zeutschel OS15000 series or similar device) with the specifications we are aiming for, the project would have a scan cost \ncloser to $75/magazine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a result, the magazine\u0027s spine will be removed before scanning and the pages discarded once a scan has received final approval. If you are an educational institution or museum and would be interested in having the unbound physical copy on file, please let us know.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is the release schedule for magazines? How will I be able to attain copies?\u003c/h3\u003e\nOnce a magazine has received final approval for distribution, Patrons will receive first access to the scans via a private link. After one week, the magazine will be publicly distributed on Sega Retro and/or RetroCDN. After an additional week, the magazine scan will be donated to the \n\u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/details/gamemagazines\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInternet Archive Game and Gamer Magazine collection\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhen will this project begin?\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe have approximately 40 issues in storage cleared for scanning and will immediately begin processing these as soon as we hit our first goal while acquiring more titles.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
