I believe that this kingdom is marked by \u003cstrong\u003eaudacious love and self-sacrifice\u003c/strong\u003e from the Church. And I believe that\u003cstrong\u003e I am one of many called to equip the Church with the skills it needs to build this kingdom\u003c/strong\u003e (and to build it through my participation within the Church).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is why I write, speak, and blog.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that the kingdom of God is best made manifest through evangelism, social justice, and environmentalism. To this end most of my work focuses on using the Bible as a lens to explore these areas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me to better achieve this goal through Patreon. I don\u0027t put advertisements on my blog to create a better experience for you, the reader, and like all creators I have costs associated with doing this: domain payments, equipment etc. With your help, I can be a better writer / speaker, and do more of what I love. I can have access to the materials and tools that I need to better serve God and His Church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you an idea of what I write about here are a few of my most popular posts\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.simon-phipps.com/2017/09/sacred-thin-places-and-their-value-in-our-busy-lives.html\"\u003eSacred - Thin Places and Their Value In Our Busy Lives\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.simon-phipps.com/2017/10/encouragement.html\"\u003eEncouragement - Wand To Make a Real Difference In The World?
