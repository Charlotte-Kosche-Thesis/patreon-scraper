I\u0027m Shawn, an author working on a number of projects. I\u0027ve written an unpublished paranormal thriller/modern fairy tale titled \"Hunter Green.\" This year, I\u0027m a good ways into first drafts for two more novels; an alternative history novel in which Europe remains an impoverished backwater from the Middle Ages on and a sci-fi novel involving teen angst and virtual reality worlds. On top of all that, I\u0027ve self-published an adventure short story called \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Siege-Melilla-Shawn-Humphrey-ebook/dp/B00IKC93FI\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Siege of Melilla\u003c/a\u003e,\" a fictional account of African refugees seeking a better life in Europe.

I\u0027m calling this thing \"Select Your Own Trite Ending: A Whimsical Voyage Beyond the Suburbs.\" I have no idea if this will be a series, but it will certainly be a single novel.

If you support me just a little more, you may get to mess with me by requiring I include a plot device of your imagining- like, I don\u0027t know, a gopher, a pot of gold, an ironing board, a side-trip to Kashmir for the main character- that sort of thing. The harder it\u0027ll be to work it into the story, the more fun I think it\u0027ll be. Go ahead, give me a challenge. Just keep it safe for work is all I ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, I hope to provide posts, short stories, flash fiction, and videos of me over sharing about my writing and literature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Bear in mind I will retain sole, exclusive rights for these stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSample the Writing, Won\u0027t You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=2431523\u0026amp;rf=648045\"\u003ean introduction to the story\u003c/a\u003e, provided by the \"Humble Narrator with an Affected Trans-Atlantic Voice.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
