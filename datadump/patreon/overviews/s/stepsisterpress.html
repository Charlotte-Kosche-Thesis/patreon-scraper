This means that once we decide to work with an author or team, we devote time to helping them develop a book, whether they\u0027re starting out with a polished manuscript, a stack of drawings in a folder, or a big idea. Our recent titles include three significant works in museum studies, with a fourth on the way this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnnie Heckman founded StepSister Press in 2007 in Chicago. Now based nearby in Park Ridge, Illinois, the press coordinates collaborations with artists and writers around the world. In 2017, its 10th-anniversary year, the press is releasing \u003cem\u003eFwd: Museums: Small (Issue 2)\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand developing re-releases for several titles from its early years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0HOW DOES YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP US?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePublishers-in-Training become future publishers\u003c/strong\u003e: Up-and-coming designers, editors, artists, avid readers, and entrepreneurs learn how to design books, manage projects, and calculate 55% off of retail prices in the UK and so forth. All the details. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur training program piloted with Lauren Dacy, who brought a strong background in design and photography. Since joining StepSister, Lauren has designed her first book, coordinated with a journal editorial team, and mastered the details of printer specs, pricing, and distribution. We offer an honorarium to Publishers-in-Training through our company coffers; your contribution allows us to expand and maintain this amazing process. The program went so well this time that our first goal is to hire Lauren at a competitive rate to design and project manage an upcoming book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe get to work with first-time authors and experimental projects\u003c/strong\u003e: You help us stay financially nimble so that we can work with authors who may not always have a book ready out-of-the-box, and with teams who have big ideas that require extra design and editorial invention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur books stay affordable\u003c/strong\u003e: Full-color books on-demand with retail discounts and shipping costs can be expensive!

You help us cover our software subscriptions, professional development, proofing, and shipping without needing to shuffle funds around or delay purchases. This includes extensive third-party training materials for our publishers-in-training so that we can offer the most up-to-date educational and work experience possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnie sleeps better\u003c/strong\u003e: Where does early modern Tibetan literature meet indie press and Adobe Creative Suite? Maybe just in Annie\u0027s head. It doesn\u0027t matter. Knowing there is support in place for the company\u0027s infrastructure helps Annie Heckman (Founder, Owner, Director, Superfan) sleep at night and push forward in her Buddhist studies PhD work at the University of Toronto. Her family holds down StepSister\u0027s base in Park Ridge, Illinois, in a home full of books and big ideas.\u003cbr\u003e"
