Each podcast we review an episode from every Trek show, and rate them from 1-10. That includes\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, \u0026amp; Enterprise\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0Plus, after TOS ends, we will treat \u003cstrong\u003eThe Animated Series\u003c/strong\u003e as it\u0027s unofficial fourth season! The fun part is, it\u0027s not just us the hosts reviewing the episodes, it\u0027s you as well! By joining the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/startrekwars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStar Trek Wars Council\u003c/a\u003e on Facebook, you also get to rate each episode yourself and potentially have your comments read on air! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting with the Series Premiere, we will go in chronological order until we finish a season. Once a season is finished we will have a Season blow out special cast where we go over the best and worst of each series, and reveal which show statistically did the best that year. This will continue until we reach the end of all the shows, at which time we will have a massive finale to determine the overall best show. Who will win? It\u0027s a question that can only be decided through Star Trek Wars!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery episode features \u003cstrong\u003edebates\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e fun facts\u003c/strong\u003e, plus \u003cstrong\u003esound bytes\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for each episode, plus segments that include \u003cstrong\u003ePro\u0027s and Khans\u003c/strong\u003e, where the group discusses the weeks best and worst moments, \u003cstrong\u003efan feedback\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003epoll results\u003c/strong\u003e, and much, much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek Wars \u003c/strong\u003ereleases every other Saturday. Any contribution you can make is deeply appreciated. This is a labor of love for us, and our material will always be free to you, but if you have anything to spare to help drive this cast through to the Series Finales, you would be taking a lot of the financial pressure off of us, and allowing the team to deliver the best possible podcast we can each week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek Wars\u003c/strong\u003e is available on Itunes, iHeartRadio, YouTube, Stitcher, Pocketcasts for Androids, Blackberry, our website \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.Gonenerdin.com,\u003c/a\u003e and anywhere fine podcasts can be found!"
