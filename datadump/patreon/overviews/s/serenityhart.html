This is where you get to see the uncensored art nudes that don\u0027t usually make it to my social media! I started this page because I\u0027ve been flagged and deleted from both Facebook and Instagram a number of times in the past and wanted an alternative way to communicate with like-minded people like you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Projects funded by Patreon Users: One of my goals (hopefully before I turn 30) is to capture the images of other women and host an exhibit. I started working on this project in 2013 originally with a female photographer and realized\u00a0that no one will be able to capture the essence of my message better than me. My next step is to get a camera (current goal) and practice my craft over the next two years. I want this exhibit to consist of 111 images of women in the nude paired with their voice interviews\u00a0of how they view\u00a0themselves and what body image means to them.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThank you in advance for helping me live my dreams!

I have the best friends! :) So I am raising my goal to $600 so I can purchase my own Pro Camera kit and tripod for the days I get inspired and want to shoot myself (not in the head). Especially in the beautiful hotel rooms I stay in when I travel. When I reach this goal I will not only be able to release more sets, I\u0027ll be able to create on my own and take advantage of my surroundings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "I would love to hit this goal by my birthday November 2 so I can plan a trip to The Grand Canyon to shoot! I\u0027ve dreamed of going there for forever and would love the chance to connect with locals and explore places that aren\u0027t touristy. One of my favourite things to do is wake up before the sunrise and shoot in beautiful places I\u0027ve never seen before. If I hit this goal by November for 2 consecutive monthly I will personally mail out a handwritten postcard of y\u003cem\u003eours truly\u003c/em\u003e as a keepsake. Not only will this goal\u00a0help with my travel expenses and shelter, I will be completely focused on creating and won\u0027t need to book random gigs for the sake of a few dollars.",
