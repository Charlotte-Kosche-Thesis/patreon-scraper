    "summary": "Sarcastic Pasta Games is a brand new indie game company.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re kind of a group of people who have various talents and can make really amazing games when we pool those talents. Additionally, we are also a group of talented content creators on YouTube who are focused on making high quality fan projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Katie and I am the creator of Sarcastic Pasta Games. I\u0027m majoring in Gaming and Simulation in college and I have been a creative writer for over 15 years and a performer for over 20 years. I know how to make games with really good stories but my awesome team and I need your help to be able to continue to make you the incredible content that we have been producing! Over 50 people are working under the Sarcastic Pasta Games label, so we definitely have the talent to achieve our dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn August 7th, 2017, we released our very first video game called The BOSS. It was a Jacksepticeye fan game and it got very high reviews. People absolutely loved it and, as a result, we want to make more games with high standards. We\u0027re not satisfied with goofy little fan works or apps or games, we want to make everything professional quality as best we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some ideas for upcoming games that we think you\u0027re really going to love. We are currently working on a sequel for The BOSS, an Alphys-centric dating sim, an original puzzle platformer, and an original RPG.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider becoming a patron to help us get these amazing games and videos off the ground. The money we raise will be going toward paying our programmers, artists, writers, and actors. It will also go toward getting new equipment to make our games even better! I\u0027ve handpicked the best team I could ever ask for and I hope you\u0027ll consider helping us out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading this! Check out our GameJolt page here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gamejolt.com/@SarcasticPasta\"\u003ehttps://gamejolt.com/@SarcasticPasta\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAt this point, we only have 10 spots open in the Gallery for your personalized sprite and message to Jack. We wanted to limit it to 30 or he\u0027ll be there all day. We have no cap on the message document we will be including in the game files, however, so you can still get your message to him in Glitch in the System!"
