    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHello Family, Friends, and Strangers!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever you made your way here, I want to let you know what my art means to me. I believe in always striving to make things better. I believe in working with others to accomplish a common goal. I believe in enjoying the beauty our existence offers us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that making a better tomorrow starts with educating the younger generations as they begin the process of assuming adulthood to the best of their abilities. I believe we are responsible for protecting the next generation, for supporting the next generation, for lifting the next generation, so they can take the mantle from a better position than we did. When we pass this world to our children and to the next generation, we pass on a legacy. I dream for a future where we are the best we can ever be, knowing that we can never be that good, but the idea is so pure it will keep me moving in the right direction. I want to live by this way of thinking about my own importance and my own life because I believe in looking at the world this way. I am here to do my part to make our legacy better for future generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is how I explore this in a more spiritual and creative light. I have plans for a 25-Book comic series. It will explore spirituality and philosophy and so much more through the stories of many different kinds of people. It is called \"The Fabric\" as a whole series, but the first book is called \"Tlalli\u0027s Fall.\" It resembles a lot of superhero stories in terms of action and adventure, but it digs deeper than most and explores our emotions, our ideas, our personalities and identities, our morals and ideals, and the chaotic order of life. It will feature spirits, the afterlife, higher conscience, spiritual leaders, gods, heroes, a story of creation, genocide, birth, nature, and politics. It will all be tied into a single, very long story from beginning to end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project will take years to plan out before I can even write the first issue, and decades more than that to complete the art properly, but I have begun this process one piece of concept art and one page of outlines at a time. I have a long way to go until it is ready to print, but I have a lot of it outlined and some of it has the first wave of details. In the meantime, I have to work to pay bills, so my art can only move at a snail\u0027s pace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTHAT\u0027S WHERE YOU COME IN:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to dedicate myself to art, especially to writing and illustrating \"The Fabric,\" I need to make enough money from my art so I can be able to afford to leave any other jobs. One way I can do that is by selling products at music and art events, but in order to do that, I need to have the products to sell. That means I have to invest money in printing or spend time in drawing and painting, and I am limited on both.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Patreon MONTHLY pledge goes to helping me pay for the printing and production costs of my art products. Until I make $2000 a month from Patreon alone (which will not happen for a very long time), \u003cstrong\u003eALL of the money you pledge will go right back to producing NEW PRODUCTS.\u003c/strong\u003e I will sell those products and pocket that money, but every dollar from this site is for new products and printing old ones that I could not finance on my own. Before I can pocket any money from this site, I have to print and mail products to my Patrons (You, hopefully), and the way I set it up, I will need every dollar to keep up with my promises. For helping me take the first step to living off my art, I will send you several copies of each product I print even if you only give $1 monthly. I know that it will be a long time until I can afford to live off of my art, but printing new products is a great way to get started in that process, and I am grateful for any help you provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eREWARDS FOR YOUR PLEDGES:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will receive access to my monthly newsletter AND copies of the bookmarks, postcards, and prints that I have made with the money from their pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaying $2 or more a month gives you digital access to my comic book \u003cstrong\u003e\"Thoughts\" \u003c/strong\u003ewhich is a poetry art comic series which will explore similar themes as \"The Fabric\" but in a different format. Each issue will feature poetry and accompanying art and will stand alone from the others, but I will include images and other little Easter eggs to my other art works, so in their own way, the issues of \"Thoughts\" are connected to each other and to my art in general. I have a rough version of \"Thoughts\" #1 that I published and will provide the PDF to $2+ Patrons once I make a few edits to the original edition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$3 will get you digital AND printed copies of \"Thoughts\" \u003cstrong\u003eWHEN THE MONEY I EARN FROM THIS SITE CAN PAY FOR IT.\u003c/strong\u003e The monthly reward must be printed first and any money left after that will slowly add up to the printing of \"Thoughts.\" I have a digital version of #1, but do not have the money to print it. Until I do,\u003cstrong\u003e $3 will earn you more of the monthly rewards than your fellow patrons who make a smaller monthly donation.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have plans for a small, annual art book once my earnings increase by a lot, and in \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyears \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003ewhen I start publishing \"The Fabric\" I will change this site to reflect that and include it as part of the rewards somehow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have more plans for the future and more options for rewards, especially as I earn more from this sight. Remember, even just $1 goes a long way in my plans for my future with art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW I WILL USE YOUR MONEY:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have several goals, but the idea is that whenever I bring in about 60$ from Patreon (even if it takes a few months for the money to add up), I will print a new design (bookmark, postcard, greeting card, small print, etc.) and mail out copies to my supporters. Right now it will take about 4 months for the money to add up to a new print, BUT I have 4 products to choose from already, so you will start receiving rewards the moment your first pledge is processed. I also got a one time donation from a friend that helps with the cost of a new product, and it will be out mid to late March, making 5 products. The more supporters I have, the more often I make a new product. The ultimate goal is to make a new product every month for my Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I can afford a monthly printing cost with patreon income, I will start taking the extra money and saving it to print \"Thoughts.\" I will be working on \"Thoughts\" regularly at that point, but I can only release them as fast as I can print them. SO, as my earnings increase here, the rate at which I publish and print \"Thoughts\" will increase. The goal is to print a new issue every three months, but remember the cost of the monthly rewards has to be paid first. The extra money each month will sit in my bank account untouched until it is used for printing costs. The more supporters I have the more often I print.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I can afford a monthly reward and a new issue of \"Thoughts\" every three months, I can start to pocket the money from Patreon. However, I can\u0027t live off of a few dollars in my pocket because I have bills to pay. At $2500 a month, I will have enough to pay bills from my pocket money, so I wont need to work any other jobs! \"Pocket money\" will become \"bills money\" and I can start going to more fairs and events where I can sell my art, and that money will be my new pocket money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe budget will be tight and depend an uncomfortable amount on making sales (you never know how much you will sell), but I will be living my dream so I don\u0027t mind having a slim wallet. With all that extra time to dedicate to my art, I will begin releasing more concept art and sneak peeks for \"The Fabric,\" but I will also assemble an annual art book that showcases my work. With enough extra earnings I can print that too, and send it to my most dedicated patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know those last few steps are a long way off, but those of you reading this right now have the chance to help make it happen and be there from the beginning. Remember, even a dollar helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading,\u003cbr\u003emuch love,\u003cbr\u003eCarlos C. Tejeda\u003cbr\u003e"
