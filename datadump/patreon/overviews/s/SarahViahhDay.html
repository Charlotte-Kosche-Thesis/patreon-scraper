I\u0027m just a 24 year old creative type trying to do this adult\nthing. Thanks for stopping by! :D\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI suppose I better tell you why being a patron would be a fun thing to do huh.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, when it comes to art, I\ndon\u0027t really have one thing that I stick to, so if variety is your thing then keep reading. I love drawing,\npainting, polymer clay, and generally trying new things and seeing what\nhappens! My favourite subjects would have to be dragons, my OCs (Ilmarinen the angel, Akka the raven, and the Haarmi - that freaky hairy horse thing), animals, people, general fantasy, etc. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a big fan of all things Nordic, the band Apocalyptica \u0026amp; music in general, and I think those things come through in my work a lot, even if it\u0027s not the main focus.\u003cbr\u003eSo if any of that sounds interesting to you, perhaps consider checking out my work and maybe even supporting me \u0026lt;3 I would be more grateful than you can imagine, and I will prove it by giving you exclusive access to content and rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will\nPatreon help me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook \u2013 I\u0027ll be honest with you. I used to have\na good job translating at one of the biggest companies in the world,\nbut now that\u0027s come to an end I\u0027m in a bit of a pickle. I\nstruggle with sensory disorders so I\u0027m not exactly best suited for the work available in my home town, and\nthe unemployment office has abandoned me. I don\u0027t have a lot of options now. Luckily all I\u0027ve ever\nwanted to do as a career was something in art, but I wasn\u0027t expecting to be left\nhigh and dry so soon when I\u0027m still not making enough out of\nit!\u003cbr\u003eI almost feel like all the recent events in my life are a sign that it\u0027s now or never to be serious about art, so I want to give Patreon a go! Ultimately this will help me to do anything and everything. If I can afford art materials, I can afford to make art. If I can make art, I will be able to reach my full potential, and I can sell work I\u0027m truly proud of which will make me happy and *hopefully* be more interesting for you. If I can sell art, I can earn a living and be a responsible adult. Currently I\u0027m struggling to do any of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current art\ngoals look something like this:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eOOAK\nposeable fantasy art dolls.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve been trying to get into them for\nabout two years, and through tedious trial and error I believe I\u0027ve\nfinally learnt enough to successfully make some, but now I\u0027m struggling to afford materials. Typical!\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eArt\nbooks.\u003c/strong\u003e I made one in 2015 with the help of a good friend as a gift for\nour favourite band, and it was beautiful! I enjoyed it so much that I want to make another sometime in the future, based on the life of my character\nIlmarinen. And perhaps another just for dragons. Why? \u0027Cause dragons of course ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see more of my work or follow me on social media, look no further!:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/SarahViahhDay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/viahhapocalyptica\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.etsy.com/shop/WorldsCollide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.viahhapocalypticart.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://xhidefromthesunx.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig05.deviantart.net/9663/f/2016/285/9/d/untitled_by_xhidefromthesunx-dakr4bu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThank you for your time and any support you choose to give \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
