In addition, it also paves the way for better technology to produce the show when it is needed, though this only happens every three years or so.\u00a0While this campaign is by episode, you can still choose how much you contribute in the course of a given month with a specified cap, if you so desire!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, every dollar obtained through this campaign has gone and will continue to go directly back into production, which keeps the show running even longer.
