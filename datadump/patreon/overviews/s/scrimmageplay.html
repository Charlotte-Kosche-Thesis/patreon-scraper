Scrimmage Play has been around for eight years now so if you\u0027re here, you\u0027ve got a good idea of what we do already -- cover Central Virginia High School sports with writing, photos, video and audio. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently we\u0027ve been getting a lot of questions about how our readers and fans can support the work we do. Well, here is your chance! For less than a cup of coffee in the morning or a 32 ounce Gatorade after practice, you can ship us a few bucks each month and help us continue the coverage you\u0027ve come to expect and rely on. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some amazing corporate partners that have helped propel us over the years and continue to do so, helping us never charge you to view the stories, photos and videos on our site. But this is another avenue to help us keep doing what we\u0027re doing, and open up some new opportunities and ways for us to cover prep sports in the Scrimmage Play area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewww.scrimmageplay.com"
