If you\u2019re better than video clips and want to continue your text based adventure we won\u2019t stop you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the hell is a Seduction Nerds podcast and who would be haughty enough place the words \u201cseduction\" and \u201cnerds\" next to one another?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re a couple of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons obsessed, comic book reading, Battlestar Galactica rewatching nerds who also happen to be really successful seduction coaches. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over ten years, we worked for Neil Strauss (Author of The Game), traveling the world teaching the art of seduction to thousands of students. We\u0027ve written countless of articles, talked to hundreds of experts, and most importantly, we\u0027ve had adventures, meeting strangers, all over the world in an effort to learn our artform.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe believe that us nerds are full of passion for the things we obsess over, it\u2019s just that many of us have trouble expressing that passion in a way that\u0027s digestible to the average person. It\u2019s hard to care about all four grades of adamantium that exist in the Marvel 616-universe if you don\u2019t love comic books, but the truth is that passion, like cyclops\u2019 eye beams, needs to be focused to be effective.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring our travels, we met loads of interesting people: actors, writers, musicians, politicians, pornstars, and more. While nerding out on the things they loved, many expressed ways that they\u2019d used seduction in their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we loved most about the conversations was how the principles of the artform applied to all these different aspects of life. At some point, one of them said, \u201cyou guys should think about recording these conversations, have you tried podcasting?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo which we both said, \u201cNo, who listens to podcasts?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA day later, we asked around and found out - everyone listens to podcasts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we created The Seduction Nerds podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn each episode, we talk with guests about the ways that both nerdiness and seduction play roles in their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron support will go towards improving the show: getting more guests, enhanced audio production, better content, and more ways for you to interact and ask questions.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, you won\u0027t be charged for previous episodes, just new ones. We release episodes bi-weekly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening and contributing!"
