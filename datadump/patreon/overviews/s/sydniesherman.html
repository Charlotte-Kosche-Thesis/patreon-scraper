     "about": "Let\u2019s Make the World\nBeautiful!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sydnie Sherman\nand I am an artist from the East Bay, California. I have lived and worked and\nplayed here all of my life and I am glad to call it my home. There were\ndefinitely some early warning signs that I was destined for art. I can\u2019t\nremember a time when I didn\u2019t draw, paint, write, and express myself through\nphysical mediums. One of my earliest childhood memories is of watching Bob Ross\nas a young child. I would sit on the floor with my colored crayons and watch\nthis crazy dude sporting an afro painting on television. And I remember\nthinking \u201cman\u2026 I want to be that guy!\u201d I always knew what I wanted to be when I\n\u201cgrew up\u201d, but figuring out how to get there is my life\u2019s work.\u003cbr\u003eI would like to think\nthat I have a unique vision of the world, but I think that we all do. And\nthat\u2019s why we are here, to learn and share and grow as people and artist in our\nown right. There have been times when the world has planted little seeds of\ndoubt in my thought garden, but I always come back and pull the weeds. When I\nwas young, I had a teacher that told my parents that I \u201clacked creativity\u201d\u2026\nwhat the heck?\u003cbr\u003eArt is such a unique aspect\nof reality in that it openly questions and challenges the idea of \u201cwhat is\nreal?\u201d The process of creating something tangible from intangible thoughts and\nemotions is just so magical. Sometimes when I am creating a very emotional\npiece I think to myself. \u201cThis must be what god feels like\u2026Breathing life into\nthe universe.\u201d Art can capture a moment and make it a lifetime. Art can provoke\nhope, or incite violence. It can bring people together and rip them apart. Art\ncan fix elections and overthrow governments. Art knows what god and death look\nlike, it can be beautiful or dangerous. But most importantly Art knows no\nboundaries for wealth, race, religion or nationality. Art is what we make it.\u003cbr\u003eInspiration \u0026amp;\nCollaboration\u003cbr\u003eI find inspiration in\neverything\u2026 or rather, inspiration hunts me down and throws itself upon me when\nI least expect it. I often think about art as mankind\u2019s imitation of creation.\nWe copy from what is around us and then learn to shape it in our own image.\u003cbr\u003eOne thing is true, and\nthat is that I learn best from watching. I could see something done once and\nknow how to do it forever, which is why I find working with other artist to be so\ninfluential. Everyone has something special to offer, even if they don\u2019t know\nit. I have learned more from drawing\nwith my peers than I ever learned in all my years of schooling. And if I could\ndo it all over again, I would have never gone to college. I think about the\ntime I wasted trying to syphon knowledge and technique from blank canvases,\nblank people, and institutions, and it saddens me. The best part about going to\nan \u201cart\u201d school was being in a place where, if you were lucky, you could meet\nother artists. My motto is this\u2026 Traditional schooling grinds creativity and\nvision out of people. And only the resilient will survive. With that being said\nI did had a couple of great art mentors who just so happened to be teachers.\nTheir methods were effective, inspiring, not backed by institutional funding\nand have made a lasting impression on me as an artist and a person. You know\nwho you are!\u003cbr\u003eMy Goal\u003cbr\u003eI would like to\neventually support myself solely on commissioned work and through patrons. I\nknow that I have a ways to go before my reality is in sync with me but it is a\nworthwhile goal. It has taken me long enough to figure out that I could never\nbe happy doing anything else.\u003cbr\u003eIf You Support Me\u003cbr\u003eI would love to keep\ndoing what I am doing. But we live in a material world so I will need your\nhelp. If you help support me and become a patron I can keep dedicating more and\nmore of my time to becoming an artist worthy of existence (to do the one thing\nthat I long for) to create works that inspire others to express themselves. And\nto create art that provokes emotional, spiritual and physical responses. To\ncapture the things that make life beautiful and to reshape the world.\u003cbr\u003e",
