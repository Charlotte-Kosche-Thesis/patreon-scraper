    "summary": "Hi there,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for stopping by. My name is Matthew Fountain, I am a bandleader and\ncomposer hailing from Portland, Oregon. My college years studying screenwriting\nand filmmaking inform the lyric-centric, story-driven songs I write and perform\ntoday. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA few years ago I began volunteering at p:ear, a day center for homeless youth,\nas a music mentor. Every day is unique at p:ear-- on one, I\u2019ll teach a single\nkid how to play a Green Day song on a guitar missing a string; the next, I\u0027ll\npin the chords to \"House of the Rising Sun\" to the wall so five\ndifferent kids\u2014at all levels of experience-- can play it at once, and I turn the most\nskilled player into my teaching assistant for the day. Sometimes putting a\nguitar between myself and a youth is just an easy way for them to tell me their\ndaily struggles, and sometimes, their life stories. Eventually, we started\nwriting songs together and recording them. This is where I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe concept of \"Street Anthems\" is simple-- introduce the world to\nthe songs of homeless youth. Much like \"Humans of New York\" brings\nhuman dimensions we sometimes don\u0027t see simply by talking to people and having\nthem tell their stories, I want to do this with the songs of the street. We\nlive in an era saturated with studio- and homemade recordings, and money has\nbecome an arbitrary filter for entering the doors of tastemakers and\npublications that break new artists. Upwards of $20k to a PR firm can be --\nstrike that, is-- the difference between an artist getting traction versus remaining\nin obscurity. It is a genuine concern of mine that the messages contained in\nthe music most people hear are only those of the highly privileged. A society\nthat doesn\u0027t acknowledge its own suffering is an isolated one, and I believe\nthat broadcasting these blues not only gives a voice to the homeless, but\nunlocks a compassionate dimension inside everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease have a listen to our songs, and we would appreciate any help you can\noffer. Thank you for listening.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith love,\u003cbr\u003e\nMatthew"
