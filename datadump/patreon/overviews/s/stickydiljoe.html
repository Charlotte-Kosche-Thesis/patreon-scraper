    "summary": "The Chronicles/Stickydiljoe.com is a car culture website and video series created by myself, Joey Lee, better known to the online automotive community simply as \"StickyDilJoe\". The website originally started back in 2008 and has been growing ever since, with a video blog series debuting in the fall of 2014 and a Podcast series in the summer of 2017. In the early years, the website covered the Honda/Acura enthusiasts community in Southern California but as time went on, the spectrum of coverage became much wider and now covers the automotive tuning culture, not just limited to Hondas/Acuras, worldwide. I have been an automotive enthusiast since the late 90s and since then, have become a writer and photographer for multiple print magazines including, but not limited to, Super Street, Import Tuner, and Honda Tuning. The Chronicles is now a recognized name and brand the world over. Now with the video blog/vlog series, my friends and I travel everywhere to document automotive tuning culture through our eyes and experience new adventures monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis labor of love of mine originally started out as merely a side-gig, sort of a project for fun. Over the years, it has grown into something much bigger than that thanks to an amazing group of supporters from all over the world. I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve ever been a rich man, but my work has helped to not only put food on my table, but also allowed me to travel quite a bit to experience car culture first hand. With the closing of Import Tuner and Honda Tuning magazine, my source of income essentially disappeared. Print is quickly meeting its unfortunate end, and The Chronicles became my provider. I\u0027ve never been one to want to advertise because the website has always been a creative outlet for me to share my work with the rest of the world, free of charge. In the nearly ten years that I have been working on The Chronicles, I have never made the shift over to advertising or have attempted to turn my work into click-bait articles in an attempt to make money. STICKYDILJOE.COM WILL ALWAYS BE FREE. Merchandising has been of great help and I am overwhelmed by the support I have received during my run. I have been asked many times over the years to advertise but have always outright refused to do so because it was never about making money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked tirelessly over the years to provide, what I thought to be, great automotive content for the world to see. I love what I do and I live for this. The Chronicles has allowed me to not only develop as a writer, but also a photographer, someone that figured out how to create interesting video blogs, and even given me the opportunity to podcast here and there. I would love to be able to continue to grow The Chronicles and expand this operation with your help. This little thing I created in 2008 is now the thing that puts a roof over my head and food in my belly. I\u0027d be overjoyed if I could continue to build this and develop it with your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I\u0027d like to turn the podcast into a full-on videocast with a full set and everything. I\u0027d love to be able to see more of the world and experience car culture to its fullest potential by seeing new things as often as possible. Who knows, I could maybe even acquire some new photography and video equipment to replace the outdated stuff I\u0027ve been shooting with over the past 5-6 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I want to do is continue to create automotive content to share with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess some would say that I could simply \"go out and get a regular job\" but I feel like The Chronicles would suffer if I ever gave it less than my 101%. So often in life we work so hard to find our true calling and the sum of our lives is just simply working and never finding that true passion. I believe I have found that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your support. You are a witness to my life, the lives of my friends, and an integral part of this journey that is my life. I am forever grateful to those who have been there from the start and those who hopped on this train along the way to make The Chronicles what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Joey Lee aka StickyDilJoe\u003cbr\u003e"
