I am a relatively young artist and for those who don\u0027t know me for my ENDeviant comic, I like to draw people\u0027s Ocs! What more is there to say?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Use Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, I am currently a senior in high school and you would be amazed with how busy I am; I have to focus on graduating, looking for a job, preparing to move out and on top of all that, I still have art!\u003cbr\u003eSo, I figured that Patreon would help by combining 3 of those 4 things (looking for a job, preparing to move out and art) into one manageable thing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know it may just be my optimistic thinking but I would really like to make this sort of a job for me! I mean what artist wouldn\u0027t want to just draw, and having supporters just brings the dream to life for me. \u00a0n_n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Plan To Do Around Here, And Why Should I Support You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, like I said earlier, I really love doing comics and drawing Ocs/Characters of all sorts!\u003cbr\u003eIi usually have only done either my characters or friends of mine, but I would really like to expand my art to more people while receiving some support in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to why you should stay and support, here are a few things you can expect from me if you\u0027re a supporter:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will be able to post more frequent pages of my web-comic, \u003cstrong\u003eENDeviant\u003c/strong\u003e: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bigsheezy.deviantart.com/gallery/31690111/ENDeviant-comic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://bigsheezy.deviantart.com/gallery/31690111/E...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause I like to draw so many different sorts of characters, you can best believe that for certain supporters I will be offering many different types of my services! Hopefully do live raffles using Livestream in order to pic a winner every month for a free drawing? Just to show my appreciation!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnother reason I would hope you all decide to stick with me is because I am still a young artist; I feel as though I will have a lot of growth here and I have many projects I will be trying to do, all I need is a little support because a little bit can really go a long way!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for stopping by and reading this, hope to see support from all of you one way or another! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
