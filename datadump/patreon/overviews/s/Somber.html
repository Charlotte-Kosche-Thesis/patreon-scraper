    "summary": "So who am I? \u00a0Well, I\u0027m a bit of a nobody really. \u00a0Like millions of nobodies out there, I happen to write, and I\u0027ve been told that I\u0027ve skill at it. \u00a0So here I am. \u00a0Hope I don\u0027t disappoint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a little more detail. \u00a0My name is David Bushey, I live in the western United States, Nevada currently, and I\u0027m in my mid thirties. \u00a0I graduated college with a degree in English Literature and Composition, mostly because I had to graduate before my dad died of ALS and when I took my transcript to the councilor, she took one look at it and went \u0027Well, this is all over the map. \u00a0Um... English Lit, probably.\u0027 \u00a0Once I had that, there\u0027s only one thing you can do with an English Lit degree: teach! \u00a0Unfortunately then the bottom fell out of education so I\u0027m fiddling about trying to find what else to do with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do I call myself \u0027Somber\u0027? \u00a0Well, first there\u0027s my writing. \u00a0It\u0027s rarely happy writing. \u00a0Bad things happen in my stories to characters who don\u0027t really deserve what happens to them. \u00a0Secondly, I have a form of depression called dysthymnia. \u00a0It\u0027s basically chronic, neurological depression. \u00a0SSRI\u0027s just make me stop doing everything, and counseling doesn\u0027t help. \u00a0So I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat sorts of things do I write? \u00a0Well, I tend towards annoyingly large stories. \u00a0I started publicly writing in 2011, doing My Little Pony fanfics, and I still do. \u00a0I wrote a spin off story of Fallout Equestria called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/208056/fallout-equestria---project-horizons\"\u003eFallout Equestria: Project Horizons\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0It grew to more than 1.78 million words before being completed. \u00a0People seem to like it though. \u00a0I\u0027m now working on a sequel called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/298834/fallout-equestria-homelands\"\u003eHomelands\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0I\u0027m hoping it\u0027ll be a bit shorter. \u00a0I tend towards female protagonists overcoming extreme adversity. \u00a0I also enjoy writing GLBTQ characters, and the complexities they face. \u00a0I\u0027m a fan of high fantasy stories, urban fantasy, and science fiction. \u00a0I love a variety of anime, and sometimes the tropes bleed through. \u00a0While occasionally my writing might get \u0027spicy\u0027 I generally don\u0027t write explicit, pornographic materials. \u00a0Nothing worse than what you\u0027d read in Game of Thrones, I suppose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s me in a nutshell. \u00a0Thanks for reading this and supporting me. \u00a0It\u0027s really all that keeps me going at times.\u003cbr\u003e"
