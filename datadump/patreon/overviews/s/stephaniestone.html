Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my Patreon! I\u2019m Stephanie Stone, but feel free to just call me Steph \u2729 I\u2019ll be providing extensive costume build notes, exclusive extra content to the folks here that will not be found anywhere else, as well as easing into this whole \u201cprints\u201d business. Whether you\u2019re here to scope things out or sign up to be a Patron, I hope you like what you see! Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/4964df47ff5f017de0386e973dff2687/tumblr_otbsh0x2ME1qlatbko1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who exactly is the person behind this page? If you didn\u2019t know already, it\u2019s pretty evident that my life is largely centered around cosplay. I work a retail job, graduated from a community college, transferred to a state college, and graduated again with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Psychology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, onto more flavorful information! I like to cook, go to the gym, write if I can, sometimes draw, take care of my plants, and of course, play video games and watch anime. Right around the time I began middle school was when I really began to fall in love with anime, and I was simultaneously exposed to anime communities online, anime conventions, and cosplay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been attending conventions and events for 12 straight years now, and have attended AOD, SacAnime, SacCon, FanimeCon, Anime Expo, KrakenCon, Anime Los Angeles, NorCal gatherings, Cherry Blossom festivals, and Anime festivals. The very first time I cosplayed was Halloween of 2007, and then Anime Expo 2008 as Trucy Wright from Ace Attorney. I loved interacting with the other Ace Attorney fans, being approached in costume,  and meeting new people so much that I was hooked instantly. In the beginning, I mostly relied on others to sew things for me and refused to wear wigs. Thankfully, my attitude changed over time - I decided that if I was going to cosplay, I would take this hobby more seriously and put more of myself into it. It seemed impersonal to rely on others so much for these things, so I bought myself a cheap sewing machine and went at it. The nice thing about starting out was that I could only get better\u2026 and I like to think I have! But I still have plenty to learn when it comes to sewing and crafting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/43862865cbd0262be3ae81a96b28b239/tumblr_otbsh0x2ME1qlatbko4_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big question I feel people ask is, \u201cSo why did you decide to make a Patreon now?\u201d I feel the answer is the same for a lot of people. Cosplaying is not a cheap hobby; it takes so much time and money in order to work and finish a costume, to attend events, to take photos. I feel blessed for all the opportunities I have and would love to do more, and hope you guys would love to see more from me! With Patreon, we can do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on here will help me devote more time and energy to what I love! With my own money, I buy all the materials for the cosplay, work on creating when I can, request the time off work for the events, book my hotel, and drive to the event. In the long run, this really adds up and limits what I can do. Larger projects or events get pushed back because there are only so many hours I can work in a week while maintaining my sanity. But, with your help, I won\u2019t have to push back projects or skip out on events! I will do my best to give back to anyone and everyone that supports me. I feel like it\u2019s such a commonly said thing, but I really do want to be able to give back to you guys for all the support you\u2019ve given me so far!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, Patreon has helped me signifcantly with covering basic costs regarding hotels and badges, which has allowed me to begin travelling a bit farther to other conventions in the 2018 year, including Anime Los Angeles and SakuraCon! These opportunities would not have been so easily available to me if it weren\u0027t for you guys and your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/35f304b2cd180fe9079c4405d903bea9/tumblr_otbsh0x2ME1qlatbko2_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the whole Patreon thing is something I am still settling in, I only have up to six Tiers of rewards so far. In time, as we hopefully grow, I will be adding more tiers and more rewards to each Tier! One big thing I am also trying to work on rolling out is a ~print shop~! In the meantime, however, if you pledge $15, you\u2019ll receive an exclusive signed postcard of the month that will never appear in my print shop; if you pledge $25, you\u0027ll receive the postcard as well as two 8x10 size prints; if you pledge $30, you\u0027ll receive all those prints AND a one of a kind polaroid photo!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore things I would like to roll out in the future are raffles for lower tiers to receive the exclusive signed print, maybe even Twitch streams, and Discord chats! Anything you guys want - just let me know, and let\u2019s see what we can come up with! Patreon is something I want to use to work with you guys, because without you and your support, I would not have so many wonderful opportunities like I do now. I cannot thank you guys enough for all the support you give me \u2661\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhoto credits:\u003cbr\u003e Banner (left to right):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RenobenPhotography/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRenoBen Photography\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ZhousDigitalDen/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZhou\u0027s Digital Den\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CAM-Photography-478121955689405/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCAM Photography\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MinotaurPhotography/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMinotaur Photography\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sonoltaprime/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSonoltaPrime\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/christianongphotography/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChristian Ong Photography\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nbanezphotos/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNeil Banez Photography\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ZhousDigitalDen/\"\u003eZhou\u0027s Digital Den\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Headers (top to bottom):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lumlionel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLionel Lum\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DietaryfiberPhotography/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDietaryFiber Photography\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alexnphotos/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u5433\u5fd7\u63ee Photography\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DTJAAAAM/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDTJAAAAM\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
