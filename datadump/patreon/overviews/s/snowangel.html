My name is Jane Christian or I go by my artist name \"snowangel.\"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I do excatly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\n a digital artist and a budding writer. I mainly specialize in drawing creature designs. My \nfavorite part of what I do is bringing my creatures and characters to \nlife. Giving them personality,  and  emotions. Either it be in words or \ndrawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\n is kind of like Kickstarter or Indiegogo where you back one large \nproject. On Patreon you can back a lot of smaller projects. You choose \nto \u0027tip\u0027 any amount you would like per chapter or art. If you\u0027re \nworried about going over a certain amount, don\u0027t worry. There is a cap \nlimit where you can specify how much you would like to give per month, \nno matter how many chapter I post. Pateron is more for creators who seek\n support in a more stable way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve\n been drawing since I was a kid and I love it. Recently I been writing \nstories and I have come to love that as well. There are so many things \nthat writing can do while drawing can\u2019t and vice versa. It evolved into a\n huge hobby that I really enjoy doing. I literally would love it if it \nwas so much more than that.  I spend most of my free time drawing or \nwriting whenever I get the chance too. But over the months writing and \ndrawing has become a lot more difficult due to part time jobs, life, and\n many others meaning having less time to make these projects \npossible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\n you enjoy my stories and artwork and would like to support me by \nbecoming my patreon. I would be sooooooo grateful. If you don\u2019t like any\n of my rewards please don\u2019t worry about it. Drezo Regalia and my artwork\n will always be free to read and look at. The fact that you enjoy my \nstories and artwork is what keeps me creating whether or not you decide \nto support me on patreon. Thank you so much.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo\n matter the amount you decide to give, every dollar will go back into \nthe creation of more content whether it be hiring or working with other \npeople, starting a possible comic, or even possibly making it into a \nactual games. Who knows on making it into an actual game. \nThat will probably be the day where I would smack myself a couple of \ntimes and wonder if i\u0027m dreaming. The fact is that you can enjoy and \ncontinue to read for free. You guys enjoying the story is what keeps me \nmotivate and want to continue to tell the story.  Regardless of whether \nor not you decide to support me on Patreon. Thank you from the bottom of\n my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter Releases:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Drezo Regalia and Black Moon there is a guaranteed two chapters through out the month. Each chapter consist about 8,000-11,000 words. I write for free and my story can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://enlightendragons.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eenlightendragons\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only does the patrons get earlier release, once a month I will write extra chapters solely for the patrons.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe extra chapter releases does not follow any release schedule as they completely depend\non my reader\u0027s donations, and they will usually be published within a few days\nafter received sponsorship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy hope is to become a full time writer and artist so that I can increase the amount of chapter I release each week.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your time, and thank you very much for your support, you are\nawesome!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
