We\u0027re a long distance couple hoping to one day close that distance. Alex draws a comic that we co-write and co-be-cute-together-for.

If you appreciate the comics we make, and want to give back while getting a little more, consider becoming a patron! We know times are hard and everyone is broke - but every little bit helps! A little pocket change can make all the difference when you\u0027re constantly saving up for plane tickets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons receive bonus content for ever comic we post, regardless of how much you give, so don\u0027t worry about breaking the bank. Fifty cents or a dollar, or even a few cents means the world to us, and we greatly appreciate all our patrons!\u003cbr\u003eOur comics originally started as a way to cope with how much the distance sucks, and it\u0027s an\u00a0extraordinary\u00a0thought that they could potentially help us close that distance. While the comics have brought us into this amazing community, our ultimate goal remains bringing us together, and all support helps us with that, bit by bit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003eRewards:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatrons will receive behind the scenes doodles and sketches, more elaborate explanations/backstories about comics, pictures, videos, bonus panels, colored comics, internet hugs, our undying thanks, and probably a few tears of joy from Alex.
