    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo, who are you guy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi there! I\u0027m Sam Potter. I\u0027m the creator of the retro game review show \u003cem\u003eRespect Your Elders, \u003c/em\u003eand other such random videos and let\u0027s plays. I also make regular video game Top 10\u0027s and Original reviews to boot. So why am I on Patreon? Well, I love making new videos, and I think that Patreon would be a big help in general.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making videos for roughly three years now, and I don\u0027t plan to stop anytime soon. Video Games, and especially the retro video games are what I love most in life. I love hearing about their development, their creators, how they came to be, and last but not least, playing the ever-loving crap out of them. Since I started reviewing these games, I\u0027ve only fallen more in love for the industry. I\u0027ve also been able to find a small community who enjoys learning about this kind of stuff too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell to be completely clear, this does not mean that I will start charging you to watch my content. Just think of it like a \"tip\" jar. Essentially, you can donate as little as one dollar a month (or however long you want) to help me out, and you can even donate even more if you feel so inclined. It\u0027s like a never ending kickstarter. In return, you\u0027ll see better quality videos, more types of games that I play/review, and even get some special streams ;) Just to be clear: \u003cem\u003eYou can cancel at ANYTIME.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m doing this so that I can continue to create great content that I feel that you guys deserve. Not only that, but sometimes the world of Google/Youtube can be a little weird when it comes to payment. I make literally pennies on making stuff, so obviously I\u0027m not doing it for a profit, but help would definitely be nice :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI would love to keep making more great stuff like this...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7ELRyzZ5ZE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what happens if this works out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply speaking, with Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to continue doing what I love, as well as being able to connect closer to my fans. Paypal donations are nice, but being able to speak directly with the donor is fantastic! I take so much pride in my work, and I love to see people enjoy it :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much in advance. I appreciate it soooo much!\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
