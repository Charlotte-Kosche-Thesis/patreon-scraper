    "summary": "Dressage\u00a0is the second largest competitive\nequestrian sport in the US. Equestrian sports are the only Olympic sports in\nwhich men and women complete equally against one another. Despite many efforts to increase youth participation in the sport, many must choose between riding and school due to financial needs. Balancing academics and riding can be difficult, however I have made this work through high school and my first two years at Santa Clara University. I have competed in the junior/ young rider FEI divisions, going to Festival of Champions and placing third, North American Junior Young Rider Championship twice and being a part of silver and gold medal winning teams as well as an individual silver medal, and I have been CDS Junior Champion. I have also had the opportunity to ride in many selective clinics, such as the USEF Pipeline Clinic in 2014. I am incredibly grateful for all of these opportunities and the amazing horses I have had the chance to ride, compete, and create partnerships with. I am also ever grateful for the wonderful coaching, training, and support I have received from my mom, Julie Thomas, Rachel Saavedra, and Jan Ebeling. They have opened many doors for me and have provided me with the skills necessary to be successful in the sport and are excellent role models. My next quest is to buy and then train a young horse under the expert guidance of Julie, Rachel, and Jan. Buying a talented young horse can be a daunting proposition, but with help from supporters of Stable Friends LLC it is possible! Other riders following this model of a patron of the arts or syndication have succeeded! I hope that through the creation of this LLC and through the amazing support system I have at my barn and beyond that I will be able to make this dream a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
