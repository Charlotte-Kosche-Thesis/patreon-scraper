I write what\u0027s in my heart, what inspires me, and all too often that\u0027s a 1 am thing! :) As an awesome patreon you\u0027ll get access to my works, everything from races and classes for Starfinder, to maps and modules for D\u0026amp;D. But I don\u0027t do it half assed! My work, I hope you\u0027ll agree, is pretty much commercial quality. I\u0027ve dedicated my life to writing and creating and hope it shows in my work. So sit back, relax, and let my creative juices spice up your games!"
