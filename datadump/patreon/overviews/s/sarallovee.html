    "summary": "Welcome to my patreon and thank you for visiting!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a place where you will receive the gifts I have to offer in terms of inspiration, love, beauty, healing, connection, growth, reflection. In supporting my Patreon you\u0027re receiving a deeper look into my creative fires ;), which yes are a glowing red ginger amber radiance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love finding a deeper emotion in an image and also, sinking deeper into my skin. I love all that is beautiful in the world, even that which isn\u0027t beautiful by mainstream commands. I\u0027m an intense scorpio, passionate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of my life experience, I am a voice for women who have struggled with body image issues and disconnect from their bodies.\u003cbr\u003eI am a voice for empowering oneself to choose health and wellbeing, to be the one who gives yourself everything you truly desire. \u003cbr\u003eI am a voice for individuals to feel safe expressing their sexuality, but with powerful discernment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am a voice for mother earth, and all matters of the spirit. \u003cbr\u003eAnd so much more, I\u0027m MULTI-FACETED.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy interests are many. I harness my energy and focus on one thing at a time, whether it is on writing, or booking a photoshoot, or making a flower essence, etc. But I can\u0027t entirely plan my inspirations either...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I like to balance what is spontaneous in my life (such as artistic creations) with what is planned and disciplined (such as fitness or regular journaling)!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you can expect from my Patreon Page:\u003cbr\u003eFigure and Nude Art\u003cbr\u003eED Recovery Reflections\u003cbr\u003eSelfies\u003cbr\u003eRandom Blogs\u003cbr\u003eMenstrual \u0026amp; Moon Musings\u003cbr\u003ePoetry\u003cbr\u003eFitness Routines I Do\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSkincare \u0026amp; Beauty Blogs\u003cbr\u003eEtc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps me to invest more time into creating content. All proceeds from my Patreon will initially go towards helping to pay off our enormous student loan payments (but hey, DPT am I right?). Some of it will help support any equipment I may need camera wise or app wise for editing. Eventually, with the hard work and growth of this platform and as a reward for my own dedication to sharing my work, I would like to donate 10% of the proceeds at the end of the year to the conservation efforts of a near threatened or endangered species, likely my spirit animal, the Leopard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, you can sign up to support me for $1.00 a month and get things I post on Instagram and such. This is just a sign of your support! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003eYou can also currently sign up for Subscriptions of $5.00/month, which is content I find to be valuable and requires a lot of my attention. (Expect 4-10 posts a month)\u003cbr\u003eThe subscription of $10.00/month is more for the uncensored nude and figure art, and even more time-consuming writings/creations. (Expect 2-5 posts a month)\u003cbr\u003eThere will also be one-time photosets or downloads you can purchase just once!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll purchases are ultimately just a sign of your support and respect! THANK YOU!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eServices offered in person:\u003cbr\u003eBody Empowering Nude Photoshoots, 1 on 1 with me (we have to be local)\u003cbr\u003eFlower Essence Therapy Sessions (3 month program) (can be via Skype if not local)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for becoming a patron of my art. I value you, me, this earth. Your support helps me to peel back another layer of myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
