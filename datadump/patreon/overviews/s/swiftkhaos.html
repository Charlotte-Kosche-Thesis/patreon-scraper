    "summary": "Hello! My name is Swift and I am an aspiring artist and animator. Drawing has been my passion for a long time; with animation and making edits to songs quickly catching up, and I would love to be able to commit more of my time to my work. If you\u0027re seeing this then you probably also know that I no longer monetize my speedpaints, all the information about how to actually get the money makes my brain hurt, andI have been wanting to create more animations as well as pmv\u0027s (Picture Music Videos) but these do take a lot of time, not only to mention but these videos also use copyrighted songs so I would be unable to monetize the finished products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I start getting older money will start becoming an issue and I\u0027ll have less time to focus on projects that I really want to do, which will lead to them taking longer to be completed. With patreon support I would be able to focus more of my time on my bigger projects and get them completed sooner. Any amount you have to offer would be incredible in helping me start getting ready to pay for my future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledged to me I wouldn\u0027t have to worry myself over the concerns of time and work, I would be able to focus more time to my art and less hours at work, and to help start paying the bills around the house.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention that pledgers would receive art from me, sneak peaks at projects, and even be able to help choose my next big projects, and even more hopefully appealing benefits that I have to offer! I would like to thank everyone in advance! \u0026lt;3"
