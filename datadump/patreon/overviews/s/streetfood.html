    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am: \u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Christian Dzadek and I\u0027m from Florida (don\u0027t hold it against me). My family and I live and work as expatriates in China - one of the most rapidly developing and globally dynamic countries on the planet \u2026 Also, it has the most people, but you probably already knew that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I make: \u003c/strong\u003eStreet Food! I love it. It\u0027s one of the things that gets me out the door in the morning. And, to be honest, that isn\u0027t always easy to do as an expat in an unfamiliar culture. We\u0027ve found that one of the best ways to handle cultural differences - be they linguistic, hygienic, or culinary - is through manageable, snack-sized portions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I create vlogs (mostly set in China, but occasionally from other parts of the world) that explore cultures foreign to my own. Every episode of Street Food features a snack and a cultural tidbit. I\u0027m into cooking, travel, and TESOL as well, so some episodes also feature bonus recipes, travel guides for various parts of China, and language acquisition tips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the main event is the food. Street Food. I eat it on the street, I watch out for the parasites, I educate my fans (Streetfoodies) on the general goings-on of expat life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI release my content in Seasons - between 15 and 20 episodes per season.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConsider Sponsoring Street Food! \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m committed to delivering my content for free, but I\u0027d love to see the show improve. My fans have given me some great ideas for things to improve, but they all cost money. If you like the show, and you\u0027d like to see it improve, consider sponsoring Street Food!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust so it\u0027s clear, a pledge only counts toward the release of Street Food episodes. I release other content on my channel as well, but a commitment to support the show through Patreon will only apply to episodes of my main show - Street Food. No more than 20 episodes per season."
