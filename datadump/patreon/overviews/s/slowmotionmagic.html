    "summary": "My road to Parkinson\u0027s awareness through magic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA native of Detroit, MI, Dovid Rabotnick has always been fascinated by magic and sleight of hand.   \nIn 2013 Dovid was diagnosed with Atypical Parkinson\u2019s which sent his life into a tailspin.  Nearly every aspect of his life changed as the disease progressed.  Basic daily routines became interrupted as he was forced to use his non-dominant hand to do nearly everything.\nDovid assumed his magic days were over due to the loss of dexterity and slowness of motion which are symptoms of this specific type of Parkinson\u2019s.  Instead of giving up his passion of magic, however, Dovid realized that he could adjust his technique and would just have to be twice as good.  \nSlow Motion Magic was born.\nDovid hopes you enjoy the tricks as much as he does performing them.  For more information on Parkinson\u2019s Disease, please visit \u003ca href=\"https://www.michaeljfox.org/\"\u003ehttps://www.michaeljfox.org/\u003c/a\u003e"
