People watch them, it\u0027s pretty cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve enjoy The Films i make, usually Drone videos of local places\u00a0and occasional vlogs and you would like to help me create more videos to continuously improve standards, that\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love Filming and Creating, i enjoying Making short YouTube Videos that i think people would be interested to see.\u003cbr\u003eThis is your chance to get involved in my Creations. You sponsor my Film-Making, and I can afford to keep making films! I post at least one Video a fortnight to YouTube, and throw in a random Vlog every few weeks or months (for Patreons only)\u003cbr\u003eThere is no guilt here. I produce Movies, you enjoy them. You can keep on enjoying them and I\u2019ll probably keep producing them regardless of whether or not you patronize my work. Patronage exists as a way for you to say thanks with financial assistance, which in turn makes it easier for me to continue to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many exciting video projects in the works and am excited to share them with you.

As the financial security of YouTube\u0027s ad revenue system continues to dwindle, it starts to seem more and more likely i may have to push my online ambitions to the side unless i supplement more revenue.\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily, I want to continue creating as many interesting, enjoyable videos as possible. I have a never ending list of ideas and topics, I just need the freedom to create them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis can also help me replace broken equipment, invest in better equipment for higher quality videos, and generally free up my time to get more done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is for those of you who believe that my Art/Film-making deserves support, and who choose to help out.

     "description": "Well i have come to realise that the most important thing i need right now is a \u0027Commercial licence\u0027 for the aerial projects.\u003cbr\u003eFlying and making Videos as a hobbyist is all fine and well, I can carry on doing what i do as long as i follow the safety rules like everyone else. However saying that, It is simply not possible for me to make a career or earn any money from the work i do until i have this paperwork.. \u00a0The only way i can earn or continue my work long term just now is by Hoping for a few generous people out there that would be happy to support my work via \u0027Patreon\u0027 as donations are allowed.\u003cbr\u003eThe price for the 2 day commercial course is around \u00a31500! \u00a0which is simply waaay out of my budget, but if i can raise this target, then that would be crazy awesome and maybe i can finally say goodbye to the haters that think a hobbyist should not be doing what i do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlying model aircraft has been a passion of mine since i was a child, but was always out of my budget. As an adult Photography became an enjoyable hobby. \u00a0Now with the amazing leap in drone technology i actually have the chance to make the best of both worlds and try my best to make something out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond this, Any and all other revenue from Patreon supporters will always go directly back into my work. \u00a0I hope To Keep making videos and creating unique pictures for many years to come and in the next milestone description you can read about all the other things i would typically need to have a chance of being successful. \u00a0Not in a famous sense! but just to be able to keep creating unique aerial videos for years to come that others will be able to watch long after im gone. :)\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "I would love to document a lot of the things i do, places i go and Stream Directly When on projects.  A Better Camera will allow me to Speak on camera,Give advice/explanations, interact better with viewers,  you can imagine How much better a film makers channel would be be with a PROPER Camera right? the list is long.   (be able to take HDR pictures using a handheld?, Id love that!....Time lapse..oh yes!)   From education and experience i know how to handle the equipment, i just don\u0027t own it yet because its so expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously The mics, i.e.  a shotgun mic and a lav mic are essential if i want to interact the way i would like to with my followers/viewers... If i could start buying the tools i need it would just be a MASSIVE motivational boost to progress further.   I dont want to be famous, But i would like to make things people are interested to watch and i would like to spend a good amount of time in Post-production learning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain its all about delivering Quality right? \u00a0I really need good software/hardware For the complex tasks of \u00a0Video and photo editing, special effects, animations and general polish to what i do and upgrade here n there. \u00a0 This goal would allow me to 100% focus on my creative works and upload much more content at a much improved rate. \u00a0everything i put out should look so much better. and i would be feeling really happy about it. \u00a0Life would feel awesome and im sure it would show in my videos.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
