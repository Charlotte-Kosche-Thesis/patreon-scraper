    "summary": "Hi, my name is Clare. I am the creative brain behind Sewn by\nDragons. I make costumes to order but like all other dragons, I have a horde of\nother crafts under my wings. I\u2019m always trying to push the boundaries with my\nskills, learning new techniques and trying to come up with original ideas for\nprops and costumes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSewn by Dragons has been up and running for 3 years but\nsadly, crafting alone is a very tough way to earn a living. So as a result,\nlike all other good entrepreneurs, I\u2019m trying to add as many income streams as\nI can, so I don\u2019t have to go by the title \u2018Starving artist\u2019. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThose of you who know me well, will know that I already run monthly\nauction called Clutter-Buys, https://www.facebook.com/groups/1592375727666108/,\nand we recently started making mystery boxes which I also sell through Clutter-Buys.\nSadly, this still isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet and there are so many other\namazing things that I\u2019m capable of doing if I only had the means to be able to pursue\nthem. Such as training courses, additional equipment etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd that\u2019s were you guys come in. With a little help from my\nfriends and the LARP community, I hope to take Sewn By Dragons further than I\ncould hope to on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, what do you get out of this? Other than the satisfaction\nof knowing your helping someone to realise their dreams? I obviously want to\ngive you something back. I offer 4 tiers of rewards, please take a look at them\nand see if find one to suit you. I\u2019d love to be able to tailor them to each\nindividual but sadly time will not allow that unless to choose the final tier,\nhowever, I hope I can offer enough to tempt you. If you have any questions or\nwant to say hi, please feel free to message me and I\u2019ll endeavour to answer as\nsoon as I can. I plan to do monthly updates to keep you all informed as to what\nI\u2019m up to. These will be interspersed with how-to videos and tutorials on how\nto make bits of costumes as I truly believe that skill should be shared where\never possible and as my Patreons you will get unique access into my chaotic,\ncrafty brain.\u003cbr\u003e"
