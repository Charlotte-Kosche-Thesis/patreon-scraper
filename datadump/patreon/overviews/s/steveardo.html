For me, art has played a huge role in shaping\nmy future, and it\u2019s been a huge driving force in my own personal\ngrowth. I\u2019ve had to endure almost a decade of setbacks, losses, and\nobstacles. For the past 8 years, I spent almost 7 of them homeless which began\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://steveardo.tumblr.com/post/104276843985/homecoming-king-part-i\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eafter I was forced to flee from my own home for my own personal safety\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Yet during that time, I was able to push myself to graduate\nfrom college with my Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University at\nBuffalo in 2012. My geographical location has made it extremely difficult to\nfind a steady job in my field of study. Buffalo doesn\u2019t have a lot\nof local opportunities available as our job market for graphic\ndesigners is extremely small and fiercely competitive, with the\nmajority of open positions going to individuals with a previous\nprofessional background or those fresh out of college with internship\nexperience. I also did not have access to the same resources my peers\nhad after graduating as I had to focus all of my energies into\nsurviving what seemed like a never-ending cycle of poverty and\ninstability. What I lack in \u201cprofessional\u201d experience I\u2019ve more\nthan made up in building a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cargocollective.com/sardo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003esolid portfolio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e from the ground up with\nabsolutely nothing to my name. No one held my hand or told me what to\ndo, I\u2019ve had to learn almost everything all on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhere I\u2019ve Come From\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019ve\nbeen very fortunate in falling in with a very amazing community of\n\u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d musicians and artists too after I was asked to\ndesign a flyer for a punk show my best friend was booking and playing\nat in March of 2013. From then on I became more integrated with this\n\u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d (or DIY) group and to this day I have created\nover 2 dozen hand-drawn flyers for basement punk shows, established\nmusic local music venues like Nietzsche\u2019s and the Mohawk Place, and\neven an open-mic series for youths and young adults. Not only that, but I have been able to design album art, merchandise, logos, and\neven T-shirts for musicians (including some for the local indie\nwrestling circuit). My portfolio has been built on projects for\nlocal acts like Accidentals, On The Cinder, Seven Thirty Seven, Shevy\n\u0026amp; the Pulse, and Creation Order Xtinction, but also for\nartists elsewhere like Satellite High from San Francisco. My\ndedication to the local DIY community caught the eye of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aluminumrecords.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAluminum Records\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a not-for-profit/grassroots record label, and I was asked to\njoin their ranks as an artist and designer in 2014. These connections proved to be an invaluable catalyst for me to grow and evolve as both an artist and as a person.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy DIY contributions gave me a\npurpose in my life where my work was truly appreciated on a very genuine level. It didn\u2019t matter if I was homeless and living in\npoverty, just knowing that everyone valued me and my talents gave my\nlife meaning. I\u2019ve never seen such strong bonds between people as I\nhave within this community; everyone works together and supports one\nanother out of sheer passion for what we do despite our own personal\nstruggles. Race, religious background, gender identity, income\nlevel, and even sexual orientation were irrelevant when it came to\nbelonging. Respect is what always comes first, and I was able to\ntruly live my life without feeling fear or shame as an out and proud gay\nman. I\u2019ve never felt more welcomed and accepted into a group before\nin my life, where for the first time I could say that I had a lot of\ntrue friends. They became a support system I never knew I could ever\nhave. I finally had a solid direction and a future to work towards\nbecause of them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI might be a punk, but the\ncraziest thing I do in my life? Dance in the pit at shows as I\nmosh and skank with all of my friends.

Over the past few years I\u2019ve also\nlost two of the most important figures in my life, two men who were wonderful friends and pillars of strength that I loved with all my heart who passed only a year and a few\nmonths apart. I\u2019m still not used to living my life without them\nalways being there. Depression and anxiety have also been massive forces\nopposing me along the way on a daily basis, the stress and pressure\nunyielding. Yet still I haven\u2019t allowed them to win even when the\ndarkness has been overwhelming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI wanted\nto take back my life and pursue my dreams of creating art and design\nwork that helps other people. Last summer I tried to raise money for\na\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://igg.me/at/steveardo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003esmall business through Indiegogo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and I let go of my previously\nheld self-inflicted shame about my past and own personal struggles to share my story\nwith absolutely everyone around me.  I had a solid plan in place to\ncontinue my freelance work and sell my own screen-printed T-shirts,\nbut I just needed the capital to buy the necessary resources to make\nit reality. I could be completely financially independent and free\nfrom what was a never-ending personal nightmare of fear and\nuncertainty. But, I \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e raised just shy of $500, a little over 3% of\nmy $15,000 goal, and only had maybe less then a dozen people help\nshare my link. This was the most important step in my life; I was\nfinally taking control and building a future on my own terms. I felt\ncompletely defeated afterward as I couldn\u2019t even accomplish what I\nhad originally set out to do. I thought more people I knew would rally\naround my cause as I laid my entire life out in the open and was left\ncompletely vulnerable. In the end I was only able to take very small\nsteps to try and start my small business, but not enough to make\nanything significant happen with it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhere I\u2019m Going\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still\nhave my dreams and I\u2019m determined even more so to make sure they\nbecome a reality. I\u2019m launching this Patreon because art has been\nthe one thing that has kept me going through the most darkest and\ndirest moments in my life. It\u2019s given me a real goal of a  feasible\nfuture that lies not too far off. The DIY community has taught me\nthat I\u2019m never really truly alone, and that it\u2019s perfectly okay\nto ask for help. After enduring so much for so long, I\u2019m now\nfinally learning how to stand again albeit on really shaky legs. I\u2019m\nstill in survival mode trying as hard as I can and taking very small\nsteps to adjust to what a \u201cnormal\u201d life is. It\u2019s still a very\nnew experience for me and I\u2019m doing the best I can. I don\u2019t want\nto be rich and famous, I just want to be able to wake up every\nmorning not being fearful of anything and everything that can go\nwrong.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMaking\nart will be my full-time career, but I need \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e help in establishing\na launching point so I can reach that goal instead of always falling just-short. I still don\u2019t\nhave \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e stability in my life even after working so hard, and without any solid ground I\u2019m\nstill stuck desperately struggling to make ends meet. Despite that, I\u2019ve accomplished a lot over the years and I\u2019m slowly influencing the world around me.

I\u2019d like to also start a video series on my\nYouTube page where I\u2019ll share my journey and everything I\u2019ve\nendured and where I\u2019d like to openly answer any questions people may have\nfor me too. In return, you help ease the burden of buying supplies and upgrading primitive equipment I\nneed to continue making art that I\u2019ve desperately lacked over the\nyears, help me expand my talents beyond the limits of Buffalo, and\nmaybe even lessen the severe anxiety from scrambling to scrape\ntogether money for rent and other necessary expenses. With a solid foundation I can finally live without fear doing what I love the most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eMaking a Dream Come True\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing my creative talents to help others has\nkept me going for so long when I felt like everything around me was\nrejecting me and that I was a colossal failure. I\u2019m no longer\ncontent just settling with having to go without, to let circumstances\nbeyond my control dictate what kind of life I can live, or to let my\nfull potential be limited by continuing setbacks and obstacles. I\nknow what it\u2019s like to feel like you\u2019re endlessly drowning in a\ndownward spiral of self-loathing and despair. Art has saved my life\nmultiple times when all seemed hopeless. Right now I have absolutely\nnothing left to lose, and I\u2019ve been just fighting forward on the\nblind hope that something will work out in the end while tightly holding\nonto my dreams. Even if I ultimately fail, I hope my story gives\nothers the courage to not give up and to keep pushing themselves\nfurther.

After installing 4GB of RAM and a 1TB HDD, it has served me well since I got it to replace my stolen Early 2008 MacBook Pro in 2013. However, some things have degraded over the years and desperately need replacing, but I haven\u2019t had the extra money to do so.\u00a0It\u2019s also been four years since I graduated from college, and unfortunately during my couch-surfing/homeless adventures I had to give up certain artistic disciplines as they weren\u2019t mobile-friendly when I had to move around. Painting was unfortunately sacrificed and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to get back into - I have a 4\u0027 x 4\u0027 acrylic painting I\u2019ve been wanting to start! Other supplies like ink, primer/gesso, paints, paper, a paper-cutter, a light table, and canvases are very much needed.",
