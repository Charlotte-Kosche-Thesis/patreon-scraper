I\u0027m a creator who primarily makes sculptures of all sorts. I\u0027ve been known to dabble in other mediums and disciplines from time to time, nothing is off limits!\u00a0My\n work loosely references the various situations, feelings and thoughts \nI\u2019ve had over the years that have been influenced by my depression and \nexperiences with mental illness. I use my art to represent various \naspects of my personality as well as figure out or come to terms with these things that ail me. Shadoe in a nutshell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1153.photobucket.com/albums/p512/Shadoedelgado/0a261413-39b0-4994-95a3-c56b7485dafe_zpsypgb6p1h.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started to make a living off my art, but then I feel into a severe depression that lasted roughly a year. My business took a hit along with my reputation.\u00a0  My goal is to make my business viable again while redeeming myself and I could use all the help I can get. I\u0027m here on Patreon to ask for your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1153.photobucket.com/albums/p512/Shadoedelgado/e25f8b91-6256-4267-9f24-15a0166c30a4_zps815ijvpm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy Pledging to my Patreon you will be helping me take my passion of making art and self-discovery to a new level. If this takes off and sufficient pledges are received I can start focusing on art that matters to me and hopefully a lot of other people out there. Once I get back on my feet and to the point of supporting myself, I hope to kill my staggering student loan debt. Most of all I hope to use Patreon as a means of supplementing my art business and helping it reach the point of viability. Once I reach this point my Patreon will turn into a monthly subscription service which hopes to provide you with more, bad-assier exclusive art! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is like an ongoing Kickstarter in that it allows an established audience of supporters to support artists and projects. However, instead of pledging a lump sum for one large project like Kickstarter, Patreon\u0027s pledges are recurring, smaller donations to help your favorite artists continue to bring you the art you enjoy. Your Pledge can be from $1 to however many dollhairs you want. In most cases I will show my appreciation by giving you rewards, such as figures, prints, and hand written letters. At the very least patrons get a hearty \"Thank You\" and my phone number so you can harass me anytime!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eRewards\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e and the Like\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eBy becoming a patron you are entitled to rewards determined by your monthly pledge. The rewards are a way for me to show you my appreciation for your generous support. Rewards range from access to my exclusive Patreon content not seen anywhere else, signed prints, exclusive patreon figure variants and producer credits printed on the box art of my major toy or sculpture releases.\u00a0 This is also another opportunity for me to connect with you. Here I\u0027ll share my thoughts and the process of my works, something I don\u0027t typically do on my other Social Media outlets. Patreon will act as a blog of sorts with all kinds of behind the scenes stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1153.photobucket.com/albums/p512/Shadoedelgado/TokenSonPatreon1_zps78f943fb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are you waiting for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

The Shadows choose from various over-worn, stressed and cracked masks that they utilize to hide their dark expressionless faces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0My work is self-reflective, referencing the various situations, feelings and thoughts I\u2019ve had over the years. I use the Shadows to represent various aspects of my personality. Whether as an 8 year old or 27 year old, I have always felt the need to fit it in, even if it meant laughing at a terrible joke or pretending I understood what someone was talking about. I always felt like I was a follower and that I would change face depending on whom I was with in order to fit in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Whether the medium is Ceramic, Paint or Polymer Clay, I use each mask on the Shadows to represent someone or something I\u2019ve pretended to be in order to fit in or cope with certain social situations. The reason I chose the term Shadow to describe these beings is because of the shadow\u2019s nature to be shaped by the object from which it is being cast. In psychology, Carl Jung describes the Shadow as the least desirable aspects of our personality that we repress and choose not to recognize. It\u2019s been my goal to try and give these ideas a tangible form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e",
