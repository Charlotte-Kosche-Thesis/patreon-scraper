    "summary": "I\u2019m a horticulturist\nwho writes and speaks about how food is grown, harvested, processed, and gets into\nthe mouths of people like you and me. I live and work in Toronto, Canada where\nI\u2019ve raised chickens, squeezed 50 fig plants into my urban lot, turned my\ngarage roof into a garden, and took out my front lawn to demonstrate that a\nveggie garden can look nice. I am the author of three gardening books, have spoken\nat 100+ events, written scads of garden, food, and farm articles, host a gardening\nradio show with my daughter, and I send out a monthly idea-filled newsletter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion\nis telling the stories of groundbreaking people who shake up the food system with\nnew (often old) innovative ideas. I talk to farm entrepreneurs growing new and\ninnovative crops, and I talk to gardeners who take the rules, break them, and\ndiscover better ways to garden. Their stories are an opportunity to dig deeper and\nthink about issues we face in our changing foodscape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy\ngrocery shopping. Food fascinates me, so I\u0027ve been known to do things that\ndrive my wife, Shelley, crazy like make parsnip wine (it wasn\u2019t a great\nsuccess), run a bushel of carrots through the washing machine (worked\nbeautifully), or pack a tiny basement washroom with dormant fig trees for the\nwinter (the fig trees were fine, but Shelley and I squabbled over the remaining\nwashroom). I\u2019m interested in growing food, preparing it, and creating a better\nfood system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t\nwrite fluffy \u201cfood porn.\u201d I don\u2019t represent a company. I don\u2019t do paid endorsements.\n(Farm, food, and garden communications\nhas its fair share of corporate influence. I remember being at a meeting of farm\nwriters and being one of only two independent journalists in the room\u2014most of\nthe other people were employees of companies selling inputs such as pesticides\nand fertilizers. How\u2019s that for incestuous\u2026you can see how independent thinking\ncan get fuzzy.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here\non Patreon because I want to tell you great farm, food, and garden stories. I\ndon\u2019t want to endorse brands and products. I want to share my experiences and\nconnections in the food, farm, and garden world with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a look\nat my blogs and you may be inspired by the wacky projects I tackle myself, like\nmaking wicking beds to grow tomatoes under a walnut tree or turning a garage\nroof into an urban farm. Listen to my radio show. Check out my fig website. If\nmy work inspires you, you can\u00a0become a patron so that I can bring you more\nstories. Together, we can change the food system.\u003cbr\u003e"
