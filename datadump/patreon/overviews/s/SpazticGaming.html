Lately, we\u0027ve had a lot more ideas about creating content and we\u0027ve been unsure of the best ways to deploy them smartly and what fans of our brand of content might like, thus a Patreon was born!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney talks, Water_Elemental and I (Axis) strongly believe that a subscription based bonus feed of content might just be the thing to satisfy what you guys, the viewers want to see and what we want to produce and want your feedback to reflect! We\u0027ve created a number of tiers and set ups to fit what folks might like to see and allow\u00a0you guys, the audience to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge is a commitment to content and we hope to produce content that you\u0027ll really enjoy above and beyond what we normally produce!"
