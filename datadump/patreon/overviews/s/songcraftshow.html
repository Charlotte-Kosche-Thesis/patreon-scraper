    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSongcraft: Conversations with Great Songwriters\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eis a bi-weekly podcast featuring in-depth interviews with the creators of lyrics and music that stand the test of time. You probably know their names, and you definitely know their songs. We bring you their stories. From behind-the-scenes hitmakers like Desmond Child (\u201cLivin\u2019 On a Prayer\u201d), Mike Stoller (\u201cHound Dog\u201d), Mark James (\u201cSuspicious Minds\u201d), Billy Steinberg (\u201cLike a Virgin\u201d) and Steve Cropper (\u201cIn the Midnight Hour\u201d) to high profile singer/songwriters like Loretta Lynn, Bill Withers, Jimmy Webb, Vince Gill, Donovan, and Tom T. Hall, Songcraft digs deeps to explore the lives and careers of the men and women who put pen to paper, hands to keyboards, and fingers to strings to create the songs that inspire, challenge, and entertain us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBased in Los Angeles, Songcraft is produced by award-winning songwriter Paul Duncan and Grammy-nominated writer and author Scott B. Bomar. The native Nashvillians met in the early 1990s while still in high school. As their peers listened to current Top 40 radio, Paul and Scott spent their lunch breaks huddled around the lone mono speaker in the dashboard of Paul\u2019s 1981 Datsun hatchback. Soaking up cassette tapes of music from previous decades, the pair began analyzing what makes a great song, and eventually formed their own band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduation, Paul took off for Chicago to study Literature. Scott stayed in Nashville, where he went to Belmont University before moving on to graduate school at Vanderbilt. Paul eventually settled in Los Angeles, and Scott found his way to the West Coast soon after. Though a lot of years have passed, Scott and Paul remain, at heart, the same two guys who huddled around that mono speaker and analyzed songs. They designed the \u003cem\u003eSongcraft\u003c/em\u003e podcast as a forum for anyone from casual music fans to fellow songwriters, music geeks, and creative types to hear great songwriters in conversation about their influences, the writing process, the stories behind their songs, their experiences in the business, their own love of music, and how they\u2019ve honed their craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Duncan \u003c/strong\u003eis a versatile musician, producer, and ASCAP award-winning songwriter whose music has been heard from MTV to the stage of Nashville\u2019s legendary Grand Ole Opry. He is equally at home playing with his own rock band, The Echo Division, at the Sunset Strip\u2019s iconic Roxy Theatre as he is placing hit singles on the \u003cem\u003eBillboard\u003c/em\u003e Country and Christian charts for Sherrie Austin (\"Streets of Heaven\") Lauren Daigle (\"Light of the World\"), and Jordan Feliz (\"Beloved\"). With dozens of TV placements, you\u2019ve probably heard Paul\u2019s songs on shows such as \u003cem\u003eBoston Legal, The Hills, Extra, T\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ehe Real\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWorld\u003c/em\u003e, and\u003cem\u003e Jersey Shore\u003c/em\u003e. As a producer, he\u2019s worked on commercial projects for Samsung, Royal Caribbean, Wendy\u2019s, the Criterion Collection, and Applegate Farms. When he\u2019s not in the studio, Paul is a multi-instrumentalist who has performed extensively with artists such as 98 Degrees, Sense Field, Mindy McCready, Mercy Street (RCA), Sherrie Austin, and Nick Lachey. Though signed as a staff songwriter with Centricity Music in Nashville, Paul makes his home in Redondo Beach, California with his wife Jeami and their daughter Elliotte. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScott B. Bomar\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eis a Grammy nominated writer, researcher, and music historian who has spearheaded an array of projects for clients including The Library of Congress, Gibson Guitars, Leiber and Stoller Music, The Country Music Hall of Fame, The Georgia Music Hall of Fame, and Bear Family Records. He is a former professional songwriter who was signed to Sony/ATV Music where he collaborated with Eric Church, Brandy Clark, The Derailers, Tom Douglas, Luke Laird, and others. He ultimately moved to the other side of the desk to work in publishing, first for Universal Music Group, and now at BMG. His book \u003cem\u003eSouthbound\u003c/em\u003e, a survey of Southern rock, was awarded Best Historical Research in Recorded Rock and Popular Music from the Association for Recorded Sound Collections in 2015. Additionally he co-authored the books \u003cem\u003eThe Bakersfield Sound: Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, and California Country\u003c/em\u003e;\u003cem\u003eThe \"Odessey\": The Zombies in Words \u0026amp; Images\u003c/em\u003e; and Wanda Jackson\u0027s autobiography, \u003cem\u003eEvery Night is Saturday Night\u003c/em\u003e. Scott lives in Inglewood, California with his wife, Melanie and their very old dog Harlee."
