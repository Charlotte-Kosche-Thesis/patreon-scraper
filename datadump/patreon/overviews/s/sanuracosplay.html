    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Sanura of Sanura Cosplay! I am an up and coming cosplayer in the Atlanta area and I love sharing my art with everyone. Currently, I am also a grad student, a social work intern, and have two jobs which anyone can imagine is a pretty strenuous life style (seriously, what is sleep?), so I have created this page in an attempt to gain extra support for my love of creating beautiful cosplay art. Currently, all of my cosplays are made mostly by me, and one of my goals is to hone the skills to make 100% of all of my costumes in the future. Naturally, this gets more expensive the more I delve into different techniques and skills; therefore, helping me invest in my art will give you the chance to say that you\u0027ve helped me accomplish my goals and grow with me on this journey. I hope one day to own my own costume shop to give cosplayers more places to search for rare items. I also hope to one day be able to use what I make from cosplaying to give back to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore About this Page:\u003cbr\u003eIf you are stopping by to become a patron then WHOO HOO thanks a lot! If you\u0027re just browsing and do not wish to become a patron that\u0027s okay too! Thanks for stopping by. My rewards may seem a little different than most because, although I have no problem with sexy shoots, I am a non-lewd cosplayer. This can get pretty hard, but is also challenging and rewarding to make sure you get your money\u0027s worth, so let me explain: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNotice something? \u003cbr\u003eThe higher you get within my reward tiers, the more of an intimate experience you will receive. Just browsing my page you know me as Sanura Cosplay, you may not even know my real name. With the $1 tier, you get a little bit more depth of my cosplay life by getting early access to photo shoot content, photo sets that are not posted to social media, and sneak peaks of upcoming cosplay. This is a little more than most, but barely scratching the surface. With the $5 tier, you get all of that plus insight into my cosplay creating processes including behind-the-scenes photos and videos of how I make things happen. With the $10 tier is where it gets a little more personal, this tier includes insight into ideas for my original characters that I cosplay, monthly group sessions in google hangouts, and also exclusive photo sets of my street-clothing fashion, giving you a clearer image of who I am outside of Sanura. With the $25 tier, you are able to get regular access to my inner thoughts and feelings which include blog posts as well as videos of me expressing myself or venting about what\u0027s going in my head at the moment. You are also\u00a0able to have intimate talks with me on at least a monthly basis. Not only will you know my name, but the girl behind the name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
