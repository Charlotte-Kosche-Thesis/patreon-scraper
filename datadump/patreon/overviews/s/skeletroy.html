    "summary": "Hey everyone, Skeletroy here. You\u0027ve probably arrived at this page because you\u0027ve enjoyed my SNES thrash remixes on YouTube, and want to show some support. Thanks, I appreciate it! Just to be clear, this page is about showing support to me as an artist, rather than me trying to sell you music. That\u0027s why every song that I\u0027ve put on YouTube is/will be available for download here for $1 (total, not each), and all the remixes of those songs are available for a separate $1. For example, a song from the Legend of Zelda series would get the \n\"orchestral thrash\" mix for YouTube and Patreon ($1 tier), but Patreon would also \nget the orchestral mix and the thrash mix (in the other $1 tier).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSNES thrash remixes are created using a Nintendo DS rhythm game called Jam With the Band. It has an editing mode that allows for eight channels of instruments, which makes a good platform for making SNES-style songs. I\u0027ll explain a lot more once I start a video series about making music and finding your own style as an artist, but first I need to get all of my previous songs uploaded to Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I upload the backlog of songs and re-remixes, there will be a new song available daily until February 2019, after which I\u0027ll be able to form a standard schedule of the 5 YouTube songs per month, and any exclusive remixes of them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this, I hope it gives a better understanding of my motivations. I just want to make and distribute my art as a career, and hope to eventually have enough free time that I can make videos to help people make their own art. I just need to find enough people who can make this dream a reality with even the smallest financial contributions, and hope that in turn, they find me. \u003cbr\u003e"
