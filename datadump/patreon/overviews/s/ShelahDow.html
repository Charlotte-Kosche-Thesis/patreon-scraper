    "summary": "I\u0027m an artist. I have found my niche in creating the fantasy illustration that blends into the reality of emotions. I\u0027ve given myself the freedom to just make stuff without holding myself to rigid realism meets fantasy.  I draw the heartaches of the human condition as well as putting physical pain to the page.\u00a0I draw whimsical, sweet creatures that make you want to cuddle them up. I draw the weird and wonderful and I love it. This is all I\u0027ve ever wanted to be since I was a little girl, back when we were told we could be anything we wanted to be when we grew up....except that. Art was frivolous, but art is my soul.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to one day be a full-time artist, or as close to it as I can get. \u00a0I deal with health challenges, and they come through into my work. I am hoping to shift away from working full-time with illustration as my secondary project to having my dream fulfilled. I want to just live and create. I want to share my process. I want to share my heart. Illustrations here become coloring book pages, so if you love to color, this is also a great place for you. You can see my work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.shelahdowart.com/\"\u003eShelah Dow Art.\u003c/a\u003e You can even visit me in my own coloring group:  \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/shelahdowart/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/shelahdowart/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to have you walk along this journey with me. If you\u0027re not able, that\u0027s fine. It would help immensely if you just took a second and shared this page. Thank you so very much! \u003cbr\u003e~~~ Shelah\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shelahdowart.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShelah Dow Art\u003c/a\u003e."
