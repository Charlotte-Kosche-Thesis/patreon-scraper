    "summary": "You clicked! There are\nso many choices in cyberspace, and you taking a minute or two to scroll through\nSabzi Life is a big deal to us, so thanks so much for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou are probably a\nbusy person, so we want to make your time with us meaningful. We want to impact\nyour life with ideas and conversations from our years of formal and personal\nstudy in relationships and psychology. There is so much \"poser science\" out there\nwhen it comes to human interaction, and we want to show you how the real facts\ncan fit in to your everyday life and actually make your relationships\nbetter.  Through our podcast, we will\ntake complicated, hoity-toity ideas and make them something you can sink your\nteeth into!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have been creating\ncontent on YouTube for a while, but we aren\u2019t those people who follow stats and\nbuy ads. We are creators. We don\u2019t want to get bogged down by things that\ninterrupt our message. We found a free space at the public library in our city\nthat allows us to test recording equipment, and we are like two kids on the\nfirst day of summer with an ice-cream cone on the beach. Just so damn happy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a couple, we have\ndecided that we really want to be able to sustain our creative projects rather\nthan replaying the stops and starts we have had for the last 10 years as we\nstarted our family and held traditional jobs. Remember the good old days where creators were supported by\nthe community? (You know, like a couple hundred years ago, where rich dudes\nwould pay talented dudes to paint their portraits?) That\u2019s what Patreon gives\nus \u2013 people who actually love what we do giving us a little pocket-change so we\ncan keep on doing it. And what Patreon gives you is content-creators who have a\none-of-a-kind message that you care about supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to thank you for joining us on this epic\nroad trip of love, marriage, kids, and the meaning of life, and look forward to\nserving you, our patron. There may be some random stops along the way, and\nwe\u2019ll probably get caught in a blizzard every so often, but knowing you are\ntuning in will make us ignore our sleepy eyes and just keep on driving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we go, taking the leap with you through this podcast: uncensored, unscripted, and from the heart. Smile more, worry less!"
