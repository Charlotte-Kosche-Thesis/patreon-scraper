One of the ways I can do that is entertainment, though I am more multifaceted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently am not paid for anything I do, actually am unemployed because of disability related issues, but am using this time to try to contribute in a way that is valuable and meaningful to others. This isn\u0027t always easy for me, as I do struggle with things such as depression, but despite that, I refuse to give up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that I will give people something that changes their lives for the better, and if people would like to donate for such a purpose, though I used to be very stubborn about accepting help, I\u0027ve come to realize now that sometimes, support is a way of expressing something more than pity. Having needs isn\u0027t a sign of weakness; it\u0027s a sign of our humanity, and admitting it is a display of courage. \u003cbr\u003eI encourage those who are afraid to ask but need support to reach out as well. \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not alone in this."
