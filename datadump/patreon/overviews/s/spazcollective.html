    "summary": "The Semi-Permanent Autonomous Zone (aka the S.P.A.Z. collective) has been organizing radical and expansive non-commercial\u00a0artist driven\u00a0events, community spaces, art happenings, free festivals,\u00a0political actions\u00a0and more for 23 years. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, we\u0027ve also traveled extensively around the United States, Mexico, Europe, and Asia creating unique situations for people to come together and experience art, music and community in a liberated social environment and build networks focused on\u00a0cooperation and positive creative growth from\u00a0a D.I.Y. ethos. We are\u00a0equipped to transform any space into a vibrant, stimulating, living, breathing social sculpture. Our crew is made up of many\u00a0multi-talented creative individuals, with skill sets ranging from sound design and textile arts, bus mechanics and alternative energy,\u00a0radio producing\u00a0and circus arts.\u00a0A tight and focused group and at the same time a loose international network, the Semi-Permanent Autonomous\u00a0Zone is a unique experiment in alternative culture and dynamic community engagement. If you are there you are part of it, and now you can help sustain it via this website. Our operating model has been forced to change along with the increasing pressure and inhospitality\u00a0of\u00a0the city and the political climate towards underground art spaces. We have a very small minimum overhead, and being 100 percent volunteer operated, any chance to share and distribute these costs allows us to continue in the same spirit, as an open participatory adventure and a labor of love. Thanks for anything you can give; it goes incredibly far!\u003cbr\u003e"
