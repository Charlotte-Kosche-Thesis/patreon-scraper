    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome! I am Bryan SilverBaX and I am a sketch card artist as well as a freelance multi-media artist and illustrator. I have been a nerd and comic book geek since 1989 so most of my art has a heavy influence from the world of comic books. Depending on how I feel I can draw freehand or digital, it just depends on what mood I am in or what I am being paid to do. I have had my art sold on t-shirts, posters, stickers and all kinds stuff and it never gets old hearing how my art makes people happy. Please look around and see if anything here strikes your fancy. Thx for reading until the end, I hope you stick around. - Bryan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
