    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SS-Cast1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShotgunshuffle.com \u003c/strong\u003eis a webcomic I produce in an effort to offer story and character elements I find lacking in many internet offerings. While it\u0027s my first real pursuit in sequential storytelling, it\u0027s somewhat become my magnum opus. I wanted to write something I would want to read myself, and maybe fill a need seen by like-minded individuals who enjoy the medium. Shotgun Shuffle has had plenty of growing pains in its infancy, and it\u0027s come to point where financial support through Patreon is required to keep it on its feet.\u003cbr\u003eI was recently in a position where ending the comic seemed like the only reasonable absolution to the expense of running the site, as well as the time each comic takes to produce. From overwhelming support and influence from my reader base, I\u0027m here. They\u0027re the sole reason.\u003cbr\u003eAs a creator, if you can\u0027t listen to your own fans, what good are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew to the comic?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar, first and foremost: it has an ending. It\u0027s been working towards that end since the very first strip I made. The cast page alone conveys the characters already planned out for the future, and ultimate conclusion of the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Cast1.png\" style=\"width: 415px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/D52-Dheu3.png\" style=\"width: 232px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why\u0027s that so important? Because I\u0027m using this medium to take you somewhere. This isn\u0027t Peanuts. The characters age, change.. get better, get worse. You\u0027re not going to be pledging this comic another 50 years and you as a reader won\u0027t feel like water was tread the entire way. No addition is ever pointless. It\u0027s not a gag-a-day, talking heads, or copy/paste comic. It\u0027s a saga of interpersonal relationships, societal breakdown, and life\u0027s general drudgery (with a slight dose of surrealism.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Getmart-Ellie.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fast-Food-Ellie.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah about that surrealism...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tarra-comic.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms or writing, I try to marry the real and the fantasy with each story arc. Same with the lows and highs of life. Each one eventually brings its expected counterpart. I believe as people we\u0027re fairly optimistic in the end. This comic acts the same in its approach. The surreal elements I sporadically impose is an escape from the banality of life these characters would otherwise endure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomething of tremendous importance to me when making this strip is to never write the characters in absolutes. No one person is right all the time. Nor are they wrong. No one is perfect, and as a counterbalance, no one is perpetually imperfect. The greatest thing I could ever accomplish in my writing is having my readers see both sides of the argument. I can make the colors in my comic as bright and flashy as I want, but the grayer the forefront issue is, the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Juniper-Ginger-Fight.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to avoid making my cast the wallflowers of the world. That\u0027s a huge personal preference I can\u0027t stand in comics. \u00a0I try to avoid having my characters simply argue or talk through each edition. Talking about the world. Observing it. Walking in a park observing it. Sitting on a couch discussing it.\u003cbr\u003eJust need a good \"Herr Herr\" line for the last panel and we\u0027re golden, right?\u003cbr\u003eNot really my M.O.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t vie for yuk-yuk-move-along comics. None of my comics will probably ever be a Facebook pass-around \"everybody instantly gets it\" gag. I mean sure, I hope you find the comic humorous.. but that\u0027s certainly not its sole intent. This comic isn\u0027t a gaggle of deadpan snarkers in a room with each other. It\u0027s story driven. It\u0027s characters that like, love, or hate one another. Then take those feelings and act on them. One of my characters wouldn\u0027t surround themselves with another that constantly put them down. How many times have we seen that in comics? Even though I bend the rules myself, I do prefer my creations act like people.\u003cbr\u003eThere will be blood!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quinn-Ellie-Throwdown.png\" style=\"width: 611px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHard to say. It involves a grand lot. Perhaps youthful ignorance would be a good start? The majority of the cast is in their early adulthood and running out of fingers for each of their metaphorical dams. Dealing in responsibilities and obligations they\u0027re not quite conditioned for, they\u0027re learning what many of us have: As a functioning adult in everyday interactions, you\u0027re forced to be around people you may not necessarily like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes that involves family. It may even include paying the bills.. but every now and then, in results in realizing how much we actually need each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2013-11-20-What-the-Pilgrims-Ate.png\" style=\"width: 830px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eParody\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, I love me some parody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shotgunshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/90s-Cafe1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny of my regular readers would tell you it\u0027s something I take the utmost pride in. The art of the comic is something I\u0027m never quite satisfied with. Every strip has to be better than the last. I integrate gradients, transparencies, lighting, textures and colored lines as much as possible to give Shotgun Shuffle the most visually appealing presentation I can. It\u0027s a time consuming process from start to finish, but the end results hopefully speak for themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStill undecided??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetter pull out my A-game.
