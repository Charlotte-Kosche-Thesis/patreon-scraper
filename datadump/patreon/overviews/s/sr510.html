So probably you don\u0027t. I\u0027m not actually very good at this stuff, but I\u0027m hoping to get better. Perhaps the \u003cstrong\u003eawesome power of crowdfunding \u003c/strong\u003ewill help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould you decide to back me, you will receive the warm glow of satisfaction that comes from knowing that you have provided encouragement to a fledgling musician, and also knowing that you have helped encourage all the other artists that I\u00a0back on Patreon. Also, you\u0027ll get access to my videos a day before everybody else! Well, a few hours before most other people. Except when I\u0027m impatient or a video is particularly time-sensitive. Look, let\u0027s focus on the encouragement here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI posted one paid video in 2015, three in 2016, and two in 2017. My goal is to post one a month in 2018.\u00a0(In my \u003cem\u003ewildest imaginings, \u003c/em\u003eI don\u0027t see myself ever posting more than one a week.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that while your pledge is per creation, you can set a monthly cap on what you\u0027re willing to pay, in case I start going out of control and posting way too many songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(As matters currently stand, patrons are charged for my original songs. They\u0027re also charged for covers of songs in the public domain. In theory, I would also bill for covers of original songs for which there\u0027s a Creative Commons license allowing commercial use, and songs for which I have gotten permission from the songwriter/rightsholder, but in practice neither has happened yet. Otherwise, I make no profit on covers of copyrighted songs. Please don\u0027t sue.)\u003cbr\u003e"
