    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDear Travelers,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNovember 1, 2013, was the day Basketball Passport was born. The concept was simple: keep track of the games you go to, and get a wide array of game-going stats in return. \"Your games, your journey, your Passport.\" We launched the site on the first day of the 2013-14 NBA season, and I went on an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkpdAThTsfU\"\u003eunforgettable tour\u003c/a\u003e of all 29 NBA arenas in 30 days to promote it. We added baseball in 2014, then football and hockey, and finally MLS soccer in 2016 once we consolidated as \"\u003ca href=\"https://sportspassport.com\"\u003eSports Passport\u003c/a\u003e\". It\u0027s hard to believe that four years have gone by already.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been unbelievably lucky to have had a Fortune 100 company as a partner for these past two years, but going forward we will no longer be Sports Passport Presented by New York Life. Our recent growth and expansion would have been impossible without their help, especially our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sports-passport/id1179149006?mt=8\"\u003eiOS app\u003c/a\u003e. We\u0027ll always be grateful that NYL provided us with a solid foundation for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for future independent sustainability in 2018 and beyond, we\u0027ve made the decision to switch Sports Passport to the Patreon membership platform. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I promised you back in 2013, our core functionality will always be free. We\u0027ll never, ever hold your check-ins for ransom. As you\u0027re no doubt aware, many of the online services you use keep themselves free by making \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e the product -- vending out your site usage data to the advertisers with the highest bids. We value your loyalty too much to sell you out like that. So we\u0027re attempting to strike a balance: maintaining our existing services and letting you have direct involvement in Passport\u0027s future direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge levels start at just $2 per month. We\u0027re offering great rewards that include special members-only content, custom supporter stamps, and page sponsorships. Give more, and you can have your Sports Passport avatar and game-going stats immortalized on a real baseball card or Cooperstown-style Hall of Fame plaque. (!) We\u2019ve also set up community-wide funding goals that will unlock new Passport technology, from re-installing rapid bulk checkins all the way up to an app for Android.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m thrilled about the future of our website and app, and I hope you are too. No matter what our next four years have in store, I know this for sure: it will always be your games, your journey and your Passport. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours in sports,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeter Robert Casey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCo-founder,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://sportspassport.com\"\u003eSports Passport\u003c/a\u003e"
