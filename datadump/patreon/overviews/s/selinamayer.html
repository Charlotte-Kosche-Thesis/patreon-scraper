    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eNew for 2018: Year of Books\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s right,\u00a02018 on patreon will be my YEAR OF BOOKS, i.e. my challenge to myself next year will be to create a new art book every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Book of Days project\u00a0 (my project for 2017) has been brilliant for me as a place to play and experiment and try new things, but the biggest draw back I\u0027ve found is that I haven\u0027t been developing any of these ideas, or incorporating them into my other work, which has left the whole project feeling very removed from everything else I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aim of the Year of Books is that I will have a whole month to develop a book idea from start to finish, and each book will have something that sets it apart from all the others, whether that be subject matter, technique or medium used. This (I hope) will keep me experimenting, but allow me to focus on one element for a set period of time, rather than jumping from idea to idea and never developing anything very far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I know that a lot of you guys have been really digging seeing these early stage ideas via Book of Days, so in place of posting a page daily I\u0027ll be posting my progress on the developing books over the course of the month, whether this be sketches, notes, prints, whatever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you guys are as excited about this as I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell hello there! My name\u0027s Selina Mayer, and I\u0027m a London (UK) based film photographer, visual artist, book-maker, self-portraitist and certified cat lady. I take lots of pictures of naked people, including myself, but I think (I hope!) that\u0027s not the only appeal of my images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShooting on film can get expensive, and although I\u0027ve been able to support my film-habit with my income from my day job thus far, I\u0027ve been wanting to expand my horizons and push my creativity for a while now and have found myself limited by lack of funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron not only will you gain access to exclusive content such as behind the scenes shots, previews of new work and hand-made prints posted to you anywhere in the world, you will be helping me push my artwork down new pathways I\u0027ve been itching to get started down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging you will enable me to experiment more with my print-making, add to my equipment (I\u0027ve been using the same camera with the same lens for portraits \u0026amp; nudes for nearly 5 years), make more prints, make more books, and start working with moving image again. You\u0027ll also be keeping me stocked up with film, chemicals and paper so that I can keep creating. Hell, if enough people pledge I may be able to reduce my hours at my day job to give myself more time to devote to creating (and if that happened I would be absolutely over-the-moon gibbering ecstatic!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make this a place to share things I don\u0027t want to put elsewhere; new projects, early ideas, experiments, and work that\u0027s more intimate and personal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been looking for a platform where I can interact more with the wonderful people who support me, and give more of an insight into my working processes and what goes on behind the scenes, and it\u0027s my hope that Patreon is the place to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I don\u0027t even cover my costs with the erratic income I occasionally make from my photography, so every pledge (no matter how small) will help A LOT and will directly go into the production of new work. And you will have my eternal, ever burning, thanks and gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading (if you made it this far!), you\u0027re the best!"
