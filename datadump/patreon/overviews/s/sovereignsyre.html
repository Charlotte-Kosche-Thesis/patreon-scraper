target=\"_blank\"\u003eOBSERVATIONS with Sovereign Syre\u003c/a\u003e podcast.\u00a0 A lot of you have been long time listeners and you know my story well.\u00a0 This podcast has documented, unwittingly, my transition from adult performer to stand up comedian and writer, and you guys have been there all along sending messages of support and love. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrequently people will ask how they can give me some kind of financial show of support because you couldn\u0027t come to see me at shows and I don\u0027t see any residual profits from my movies.\u00a0 That\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u00a0 For those that have been wanting to contribute in some way, now you can!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you support this Patreon, you\u0027re not just supporting the podcast.\u00a0 You\u0027re supporting me as a creative artist.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs podcasting inexpensive?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e The short answer is yes.\u00a0 That\u0027s why so far its the only thing I\u0027ve been producing.\u00a0 I don\u0027t have the funding to do the other projects I\u0027d like to (I\u0027ll circle back to that later).\u00a0 Podcasts are time intensive though.\u00a0 The time spent editing, scheduling, driving here and there, and holy jesus the amount of time you have to spend uploading, linking promoting, cross-promoting.\u00a0 It\u0027s exhausting.\u00a0 But I love it, so I\u0027m gonna keep doing it.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027d like to talk to you about my dreams.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWEB SERIES\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago I was tapped to create a web series for Wisecrack about history.\u00a0 I came up with the idea for Boss Bitches of History where I and Ela Darling created humorous profiles of lesser known female figures throughout time.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\"

allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1qOUaWG-4Gk\" width=\"854\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistory professors and the comedy focused blogs loved the show, but Wisecrack\u0027s audience didn\u0027t respond well to the show.\u00a0 I WAS CRUSHED!\u00a0\u00a0Every time I get an email or a tweet from a history professor or a new fan asking about the show I get a little ping in my heart because I have always wanted to get back into the format.\u00a0 I loved it.\u00a0 I don\u0027t want to redo the show.\u00a0 Firstly, I sold the idea, so I can\u0027t, but secondly, it wasn\u0027t a perfect idea and it wasn\u0027t perfectly executed.\u00a0 It was a big writer\u0027s room and a shared vision.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to create my own web series: DO IT BETTER.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDO IT BETTER \u003c/strong\u003ewould follow me as I interview various people about how to do just about everything better, from overthrowing the government to changing a tire.\u00a0 This would be a humorous, scripted show, that would see me talking to professors, veterans, comedians, my parents, porn stars, and just about anyone else that is good at something and nearly everyone is.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine Philomena Cunk\u0027s Moments of Wonder...\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\"

They had a camera crew (light, camera, sound) various locations, graphics, and studio space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, the more money coming in, the more I can invest in the episodes to make them amazing.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to produce a web series like this allows me to build on my writing skills, expose me to a wider audience and also gives me something tangible that I can show people when I go out there looking to get staffed on television show like GLOW or something, or maybe become the next Samantha Bee or Charlie Brooker.\u00a0 I\u0027d love to find myself in such a position someday.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOMEDY:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt takes a comedian a long time to develop.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e You start out doing open mics, and if you\u0027re Maria Bamford, you still go to them.\u00a0 In Los Angeles you can go to three a night and get three minutes at each one.\u00a0 You drive 30 minutes, put your name in a bucket, wait two hours for your turn, do three minutes of stage time and head out to the next one.\u00a0 It takes a lot of time.\u00a0 Another reason not having to take side jobs is so essential.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of comedians in Los Angeles and not much stage time.\u00a0 There\u0027s also a slick divide between people coming up and professionals, most of whom have been on Conan and have a sitcom or a Netflix special who are going to get put on a bill before you for name recognition.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo get good you have to go to New York City\u003c/strong\u003e where there is abundant stage time and fewer comics famous for being on TV.\u00a0 I fly there every few months to stay for a week and get as much stage time as I can.\u00a0 There I can do ten to fifteen minutes sets three times a night.\u00a0 That kind of stage time is infuckingvaluable.\u00a0 I\u0027d love to go every month if I could.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost of air fare is about 400 bucks.\u00a0 I stay with friends and spend frugally while I\u0027m there, but Uber, the subway, and sustenance runs another 200 or so.\u00a0 So that\u0027s 600 bucks a month.\u00a0 I\u0027m fine going every few months now, but wow, I\u0027d get stronger faster if I could go more frequently.\u00a0 Help me get my million air miles and vibrate into the singularity.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you guys so much and can\u0027t tell you how grateful I am for all the support, acceptance and encouragement I\u0027ve received from you.\u00a0 OBSERVATIONS is not only full of conversations with comedians, writers, directors and musicians, it\u0027s also about me.\u00a0 I put a lot of myself out there over the last two years and the fact that so many of you have come on this journey with me, and continue to support me as I move into the next phase of my life, means the world to me.\u00a0 I couldn\u0027t have better company.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what you give, I\u0027m so glad to have you on my side.\u00a0
