    "summary": "We\u0027ve been making noise at Carolina Hurricanes games since the very first puck dropped in Raleigh. Since 2011, we\u0027ve brought that noise, passion for hockey, and all the snark a growing body needs to both Twitter and Section328.com. Starting in 2013, Cheaters Never Win is the longest running Carolina Hurricanes-focused podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach hockey season, we bring you roughly one hour of discussion every week. We do our best to feature great guests like Puck Daddy\u0027s own Greg Wyshynski, Jen Neale, and Sean Leahy; Jeff Marek, Scott Darling, Brock McGinn, Jeff O\u0027Neill, Ray Whitney, Noah FREAKIN\u0027 Hanifin, Patrick O\u0027Sullivan, Mike Maniscalco, and of course, our annual offseason chat with John Forslund.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love recording Cheaters Never win, however, it\u0027s not cheap. Audio equipment and hosting costs can certainly add up. This is why we\u0027re asking you, our loyal listeners and fans, for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love Cheaters Never Win, appreciate our work on Twitter, like reading our blog, or just have some spare money lying around the house that you simply don\u0027t know what to do with it, please consider supporting Section 328. A pledge of even $1 every month helps us continue to bring you new episodes of Cheaters Never Win on a regular basis as well as allows us to support increasingly great Canes coverage at Section328.com."
