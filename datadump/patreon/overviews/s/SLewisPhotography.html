In Europe, kings, queens, the aristocracy and members of the Royal Court were often patron of the arts, providing artists, musicians, poets, sculptors, and other such talented individuals, with financial support in exchange for the prestige these donations often granted them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes the name Henry Wriothesley sound familiar? To some it may not, but he was the Earl of Southampton and the most famous patron of William Shakespeare. That means without his contributions and patronage we wouldn\u0027t have some of the greatest pieces in literature history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a place where you can be a \u003cem\u003epatron\u003c/em\u003e to me, if you believe in me and my work.\u003cbr\u003eThis is for those of you who would like to support creators like me who consistently create stuff that you want to see more of. Your much-needed help will allow me to create images on a consistent basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/17211964_10158265452990034_5036359867934055054_o.jpg?oh=b9a60e352b5e90eb03b78b8878ec2fc5\u0026amp;oe=5A755402\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY BE A PATRON? \u003cem\u003eBecause you REALLY enjoy viewing what I\u0027ve already created, and believe in what I will create in the future. You recognize the sacrifice and hard work put into my images, and understand that it\u0027s an uphill struggle to be a self-sustaining artist in this day and age. You pay to see movies, right? Well, this is the same thing- only its photos.\u003c/em\u003e"
