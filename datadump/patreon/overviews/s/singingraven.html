I am a member of Vaudezilla Productions and \nhave been performing burlesque on a weekly basis for 7+ years.  I\u0027ve \nappeared onstage in 9 states (including Alaska!) and in numerous \nnational burlesque festivals.  I gravitate toward projects and \ncollaborations with artists who have a strong vintage aesthetic.  \nAdditionally, I am a very experienced artist\u0027s model, posing for 60+ art\n classes annually.  I own and maintain an extensive collection of \nvintage clothing ranging from the 1920\u0027s-1970\u0027s, as well as a wardrobe \nof self-constructed reproduction vintage-style clothing.  I have \nbachelors\u0027 degrees in both theatre and fashion design and use both skill\n sets to further my commitment to aesthetic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWHAT DO I DO?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nI make the majority of my costumes, and figure out the most innovative ways to take them off in front of an audience. I spent 2016-17 returning to school for a degree in fashion design, inspired by my need to make even\ncooler/more elaborate costumes for me and my fellow performers. I\u2019m obsessed with quality and detail. I\u0027m always trying out new techniques. In addition to creating and performing burlesque acts, I also use my skills and commitment to vintage aesthetics to collaborate with photographers in Chicago and beyond.\u00a0 I have been published in various publications, as well as producing work for my own vintage lifestyle/fashion blog, \u003cem\u003eRevisionist Vintage.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"427\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/604/31933730924_227b7f594c_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCredit withheld at the request of the Photographer\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(141, 179, 226);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWHY ON EARTH DO I NEED YOUR HELP?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI work.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0 I derive about 70% of my income solely from modeling for art classes.\u00a0 But I would need to model for approximately 20 sessions a month to generate a consistent, livable income.\u00a0 Spoiler alert:\u00a0 Even if I could find 20 sessions to work over the course of a month, 60-80 hours of immobile stillness is *brutal*.\u00a0 I balance this out with burlesque performance and costuming, but a completely freelance lifestyle can sometimes be unpredictable.\u00a0 That\u0027s where you come in!\u00a0 Creating a more stable situation for myself means having more time to concentrate on creating work, costuming new acts, and reaching out to new photographers and artists, and less time fretting over the rent.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"1024\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/820/39207940470_5a55076521_b.jpg\" width=\"680\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePhoto (C) Michael Cabrera\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET FROM BECOMING A PATRON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nPhotos!\u00a0 Some glamorous and cheesecake, and some NSFW and... \"artsy\".\u00a0 I\u2019ve been amassing a vast\ncollection of photos since I started modeling in 2009.
