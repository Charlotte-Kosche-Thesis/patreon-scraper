Writing and meditation have both been practices that have grounded me over the years, through challenging personal times as well as challenging societal times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strongly believe that each mala that I create is made for a specific person and that they find their way to one another at just the right moment. I also believe in the power of words to heal and to help us grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful for the Patreon community which offers creators a space where we can share our work and get paid for the love, time, and energy that we pour into all that we do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons are my inspiration, in both my mala creation and my writing. Nothing any of us do happens in a vacuum, and I am thankful for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you allow me to continue to purchase quality beads for the malas and to be able to keep a steady flow of new items coming to the shop. You also give me the opportunity to publish some writing projects that are in the works so I can share those words with you and the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become one of my patrons, you get access to my patron-only feed, first access to new items, behind-the-scenes videos of my creation process, and more! \u003cbr\u003e"
