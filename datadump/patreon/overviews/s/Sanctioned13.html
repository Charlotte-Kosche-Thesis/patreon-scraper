    "summary": "-:Why I\u0027m Here:-\u003cbr\u003eI want to make furry games and with in addition to those furry games I\u0027d also like to learn how to make furry art, the thing is while still being fairly new to several coding languages and furry art, this will take time. But hopefully these projects will yield results and be a learning experience for not just me but for you as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-:Why You Should Patron:-\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I do enjoy this I lead a busy life as a student and waiter/bartender so any tips or money is greatly appreciated and will keep me more then motivated. And of course if I make enough off this a month I can stop my second job and give more time into art, game mechanics, story and much much more. Plus there\u0027s awesome rewards, :D!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-:Keep In Mind:-\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind Patreon is foremost a site to support your favorite creators and if you decide to support me please have that mentality when and if you do, thank you, :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-:Info On Uploads And Rewards:-\u003cbr\u003eUpdates \u0026amp; Rewards(Please Read!)\u003cbr\u003eUpdates, rewards and votes are a week or two after the start of every month(after all patrons are processed), rewards will be delivered to all Processed patrons at the start of the month, processing takes a few days so please be patient(anywhere between the 7th and the 14th of each month give or take a few days). To be added to the reward roster you need to patron that month then receive your rewards within the first two weeks of the following month. So say you patron $5+, January, your patronage will be registered and processed at the start of the following month (February), after the processing is completed (somewhere in the two weeks after the start of the month) updates will go up and on the same day rewards will be given to those processed patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-:Where Can I See Your Stuff?:-\u003cbr\u003e(Any of these sites, enjoy, :3):\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://e621.net/user/show/18694\"\u003ehttps://e621.net/user/show/18694\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sanctioned13/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/sanctioned13/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sanct13.deviantart.com\"\u003ehttp://sanct13.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Sanct13\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Sanct13\u003c/a\u003e (still fairly new to twitter, so other than the odd upload here and there not too much, :3)\u003cbr\u003e"
