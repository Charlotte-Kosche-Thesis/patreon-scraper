First founded in 2005, Starlight Academy started from a small group of teenagers who could barely write to becoming a home for writers from all different walks of life and creative inspirations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs Starlight Academy has grown, so has the costs of upkeep.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThough I love Starlight Academy and will always aim to keep it going, it\u0027s difficult to afford the costs of all things combined. I\u0027m both disabled and unemployed, so Starlight Academy is what I would consider my full time job. A lot of work goes into Starlight, and I find it rewarding to help offer a place for people to pursue their writing dreams.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI usually work on programming the back end, building the world of the Manta Carlos Islands, and making concept art to help build the site.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat all aside, most importantly I keep Starlight Academy running and functioning, which is certainly a full time job.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo where does Patreon fit in?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs it is right now, I would love to expand on Starlight Academy more. Right now, we are developing our own chat software, and someday we even hope to build a mobile app. I have projects in store for Starlight Academy that will take years to implement, and all of this takes hard work and long hours.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to use this Patreon to fund our basic annual fees, but I also want to use whatever I can to build the site even more. Any funds that exceed our annual fees would go into creating assets, software, and adding more to the world that we are building.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tPerks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eOver time, if you\u0027ve cumulatively donated, you will also get perks. For example, you may receive sketches, artwork, personal theme tweaks, and even the option of requesting a special all-new theme to your liking! Perks are cumulative, which means that you can gradually accomplish a perk. For example, you could donate $10 a month, and in three months you will have reached the $30 perk! Once you reach the perk goal, just let Kyros know.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e$15 -\u003c/strong\u003e A complete sketch of your character (1) by Kyros!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e$40 - \u003c/strong\u003eA full colored artwork of your character (1) by Kyros!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e$75 - \u003c/strong\u003eA tweaked current theme to your own liking!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e$150 - \u003c/strong\u003eAn all-new theme by your design!\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAside from getting cool personal stuff, Patreon subscribers also get to take a look behind the scenes and get a first look at everything new that\u0027s coming to SA.\u00a0Subscribers will get access to all the progress of what I work on, getting insights to new skins and features and artwork before they\u0027re shown to the public. You would also receive a Donation badge, as well as a Subscriber badge for as long as you subscribe to our Patreon.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStarlight Academy is growing every day, and its all thanks to you guys. Thank you for supporting Starlight Academy, and supporting me in my dream to make this the best place it possibly can be.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e"
