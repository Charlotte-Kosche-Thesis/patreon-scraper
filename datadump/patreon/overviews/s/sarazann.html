Donate, watch, read and post, some money or none - it\u0027s your support that brings me to create the next thing. Here\u0027s a big THANK YOU for caring about my little world. Peace be with on your travels. :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You! I am so grateful for the vast amount of creativity and difficult dreams conquered through this remarkable network of Patreon support. Come on a journey with me and we can create some beautiful art together :)\u003cbr\u003eMarch of 2008 I picked up a pencil for the first time and drew my very first comic on printer paper with smart mouthed stick figures. Later that week at dinner, I sold a copy of that comic for 50 cents to our waiter. That was my Aha! moment. I knew for the rest of my life this is what I was going to do - Draw! I have pursued this with a childlike fervor ever since. It would take the birth of my spectacular little girl to bring such clarity to my mind again. (I adore those moments in life)\u003cbr\u003eMy Caleb gave me\u00a0the amazing opportunity to stay at home and raise our daughter. In my effort to be a super mom, I am working to figure out how to be here for her and still create a comic empire. This seems like the most perfect solution. Welcome to Smiles by Sarazann. I hope you enjoy the ride and I send deep thanks to you for letting me be part of your story. Keep Smiling and Be Excellent to Each Other!"
