    "summary": "NOTE-- in the video I mention being unemployed. I currently have part-time work and a little bit of income. But as far as any kind of actual industry job, salaried income, etc, everything is the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved talking about movies and introducing people to films that I love and films that have influenced me. Film history and film analysis are fascinating to me and there\u0027s no reason for there to be any barrier to entry for anyone to learn about and appreciate them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially the central series to this channel was S\u003cem\u003eO YOU WANNA BE A FILM NERD\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s an introductory-level series that\u0027s a blend of film history and film academia with a focus on accessibility and anti-elitism. I was very active in film clubs in college and while I was always honest about my opinions and could go toe-to-toe with anybody on film discussion, I was aware that being closed-minded or being a snob would discourage some great people from getting involved. The series carries over that mindset and synthesizes all of the stuff I learned both in film school and on my own into quick, dense episodes that cover broad topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter focusing on that for a while I decided to branch off and cover wider topics, like horror theory and parasocial relationships. I am still focusing overall on having the same tone of anti-elitism and accessibility but with a wider scope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s the point of making an accessible series if people have to pay for it? I want my work to reach as many people as possible and have little to no barrier to entry. At the same time, the more work I put into my channel, the less time I have to work and pay rent, pay for food, etc. My focus is on financial support that will allow me more time to research and work on my videos. Editing itself is a time-consuming process. On top of that I would love to have time for reading and watching as much as I can to make sure I don\u0027t leave out any pertinent information (I love learning about film/media so it\u0027s a win-win for me!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ability to expand is limited by my time, which is limited by my money. The more I can make through avenues like Patreon, the more I can expand and reach my potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayment is per video, not per month. If I don\u0027t produce any content, you don\u0027t have to pay me anything. You can also limit how much you donate per month regardless of how many videos I produce. Any amount is appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!"
