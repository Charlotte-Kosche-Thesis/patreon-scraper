I create anime art and vary the subject matter up with tutorials, critiques, and the art itself. As time goes on, I want to strive for a lot of other things, but most notably digital artwork and animation. Making this Patreon marks my effort to start varying up my content and post things like artwork tutorials, videos, and side content. I\u0027m also looking into posting piano and singing videos, culinary videos, and gaming videos. As time goes on, I hope to find enough time to adopt that kind of content into a regular schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(157, 157, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are my goals?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m currently a student at SCAD and I\u0027m struggling to find time to draw with my current job robbing me of most of my time, leaving me exhausted and demotivated when I have time at home. Gaining more commissions and supporters online will always generally help me have more time to myself so I can focus on making the content I love making. It also gives me the resources to purchase better equipment (most notably a new tablet, a better GPU, better internet for higher quality streams, an actual XLR microphone and audio interface for better video and streaming content, and of course, my education).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(157, 157, 255);\"\u003eWhat kind of art do I make?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very fond of a slight mixture of anime styles and rough, sculpture like painting techniques. A lot of the art I\u0027m inspired by tends to be more pastel and scrapbook like and falls somewhere between \"it\u0027s so cute, I\u0027m going to die\" and \"oh my god, look at those effects that I\u0027ll never be able to make.\" Compare, say, Yamio to Android Jones and you have a general idea of the art I aspire to make someday. Behind all that gooey inspiration, I\u0027ve consistently enjoyed studying and practicing more versatile and comprehensive artwork fundamentals, ranging from value and form to the interpretive and subjective side of art and identifying with your own work. I\u0027ve also just broken past NSFW and into Hentai - something I\u0027m in the experimental stage of. - I see it as a supremely foreign subject matter that requires me to push all shame out of my mind: \"just draw the forms and tissues on the body in this scene.\" It\u0027s in an effort to vary my audience, and it empowers me to be more free with figure drawing tutorials since I believe it\u0027s crucial to be able to draw the naked body before you can draw clothes on top of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(157, 157, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are you paying for?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing a new, young Patreon page, I don\u0027t see it fit to segregate tiers of supporters. You either pledge or you don\u0027t. If you choose to graciously support me at all, you\u0027ll get access to every reward I have to offer: open PSD\u0027s of my work, any and all posts I make, including NSFW images, invitations to my Discord page to discuss art and critique stuff, and a chance to win my monthly art raffle and get free artwork (click this link to see the full list of raffle rules: http://bit.ly/2hzR5VJ ). You also pay for the time I don\u0027t have to spend at my job, meaning you\u0027re empowering me to make videos, interact, and upload more frequently.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s all I have to say here. If you want to hear more from me, be sure to drop by my stream at picarto.tv/sardrellas or take a look at my YouTube channel. I\u0027m just getting back into video editing, so it might be a bit until I get some more videos up there.\u003cbr\u003e"
