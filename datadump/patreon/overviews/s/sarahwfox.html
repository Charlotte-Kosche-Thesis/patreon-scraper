    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHi Everyone! Welcome to My Patreon!\u003c/h2\u003e\n I am a Professional Artist, Makeup Artist and Web \u0026amp; Graphic Designer. I am also an Entertainer, and have been doing so professionally since I was 4 years old, from singing to modeling to acting, to now having my own You Tube Channel that is just starting to grow in audience and subscribers. A HUGE THANK AS WELL TO ALL OF MY PATRONS SUPPORTING ME! IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe purpose of this Patreon campaign is simple - to raise money to be put back into my channel and to create a more direct relationship between myself, and to YOU... my viewers. I want to have more interaction with viewers, on You Tube, via Live Streams and to show outtakes and videos and previews of upcoming videos that only YOU patrons will see! I also want to put out higher quality videos, and upgrade my equipment as I currently use my Iphone to record content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSo a little more about me...\u003c/h3\u003e\nI am a single parent of two amazing children, with a huge college debt, as I have 5 years of college behind me, and have been lately embarking on a new career as a Web \u0026amp; Graphic Designer, and just stumbled into the You Tube Community when a video of mine made purely for fun, called \"My Banana Trick\", was being shared around by cyber bullies, that seemed to kick start this video to going viral... and I have been making videos to my channel since then that are similar banana tricks or challenges. I also do makeup up tutorials- usually character, cosplay, fantasy or horror makeup and special effects. I also upload other entertaining content where I can explore my creativity and my attempt at humour.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have decided to focus on putting out MORE and HIGHER quality content on my You Tube Channel, as working a 9-5 job right now is not possible, mainly due to caring for my son who has autism and being a single parent. Having a schedule that is flexible allows me to work around my sons needs, my responsibilities as a parent, and allows me to make creative content for my You Tube Channel... and still work in my career as a Freelance \u00a0Artist and Web \u0026amp; Graphic Designer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTHIS IS WHY I HAVE SET UP A PATREON ACCOUNT.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWHY SUPPORT MY PATREON? I will discuss topics and content for my channel, with my Patrons FIRST, and as direct supporters of the content being created, you\u0027ll have a say in what comes next. Through the Patron-only feed, we\u0027ll discuss upcoming ideas and I\u0027ll take all your feedback into consideration. Depending on you contribution as a Patron, you can have a say in my topics and content, vote on topics and content... AND have shout outs during or as credits in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you SO much for your support this far, and I look forward to embarking on this new journey, and hope to see YOU come along on the ride with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTo Donate to My Paypal:\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003ehttp://www/paypal.me/sarahwfox"
