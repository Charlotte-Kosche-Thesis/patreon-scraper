With Scicomm Monday, you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"281\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4193/34520204876_2086559397.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my weekly live stream broadcast,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/ScicommMonday/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScicomm Monday\u003c/a\u003e, I share the amazing science and outreach of my fellow scientists and science communicators. Each week I have guests from all over the world share their science and science communication (scicomm) with the Scicomm Monday audience. Other scientists/scicommers have Twitter/Facebook accounts, blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, etc., but Scicomm Monday is the only weekly scicomm live streaming broadcast that fosters live audience participation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"281\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4181/34520406386_50af097e42.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the power of Periscope, audience members can actively engage with the broadcast participants, by asking questions live on air. While the bread-\u0026amp;-butter of Scicomm Monday is the in-studio remote interview with our guests, we also broadcast live from various locations with interviewees and we get our boots dirty through our #FieldworkLive series, where the audience can see science research as it happens live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"291\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4183/34561633185_16dd27c36b.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal for Scicomm Monday is to help facilitate discussion on science topics both between fellow scientists and between scientists and non-scientists, while making it fun for all involved. By fostering a relaxed environment, the audience is excited to ask questions and help drive the direction of the broadcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy future goals for the broadcast are to be able to crowd-source the entire Scicomm Monday budget, so any scientist, scicommer, university, agency, or organization can have Scicomm Monday come out for in-person interviews and #FieldworkLive broadcasts at no cost to them and so I can continue to devote the time and equipment to making a quality broadcast for both the audience and the guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Follow along on Twitter (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ScicommMonday\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@ScicommMonday\u003c/a\u003e) for updates on upcoming broadcasts.
