     "about": "Currently living in Greenville, North Carolina, Shawn Durington grew up in Portsmouth, Virginia where he enjoyed doodling and scribbling whenever he should have been paying attention in class. During his Sophomore year of high school he had to make a tough decision art school or clown college and eventually made the decision of both and decided to go to school for teaching and art. I mean, the best teachers of all are clowns, am I right? He received his undergraduate degrees from East Carolina University: a Bachelor\u2019s in Fine Arts Art Education and a Bachelor\u2019s in Fine Art Studio Art where he studied Printmaking and Textiles. After teaching for four years he decided to return to school at Academy of Arts University where he received his Master\u2019s in Fine Arts in Animation and Visual Effects in the area of Visual Development.",
