    "summary": "Hi there... I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelstevendoran/\"\u003eMichael\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have over 15 years of corporate experience working at companies that range from startups to the Fortune 500 (including Google, Dropbox, Nokia, Allstate, and Grainger).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have interviewed tens of thousands of people around the world for a large variety of jobs. and I have learned the secrets to how companies select and hire people. I\u0027ve also learned from those people not only how they got where they are, but what they are doing to get ahead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now at the point where as I build out my consulting company I see an opportunity to give my company some stability while I also help people achieve their career goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I hope to help people at any stage of their career identify what their career goals are, and what is needed to get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not new to this. I have been doing this informally with people I have encountered throughout my life. Here are two of their stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI met\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesthamm/\"\u003eCharles\u003c/a\u003e when he was about to get out of the US Army. His last job in was as a recruiter, and he had really enjoyed it.\u00a0 People around him were discouraging about pursuing recruiting as a career and he wanted to discuss it with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI normally give people who reach out to me about a recruiting career a 30 min summary of information and I give them the option of doing some homework, and then following back up with me in a week. I\u0027d say 95% of people never follow up. Charles did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI helped Charles navigate his first few civilian recruiting positions to get enough experience to begin contract recruiting. Through about 40 hours of time over 4 years, and using my recruiting systems and tools he was able to get noticed while on contract at Fed Ex and was converted (he was one of the earliest experienced contractor\u0027s ever converted there which required executive approval). Charles did the hard work, my advice and guidance helped focus and accelerate his career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI met\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/shark-tank-investor-chris-sacca-calls-slik-cofounder-stefan-stokic-pure-hustle-2016-12\"\u003eStefan\u003c/a\u003e through a previous failed startup. He asked me how to get the attention of Chris Sacca and Matt Mazzeo. I spent some time with him giving him ideas, and a framework on how to communicate. Using these strategies he was able to get on their radar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hosted Stefan and his friend\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SoroushG_\"\u003eSoroush\u003c/a\u003e for lunch at Dropbox when they were in San Francisco last year. They became the two youngest founders ever admitted into Y-Combinator, and are a good example of how having the right information, and the right time can have a tremendous effect.\u003cbr\u003e"
