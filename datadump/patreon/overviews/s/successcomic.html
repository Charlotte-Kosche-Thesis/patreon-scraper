    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, everyone! If you\u0027re here, you probably already know who I am and what I do. My name is Michael Johnson. I\u0027m a singer/songwriter/composer who has dedicated much of my life to a musical act called Reclinerland. You may or may not know that since I started Reclinerland in 1997, I have released seven albums and toured in Portland, Oregon, England, and all over the U.S., sharing bills with many talented people. I\u0027ve performed at notable venues such as Berbatti\u0027s Pan and the Roseland Theater in Portland, OR, the Moore Theater, the Crocodile, and the Sunset Tavern in Seattle, CBGB\u0027s and the Living Room in New York City, The Whisky A Go-Go in LA, the Garage and the 12-Bar Club in London, the Grog Shop in Cleveland, and The Make Out Room in San Francisco, among others.\u00a0I\u0027ve also recorded two albums as the singer/songwriter and orchestral arranger for the band Parks \u0026amp; Recreation. If you want more detailed information on what I\u0027ve been doing with Reclinerland, you can click here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.reclinerlandhq.com.\"\u003ewww.reclinerlandhq.com.\u003c/a\u003e For Parks \u0026amp; Recreation, click here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.parksandrecreationhq.com\"\u003ewww.parksandrecreationhq.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know me at all, I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here. I hope that if you decide to become a patron, we can get better acquainted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me get straight to the point. I created \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003efor two reasons. First,\u00a0I strongly believe that comics and graphic novels are among the most powerful storytelling art forms. Not only that, but I believe that musical theater (including Opera, Operetta, etc.) is the highest form of artistic expression a songwriter can attempt. As far as I know, \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003eis not only \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e first attempt to fuse printed music with sequential art, but it\u0027s the first ever. Many artists have used printed music in their art, many musicians are also visual artists, and many visual artists have created printed music, but--and please correct me if I\u0027m wrong--I haven\u0027t seen anyone bring the two together in quite this way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I believe that music is for everyone. Music, as a language, can be spoken by anyone, not just a talented few individuals. Anyone can learn music. Written notes need not be frightening, or daunting. Musical notation can be as wonderful to look at and to comprehend for the musically uninitiated as it can be for the musical expert. I believe that every human being can and ought to speak music as their second language. I hope that in some small way, \u003cem\u003eSuccess!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0will contribute to making music more accessible to the world. I hope it increases my readers\u0027 appreciation of the beauty not only of musical sounds, but also of musical notation. I\u0027m so glad you are considering joining me on this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe story so far...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy journey toward\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003ebegan in 2008, when I took a hiatus from writing 3-minute songs to write my first musical play. \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003eemerged as a modern-day revenge comedy about the stormy relationship between two mismatched adoptive brothers--Nicholas, a gorgeous, vain, effeminate social climber and his brother Gregory, a slovenly, self-conscious, suicidal, struggling painter. The play chronicles their exchange of status as one slips away from, and the other towards, success. The story is loosely based on the novel by the same name by Martin Amis, an author I very much admire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being a musician, since I was 10-years-old I\u0027ve acted in plays and films. Throughout my childhood and into my twenties, I acted in plays with companies in the San Francisco Bay Area; Orange County, CA; Eugene, Oregon; and New York City. I played roles such as Fortinbras in \u003cem\u003eFortinbras, \u003c/em\u003eHorace in \u003cem\u003eThe Little Foxes, \u003c/em\u003eOrsinio in \u003cem\u003eTwelfth Night, \u003c/em\u003eRosencrantz in \u003cem\u003eHamlet, \u003c/em\u003eGeorge in \u003cem\u003eThe Actor\u0027s Nightmare, \u003c/em\u003eCharlie in \u003cem\u003eWhat I Did Last Summer, \u003c/em\u003eand George in \u003cem\u003eOur Town. \u003c/em\u003eIn 2004, a short film I did with Grammar School Pictures called \u003cem\u003eThis Song, \u003c/em\u003ein which I played a hipster version of myself, won a prize at the 48-Hour Film Festival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to acting and music, I\u0027ve\u00a0always loved drawing cartoons. I\u0027ve drawn illustrated cards for my family members, been paid to illustrate theater posters, and I\u0027ve even designed a set for a local theater company. Cartooning has always been a huge part of my life. Bill Waterson, Berkeley Breathed,\u00a0Sergio Aragones, and Phil Foglio remain some\u00a0of my biggest inspirations in the art of cartooning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got the idea to make a comic musical about six years ago, after looking at a copy of the \u003cem\u003eSports \u0026amp; Divertissiments \u003c/em\u003eby Erik Satie, in which Satie\u0027s hand-written music accompanies fancy illustrations that dramatize each miniature piano piece. But the idea of exactly how to fuse printed music and sequential comic art came to me while visiting a comic shop in Cadiz, Spain. That\u0027s when I rushed home to make my first sketch of the comic book version of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSuccess!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003ewill be the world\u0027s first comic opera!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had initially envisioned a web comic in which users could read the comic, while clicking on an mp3 and following along with the music. After I finished drawing the opening number, \u003cem\u003eSuccess!\u003c/em\u003e went live in 2014.\u00a0At first, I drew the comic with a BAMBOO tablet, but drawing it that way quickly became tedious. So, when Apple came out with the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil, they liberated me from the tablet. Now I can draw anywhere just like I\u0027m drawing on paper and I can easily create polished looking comic pages. As a result, I upload pages practically bi-monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003ehas been performed once, as an informal table reading in Portland, Oregon in July, 2016. A talented cast of professional actors, plus me reading the part of Nicholas, performed a table reading of the play for a small audience at my wife\u0027s house in Beaverton.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter much consideration I have decided to become a member of the Patreon community. \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003eis, and always will be, free to consume, which has the natural benefit of keeping it accessible, but unfortunately it\u0027s rather unsustainable from an economic point of view. Patreon offers an opportunity for kind, generous individuals who enjoy creative content to support creators in a purely voluntary format. There is absolutely no obligation for anybody to take part, and any monetary transfers on Patreon are far more organic than the terribly impersonal forms of, say, Google AdSense. If you wish to help me improve \u003cem\u003eSuccess!, \u003c/em\u003eand if you wish to see it through to completion, you can become a patron and directly influence its creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though drawing \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003ehas been a blast, it hasn\u0027t been easy. Creating a web comic on my own is expensive. The yearly subscription cost for hosting the comic alone takes its toll, but then there are the costs to upgrade the software, the hardware, the equipment costs, the costs of possibly hiring an editor for a final print version, not to mention the sheer investment of time. At the moment, I\u0027m the definition of a weekend warrior, working on the comic as often as I can in between my teaching job. By choosing to become a patron, you will not only help ease the burden of these costs, but you will allow me to spend less time on the busywork associated with teaching and more time on my true passion. Most importantly, you will directly assist me in my goal of making \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003ea finished, fully realized work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal, after completing the web comic version of \u003cem\u003eSuccess!, \u003c/em\u003eis to either solicit publishers to create a printed version, or to self-publish a printed version. Rest assured, no matter what your monthly contribution, I will reward your generosity with a free annotated copy of said printed version, should your generosity help make it a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nice thing about supporting a one-off project such as \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003eis that once the comic is finished, you\u0027re generous contribution will no longer be required. I can\u0027t say how long that will be, though. At the moment I\u0027m working at a pace of about a scene every two months. This varies depending on how long a scene is, but that\u0027s the pace at which I\u0027d like to continue. At that rate, granted,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSuccess!\u003c/em\u003e could take a while, but I promise it won\u0027t take forever. When it\u0027s finished, so will be your generous contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s worth briefly noting that I\u0027m asking for a monthly contribution. Be assured, though, that even if it takes me a few months to crank out a new scene, even at the $1 level, you will receive monthly content from me. For example, at the $1 level, I will send you some preview pages in advance of the scene\u0027s release. Whatever pages I have finished that month, I will send to you, so you can enjoy watching \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003etake shape, without having to wait for the monthly upload.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to pledge\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, if you\u0027re enjoying \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003eand you\u0027d like to become a patron, first and foremost,\u003cstrong\u003e thank you so very much!\u003c/strong\u003e People like you are the reason I am able to continue doing what I love.

(e.g. if you pledge $10, you will receive the $1, $5, and $10 rewards.)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you pledge $10 or higher, (my gosh, thank you!) you will be asked to provide a delivery address.

I believe in the power of musical theater and graphic novels to communicate powerful and important themes through the medium of story. I also believe that music can be accessible to everyone. I know it sounds cliche, but music, theater, and the arts are my passions, and with your generous help, \u003cem\u003eSuccess!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0can enable me to have my hand in all three. Join me, become a patron, and together, you and I will bring into the universe something entirely new: the first \"comic opera\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, as long as it\u0027s online,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003ewill be free. If you\u0027d like to support its creation, I would be endlessly grateful. I am of course greatly thankful for \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e donation you may be willing to make, no matter how small, but if you do not wish to pledge, I hope you will enjoy \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003eand even share it and talk about it with your friends, loved ones, colleagues, and all the people in your life. If you can\u0027t contribute in dollars you can certainly contribute by word of mouth. I would greatly appreciate either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever you choose to contribute to the, well...success of \u003cem\u003eSuccess! \u003c/em\u003eI am pleased to have you on my team.
