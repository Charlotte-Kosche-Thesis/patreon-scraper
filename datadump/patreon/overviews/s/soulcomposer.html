I\u0027m here because I got accepted into the JET Program to teach English in Japan :D! Sounds wonderful, right? It really is. But here\u0027s the thing: They recommend that all participants save up at least $2000 before embarking on such a journey to cover all kinds of setups: apartment, phone, food, insurance, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrust me, I\u0027ve been on the lookout for jobs both where I studied in Tallahassee as well as my hometown in Miami but alas there\u0027s been no luck. Although I have just about enough saved to cover till the end of my apartment lease and maybe a wee bit for food I have nothing left over for anything else. I\u0027ve been selling my things left and right and have got 150$ for Japan to spare.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I really want to turn to my creative side to help me: I\u0027ve been really inspired by Yoongi from BTS to get back into writing, especially as the stresses of being rejected for temporary employment keep rising. Unfortunately I had to sell my keyboard 3 years ago so I don\u0027t have that at my disposal to try composing but I do still have a pen and paper at hand which is why I\u0027m doing \"music in writing\". Once I get to Japan though a keyboard is the first thing I\u0027ll be saving up to purchase *-* It\u0027s long overdue and I miss playing so much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are: as of right now I\u0027ll be writing these spoken word/freestyle works in English but my end goal is to write Japanese versions as well to continue improving communication in the language :) With that said, thank you for checking me out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
