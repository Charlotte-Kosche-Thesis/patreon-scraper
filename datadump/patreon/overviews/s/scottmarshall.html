    "summary": "Oh, hello! I didn\u0027t see you there. My name is Scott Marshall, and I have been making comics, zines, and other stuff for over 30 years! I will be turning 50 in 2018, and I want to create a bunch of stuff in other media - including a game, a podcast (or two), animation, and a novel (or two) - in addition to creating a bunch of comics. No problem, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, sometimes I have goofy ideas that don\u0027t really get (or merit) a lot of promotion, but I think they\u0027re fun so I make them. So this Patreon, in addition to being a central place for me to connect with fans of my stuff, will also be a sort of \"lab\" for the weird little projects that only people with excellent taste - people like \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e - could appreciate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to keep the pledge levels very simple. If you pledge a buck a month, you get access to a bunch of new stuff in digital form, plus you\u0027ll get discounts on everything I have in print, PLUS I will randomly send out little gifts if you give me your address. If you pledge five bucks or more, you\u0027ll get all of that plus occasional packages of new, Patron-only goodies. Could be a comic, a zine, some kind of print or sticker? Who knows, I haven\u0027t done it yet. But I will- with your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
