    "summary": "Alrighty then, Stonewall008 here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been making youtube videos for almost six years now and am still going strong. I was in college when I started my youtube career and, out of pure chance, saw it grow and become successful and lead me to where I am today. Youtube has had its ups and downs, its joys and frustrations, and I\u0027ve stuck through it all alongside the fans who have been with me since the start. Unfortunately, for myself and other colleagues, youtube is starting to become strained and thus many youtubers are feeling pressure like I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a very prideful person, of that there is no doubt, and even filling this out is causing me some sadness. Times have been rough and fans have encouraged me to use a website to allow them to support me. I cannot really offer anything that I don\u0027t already give for free. I stream with no expectations of money, I interact with fans with no paywall, I actively refuse sponsors that I don\u0027t have my heart set in or would not treat my fans properly. As a result, I cannot offer anything through patreon because everything you could want I would already work to provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to support me with monetary assistance well I welcome that. Assisting me simply by watching my videos is enough and I strongly appreciate that continued support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
