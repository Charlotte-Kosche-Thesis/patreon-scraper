We purchased Sundowner in 2010 and spent the next 5 years replacing nearly every system. In 2015 we sailed out of New Orleans Louisiana. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first year was spent on Sundowner where we sailed from New Orleans to Panama visiting such countries as Cuba, Mexico, Colombia and Panama. \u00a0A portion of 2016 was being spent travelling North America in our 27\u0027 Class A motorhome \"RA\". 2017 finds us back aboard Sundowner in Panama, Central America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the past 6 years we\u0027ve blogged (\"\n\u003ca href=\"http://sundownersailsagain.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSundowner Sails Again\u003c/a\u003e\") our trials, tribulations and adventures from refitting our 42 year old sailboat to sailing the seven seas to spearfishing. We hope to inspire others and LOVE sharing our adventures with you. Your support means the world to us! (This trip just wouldn\u0027t be as fun without you) Publishing videos is quite a bit more time consuming than a written blog. It is also a lot more expensive with data costs for uploads, specialized \u00a0computer and camera equipment and mounts, video editing software, and time to film and edit the videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEach finished minute of video takes about an hour to edit and produce!

Instead of literally throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pledge a few bucks per video\u00a0that a creator makes.  For example, if you pledge $2 per video, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of $6 that month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly (every time she releases something new), and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts. \u00a0\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(26, 139, 196); background-color: initial;\"\u003eYou can also set a monthly maximum that you are willing to contribute so you don\u0027t go over your monthly budget no matter how many videos are created that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is safe, secure, and doesn\u0027t take a big cut (about 10%). \u00a0We like it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJust hit the \"Become a Patron\" button and you\u0027ll be on your way.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for watching!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eTate and Dani\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/i1121.photobucket.com/albums/l518/svsundowner/Tatedani34.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/i1121.photobucket.com/albums/l518/svsundowner/SundownerRainbowKarl.jpeg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/i1121.photobucket.com/albums/l518/svsundowner/jmb_westsail32sund_draft.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
