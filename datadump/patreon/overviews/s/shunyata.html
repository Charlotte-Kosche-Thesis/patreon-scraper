It is a curious anagram\u2014 my take on the famous five\u2014 \u003cem\u003ethe who, what, when, where and why\u003c/em\u003e. It\u2019s also a quirky mantra. Try it. After a minute or two of \u0027who how\u2019ing\u0027, you\u0027ll see what I mean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk, I\u0027m weird and wonky\u2014\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou could call me an in-formation architect, a symbolist, a shaman, a creative catalyst or any number of things and not all of them polite!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy background is as motley\u00a0as a psychedelic rainbow.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI started painting and designing when I was around eight years old. I left home in my early teens, grew up wild and free: opened my first nightclub when I was just coming of age, and modeled on the runways of Paris in my early twenties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cldup.com/u6oN0vhZJY.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003eAntoine Giacomoni, famous for his \u2018mirror images\u2019 of rock stars and celebrities, took this photo during my modeling stint in Paris. It was shot through an illuminated mirror. The mirror was surrounded by lights, like a makeup mirror. You can see the lights reflected in my eyes.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, modeling in \u0027Gay Paree\u0027 was a blast for a young guy like me! There were super hot chicks, star-studded parties, and it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect. If I left off the story here, you\u0027d certainly get the wrong impression You see, I never fit into the model mould.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI wasn\u2019t only the shortest guy in the agency, at six feet tall (183cm) I looked more like the water boy on a basketball team\u2014 what actually singled me out was what you might call my spiritual eccentricities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was like a spiritualist gone vogue, the agency\u2019s very own mystic. What else would you expect of someone who organized ecstatic moon rituals, brewed up mind-altering concoctions, read hands and did hands-on healings?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, we are skipping over the spicey details here. But in the context of this little intro column, a deeper segue wouldn\u2019t be fitting. Would it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter three years, I\u2019d had my fill of the glitz, the glamour, and the shallow minded pomposity. So, I left Paris behind and moved to Bali, where I built the Laughing Yogi House.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cldup.com/7e0kx3b6Xw.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cldup.com/7e0kx3b6Xw.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLittle house with a view. The Laughing Yogi House was a small retreat center that I built on the edge of Sayan Terraces, a secluded river valley outside of Ubud, Bali\u2019s art center.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus far you\u2019ve had a whirlwind tour, a light-speed journey back in time, with countless tales written between the lines. It brings us up to 1986 when my life\u0027s work had just begun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt feels like lifetimes have flashed by, since then. And, if you wish we can pick up this chronicle again. This is where you\u2019re Patreon\u2019age comes in. If there\u2019s enough interest on Patreon\u2019s Message board, I\u2019ll flesh this retrospective out for you some more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor right now, the story is live, like a river its spirit flows on towards the sea. Wouldn\u2019t you like to be my guest on this extraordinary quest? We\u2019ll sail with serendipity, probe the most profound mysteries, uncover hidden truths, shatter conventions and break through to the real you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cldup.com/ox0ZiTwPdO.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI admit that up until now\u2014\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019ve been holding back. You see, posting original pieces on Facebook, Youtube and similar sites feels, well\u2014 treacherous. They are a necessary evil to some extent, but they keep getting worse, ramping up the scale of their iniquities. The last thing that I want to do is feed their corporate coffers with the fruit of my labor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn Patreon, I\u2019m not going against my values. I\u2019m not supporting a company that exploits our creativity, culture and tribal yearning. Patreon\u2019s raison d\u0027\u00eatre is rewarding reciprocity. The more support that you provide, the more I\u2019m able to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon gives us a platform that cuts out the noise, the trolls, and the clickbait.
