    "summary": "Welcome to our Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Sean Cunningham and Eric MacPherson, the hosts of the Strange Matters Podcast. Seated around a campfire late one night, we found ourselves discussing our favorite stories of the strange and macabre into the early hours of the morning. It was then we decided to put our interest in the bizarre and unexplained to good use. We began planning the framework for our new venture and a few months later we had aired our first episode. As our skills improved we were able to reach an ever growing listener base. As podcast hosts, we are always looking forward to releasing our latest episode discussing anything from cryptozoology to conspiracy theories and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere at Strange Matters we discuss anything that is mysterious, bizarre and unexplained. Our most popular topics include the apocalypse, urban legends, unsolved mysteries, serial killers, and the paranormal. We release 3-5 episodes per month ranging from 15 minute shorts to 90 minute in-depth discussions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support would allow us to improve our research methods and the overall quality of the podcast. We are hoping to buy better recording equipment and obtain a permanent recording studio. Our hope is to release more episodes per month and with your contributions we can achieve these goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond supporting us and helping us grow as a podcast, those who contribute to us on Patreon will have access to several exclusive bonuses! \u00a0Those who wish to support us at any contribution level will enter our Inner Circle, where we will ask for feedback and ideas which will help decide what direction the podcast will go in. \u00a0Also those contributing anything a bit more than the minimum will have access to a Patreon exclusive bonus episode every month! \u00a0Of course, every supporter of the show will receive our thanks and get a personal shout out during our podcast. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
