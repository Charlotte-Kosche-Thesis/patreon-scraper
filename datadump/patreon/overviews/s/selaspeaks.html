    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etldr;\u003c/strong\u003e support a radical black queer femme feminist and get access to diasporic black feminist thought, creative fiction, political analyses, various forms of art (pastels, watercolors, digital, comics)! To see previous published written (black feminist pop-culture criticisms) work visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/profile/bemnet-gebrechirstos\"\u003eright here\u003c/a\u003e. Also, check out my public posts for things that I want to share with the community and are also examples of what you\u0027d be getting as a patron \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is made in support of my (Sela) work in being a radical creator across varying genres of mediums (written - fiction, non fiction, short stories, opinion essays, audio - recordings of written work for accessibility, art - comics, pastel portraits, film photography, short films, etc) and ultimately to help me sustain an art shop and career as a creator.\u00a0I am a black queer disabled feminist \"scholar\" (aka struggling student navigating the elitist field of academia), who has a deep love for afrofuturism and can sometimes be an afropessimist too. Ultimately, I want all interconnecting forms of oppression (such as white supremacy, capitalism, patriarchy, and imperialism) to fall, and I want to create content that helps people understand the work that I\u0027m putting out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy blessed and given name is Bemnet Gebrechirstos and I share this knowing that names hold weight and power, and I don\u0027t just mean in terms of social capital (clout) -- I mean in the universe. I thank my mother for teaching me that and birthing me so I can birth this, and other projects. I have published online articles through a great feminist based magazine (\u003cem\u003eBitch Media)\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which you can find all my written (non-fiction) work as their 2017 Pop-Culture Criticism Fellow\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/profile/bemnet-gebrechirstos\"\u003eright here on my page on Bitch\u0027s site\u003c/a\u003e. I publish my artwork (among other things) under \u003cem\u003eSela\u003c/em\u003e (resistance, resilience, return to ancestors, a chosen name) and you can find an example of that work in \u003cem\u003eBitch\u0027\u003c/em\u003es most recent issue, Revenge where I also have a long print feature.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing my fellowship with Bitch Media, and the worst year of my life (2017, which left me devastated in a number of ways), I am still a full-time student (abroad in Cape Town, South Africa until mid-June!) and need support to pursue my passions and also make a living under the constant coercion that is capitalism. For the past three years, I have been a student organizer and member of various communities giving my emotional, physical, spiritual, and intellectual labor for free because I believed (and still do in some ways) for what I fight for -- \u003cem\u003ewhich is autonomy and liberation in the spaces that we can carve out from the world we\u0027ve been thrust into\u003c/em\u003e. Compensation for the work that I do as a black queer femme is what you\u0027re giving when you become a patron to my patreon (because the global economy will not respect reparations)! And as I not only write opinon essays and blog posts, I will also work to create a multimedia platform in which I can share as much knowledge (that I have privilege of accessing through multiple venues). This means better understanding the nature of this world\u0027s conditions with the community and sharing what I do have, because I also believe in shared and equitable resources -- especially when this comes to knowledge and creation. Shout outs to you if you read this whole thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll hop in my portal and join me in my struggle for autonomy by becoming a patron and member of the community I am trying to build.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFiker \u0026amp; Ashe,\u003cbr\u003eSela\u003cbr\u003e(they/them)"
