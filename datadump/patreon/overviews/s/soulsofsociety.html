We want to pay people to contribute their time and energy. \nWe\u0027re going to try hiring storytelling to tell 5 stories featuring photos about a specific community for $500. We also need people to handle things like posting to social media, spam \ncomment deletion, store creation and upkeep, store customer service, and\n a bunch of other little jobs. These things end up adding up to a few \nhours every day, and without help, I end up doing it all and have much \nless time to connect with people to create stories and build the \ncommunity.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting\u003c/strong\u003e.
