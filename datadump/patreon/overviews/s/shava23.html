Twitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are not so many of us who bridge the years and sensibilities from 1964 to today. \u00a0This is how I grew up and took off, roots and wings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dad worked night security for the Salem-Montgomery march for Dr King and the SCLC, and was a union organizer in his younger years.\u00a0 By the time I was born he was working on his divinity degree at Oberlin to become a Universalist minister, because the Universalists\u0027 focus on social justice in Cleveland had pulled him in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sat on the floor in the living room and listened to my dad and his cronies talk media strategy, direct action and so on.\u00a0 When I was four, I was on a local civil rights march.\u00a0 A TV broadcaster picked me out as the safe interviewee:\u00a0 the little white girl in the home-made corduroy pinafore.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Why are you here today, little girl?\" he asked me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I believe we need a more healing dialectic around race issues in this community,\" I told him, in my tiny piping voice.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDead air followed for a few lengthy seconds.\u00a0 Remember, everything was live in those days.\u00a0 At which point, I understand, the cameraman saved him by cutting to a commercial.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have not stopped being nerdy, disruptive or frank in over five decades since.\u00a0 One of the blessings of being involuntarily retired is that I no longer am beholden to any organization that I have to represent.\u00a0 I can speak my mind fully without my opinions \"reflecting back\" on any group\u0027s funding or reputation.\u00a0 Now I can analyze fully and with great detail what I think regarding the theme and structure of political affairs, and pass that on to you unfiltered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsually people like you don\u0027t get frank direct opinions from folks like me, because we\u0027re kept as advisory to organizations. \u00a0But I\u0027m to broken now to be locked in anyone\u0027s back room.\u00a0 The rest of my life is one long \"Ask me anything.\" \u00a0And you know, I like that. \u00a0It\u0027s fresh air.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, there are a number of topics I\u0027ve been jotting down in Evernote for some time to tackle as time allowed that fall into various series.\u00a0 My favorites are a whole series of disruptive ideas, ones that will generally turn most peoples\u0027 brains inside out before coffee on a Monday morning and keep them spinning into the next few days.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create projects on the fragility of our financial instruments, which rely way too much on trust and too little on security by design. \u00a0In this age of daily reports on breaches and hacks (some of which are by state sponsored agents) we need to have a major overhaul -- and a major overhaul of our attitudes -- about what financial information security means, and how it relates to personal information and personal privacy. \u00a0At root, this is political flashfire material -- the elephant in the room in every discussion of encryption, back doors, foreign hackers, privacy and security.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create an e-book on how the cultural divide between civilian and military (and paramilitary -- including law enforcement, justice, and intelligence) culture is killing our society, and some ideas on how to heal this. \u00a0And this is from a classic-liberal Army mom, and former military contractor who has worked with pacifist organizations and with the Intelligence Community on friendly terms. \u00a0(Has your head exploded yet?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, I have an exploration I\u0027d like to make with you, which is a project I call \"How to Save the World in Your Spare Time.\"\u00a0 This is a class I\u0027ve taught for over fifteen years now, and I\u0027ve never been able to put it into a portable curriculum that others can teach.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I want to find a set of people -- teachers, organizers, curricula designers, whomever -- who can work with the pieces I can put out, and create something beautiful out of it, so I don\u0027t end up buried without this work passed on.\u00a0 Because in a couple hours, I can take a room of high schoolers, and turn them into organizers and system thinkers in the civic sphere -- and that\u0027s amazing, it\u0027s a wonderful thing to watch those lights go on.\u00a0 It\u0027s something that needs to be propagated.\u00a0 And I need y\u0027all\u0027s help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007, I had to leave the Tor Project due to what seems extremely likely to have been a misdiagnosed stroke. \u00a0I was rear ended by a drunk driver in Florida in slow suburban traffic at a stoplight. \u00a0I was healthy and in my 40s -- we didn\u0027t have much reason to think about stroke. \u00a0We went on that evening to eat in Kissimee at a seafood place, but I was getting increasingly sick. \u00a0My fiance thought it was food poisoning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, years later, I\u0027m classed as fully disabled, on SSI, often left for weeks at a time confined to bed with nerve pain and a laundry list of problems that are more typical of people who survived strokes half a century ago. \u00a0I can still write, but not every day. \u00a0I can still speak, but not as well. \u00a0I really want to find some way to continue to work, but I can\u0027t guarantee deadlines well enough for any one employer to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much left in this life of mine, as limited as it is, that I can still share. \u00a0You let me share it with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are my patrons. \u00a0Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Vint Cerf speculated back in 1997 that I was one of the first 50 women engineers on the Internet.\u00a0 It was chance that brought me online so early, but it was determination that made me steer toward the nascent area of public interest Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent decades working for digital rights and digital inclusion as more and more of the Internet has become integrated in more and more of the world\u0027s daily life. \u00a0From 1982, when I was making educational software at DEC and building online community with other women on Usenet. \u00a0Through my years of campus and community and nonprofit and political networking, in my work as the voice of digitaldivide.org. \u00a0And, most notably, in my stint as the founding executive director of The Tor Project, where I wrapped up a distinguished career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007, what was likely a cerebral hemorrhage knocked me out of my career.\u00a0 I\u0027ve since been diagnosed with autoimmune vasculitis, a rare disease similar to lupus that can weaken the walls of the circulatory system leading to strokes, and causes deficits in mobility, chronic pain, fatigue, migraines, and a raft of symptoms.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend many of my days lying on a memory foam mattress, able to spend only an hour or two sitting, and only a short time standing in place (although many days I can walk if I don\u0027t have to stand long).\u00a0 My CPU is clocked down.\u00a0 I also have dyscalculia -- my math center is gone since 2007 -- hard for an engineer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can still write, think, analyze.\u00a0 It\u0027s slower, and my output is less, and irregular when my health flares bad. I have never stopped writing and teaching except right after the stroke.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn spring of 2013, the good folks at Silent Circle gave me a go to work with them on their new Blackphone project.\u00a0 I couldn\u0027t keep up.\u00a0 So I bit the bullet and applied for disability. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause while I was hoping to heal from the stroke I cared for my mom (Parkinson\u0027s/dementia) for too long, my eligibility for SSDI elapsed, and I\u0027m stuck on SSI at $770/mo. \u00a0But I\u0027d rather work. I\u0027m worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have arranged to minimize my expenses as much as I can.\u00a0 I live very modestly with my son, who was released from his \u00a0Army obligations on \"only child.\" \u00a0But there may come a time when I need to think about other arrangements -- he\u0027s a young man with his life ahead of him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think what I have done in the past and am doing today is worth the cost of a beer or a latte, pitch it my way.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my savings was wiped the year and a bit after I got sick, supporting my household of four (me, my elderly mom, my teenage son, and my disabled boyfriend), so I did save -- but it\u0027s gone forever.\u00a0 I am living on karma and government cheese.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar you send me cuts my SSI, but that\u0027s fine. \u00a0I\u0027d rather work.\u003cbr\u003e",
