I want to involve my team in my videos and start new segments including a weekly show. I also only need one more piece of equipment to take my video quality to a far higher level.

We will be able to make daily videos and stick with the content everyone loves and came to this channel to see. Additionally, we will be able to purchase new equipment such as a camera rail, lenses, lighting, tripod etc. This will enable us to increase the quality of our videos to professional levels. We will also be able to expand our team to enable us to bring your more, higher quality content. You will see epic changes to the channel at this level. I will be able to spend time on personal builds and modding projects which means that I will have complete freedom to create my own ideas and designs, so you will finally see what I am truly capable of.",
