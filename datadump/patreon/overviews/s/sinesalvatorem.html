I am best known for terrible puns, baffling quotes, and being a transwoman from the third world with Opinions on her homeland. I have been searching for a job for a while, but it turns out immigrant status makes this unusually difficult. To tide me over until I get there, I\u2019ve been convinced to start a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I would like let everyone know that I am in no way an effective charity. I am a cute puppy with a rare disease.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, people who like my writing but don\u2019t have money to throw at internet strangers should not feel any guilt about this! I am not a fan of guilt! You should only give this internet stranger money if you really want to and are in a position to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I could really appreciate your support for such endeavors as: living under a roof, eating food, and not ending up back in my home country and getting arrested for \u201chomosexual conduct\u201d, or something. If you approve of these goals, this might be the Patreon for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the sidebar for all the ~fabulous prizes~ you can earn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Note: If you would prefer to hire me instead of or in addition to sponsoring me, \u003ca href=\"http://sinesalvatorem.tumblr.com/post/151748323706/on-the-employment-of-alisons-in-need\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esee here\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e"
