    "summary": "Hiya, I\u0027m Varaidzo, and I currently produce and edit Search History. It\u0027s a podcast about the internet, kind of, and race, kind of, and everything weird, woeful and wonderful inbetween. It\u0027s a very DIY project - currently, I make it on a bean bag on my living room floor - and hopefully you\u0027ll consider becoming a patron so I can elevate the production (perhaps even move up to the sofa!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer, I\u0027ve written for places like The Guardian, New Statesman, Complex, and I was a contributor to the award-winning essay collection The Good Immigrant.\u00a0Search History began when I was going through a really difficult time with my mental health, and I couldn\u0027t work or write. The podcast began as an excuse to get out of bed, speak to people, and tell stories again without the pressure of having to write. Since then, it\u0027s grown into a really interesting platform of enquiry that I\u0027m immensely proud of and want to continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I\u0027m currently funding its production entirely out of my own pocket, and my pockets are almost empty. With your help, I can buy more equipment to improve the quality of each episode, and will be able to raise my production budget in order to bring you more exciting stories. Without funding, I won\u0027t be able to keep making more episodes of Search History. I gotta eat and pay rent and have a whole wage gap to reckon with. So, if you like what you hear, please consider supporting this independent production by becoming a patron.\u00a0"
