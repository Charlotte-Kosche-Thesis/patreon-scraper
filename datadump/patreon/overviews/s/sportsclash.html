Starting a show like Sports Clash Radio has been a dream of ours for years. The one thing we have learned is if you have a dream or goal then you should do everything in your power to make that happen. Our fans and friends have allowed us to start on this awesome path. The style of our show allows us to have a unique relationship with our listeners. The one thing we thrive off of and what helps us deliver a better show week in and week out is LOTS of feedback. We like to know how you\u0027re feeling about the show and what you want more of (less of too). We listen to your suggestions and requests, which we learn from, appreciate and take to heart. Overwhelmingly, the issues that come up are 1) Access to the archives,  all back episodes in one place for stream or download 2) Merchandise, having it available online consistently and shipped promptly 3) More content, whether it be bonus episodes, live shows or video. 4) An easy way for you the listener to support us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love our listeners and we would like to be in a position to offer all the things you\u0027re asking for while still remaining completely free, in order to do this we have decided to ask for your help. We hope we can hit the goals we\u0027ve set so we can maintain the archives, the website and an online merch store w/ employee AND be doing this full-time so we are able to oversee all this new stuff we want to do. We\u0027d also like the time to add more audio and video content! We are going to be hosting a weekly private Fantasy Draft show for patrons who achieve a certain award status as well as offering other special gifts for all of your support. After years of doing these podcasts out of pocket we are asking for the Sports Clash Radio family to help us keep this show rocking for the next ten years, we are just not in a position to do this on our own any longer. We\u0027ve set these goals up and listed different donation options but these are just suggestions, you are free to give whatever feels right to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone who has helped already get us to where we are and thanks in advance to you who choose to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eChad and J.C."
