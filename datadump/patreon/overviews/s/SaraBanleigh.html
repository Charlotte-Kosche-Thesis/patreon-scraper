Now I create piano-based arrangements of old folk \ntunes, go figure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a love affair with English Country Dance\n music. It\u0027s what I\u0027m usually tinkering around with for practice, for \nrelaxation, for curiosity, or for an apres-meal digestive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write my own folk and country songs. I\u0027ve been told they sound like old, classic folk and country songs. That\u0027s cool. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSongs\n are wishes, songs are dreams, songs are like human beings. When I share\n songs of any kind with others, I am sharing deep and meaningful parts \nof myself. Some of those parts are beautiful, and some are rather \ndreadful.

I felt like nothingness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt times, folk music was the only \nthing I could sing and play; it was the only thing I could listen to - \nraw acoustic folk made with living instruments and singers who told \nstories. I became immersed in folk music for selfish reasons. The old \nfolk songs told my story better than I knew how. The muck at the bottom \nof the well, the dead leaves clogging the stream  - folk music was the \nonly thing that could open my throat and help me get the muck out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn emetic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery clever lyric, every strong musical phrase was medicine, and I wanted to eat it all.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n am still waiting to see if the words of the prophetess come true. In \nthe meantime, I do see that the sands have shifted a bit. And, I do \nbelieve that the old folk songs, and the new ones that are coming out of\n me, are part of what appears to be a journey. So that now, I feel less \nlike nothingness. That is to say I am more than nothingness. That is to \nsay, more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFolk music is the golden bough to which we return time\n and again, through millennia.

The videos and musings I post to Patreon are meant to be enjoyed, read, listened to, watched, reflected on, and interacted with. If you like anything I\u0027ve posted here or anywhere online, consider becoming a patron for only $1 per month. These little drops of water are life-giving and add up to an ocean of support. Small amounts per month, donated by fans, friends, and supporters from across the globe, allow me to continue to write, post, perform, and interact with the world as a musician. I am deeply grateful for your support, and I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for believing in me!",
