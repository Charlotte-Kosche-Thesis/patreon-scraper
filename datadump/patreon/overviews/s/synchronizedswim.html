    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.synchronized-swim.com/\"\u003eSynchronized Swim\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0is about a lot of things, but community is at the very heart of the project. When Jess and I began meeting in late 2016 to talk about the possibility of starting a joint-writing project, one of the things we kept coming back to was a desire for community on the internet, a space\u00a0to talk about the things that are stuck in our heads with each other and with other people. We wanted to create something we couldn\u0027t already find, make a place that hadn\u0027t existed yet. That vision became something like the dream of a\u00a0chlorine-y pool in the basement of the internet where we and our friends could while away an afternoon, feel the sensation of floating, shout and laugh, talk about our fears and hopes in the echoey hush, light coming through high windows. A bunch of people in swimsuits dancing and swimming and talking, beautiful, reverent, vulnerable, calm.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been writing Synchronized Swim now for a year, and it has been a true joy to both see it unfold week by week and see a community, small and steady, growing up around it. Jessie and I are so honored and thankful for each reader and friend who comes back week by week to read and see, to participate, to hop in the pool with us. As we swim into our second year, our desire is for \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0community, \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0voices, \u003cem\u003emore \u003c/em\u003epeople coming to join our circle of friends. We are ready to grow, and we are so excited to see what is in store for us. Your support helps us continue this work, dream bigger dreams, hope bigger hopes. We will be here, doing the work, swimming right along. We are endlessly thankful for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS.
