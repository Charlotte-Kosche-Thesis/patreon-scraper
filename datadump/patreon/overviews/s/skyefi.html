When I am not working as prop master or swimming teacher or english teacher or child carer I like to work on small projects that I find meaningful. My most time consuming and challenging project is a Feminist Science Fiction Zine that I called ZENITH. I curate the zine by sourcing works of feminist science fiction I find compelling and under-appreciated and compile them into a nice-looking, old-school, actually printed in the real world Zine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny $$$s I make through Patreon will go to printing and distributing ZENITH. You can see the digital version of the first issue\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://issuu.com/zenithzine/docs/zenith_full_small\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond ZENITH I like to embroider. I make a lot of things as gifts for my friends, but I am also working on a number of pieces that depict historic/revolutionary/badass women embroidered in a pop-art style. My grandmother taught me the art of embroidery when I was very young but I only recently began working with the needle as an adult. So I am developing my skills in the medium and finding it a really awesome way to both create and engage in self-care. Embroidery requires a lot of patience and meditative concentration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, despite hating being in front of a camera or putting myself into the center of attention, I have found I really enjoy vlogging about my life, which has been really fucking bizarre for a fair while now."
