My name is Shawn and I make a comic called \u003ca href=\"http://www.howtobeawerewolf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHow to be a Werewolf\u003c/a\u003e. There are two new pages every week on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. It\u0027s not an instruction manual! As much as people keep emailing me on how to turn into a werewolf, I\u0027m afraid you probably know as much as I do. But if you\u0027re my main character, Malaya Walters, you at least would have the \"already a werewolf\" part under control, just not the \"what do I do now\" part. Malaya was bitten as a kid, but she ends up being raised by her very-human family, far away from any other supernatural creatures. For the most part, she keeps things under control as well as can be expected, until at the age of 25, she finally meets another werewolf and everything about her life changes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to be a Werewolf\u003c/strong\u003e is an odd little romp through the life of one twenty-something werewolf, exploring anxiety, family relationships, issues with emotional abuse, and what it means to find your place in the world. Plus, HTBAW is really funny because I can\u0027t take anything seriously for very long apparently. (Like writing this paragraph.) It features a diverse cast of characters who ALL LOOK TOTALLY DIFFERENT (because I think that\u0027s important). One of them is a lesbian werewolf lawyer, and I\u0027m really proud of myself because that sounds super neat. (She is neat.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I put a lot/all of my spare time into this little comic, and it would be great if you guys could help me make this endeavor less of an economic black hole/labor of love. In return, you\u0027ll get eight damn pages a month, and whatever else I can throw at you to make it worth your while!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post things all month long. If there\u0027s something neat you\u0027d like to see here, tutorials you\u0027d like to request, writing tips you\u0027d like a post on, let me know. There\u0027s a handful of stuff that $1 patrons can see, though most stuff starts at $2. Here are some things I post throughout the month:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- In progress drawings and sketches\u003cbr\u003e- Cover ideas and in progress covers\u003cbr\u003e- Not-quite-done pages early ($10+ patrons...sometimes they\u0027re finished, but usually in progress)\u003cbr\u003e- Writing tips about developing characters, plots, building on story ideas, etc.\u003cbr\u003e- Comic-making tutorials before they wander over to tumblr and get lost\u003cbr\u003e- Zip files of HTBAW chapters ($5 patrons get standard resolution, $10+ patrons get high res)\u003cbr\u003e- High resolution files of each page ($5+ patrons)\u003cbr\u003e- Commissions for $20, $40, $80 tiers (see notes below)\u003cbr\u003e- Whatever else ya\u0027ll wanna see. I\u0027m always open to ideas if I can find the time to make them happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommission Tier FAQ:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you take commissions through Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s easier for me to keep track of taxes and whatnot by putting all my commission requests through Patreon. This also makes sure I don\u0027t have too many people who want stuff commissioned at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore you pledge for a commission tier, it never hurts to drop me a message or an email (shawnlenore @ gmail) just to make sure I have time and can meet your request.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou ONLY have to pledge the one month at that tier, and then after you\u0027re charged, you can switch back to whatever tier you\u0027d rather be at on a monthly basis, or you can discontinue your support thereafter. I really don\u0027t mind if that\u0027s the case! I always appreciate when people stay on, but totally not required. I will try and make sure to remind you to switch before the end of the month, and if for some reason you forget, I\u0027ll make sure to refund your money or get you another reward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like additional commissions after the first month, please give me a head\u0027s up first! That\u0027ll give me a chance to make sure there\u0027s no one else waiting in the wings who already requested a spot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford the total amount for your commission right off the bat, let me know ahead of time, and we can split the cost up over a series of months. So like, two months at $40, etc. That gives me more time to work, and you a bit of a break on spending money all at once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get at each of the available tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$20 gets you a black and white sketch, full body, of whatever character you want - first month only.\u003cbr\u003e$40 gets you a black and white inked drawing, OR I\u0027ll do a full color bust - first month only\u003cbr\u003e$80 gets you a full body, full color commission - can do multiple commissions, just give me a head\u0027s up first\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to switch between tiers, so a sketch one month and an inked drawing a different month, that\u0027s cool. Just keep me posted about whatever you\u0027re looking for. I\u0027d do multiple sketches and inks and whatever for everybody, but it becomes a lot to squeeze in every month, so that\u0027s the only way I can keep these tiers under control lol\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I get my finished commission?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe month of your full payment, unless I contact you otherwise ahead of time, or unless I just never hear back from you about what you want for your drawing. Generally, I\u0027ll try and hunt you down for details on what you want as soon as I notice you\u0027ve pledged to one of these tiers, so mostly it\u0027s an issue of whenever I hear back from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you need from me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecificity! The more specific you are, the more I\u0027ll be able to get you the drawing you want. If you have other drawings of your character, a pose in mind, colors you\u0027d like to use, photos of people who look like your character, etc., that helps me get a more accurate idea of what you want the finished product to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a sketch first (or for stuff I\u0027m really not sure of, a thumbnail and then a sketch), which you\u0027ll get to see early on so we can do a round of changes. Then I\u0027ll ink and color the drawing, at which point, I don\u0027t mind doing small changes (make the shirt a bit redder, take off this bit of hair, etc...nothing big). Then you\u0027ll get a high resolution image that you can use to make prints or whatever. (Not for resale!) If you\u0027d like me to upload the drawing to tumblr, deviantart, twitter, etc so you can share it with your social network, let me know :).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you draw?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Safe for work stuff! Fan art, furries, original characters, characters from HTBAW...whatever. I try not to turn down requests. If you\u0027d like to commission something of characters from HTBAW, I might be pickier about the context, just because they\u0027re my characters."
