But what does that tell us about the person?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working in gaming and nerd spaces for the past 6 years and my passion has always been interviewing.

But traveling to these comes at a huge cost. Freelancing is my full time job and my outlets don\u0027t cover travel or expenses for me. For a while, I was eating the cost because I wanted to bring unique interviews into the gaming space.
