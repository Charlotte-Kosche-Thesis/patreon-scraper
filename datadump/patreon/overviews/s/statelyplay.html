    "summary": "We started Stately Play as a way for us to keep doing what we loved doing back when Pocket Tactics was a thriving hotbed of mobile game news, reviews, and fan-led chatter on the forums. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever and when Pocket Tactics was gobbled up, that sense of freedom went away.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel we\u0027ve brought that old Pocket Tactics spirit back with Stately Play, spreading our wings and writing about everything we love, be it mobile games, board games, PC titles, or even a few 3DS or Switch games in there. Unfortunately, our need for a paycheck hasn\u0027t abated and while we\u0027ve been doing this for a year now gratis, it\u0027s become clear that to keep Stately Play going with daily content, we need to bring in a little cash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank everyone who\u0027s been involved in making Stately Play feel like our 2nd home since we opened the doors in October 2016. We wouldn\u0027t be where we are without you and, if you decide to help us financially, we hope to make the site a better place over the coming months. More cash will help us pay writers, which means more quality content for everyone! At some point we\u0027d love to move into offering game streams, videos, and even tabletop RPG session videos. We\u0027ve even thought of doing a podcast down the road, but we can\u0027t do any of this without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read and be a part of Stately Play over the past year!\u003cbr\u003e"
