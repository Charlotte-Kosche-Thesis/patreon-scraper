    "summary": "Hello everyone and welcome to my page, I appreciate you dropping in and spending a little time looking through what is offered here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Samuel Benson and I have been a hobbyist for around 18 years now, I have always had a keen interest in sharing knowledge and helping others, not just in the hobby but in life in general. So it is quite natural for me to be here now creating content for hobbyists and combining two of the things that bring me joy.\u003cbr\u003ePersonally, I am immensely thankful to all of those who helped shape the painter I have become and continue to grow into. Be they the games store owner who sat with me and showed me how to thin my paints, the golden demon winner who described painting metallic surfaces with a NMM mentality, or the countless forum members who offered their feedback on miniatures as I published WIP shots or asked the \"stupid questions\", every one of them helped me to improve to the point where today I own this page.\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I have decided to create articles and video content myself, with the hope that my ramblings may in turn help other hobbyists reach their goals, and with the dream of expanding my hobby into a way to help people from all across the globe\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI firmly believe in the community of hobbyists we have around the world and understand first hand the frustration of seeing great content hidden behind financial barriers or secreted away completely. This is why the underlying philosophy of this page is to share all of my work for whatever it is that an individual can pay, you decide what my content is worth to you and I rely on the generosity of patrons to keep this dream alive.\u003cbr\u003eIn short, everyone who wishes to improve their own work will always have ready access to all the content I produce, regardless of means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, whether you\u0027ve downloaded a tutorial or watched some videos, consider what it\u0027s worth was to you. Every single dollar helps me dedicate the time and resources needed to keep them coming!\u003cbr\u003e"
