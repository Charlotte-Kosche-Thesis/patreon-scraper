    "summary": "Hi, well met and hearty welcomes to the Patreon page for SovereignofAshes and the Vorrgistadt Saga project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m hard at work creating the mighty web serial fiction project known as \u003ca href=\"https://vorrgistadt.blogspot.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Vorrgistadt Saga\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s a pretty demanding project that involves me putting in a great amount of time on a computer, at an art desk, or frantically scribbling things down in numerous notebooks to get this whole thing done. I\u0027m the author, the designer, the artist, the cartographer, the layout person, the editor, and the (not-so-good) PR person for the entire thing. In case you were wondering, I get very little sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now the Vorrgistadt Saga has a pretty erratic update schedule. I\u0027m trying to keep to a bi-weekly schedule but things are a little hard with a demanding job (twelve to fourteen hours a night) cutting into a lot of the writing time I need to get things done. With your help, dedication as readers, and the fulfilling glow of your patronage, I would be able to devote more time to writing, less time to my job, and be able to create more updates regularly as per your whim as my patron overlords.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough a little bit of the patronage would be going to sustaining my mortal existence so that I can continue to serve you diligently as a writer and creator of things, most of it would be going to better the fiction works themselves. With a little bit of help, I will be able to hire artists to help out with their awesome skills, give some help to other authors and creators of fan-fiction or fan-art, find some talented people to do some audio releases of the story, hire an editor to catch all of my mistakes, upgrade the site to be all spiffy-like, and even be able to release the story via more traditional methods like e-pub/kindle and actual dead-tree novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big thing I strive for with my writing is professionalism, out-of-the-box creativity, and being able to create things that other people can enjoy, have fun with, and put themselves into. I have some pretty lofty plans with the stories that I\u0027m working on and need your help to make those things a reality. Ideally, I would love to be able to make regular fiction releases every couple of days to a week, to get as much input from readers as possible to make the stories go in the directions you want them to go, and to create secondary works that allow you, as readers, to make your own stories in the worlds that I can help create for you. As it is right now, I\u0027m able to devote 30-40 hours a week to this writing project, but with your help I can turn that into a full-time writing job of 60+ hours a week, able to get lots more done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis whole adventure is just beginning, and with every bit of help you can provide, the sky is the limit for what this project can become. If you have some time, please drop by the fiction pages and check it out to see if it\u0027s something you\u0027re interested in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, for your consideration, and for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
