There\u0027s no peace, no quiet. Lots of love, and that\u0027s great, but I\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need to write. I need a place to write. And that means I need to make money writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy career is still young. I came to it in a weird, screwed-up way, but now that I have it I love it. But it doesn\u0027t pay the bills. YET.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help here. Your money, yes. But also your support. Do you know how goddamn GOOD it feels to know that someone believes in what I do enough to part with real live folding green?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt feels AMAZING. And I NEED that feeling as much as the money. I need readers. All writers need readers. People willing to part with money in exchange for the fun of reading and exploring part of my head. I need to know you\u0027re there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for a few years now. At first I wrote on lunch breaks at my job, which was managing a grocery department in a grocery store. Lots of lifting boxes and towing half-ton pallets by muscle on wheels and stacking cans and squatting down and climbing up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd my hip wore out. I have x-rays, they\u0027re medium-gnarly. The joint doesn\u0027t fit together anymore, the cartilage is long since ground away; the head of my femur and the ball socket it fits into have been razed and salted like the ground of old Carthage after the Romans got done with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that left writing. And I didn\u0027t feel bad about that. I didn\u0027t like schlepping groceries. I didn\u0027t much like any of the other jobs I had. Not the sit-down or the active, the menial or the managerial, and definitely not the dark days I don\u0027t like to talk about, the deep shadows that lurk in the background of many of my stories and haunt my villains and heroes alike: the years I spent alone and despairing, the years I spent trying to drink myself to death. I nearly succeeded more than once. The knowledge haunts me: I almost cheated myself out of this family I love more than I love myself and always will. I almost cheated myself out of this dream of writing great stories for me and you and everyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is the only job I\u0027ve ever loved. It\u0027s all I want to do. I never had a dream before just like the real live angsty Gen-X dude I am.\u00a0I need your support to make it into a paying career that can support me and my wife and my two little ones and my teenager and hey, my cat says \"MEOW HELP THE MAN BUY ME MORE KIBBLE MEOW.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI HAVE FINALLY SET UP A REWARD STRUCTURE SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR SUPPORT. TOOK ME LONG ENOUGH. And also...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...you get the warm fuzzy feeling of backing a writer who is here to succeed, the pleasure of being a patron of the arts, and the humanitarian glow of helping a trailer park denizen GET THE HELL OUT OF THE TRAILER PARK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
