I am fortunate to live in a beautiful area, surrounded by mountains and rivers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I stopped taking pictures for 3 years. Personal issues took over and I lost my passion. Thanks to friends and family, I got my passion back. I am now taking more photos, learning lots, and creating some art from these photos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a single parent working 2 jobs, and am trying to make and sell more photographs and art to pay bills. There is very little, if any left over at the end of the month. Sometimes there is more month than money. I was able to borrow some money and find a decent camera that is allowing me to take more photos and create art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to purchase the gear that I need to take more and even better photographs, give me more time to create photos and turn them into art. \u00a0Your funding will help me pay for the software needed to make the art. In exchange I will give you exclusive photographs and art to see, plus the opportunity to purchase art for your home or office."
