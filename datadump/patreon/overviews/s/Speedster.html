    "summary": "Hello there Ladies and Gentlemen, it\u0027s the Speedster here! I am a Content Creator on YouTube who specialises in making video game related content, typically in the form of Countdowns and Let\u0027s Plays but at times I simply make content in the style that I feel best suits the topic at hand. I\u0027ve been making videos like these since I was 14 and can see myself doing this for the foreseeable future. For those curious, I could accurately be referred to as a Scozzie (Scottish Australian) with a weird accent that makes stupid videos on the internet. I like to think I\u0027m funny and entertaining but that\u0027s really up to you to decide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eCountdowns\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThese style of videos are my main deal. Taking a topic in gaming, ranking games/characters/bosses/anything really in a list of 5, 10, 20 or even 100 once (not doing that again) and trying to make the topic as funny, informed and entertaining as possible. These take up the most of my time and are basically the thing that most people watch my channel for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OvxffqLagY\u0026amp;t=125s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OvxffqLagY\u0026amp;t\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eLet\u0027s Plays\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThis has been an on-and-off thing for my channel for a while but as of the last couple of months I\u0027m making this consistent! I set up a game, a capture device and a microphone and show myself playing through a game for your entertainment, my level of competency varying. My Let\u0027s Plays will typically be of me playing through a game for the first time mainly to encourage myself to play different and more varied games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6h44C_Qm20\u0026amp;index=1\u0026amp;t\u0026amp;list=PLNfQsZF5qOkC7n6vgsM6WfJ8h4AMrCts7\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6h44C_Qm20\u0026amp;index=...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMiscellaneous\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAs much as I may try to stay on topic, sometimes I like to make content that doesn\u0027t fall into either of these categories. Whether it be a Highlights clip montage, a review of some sort, a discussion piece or maybe a video based on a topic suggested to me by a Patron, any of these are free game for me to do something on.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNone of this will affect my usual work on my channel. This is simply a method of showing me some support if you feel inclined to do so and would be much appreciated, but content will be made regardless of Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, thank you for reading all this and I hope you have a lovely day!"
