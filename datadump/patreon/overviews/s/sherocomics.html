    "summary": "Greetings Everyone, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You so much for visiting my Patreon page and for your consideration of becoming a patron of Rayven Choi and Shero Comics. My six-part graphic novel series, Rayven Choi, has definitely been a long and winding road to get to where we are now. The story of Rayven Choi, stems from my experiences during a short study abroad trip to Seoul, Korea, while attending North Carolina State University. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisiting Korea was one big life altering a-ha moment for me. I returned to America knowing that I wanted to be a writer and that I wanted to create unique stories and \u0027what if\u0027 worlds that had never been explored before. In 2003, just two years after graduating college, I wrote the first draft of Rayven Choi as a screenplay. One year later, I moved to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting full-time. Those first few years in Hollywood, that Rayven Choi script got me meetings, won awards, and got read by numerous producers, however, it never got made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral years later, in 2008, I walked into a local comic book shop and noticed that the store was devoid of any comics that prominently featured an African-American heroine. By the time I got home, I began thinking that maybe somehow Rayven Choi could possibly fill that void. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSix years later, shortly after a whirlwind experience as a Top 20 finalist in Matt Damon and Ben Affleck\u0027s HBO Series, Project Greenlight, the Rayven Choi graphic novel idea hit me again and this time I jumped at the opportunity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the summer of 2016, Rayven Choi Chapter 1 was released to five star reviews. By the fall of that same year, Rayven Choi Chapter 2 saw it\u0027s release date. Today, Rayven Choi Chapter 3 is halfway completed and is scheduled for release in the fall of 2017.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese past two years, I\u0027ve worked very hard to finance Rayven Choi and the Shero Comics brand myself. I\u0027ve created this Patreon page so that fans of the series can make contributions to help me continue to build the Shero Comics brand while releasing the Rayven Choi series at a much faster pace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you in advance for your contributions and your continued support. I can\u0027t wait for you to see what\u0027s to come with the remaining issues of Rayven Choi and what we have in store for Shero Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Shequeta \u003cbr\u003e"
