    "summary": "Hey folks! I\u0027m excited that you\u0027ve even made it this far! For those unaware, I\u0027m Shado_Temple, a dude on the internet that does the streaming thing on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/shado_temple/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been broadcasting a wide variety of games nearly every night since June of 2014, and look forward to doing a ton more in the future! For the first year or so, this was just a fun little side hobby; something to keep me occupied after work each night. Along comes 2016, and with it, a genuine feeling that this could be something bigger. My adventures at MAGFest, Twitch Con, and of course Zeldathon have made me realize just how much I love this world, and that I want to involve myself with it as much as I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m quitting my day job! I love being an engineer during the day, solving the sort of problems I don\u0027t necessarily get to see during my night gig. And honestly, if I just stuck with streaming games, I\u0027d probably be fine without what I\u0027m proposing here. The trouble is that I want to expand. I want to get to more conventions to meet with you guys, make a greater variety of content (like the recent cooking stuff), and raise the quality of it all. In order to do so, it seems like it\u0027s going to take more than what I\u0027ve got, which is why this plea exists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny sort of pledge you make here can help me get stuff I want to do for you to you faster, and at the quality that you folks deserve (that is, a helluva lot better than I\u0027m doing now). Check out the goals/rewards, and see what you think! If you can\u0027t afford to make any sort of pledge, don\u0027t worry about it. The support you\u0027ve given me so far is ridiculously beyond what I expected going into this, and I can\u0027t wait to see where we go from here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShado_temple\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "If in some sort of fever-dream, alternate-timeline kinda crazy thing we hit this goal, I\u0027d seriously consider going full-on content creator, and knock out the day job to make more time for it all! More game streams, more edited content, more Scienc_Temple, more Apron Adventures, more everything! This would be a major life-changing sort of thing, so I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027d make such a choice as of writing, but it\u0027d be a point where it might end up being worth it.",
