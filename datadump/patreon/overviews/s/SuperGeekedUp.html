It\u0027s virtually guaranteed you\u0027ll laugh so hard during the show you\u0027ll spit our your Bantha milk!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuper Knocked Up\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is our action/comedy series about a female super-villain who gets knocked up by a superhero and has to raise the baby with her nemesis! We have two super-fun seasons online on Amazon, where it\u0027s totally free to watch even if you\u0027re not an Amazon Prime member. \u00a0Check it out on Amazon at bit.ly/SuperKnockedUp or on YouTube at \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/supergeekedup\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/supergeekedup\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonday Night Mayhem\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(Mon - 8pm ET) is our gaming show where we play Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons and other super-fun RPGs live every week!

Join the live chat and help shape the adventure with your comments!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDC Action Hour\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(Sun - 8pm ET) is where we talk all the super-fun DC superhero shows on the CW network: Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, Black Lighnting, and Legends of Tomorrow. \u00a0Hear our thoughts on each week\u0027s shows and share yours in the live chat! Plus we share DC news every week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find videos from our appearances and interviews at Comic-Cons and tons of extra information on our website and YouTube Channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our absolute favorite parts of doing these shows is the huge part our audience plays in them. There is a live chat window going on for every single show. We share viewers\u0027 comments and their tweets LIVE on-air and interact with the audience throughout the show! For our gaming shows, your comments can actually affect what happens in the game! But no matter what you\u0027re geeky about and love, we want to hear about it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you may be channeling Vader and thinking \"Impressive. \u00a0Most Impressive. But how can I help?\" We\u0027re so glad you asked! By making a monthly pledge, you can help us be even geekier in two main ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Your pledges can help us loan R2D2 out from the Rebellion so he can vastly improve our video and audio quality of the show, including switching to a broadcast method in full 1080p HD or better without any kooky webcam hiccups or pixelations. Think how amazing it is to watch the original Star Wars trilogy on Blu-ray vs. VHS. That\u0027s the idea!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Pledging will also help us purchase an X-Wing so we can whisk around doing our show at comic cons around the country and world (how cool would it be landing in front of San Diego Comic-Con in an X-Wing!). Doing Super Geeked Up LIVE at cons on stage is amazingly fun and we get to bring audience volunteers on stage to play our geeky games with us and super-cool guests! We\u0027ve been able to do the show at such epic comic cons as San Diego Comic-Con, Fan Expo Canada, WonderCon, Emerald City Comicon, and Montreal Comiccon. But we also love going to smaller cons so your support will help us come to a con near you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- And if we get enough pledges, we could even get closer to our goal of making this our full-time jobs and do a show every day of the week! As Vizzini would say in The Princess Bride, that\u0027s \"Inconceivable!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re able to help us out, we can\u0027t thank you enough and we have some super-cool perks for you (see the geeky list below)! But even if you just tune into our show and subscribe, that\u0027s awesome and will make you a Jedi Knight!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can\u00a0tune in at the times listed above at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.supergeekedup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.supergeekedup.com\u003c/a\u003e and be sure to subscribe to us at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/SKUWebSeries\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/supergeekedup\u003c/a\u003e!
