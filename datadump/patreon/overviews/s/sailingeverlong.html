    "summary": "Hi, we\u0027re Gerard (G) and Tarryn (T), welcome to our brand new Patreon page! We\u0027re following our dream to sail from Croatia to Australia, just lke G\u0027s great Grandparents over 100 years ago. After a few weeks on our own we realised that the adventure is really best shared, and so we convinced some family and friends that being on a yacht was a great life choice for them as well, and now we have crew!! Karl (K), is with us for a month (he hasn\u0027t booked his flight home yet, so there\u0027s still time to convince him otherwise!), Shannon (S) and Juliette (J) are as free as the wind, and so will go wherever the wind takes them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eT started making videos for her mum back home to follow the trip, and realised that all sorts of people around the world also wanted to come along, via their couches. It\u0027s a real boost having people we don\u0027t even know sharing the journey with us. \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also learning quickly that boat really does stand for \"bust out another thousand\" so we thought that Patreon was a great way for people to be able to support us to eat whilst we sail around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support is greatly appreciated, we are constantly blown away by how many amazing people there are in this world. THANK YOU!!!"
