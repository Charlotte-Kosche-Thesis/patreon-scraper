    "summary": "Hello there, I\u0027m Steven Wilson, and I write music from time to time (albeit I would like to say it\u0027s my full time job even though I have to share my time with and actual job). I enjoy Writing music, be it with a band or just on my own. I have been doing so since about 2005 and I will continue doing so into the future. I plan on uploading 1 to maybe 2 songs per month (depending if it\u0027s a good creative month or not).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write mostly instrumental songs, be it acoustic, full band (drums, bass, and guitar) or ukelele. From time to time, I will be asking my fellow musician friends for a featured spot on a song if I see fit that there should be some sort of lyrics or even a better percussion piece that I can\u0027t seem to write myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a fond believer that the monetization of the music industry is what\u0027s killing great music. That\u0027s why you will more often than not, see a bunch of bands or artists coming out being advertised just to make money, where I feel if you take the money out of the creative process you will get significantly better content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou may ask then\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ewhy am I going through Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs it stands, I will never have my youtube video\u0027s monetized, and any of the funding gained from Patreon is not in any way the reason why I am making music. I don\u0027t write music for the sake of being paid, I write for the sake of enjoyment for myself and others. As I see it, as long as there is at least one person who likes what I am doing and that makes them happy, I am doing something right.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support me with your patronage?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGood question. If you like what I am doing, send me a pledge, even if it\u0027s $1, every dollar helps. If you are worried about amount of content, when signing up for a pledge you can set it to how many times you would like. For example, you can set it to pledge a maximum of twice a month, if i upload more than twice you will only be pledging twice and won\u0027t have to worry about the extra content. Helps keeps your balance in check =D. If you financially cannot pledge and would still like to help out, you can always share my work to friends, family, social media, etc..\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
