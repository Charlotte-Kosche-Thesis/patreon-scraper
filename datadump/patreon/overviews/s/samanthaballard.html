My name is Samantha and I play the harp.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love video games, anime, and pop music, so put the two together and what you get is my YouTube channel - harp covers of all kinds of music, focusing on the nerdy side of the music scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is Patreon important?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027ve started this Patreon page is this: I love creating harp music videos, and I want it to always be free for my fans. But, as a professional harpist, I can\u0027t justify spending tons of time on YouTube videos that take hours to make (writing arrangements, practicing, recording, filming, editing) that I don\u0027t get paid for. To pay the bills, I have to spend time on other repertoire, gigging, etc. By supporting me through Patreon, you allow me to spend more time on my YouTube content, resulting in more frequent and higher quality videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Please note: I will only ever charge for music videos. I will not charge for updates, Q\u0026amp;A videos, or videos where I\u0027m just talking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money will directly support me as an artist, allowing me to make Youtube a larger part of my career. So far, thanks to my patrons, I\u0027ve been able to upgrade my audio recording equipment, increase my uploads from once a month to twice a month, and even help pay off a new harp! In future I\u0027d like to upgrade my video equipment and hire videographers to help me make better content. You can help me do that with your support with just a few dollars per video I make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGenerally I upload twice a month, or roughly every two weeks.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, if you can\u0027t afford to help, please don\u0027t feel you have to! My content will always be free, so only lend a hand if you feel you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me, thank you so much! It means a lot to me. If you can\u0027t or choose not to, thanks so much for watching my videos and supporting my music that way! I love each and every one of my supporters, regardless. Just think of Patreon as a tip jar: I\u0027m very grateful to anyone who drops in a few coins, but I\u0027m also very happy to play for anyone who happens to stop by whether they pay me or not, and I hope I\u0027ve made their day a little better. :)"
