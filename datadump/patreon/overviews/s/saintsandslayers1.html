    "summary": "My name is Andre, I\u0027m a painter, Illustrator, musician, and writer. I believe everyone has a story to tell, I have 140+ stories I\u0027d like to tell but lets start with one at a time to \u00a0maintain sanity. I\u0027m currently working part time to keep things moving and I graduated college. Of course you know what happens after graduating: debt, bills supply and equipment costs \u00a0that never seem to cease. but I\u0027m sure you\u0027re not here to read my complaints so I\u0027ll keep it simple. I\u0027m producing a short film called \"Ambergris\" . I\u0027d like to provide more details but I\u0027m a \" show, don\u0027t tell\" kind of guy. I\u0027ve tried applying for grants and other funding sources but thanks to our \" current political situation\" funding has been cut and I\u0027m out of luck, and so I\u0027ve come to patreon. Anything and everything helps. Patrons who\u0027re will to spare $1 will have access to over 200 pieces from rough drafts to character concepts, patrons willing to spare $5 can get early access to some of my material before it\u0027s posted, and for patrons generous enough to give $20+ will receive access to published and unpublished work, a top slot on my list of \" Top Patrons\" and A top spot in the credits. I\u0027d like to publish at least 2 short films and pitch my series this year and with you generosity anything is possible . I\u0027d like to take a chance at pitching my work to Frederator Studios or Cartoon Network. I will try to come up with an uploading schedule starting with Tuesdays and Thursdays, then Monday, Wednesday and Friday. \u00a0If you\u0027d like to request a commission please feel free to contact \u00a0me and I\u0027d be more than happy to fulfill the request.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to check out my instagram page: saintsandslayers1\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. Pardon the terrible quality of the video i was done on an android phone then quickly uploaded. I was still using a run down windows xp computer.\u003cbr\u003e"

Lets break away from that downward spiral and \u00a0tell stories, make art, music, change the world for the better. I\u0027m a painter, musician, storyboard artist and more. A lovely hobby of mine is writing stories and scripts. I\u0027ve been through years of terrible events, witnessed death first hand, lost everything I owned 9 times, but not once did I ever give up on making someone smile. I may just be a guy from New York but I\u0027ve lived in many places and seen more than what any human should ever see, lived through a few tragedies, but there will always be someone in a worse situation. I won\u0027t say much more but my time is limited and I just want to tell my stories before time\u0027s up. Will you help me?",
