I guess I\u2019m the ultimate devil\u2019s advocate. But sometimes that will come off as being argumentative. I am a single parent who raised my 2 youngest teenage boys, Alex and Cody. My oldest son Matt is married. He and his wife are the proud parents of my only grandson, Lucas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was an infantry officer in the US Army, traveled extensively as an international mountaineering guide, ran for the US House of Representatives, been imprisoned for civil disobedience, been shot at, drank some beer and was present when the fat lady sung. I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and an MA in theology. I am an adventure junkie at heart. I love to travel, ski, camp, hike, mountain bike, Tae Kwon Do, mountain climb and sailing!I own a flight school, where Matt and I teach aerobatics, unusual attitude recovery techniques and tailwheel endorsements. Flying is in my DNA, but so is sailing. I am now on a multi-year sabbatical planning a world circumnavigation sailing trip to begin in Fall 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen sailing I find my creative juices flow, and some of my most productive projects occur. Maybe it is the calm that is boat life that opens your mind to adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
