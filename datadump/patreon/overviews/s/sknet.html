One of the cornerstones of\nour community, and the reason we have been able to keep it to such a high\nstandard, is that we have access to very reliable, 100% accurate translations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany have\ncontributed to our Berserk translations over the years, but the one who\u0027s done\nthe most is undoubtedly\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.skullknight.net/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=167\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePuella\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. And not just translations of entire episodes, but titles, summaries, comments from Miura, both questions and answers in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.skullknight.net/forum/index.php?topic=9513.msg166308#msg166308\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eour 2009 interview with Miura\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and all those last-minute demands from\nAazealh and Walter. Few are the things she does not participate in behind the\nscenes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, after more than 10 years and as many volumes, health problems and an increased workload make it\ndifficult for her to hold the same pace, the same dedication she once did.\nEspecially since as a professional translator, working on Berserk is essentially\n\u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e work after she clocks out of work. Beyond that, there is also a feeling\nthat maybe not many people really care. Some have expressed their gratitude, but they\u0027ve never been given the chance to show more than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we\u0027ve decided to ask our community to assist in giving a little bit back to someone who\u0027s helped us tremendously over the past decade. It\u2019s a way to show true appreciation for all her work, and to show that we care. The money we raise here will help ensure that we continue to have the best translations around for Berserk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePuella\u0027s translations\u00a0have always been without peer, even when compared to the officially licensed localization from Dark Horse. From mixing fate with causality, failing to translate Japanese words like \"Hanafubuku,\" making up phrases (e.g. \"Sword of Resonance\") when it becomes too complicated, and generally just mistranslating things and confusing readers (e.g. Flora\u0027s line about the beherit and its master in volume 24), the examples are too numerous to count, and they litter our forum, as our regular members know. But we can only emerge from that confusion because we have our own translations for reference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Donate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis fundraiser is\nfor fans of all things SKnet. If you\u2019ve enjoyed our forum and support what we stand\nfor, we encourage you to donate. If you want to read a new Miura interview, we\nencourage you to donate. If you want to read about Miura\u2019s earliest works,\nnever before translated, we encourage you to donate. Finally, if you care about Puella\nand all that she\u2019s done for the site, we encourage you to donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTranslations are the rallying point for this cause. But it\u0027s also a chance to be showered with SKnet forum perks. So to sweeten the deal, we\u2019re\nusing this opportunity to roll out forum rewards that some members have asked\nfor over the years, along with a few ideas we came up with in the process. I\u0027ve\nnever wanted to run a site with a paywall. That\u0027s why these rewards are\nstructured as perks that add to the experience of browsing the forum, and don\u0027t\nlimit features that are already there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEveryone will benefit from\nthe projects being funded. They won\u2019t be placed in a \u201cmembers only\u201d area. By\ncontributing and helping these projects come to life, particularly the yet-to-be-translated\nMiura interview, you will be helping every Berserk fan understand the series,\nand the creator, better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese donations will recur monthly.
