    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey there friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Keith, or as most know me on the funny little thing called the Internet, \"Sages\". For nearly 4-5 years I\u0027ve been creating videos on Youtube based around games. You know, that thing where I play a video game, talk over and pretend to be important. Yeah, that! I create silly little let\u0027s play videos for my own enjoyment... and maybe yours as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver those years, we\u0027ve grown quite a bit. The channel has garnered 40,000+ subscribers and nearly 16 million views in total. Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever gotten this far if it weren\u0027t for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo give the simplest of explanations, my real job of recent has been cutting hours due to budget restraints. I\u0027m not close to losing my job by any stretch but a lot of what I can do for the channel is impeded by the constant slashing of hours. This is why I\u0027m turning to you for help, not only to continue with the quality we have now for the channel but also to expand it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdd to the fact that Youtube and it\u0027s upkeep are quite expensive. I spend a lot monthly to ensure our channel retains a lot of what it always has. From games, to programs and components, I spend almost all I make off youtube and put it back into the channel. This means that in some way, we\u0027re limited by the views and budget allotted to us. I want to try and break the boundaries, fund new adventures and try to create new series for those who are willing to put the time forward with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, a lot of this cannot happen in the current climate of youtube. I have a fanbase, but I rarely make much off youtube aside from the occasional up spike in views. Imagine the possibilities we can create and not deal with analytics or those limitations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe channel has been about audience interaction for awhile and I believe firmly that you guys can help, along with Patreon. I want to expand further and if this goes well, I could even cut down on hours at work and focus more of my efforts on my channel and the content I wish to create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
