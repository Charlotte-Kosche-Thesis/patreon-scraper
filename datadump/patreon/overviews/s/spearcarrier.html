There are just too many things I want to do in life! On the one hand, I\u0027m an amateur actress (mostly for fun while I take classes for voice acting). On the other hand, I\u0027m a 2D artist and author with aspirations to make animation here and there. These passions culminated into me running my own publishing company, The Writers of the Apocalypse, and have been doing so for years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I changed my main artistic focus from \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theheavenlybride.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Heavenly Bride\u003c/a\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ea short story entitled Strings Below\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. The Heavenly Bride isn\u0027t finished, but it\u0027s also not very popular - and to be honest it hit me real hard when I discovered people were reading it to steal the pages without giving even an ounce of emotional support. Being taken for granted and used can really dampen creativity, so I removed most of the comic from it\u0027s home on the internet. Now recent HB releases can only be found through book store outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery night I take at least an hour if I can to work\u00a0on my current novel, \u003ca href=\"https://writeon.amazon.com/read/story/K._J._Joyner_The_Demonkeeper%27s_Daughter/amzn1.ignite.story.3e36205310b024b3e0530100007f2c3b?ref_=ign_m_st_st_0\u0026amp;segment=amzn1.ignite.segment.3e36205310b224b3e0530100007f2c3b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Demonkeeper\u0027s Daughter.\u003c/a\u003e  I only work on this at night, and it\u0027s coming along nicely while I don\u0027t burn myself out.
