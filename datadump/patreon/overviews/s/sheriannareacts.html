    "summary": "Hello, I am Sherianna and I create videos on Youtube specifically Anime and Anime Movie reactions (will consider TV shows and non- Anime Movies in the future too), Book/Manga reviews, Novel Writing videos etc but I\u0027m currently struggling financially especially after my father passed away, me and my mum have been a bit short on cash as my mother is just a housewife and I\u0027m still a full-time University student. Also, unfortunately, a huge sum of money was stolen from my bank account and my bank\u0027s refusing to refund that money meaning I\u0027m very short on cash at the moment but I highly appreciate just $2 per month to be given because at least I can continue making Anime reactions for your enjoyment and that way, I can afford better camera equipment as headphones and cameras often need changing after a couple of months of use and as a reward, you will receive a shout out on a video too. If enough Patrons pledge $2, $5 or $10, I will consider doing more quadruple reactions instead of triple reactions for your enjoyment. Also, social media promotions for all pledges $5 and above but you MUST message me what site/channel to promote :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I have been planning and writing my own Novel series and am currently working on book one but this is a LONG TERM project so my rewards of giving a FREE Ebook or Signed Paperback copy will take a few years to finally give to you as the whole editing and publishing process takes a long time- especially since I\u0027m going for the traditional publishing route but I PROMISE from the bottom of my heart that I will stick to all those rewards and will keep a track of everyone\u0027s names, whoever becomes a Patron. I never break promises, that\u0027s my Nindo, my Ninja way! In regard to editing, professional Novel editing such as Novel Critiques and Line Edits cost a huge amount of money like on average $500 for Novel Critiques and $1000 for Line Edits so I need your help to fund a LITTLE bit of this please. Any pledge is greatly appreciated! The main goal is to just be able to afford better camera equipment such as a digital camera, lighting and editing software.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to summarise clearly:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALL Patrons will receive EARLY ACCESS to my Full Movie Reactions for two weeks BEFORE everyone else on Youtube get to watch it as well as receiving updates regarding my Novel such as book cover reveals, release dates, book signing events etc and they will also be the FIRST ones to read the FIRST DRAFT chapters of my Novel if they are Patrons for months July/August/September.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$2: More reactions + a SHOUT OUT to you on video + EARLY ACCESS to Full Movie Reactions and Novel Progress/ Publishing News.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$5: More reactions (more quadruple reactions will be considered if you choose this option) + a SHOUT OUT to you on video + one social media account promotion\u00a0+ EARLY ACCESS to Full Movie Reactions and Novel Progress/ Publishing News.\u003cbr\u003e$10: More reactions + a SHOUT OUT to you on video + social media account promotion + FREE Ebook copy of the novel once it\u0027s published\u00a0+ EARLY ACCESS to Full Movie Reactions and Novel Progress/ Publishing News.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$20: More reactions + SHOUT OUTS to you on video + more social media account promotions + FREE SIGNED Paperback copy of the novel mailed to you once it\u0027s published. Although you must at least pledge this for two months to be eligible for it. Also, get EARLY ACCESS to Full Movie Reactions and Novel Progress/ Publishing News.\u003cbr\u003e$30: More reactions + SHOUT OUTS to you on video + more social media account promotions + FREE SIGNED Paperback copy of the novel mailed to you once it\u0027s published AND a Novel-themed Postcard sent to you with a personal thank you on it from me. Although you must at least pledge this for two months to be eligible for it. Also, get\u00a0+ EARLY ACCESS to Full Movie Reactions and Novel Progress/ Publishing News.\u003cbr\u003e$60: More reactions + SHOUT OUTS to you on video + more social media account promotions +FREE SIGNED Paperback copy of the novel WITH merchandise (a Bookmark, Postcard and one other more expensive piece of merchandise) mailed to you. Also, get\u00a0EARLY ACCESS to Full Movie Reactions and Novel Progress/ Publishing News.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf anything needs clarifying, just ask me and even $2 can make all the difference in the world so thank you if you decide to help me (and my mum) in the long run, you guys are amazing and ALL Patrons receive shout outs on my videos regardless of what reward is chosen as well as ALL Patrons receiving EARLY ACCESS to read all my FIRST DRAFT chapters of my upcoming novel before anyone else does although you would need to be a Patron by the time I upload those (probably in July/August) as well as receiving EARLY ACCESS updates regarding my Novel like finding out when I get a Literary Agent, Publishing Deal and Official Release Dates, you\u0027ll be the FIRST ones to know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys are amazing. THANK YOU SO MUCH and thanks for always supporting me throughout the years on my Youtube channel \u0026lt;3 Links to my social media accounts are available on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
