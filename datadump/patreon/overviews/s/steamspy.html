Steam Spy automatically gathers data from Steam user profiles, analyzes it and presents in simple, yet beautiful, manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://steamspy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam Spy\u003c/a\u003e is designed to be helpful for indie developers, journalists, students and all parties interested in PC gaming and its current state of affairs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hobby project, so to continue to support and improve it I need your help. Your money will go into paying my server bills, expanding the site and adding new features.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eSteam Spy pulls data every minute, but updates visializations only once a day at night (03:00 GMT), so there is no point in refreshing it more often. The data is based on several days samples: from three days for individual apps to seven days for location-based info. It means that Steam Spy is completely unreliable for recently released games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis service relies on data provided by Valve and, well, sometimes Valve Web API servers do not work as intended. So you might see missing or wrong information here and there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that Steam Spy extrapolates data from limited number of user profiles and thus isn\u0027t 100% correct.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat will you get for your support?\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027m posting my updates here first and you\u0027ll be able to see some stats before everyone else. Think about it as collection of interesting Steam-related trivia. Some of my stats, especially related to revenue aren\u0027t posted outside of Patreon at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also get an extended Steam Spy access to more historical data and some additional charts. You\u0027ll need to register on Steam Spy with your Patreon email for this to work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the most important thing here is that I\u0027ll be able to continue to support and improve Steam Spy, get a new server for it and give everyone access to more data.\u003cbr\u003e"
