    "summary": "I love teaching. I especially love teaching topics that are challenging - like workshops to explore tools to cope with the aftereffects of sexual trauma, or discussing the role of privilege in sexuality education \u0026amp; how to make it more accessible, or how to re-evaluate our relationships from a perspective of personal empowerment. And while I get a number of opportunities to teach, almost none of those opportunities actually ends up as a \"break even\" for me; many events can\u0027t offer more than a basic registration cost, and while some are able to cover travel, the cost for meals, lost time from other paying work, etc. becomes far more than what I can afford to subsidize.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love coaching, especially folks who are already dealing with being marginalized, and especially folks who are dealing with chronic illnesses. And those folks, usually, are folks who can\u0027t afford to go the \"professional coaching\" route (which can cost upwards of $100 an hour, even more if they\u0027re looking for help with starting or running their own business).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, it means that I have to pick \u0026amp; choose when an event asks me to teach, or someone reaches out to me for coaching. As someone who is self employed, I don\u0027t have a cushion of either paid time off or extra spending money that might keep me from going into financial deficit in order to present. If it comes down to my financial ability to cover costs, I would very literally teach only at local one-day events, with one or two events per year thrown in.\u00a0 And in terms of coaching, to make room for someone who is in need, I have to either \"discover\" time in my already full schedule, or take away from paying work (see also: no paid time off!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where the Patreon comes in. If you want to help make sure that I can offer my education skills to events and organizations that can\u0027t afford to cover my costs, or to small groups that have zero budget for education; or if you want to help me offer coaching to more people that can benefit from it (and who can then go out \u0026amp; make their own worlds even more amazing), your patronage can help me make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon sponsors will get some cool intangibles! If there\u0027s event schwag that I get, y\u0027all will be the first folks I offer it to (including any additional comps or discounts). If you\u0027re at one of the events I\u0027m teaching at and you let me know that, I\u0027ll bring you a treat (likely baked or handmade from my kitchen or crafts). You\u0027ll get early peeks at new classes in development. And you\u0027ll get info from me on where and when I\u0027m teaching, and how your support is tangibly helping me do that. You\u0027ll get to know how many coaching sessions I\u0027m able to offer at drastically reduced rates (or for free). You\u0027ll get a substantial discount on any coaching that you\u0027d like (and if you know someone who can\u0027t afford coaching, send them my way and I\u0027ll make sure they\u0027re at the top of my list). And you\u0027ll have my undying gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to do a single donation rather than a recurring one, you can reach out to me directly at sarah.sloane@gmail.com for ways to help. And if you have any questions, please let me know!"
