Then I met some friends at the climbing gym and did my first lead sport climb ever. From there I ended up joining a climbing club (in Utah ironically) where I learned even more about climbing, aid climbing, mountaineering, canyoneering, and so on. I love learning new things so I also like to go mountain biking and sailing from time to time. So needless to say, being outside has changed me immensely and has been an ongoing passion that I don\u0027t expect to ever quit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca\u003ewww.SheDreamsofAlpine.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eis a blog that is creating quality content for climbers, adventurers, and outdoor enthusiasts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s for those of you who are continuously hungry to learn more and adventure often. Its\u0027 for those who aspire to get out of their comfort zones and do something they never imagined. I wanted to find a way to pay it forward, so to speak, as a thank you to all of those amazing friends I\u0027ve met along the way who took me under their wing and showed me that there is no such thing as average. Life can be as exciting as you make it, and I\u0027ve learned the mountains have a lot to teach you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy collaborator and life partner is named Michael Auffant. He is an extremely talented photographer/videographer, and even more importantly a great friend and supporter.

The student loan companies have plans to get payments 30+ years, but we are determined to cut that in half or more in any way we can. Our current plan has us paying the loans off in a little over 6 years, but that estimate is conservative considering a lot can happen in 6 years and this estimate assumes a fixed circumstance. In this time frame, we can expect to pay an additional $50,000 in interest. As you can see, we have a dedicated plan to hopefully get this debt tackled, but will greatly appreciate any support from Patrons who find value from this site and enjoy what we are putting out in the world. We would love to turn 6 years into 2 or 3 years, and we would love to reduce the additional amount of interest paid to lenders. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e100% of supporting Patreon funds will go to paying off this student loan debt.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cannot begin to thank you enough for taking the time to read this, and if we are so fortunate, for you supporting us.\u00a0In the end, this blog and these trips are our passion and we are happy to share with our readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eAllison + Michael\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShe Dreams of Alpine \u003c/strong\u003e+ Badass Collaborating Climbing Boyfriend Partner\u003c/em\u003e"
