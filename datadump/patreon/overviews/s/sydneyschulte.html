My pronouns are she/her/hers. I have degrees in English and Magazine Journalism. I love reading and hope to eventually find myself working as a copy editor in the book publishing world. I\u0027m more than a little dog-crazy, but currently own a cat named Salem. I also write\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/OtakuOkami/pseuds/d0g-bless\"\u003efan fiction\u003c/a\u003e from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Backstory\u003c/h3\u003eIn my last semester of college, I took an English class about reading and writing comics. I\u0027m not the best artist, but I like to think I can write a good story. When I wrote and drew my final project\u2014a 5-page comic\u2014my peers had nothing but good things to say. One comment stuck with me for days: \"Are you going to continue it?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve finally decided that I am going to do more than continue that comic. I\u0027m going to re-write and adapt it into a young adult novel. Not only will I write it, but I also plan to go through an indie publishing route.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy read this story?\u003c/h3\u003eYA Paranormal Romance literature sucks. It\u0027s almost always about two straight cisgender teens in a modern setting. The girl usually enters the \"magical\" world of a boy who saves her. More often than not, the guy\u0027s a jerk who really doesn\u0027t have all that much going for him. Then the girl ends up with some crazy OP magic she never realized she had or shouldn\u0027t have, etc, etc. Let\u0027s also not forget that all YA Paranormal Romance covers look the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy story isn\u0027t going to have those things. For starters, it\u0027s going to be focused on the romantic relationship between an accidentally adopted werewolf and her lesbian \"rescuer.\" By rescuer, I mean this girl adopted a werewolf at the animal shelter and has no idea her dog is a werewolf. There\u0027ll be angst and heartwarming moments. And no love triangles! Not to mention I\u0027m going to fight off LGBTQ+ stereotypes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere needs to be more LGBTQ+ representation in literature as it is, and especially in YA. It needs to be normalized and not fetishized or thrown in as non-main characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy support me through Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003eMost modern writers cannot survive off of their published works alone. I\u0027m currently trying to find a post-grad job in proofreading or editing. Basically, your patronage will help me not starve and save up for a new apartment whenever I do get that shiny new job. Not to mention you\u0027ll get some nice extra preview content if you support me!\u003cbr\u003e"
