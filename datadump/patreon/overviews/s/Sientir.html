    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Ben, though I usually go by Sientir on the Internet. I like thinking and talking about things that interest me; analyzing ideas, concepts, and systems; and learning from others and their perspectives. That\u0027s why I started my weekly podcast series, which I call \"Sientir\u0027s Ramblers.\" In this series, I talk about many different topics that I\u0027m passionate about: theology, game design, philosophy, society/culture, and politics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means a lot to me and proves that this sort of sharing of thought has value. For that, I thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour financial support also gets you more access and content. Exactly what you\u0027ll get depends upon which tier you choose. You can read the summaries to the right; I also have more details about each tier listed below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that everyone knows what to expect, I want to note that audio recordings for reward tiers will have what I consider a minimal level of editing\u2014I\u0027ll trim off silence from the beginning and end of the recordings and tweak the overall volume, generally by running a compressor over it (which smooths out volume differences). This contrasts with the Ramblers themselves, where I also go over the audio, primarily to remove long pauses, random noises (like coughing), and the occasional \"um\" or \"uh.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a final note, tiers are progressive, meaning that all rewards in a lower value tier are included in a higher value tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with that, let\u0027s go over the tiers themselves!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. $1 USD \u2014 Conversationalist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis tier is all about incorporating you into my Patreon community. This means several things: Access to patron only posts, a louder voice when giving feedback (as compared to non-patrons), and access to a Sientir\u0027s Ramblers Discord server (where I\u0027ll be often hanging out).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that I make two posts to Patreon per Rambler released. One of these is a public audio post (which does two things for me; one, it lets people who may choose to follow or drop by the page see my content; and two, it enables me to provide a download of the audio). The other is a private post just for Patrons where I embed the YouTube video release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. $3 USD \u2014 Bonus Thoughts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan for this tier is to solicit suggestions for topics that I\u0027ll then curate into a reasonable poll, then you all will vote on the poll. The winning option is what this monthly bonus podcast will be about. If there aren\u0027t a ton of suggestions, then all of the suggestions may make it into the poll. Also, depending upon how much I have to say, I may talk about more than one topic. Finally, as this is specifically for you folks, I\u0027ll especially want your feedback on what you want from this monthly bonus podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. $5 USD \u2014 Dear Patrons... (Also $10 USD \u2014 Easy Generosity)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this tier you get access to frequent audio diary entries. These will be about whatever happens to be on my mind when I record them, so they may be about a game I\u0027m playing or some social issue that is particularly on my mind at the moment. They also will likely get more personal, as I expect I\u0027ll discuss personal struggles or joys. As such, I consider this tier to be the heart of this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith these, I\u0027m also ending them with a Bible verse of the day (whatever BibleGateway\u0027s verse of the day is, for convenience of selection, for those who are curious how I\u0027m choosing them). I\u0027m ending with them so that those who want to skip this section can do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe frequency I\u0027m aiming for is daily. There may be times when specific things (such as a vacation) may prevent me from recording these. If that happens, I\u0027ll let you know ahead of time. Also, life may sometimes get in the way. I do anticipate releasing a minimum of 15 a month, for those that want a more concrete number.\u003cbr\u003eI also expect the length of these to vary considerably, but the minimum I\u0027d expect is around 4-ish minutes. I may occasionally truly ramble for some of these, though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. $13.37 USD \u2014 For Some 1337 Fun!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary thing you\u0027ll get from this tier are the monthly \"songs\" I\u0027ll be making with my Yamaha keyboard. As long as there are patrons at this tier, expect the \"song\" to be released in the first half of the month, along with a poll for whether or not to publicly release the song at the end of the month. Don\u0027t expect these \"songs\" to be skillful. They\u0027ll sort of be to music what abstract art is to paintings.\u003cbr\u003eI may also on rare occasions release other (silly or experimental) content for patrons of this tier, but such things shouldn\u0027t be anticipated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I want to note that, while this Patreon doesn\u0027t directly support the creation of additional content I may make (such as Game Review \u0026amp; Analysis podcasts or my Let\u0027s Program series), it does support me, which means it indirectly supports all content I may create, but such indirect support comes with no guarantees.\u003cbr\u003e"
