    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello friends of the internet!\u003c/strong\u003e I run a gaming channel on YouTube that covers video game analysis, speculation, and nostalgia. It\u2019s pretty much my attempt at chasing my passions and reliving the fond memories of my childhood. It\u2019s a lot of fun, but as you can probably imagine, a lot of work. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this from many other creators too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nEverything you see on the channel passes through my hands.\u003c/strong\u003e In some ways, I guess you could consider me a one man army. I have to brainstorm the ideas, research the ideas, make sure my ideas aren\u2019t absolutely crazy, write the script, record the voiceover, film/animate/edit the video, and then polish it up and present it to all of you. As you can imagine, this is a pretty lengthy process. Especially when you have to go through a game to find specific footage for the video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nThe truth is though, the life of a content creator isn\u0027t what it used to be.\u003c/strong\u003e We live in an age where many people use ad blockers to protect themselves online. But while they are protecting themselves, they are also harming those of us who use advertisements to make a living\u2026 and living off advertisements is already super cutthroat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nOf course, that\u2019s where your support can help.\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon offers you a way to financially support the creators that you love, so that we can continue to make awesome stuff for all of you. Even if you can only give a dollar, know that it still means the world to me. Also, if you can\u2019t offer anything financially, please know that your support is still appreciated. Even by subscribing or sharing my videos you\u2019re helping me out a great deal, and for that, I will always be thankful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPerhaps as time goes on I can bring someone on to help produce more videos, but that is still a while down the road. The journey will be long, but definitely well worth it. Thanks for coming along, and thanks again for everything.\u003cbr\u003e"
