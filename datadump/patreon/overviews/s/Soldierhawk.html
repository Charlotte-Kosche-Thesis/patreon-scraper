My videos (mostly Let\u0027s Plays) can be found on\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SoldierHawke\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e my Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0You\u0027ll find my latest video linked at the top of this page as well.

This is because (and I imagine this is no shock to anyone) pay \u0026gt; hobbies, even ones I love as much as LPing for you guys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! To solve this problem, I decided to give this Patreon thing a shot, to see if I can make enough to post videos and articles (yes, articles! Remember those?) on a much more regular basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever it turns out, I appreciate the viewership you already give me. Reading your comments is a constant source of joy for me. Thanks for sticking with me through thick and thin, and I look forward to taking the next step of this journey together and seeing how it turns out!"
