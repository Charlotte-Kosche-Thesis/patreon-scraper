I have found that when you commit to something, the \u0027Universe\u0027 seems to respond. In a bit of kismet, shortly after starting this project, I found that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://florabowley.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFlora Bowley\u003c/a\u003e (the artist who created the one painting course I\u0027d ever taken) was starting a new course:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://florabowley.com/online-learning/creative-revolution-ecourse/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Creative Revolution\u003c/a\u003e, to help make creativity a part of every day! This course, and for me particularly the Art of Aliveness component and The Wayfinding Guide companion workbook created for the course by\u003ca href=\"http://www.anyahankin.com/\"\u003e Anya Hankin\u003c/a\u003e, set me on the path to clarifying my thinking and got me in touch with what really matters to me. It helped me see what I wanted more of in my life and how to make that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realised Artists are also ground breakers. Envisioning better ways to live is what we do; what artists throughout the ages have always done. Both on a personal basis and on a community, society, or global scale, it is the artist who challenges the status quo, who is able to imagine and bring to life a vision of the future for themselves and others.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"Artists\n to my mind are the real architects of change, and not the political \nlegislators who implement change after the fact.\" William S. Burroughs\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe National Endowment for the Arts found this to be true in their study and report on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.arts.gov/publications/how-do-creative-placemaking\"\u003eCreative Placemaking\u003c/a\u003e. I am also inspired by the work of Doug Franscisco and his\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://artspacelifespace.com/\"\u003eArtspace Lifespace\u003c/a\u003e projects. (Have a look and be inspired yourself!) In the back of my mind, I am incubating ideas on how to do something similar in my area - perhaps a project for next year.\u00a0 Shared creative space and community, in combination with Basic Income, seem like two pillars of a healthy sane society. Seeing what is possible in my area is something I will be exploring in the background this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this Patreon account continues to evolve as I refine ideas and the focus on what I can do to make a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am still painting.  I will still continue to paint.  I am an artist, it is what I do.\u003cbr\u003eI am still a Basic Income Advocate. It is what I believe in. The one thing that would make the largest difference to the most people.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have struggled somewhat reconciling a personal pursuit with work that I feel \nis so much bigger. Especially as my own art isn\u0027t currently in direct service to Basic\n Income. (Unlike the great work done by\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/UBIVisuals/posts\"\u003eUBIVisuals\u003c/a\u003e here, for example.) But ultimately, the whole \npoint of a Basic Income is to free people to be able to do the work that is in their hearts. So, I\u0027m following mine, trusting that it will lead me in the right direction. Each and every person who can do this is putting all of us one step closer to the world I want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eCreating the world you want to see\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eAs artists, it is our job to respond to society and the world we live in, take inspiration from, and use as the raw materials of our creations.  It is our job to hold a mirror up to that society: show its beauty, its ugliness, its pain, and its joy.  It is also our job to show what we - as a society - might be, what we can be, what is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cDon\u2019t ask what the world needs.
