    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eHello,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Shelby Robertson. I\u0027m a professional ComicBook, Film, and Video Game production artist with over 20 years experience in doing art full-time as a contracted professional. Properties I\u0027ve been extensively associated with in comics range from flagship titles owned by Marvel, Image, previous Malibu, Entity, Verotik, several dozen Indie publishers, and my very own American Dischord creator owned characters. In film and gaming, I\u0027ve over 15 years combined experience in designing characters, storyboards, and environmental assets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon is to further my abilities of producing artwork and self publishing my CREATOR OWNED Projects. Currently I am focusing on the release of Madam Satan: Deadly Orgins, which is a project I successfully Kickstarted last February. Madam Satan is a collaborative effort which spans dozens of pages and keeps on growing as a project. After that I am excited to finalize the work on issues 4, 5 and 6 of my comicbook series \u002794. \u002794 is a property that commemorates my extensive work as an artist in the \u002790s comicbook marketplace, taking everything that was cool about that era of comics and making them fresh again. As a subscriber you will be directly involved with my ability to continue to produce the kind of stories I want to tell and help me be able to bring those stories to a larger audience. I am posting regular videos of my process for everything from Sketch Cover artwork to Interior Page design and even Digital Coloring process for pages and pin-ups. Another goal of mine is to open a door to other creator owned projects through American Dischord as a publishing house, hopefully, eventually becoming a flagship title of their own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon with be focusing almost solely on my creator owned work, albeit a traditional pin-up from time to time for new sketchbooks and cover design for more American Dischord comicbooks. Sketch cover videos generally feature licensed characters due to my abundance of blank sketch covers from major property comic publishers and the demands of my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am beginning work in March 2016 on a Comic sized art book full of creator owned work/published work and free use characters.  Every other week I will be drawing and coloring a piece and will post videos of every step of the process. If I miss a post at any time due to my avid comic book convention schedule it will be made up via double posted artworks the following week. Patreon members will also get to vote on which characters and certain levels will get limited edition prints of the works featured through this, my Patreon! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny person who pledges for at least 6 months out of the next year (March 16-17) at the 5 dollar or above level will get a FREE Patreon Exclusive copy in May 2017 which will contain both line-art and full color versions of every piece featured in the art book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging you are directly responsible for helping me get these books produced. Even a 1 dollar pledge is appreciated more than you could know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course without question, all subscribers will also have access to top of the line food porn imagery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
