I am a pixel artist that wants to keep the art style alive and create amazing art for everyone to enjoy! I also dabble in music and getting my hands into traditional/digital/none video game animation. So hopefully I will do more than just deliver.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, it is my goal to create as much of an influence on the stance of pixel art that i can and strengthen the stance that pixel art has. With about 7 years of spriting experience, I would say that I am a pretty great pixel artist, and an okay artist at least. But there is much to learn, so how about I show you how hard I want to give the best art possible?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSprite Star Galaxy Discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/6MKA4av"
