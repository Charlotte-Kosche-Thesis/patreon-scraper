Nothing in my mission for MefightClub has changed, but the need for it today has gotten that much more urgent, and my commitment to our principles that much stronger.

Over the years, we\u0027ve grown to have thousands of registered members, and in 2010 I launched a companion gaming weblog, \u003ca href=\"http://levelsofdetail.net\"\u003eLevels Of Detail\u003c/a\u003e and a gaming-centric Metafilter-style linkblog, \u003ca href=\"http://gamefilter.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGamefilter\u003c/a\u003e, which I relaunched in 2014. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a community, we value friendship, kindness, \nopen-mindedness, generosity, and scotch.

To make MefightClub and even greater success than it already is, in other words. I have a lot of ideas, but I do need the resources to make them happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYour contributions will go toward the following, in order of priority:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Domain and server costs and upkeep for MefightClub and other MFC network sites.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Paying contractors to help with server maintenance and coding.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Stipends for MefightClub moderators.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Dedicated game servers for our members.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Future MFC site network expansion projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Paying an editor and contributors for LoD.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Some income for me (for the first time) out of any excess funds available.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\n more you are able to contribute, the more time and energy I am able to devote to MefightClub, including both front-end and back-end stuff, and will hopefully put some money in my pocket as well, beyond just helping to defray expenses. Ten years in, I still haven\u0027t taken a salary or anything, but that\u0027s just fine. Covering expenses always has been and remains the priority.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Is It Important\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving a place on the internet, and a community of thousands who support it, a place that is a haven for adults who love gaming to get away from the dumbness, \nracism, sexism, homophobia, and general hurrrr of much of the rest of \nthe gaming world: that\u0027s a valuable thing. In a larger gaming world that is still trying through the efforts of many good folks to try and shake off the legacy of the bad old days, making a stand for inclusiveness and tolerance is important. Having fun, and having fun without having to worry about being exposed to abuse and crudity, is important. Being able to talk in adult ways with other adults who share a pastime that is too often dismissed as the province of kids (or males, or hetero- or cis- or white folks) is important.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a strong aversion to advertising, and continue to resist that as a \u0027monetization strategy.\u0027 Although the MFC Amazon affiliate program I\u0027ve been running for several years does bring in a few dollars a month, it isn\u0027t really enough to pay for the kinds of things I hope to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not meant as an ultimatum in any way. I cherish the MefightClub community, and I will be 100% honest with you: I will, as I always have done, spend as much time as I am able making MFC Network sites the best they can be, regardless of how much money is pledged. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy dream remains, as it has been for years, that I might be able to give up my day job and do this full time, rather than snatching away hours where I can to work on things. As supporters, you can make that happen. Either way, though, I thank you. I love you all.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
