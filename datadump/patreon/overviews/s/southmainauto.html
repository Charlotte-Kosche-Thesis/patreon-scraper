    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As all of you know it takes a tremendous amount of time to create, edit and publish the videos we put out each week. With that being said, having a family and running a full time automotive repair business also take a tremendous amount of time (and patience)! In an effort to continue our educational, funny and informative automotive repair videos S.M.A. has decided to join the thousands of other creators on Patreon! Many of you willingly donate to the S.M.A. channel through the donation tab on YouTube and often do so going unnamed. Let it be known that it does not go with out thanks! We appreciate each and everyone of our subscribers and their sacrificial giving! However as of February 28, 2017 YouTube will no longer allow users to support their favorite creators through the donation tab. None the less, YouTube has been an amazing journey for both Mrs.O, myself and our family. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027ll be honest, I never saw this coming the day we rolled out our first video. Then something amazing happened! THE PEOPLE WATCHED IT!! So I made some more... THE PEOPLE WATCHED MORE!! And long story short here we are today. It is my goal to use Patreon to help keep the SMA Channel a FREE Channel on YouTube and allow those of you that give sacrificially to continue to do so and also allow others to help support us!! THANK YOU ALL for making South Main Auto Repair what it is today! Heres to the future!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Eric and Vanessa O."

I grew up in the automotive industry (in my parents shop) and have over 17 years (working full time as a mechanic) experience repairing domestic and Asian cars and light trucks. This is all I\u0027ve done my whole life. It\u0027s my hope and desire to produce videos that provide accurate information saving you time and money while sharing my love for fixing cars, my knowledge and my experiences with you as I travel through automotive repairs day to day in the shop and perhaps make you smile along the way!",
