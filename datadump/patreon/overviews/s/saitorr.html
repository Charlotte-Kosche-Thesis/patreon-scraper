    "summary": "Hey everyone! Your friendly neighborhood SaiTorr here. Several years ago, I started a YouTube channel with one simple purpose: to entertain people in the form of gaming videos. Though the types of videos I\u0027ve put out overtime have changed drastically, that purpose has never once wavered.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo SaiTorr, why do you have a Patreon if you already collect ad revenue from YouTube?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell here\u0027s the thing. YouTube is absolutely a great platform for virtually anyone to get noticed for virtually anything. That provides a powerful opportunity for talented content creators (like myself ahem). But YouTube has some problems when it comes to properly rewarding creators for their content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor instance, if you disable ads (which you have every right to do) that can prevent me from collecting ad revenue on a video. To further complicate things, YouTube will sometimes punish creators for using copyright content in their videos (even when it isn\u0027t violating fair use guidelines) and will demonetize content it deems inappropriate for advertisers without warning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis subsequently affects my ability to continually deliver content that meets the standard of quality my viewers have come to expect from me. Videos take longer to put out, newer games take longer to acquire, and putting out videos turns into a chore rather than a mutually rewarding medium.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what if I told you there was something you could do to change this??\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right!! There is!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar you donate to me here on Patreon will go directly towards putting out better content on YouTube. That could mean affording new software, hardware, games for streaming, review, and analysis, props for videos, and most importantly, raising the sheer quality of every video put out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy pledging to support my YouTube channel, you are ultimately ensuring a better future for the channel, full of entertaining video content that I PROMISE will make you smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have no reward for patrons set out, but this is something I am working on very very soon. I would be honored if you choose to donate and support the channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all your support thus far viewers. Here\u0027s to a hecking amazing future of the channel and a succesful Patreron campaign!\u003cbr\u003e"
