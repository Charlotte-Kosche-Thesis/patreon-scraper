    "summary": "I have been writing tales of powerful warrior women for over twenty years, though I have only recently begun to share them. A great many more are sitting in scrapbooks, waiting to be written and eventually illustrated. To bring these Amazons into our world I need help offsetting the costs associated with expanding my 2D and 3D content libraries, acquiring graphical tools, mastering new skills and techniques, and programming \u0026amp; hosting a role-playing game server and client apps. Your patronage will help improve the quality as well as the rate at which I upload this new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy completed works (art and stories) will continue to be available for free via deviantArt and other channels. Patrons will have behind the scenes access to bonus materials, writing scrapbooks, and works in progress, as well as a chance to provide feedback/suggestions during the creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also have exclusive access to the game server during alpha and beta testing; plus in-game credit (Karma) for every penny pledged to this fund, available as soon as the game moves into the public release phase. (Testers will also receive an allowance of free Karma during the test phases, and will be allowed to retain their balance when the server goes live.) Karma may be used at any time in game to reshape the gaming world - adding or changing content, augmenting characters, or reshaping the flow of history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent nearly as many years developing a role-playing system that unifies the physics we observe in the material world around us with the metaphysics we believe but cannot test in the abstract world of thought. For example, Telepathy and Quantum Entanglement are part of the same phenomena - two entities overlapping and falling into synchronicity in thought-space, irrespective of physical and temporal distances in our universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be releasing more information on the game as development progresses. For now my primary focus will be on fleshing out and illustrating my backlog of Amazon stories and artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past nine years, I have been slowly producing and uploading content to deviantArt. If I were to continue pursuing this as only a hobby, 90% of these untamable\u00a0women would never see the light of day. I am ready to become a full-time content producer, lest all these heroic tales end with me, their epic\u00a0deeds forever unsung.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
