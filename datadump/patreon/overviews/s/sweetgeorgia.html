    "summary": "Thanks for being here! I\u0027m excited to share with you the dream that\u0027s been in my heart for years now. It\u0027s about craft, it\u0027s about colour, and it\u0027s about to come to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFelicia Lo \u00a0// \u00a0committed to colour mastery in craft\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDriven by an insatiable desire to \"make \u0026amp; do\", I\u0027ve been immersed in the fibre arts (knitting, spinning, dyeing, weaving, quilting, and sewing) and writing about it all since 2004. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 12 years ago, I founded SweetGeorgia Yarns, an artisan hand-dyed yarn company, and in 2013, I was invited to teach \"Spinning Dyed Fibres\" on Craftsy.com. Two years ago, I started \"The SweetGeorgia Show\" podcast, and this past year, I published my first book with Interweave Press, \"Dyeing to Spin \u0026amp; Knit\" which details the process for dyeing your own as well as knitting and spinning with hand-dyed yarns and fibres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Dream \u00a0// \u00a0School of SweetGeorgia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe big dream that I\u0027ve been working on in the background for several years now is an online school for colour and craft. Translation... I\u0027m making video-based craft workshops on topics like dyeing protein yarns and fibres (like wool, cashmere, camel, alpaca, and silk blends), dyeing cellulose yarns (like linen, cotton, and bamboo blends), natural dyeing, hand-painting warps for weaving, spinning intentional yarns for socks or shawls, and working with colour in knitting, and \u003cem\u003eso much more\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ve been gripped by this idea for \u003cem\u003eyears\u003c/em\u003e now and am to the point of bursting, I\u0027m SO ready to put this together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, back in 2015, I even recorded the video here about starting this project and then put the project on hold at the very, very last minute. I was expecting baby #2, writing the book for Interweave, working on the podcast... and the timing just wasn\u0027t right. Time and time again, I had to put the dream on hold. But this dream just won\u0027t fade away.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the start of this year, I made a commitment to myself that I was going to \"hit publish\" on this project come hell or high water before the end of 2017. I alluded to it on the podcast in January, and again in March, when I put the podcast production on hold specifically so that I could work on this dream project over the summer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027ve been thinking... I don\u0027t just want to launch a fully-finished \"school\" in the fall. That wouldn\u0027t nearly be as much fun as sharing with you the creative process behind building it \u003cem\u003ewhile I build it\u003c/em\u003e. And so, rather than wait until I have the whole thing finished, I want you to join me as I work on this dream project. I\u0027ll bring you behind the scenes and show you how I\u0027m figuring it all out... all the fun and exciting bits... as well as the crazy and challenging bits too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus and my desire is to do what I have always done... be passionately curious about creating colour and then documenting and sharing how I\u0027m doing it. My mission and the mission of SweetGeorgia is also the same as it has always been... to share the joy of colour and craft.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. If you are passionate about knitting, spinning, weaving, dyeing, and colour and want to see me create video-based workshops for the fibre arts, I would love for you to join me in creating this online learning community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support of this project is my encouragement and fuel to make it happen! But to be clear, I\u0027m making this online craft school. It\u0027s happening. Won\u0027t you join me for the ride?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Plan // Hand-Dyeing and Colour Mastery Course Development\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first video-based course that I\u0027m working on is in hand-dyeing yarns and spinning fibres with acid dyes. Everything from dye safety and setting up a dye workspace to immersion dyeing and handpainting yarns. A second video-based course is about mastering colour theory and might be offered together or separately with the dyeing course. The goal is to make a very comprehensive and detailed course with close-ups of the dye techniques and processes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Patreon Perspective //\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, SweetGeorgia already has a website, blog, Ravelry group, YouTube channel (well, the start of one), Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter... so I understand, it seems like this is just \u003cem\u003eone more thing\u003c/em\u003e. BUT, I\u0027m using Patreon as a space for building our community where we can connect and engage about these new projects that SweetGeorgia is working on. Your participation (at \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e level!) is a vote of confidence in me and what I\u0027m making. And it gives me a way to connect with you and discover exactly what it is that makes you excited about the fibre arts. And where you and I overlap, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be making.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime is a precious, precious currency and it\u0027s incredibly important to me that we all be spending our time in a way that brings true joy to our lives. Your support on Patreon tells me that what I\u0027m making is valuable and important to you. Whether its hand-dyed knitting yarn or the podcast or this new online craft school, it\u0027s your voice and participation that makes it all worthwhile. Thank you so much for your support!"
