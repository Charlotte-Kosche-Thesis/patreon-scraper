I\u0027ve made videos\nabout companies mistreating their employees, or companies avoiding taxes.

At the second funding goal, I\u0027ll no longer be required to work that day job. With my newfound 8 to 10 hours\na week (and an extra safety budget padding added to the goal,) I can use that time creating a new, original podcast with a team of two regularly and fairly paid co-hosts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can maintain the second stretch goal over the coming Fall, I \u003cem\u003ewill \u003c/em\u003ebe starting a new podcast by the end of the year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eStarting this channel has been the best decision I\u0027ve made in my life,\nand I\u0027m really happy with how it\u0027s turned out.
