    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eGreetings Sexy Souls\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I share with you my vision with \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, let me first tell you my WHY on this planet. After the \u003cstrong\u003e#metoo movement\u003c/strong\u003e, a lot has changed for me. After seeing more men and women share their story of how they also experienced rape, sexual harassment, and/or incest, I realized there is a demand for high-quality sex education. While we get our sexual education by porn or experiencing losing one\u0027s virginity, it\u0027s rare to hear one say, \"I learned tons from this one teacher in 6th grade. I learned so much from how to put a condom on a banana! Mind-blown\" (sarcasm). Instead the old models of education especially in the Western culture are mainly through porn or experiencing it. The result for some is unexpected pregnancies, higher chances of getting an STD or STI, and a negative relationship to one\u0027s sex life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I know this?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides also experiencing rape from the age of 7 til 13 by my stepfather, it created a spiral of negative decisions and experiences. I went from a joyful little girl raising her hand and loving the idea of talking about boys and kissing. Eventually after feeling like I failed my family in college and getting a \"career\", I gave up. I eventually got into \"sex work\" specifically my personal favorite was a \"dominatrix\". I loved the feeling of control. I loved the feeling of getting my power back. Unfortunately, I chose to work with the wrong crowd. I chose to work with villains in the industry who lacked integrity. The villains made me hate myself and my relationship to sex. With a lack of mentors, I was on a hunt for a solution of the highest good. Somehow my curiosity lead me to a world of sex educators, healers, and leaders. I felt like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz seeking the Wizard of Oz. While in the film the Wizard of Oz, that character seemed a false prophet, in my case, I discovered various mentors and guru\u0027s that inspired me that I can also share my experiences, lessons, and tricks I learned a long way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Vision\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs the title of my page is to create videos of conscious sexuality, the intention is to eventually invest in the best sexual education. As a sapiosexual and minimalist, my main investment is myself in order to show up for my clients, and create impact in the world. What does this mean for you? Currently I am building a community around conscious sexuality on Facebook, and creating online digital courses that are affordable to everyone. As a latina or woman of color, I feel there is a lack of this education and resource for the community. The resources in the community are usually Planned Parenthood, and getting most of their information from close friends. Now social media is a primary vehicle, and even Garry Vaynerchuk who has built a household name around the importance of why everyone needs to jump on the band-wagon of the social media train, I am ready to jump very high. My plan and intent is to step-up my leadership and create more videos where it ignites, inspires, and moves others like me to start having integrity, fun, and self-expression with their sexuality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes me rare?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBesides coming from life experience and also being the first to attend college in my family on my mom\u0027s side, what makes me rare is my distinct imagination. What makes me rare is my unique ability of being a creator, innovator, and manifestor. I am true to my word, and do everything I can to make an impact with my presence. We all have values of positivity, focus, and responsibility, however, it\u0027s rare when it comes to sex. As their are more voices and people sharing their story of metoo, then the next question is, \"what\u0027s next?\" It is easy to have a conversation, and the difference between verbally speaking one\u0027s truth is creating an impact into the world, especially the classroom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat have I accomplished so far?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo far I have created 5 YouTube videos, and planning to create more videos in 2018. The goal at the moment is create 1 video per month and planning to create a lot more. Also I have created 2 events this year. My first event was an all women\u0027s Tantra event. These women learned everything from meditation, dancing, emotional freedom, and tantra. After all these women shared how inspired they were to show up more for their children, lovers, and co-workers. My co-ed event focused more on Tantra, intimacy, and creating a relationship to themselves. Finally, I lead a short class with Destin Gerek. One of my gifts is connecting with amazing superhumans. What makes Destin Gerek unique besides his transformational work with men of high caliber, is transforming men\u0027s relationship to sex, power, and relationships. To speak and lead next to a legend in the sex-positive community meant everything. In addition, I was also featured on a few podcast and blogs. My favorite podcast interview was with Alexa Martinez who is building a community of 1K+ members and has interviewed legends on her podcast, and planning to connect, learn, and co-create with more educators to bring those tools to low-income families.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s next for 2018?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith your support to create this DREAM come true my intention is to write a book, travel to Bali, attend Afest, and create more videos and events. My 31st birthday is December 28, 2017 and will turn 30. While a lot of people want tangible things, my deep desire is to travel and have the ability to go deeper within in my healing journey in order to create more videos, content, and event for all of you. I once heard someone say while a lot of people want to \"change the world\" however,\u00a0 some people instead live in two categories. Some of us live in the world of consumers and the other is creators. My intention is to be a constant creator, and to create this I ask your help to make my dream come true with any small donation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo check out what others say about me, go here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://erikabriones.com/testimona/\"\u003eTestimonials\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
