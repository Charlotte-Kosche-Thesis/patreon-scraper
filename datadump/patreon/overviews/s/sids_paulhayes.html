Please help me in any way you can. Money, your time, your expertise, your network. I\u0027m sure if you landed on this page you can help me either raise awareness of SIDS or raise donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebtw... this is in no way easy for me to do this publicly. Those who know me well enough, know that deep down I am a very shy, private person. I don\u0027t even know what to expect when my closest friends and families discover this page. I hope their reaction is to start their own page, and realise that to setup a page like this in 2017 is actually really really easy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReach out to me if you want need help setting up a patreon page btw because I have access to some great tools like Stencil that makes all this stuff super easy. That\u0027s an open offer to any visitor to this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess I hope this sparks a few others to do something similar too..."
