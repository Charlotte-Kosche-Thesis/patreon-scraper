I know, weird, but true. We\u0027ve been at this for almost 8 years. With the help of Mike, Klaus and Natalia, we\u0027ve produced over 150 episodes and we regularly rank among the top 100 podcasts in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, according to Wired Magazine. That\u0027s absolutely not true at all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nWell, the simple answer is money. It costs money and takes lots of time to keep the podcast going. There are costs like website and podcast file hosting, audio equipment, and all kinds of other incidental expenses. Through the years we\u0027ve spent thousands of dollars\u00a0on this thing. Most of those dollars were mine, of course. Those cheap bastards!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eListen, no one is going to get rich here. We just need help paying the bills, buying equipment, and \u003cstrong\u003egrowing the podcast\u003c/strong\u003e. We want to travel, do more interviews, try out live shows, and video content. That\u0027s why we are on Patreon, to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about advertising?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eOur attitude, irreverent sense of humor and my crass personality are key ingredients of the podcast, right? Well, the truth is that our antics have alienated us from a lot of potential advertisers. I\u0027m very proud of that. We have not compromised what we are about. However, that means, that we can\u0027t rely on ads to sustain the podcast. Ocasional\u00a0advertising may continue, but it\u0027s been our experience that the inconsistent and sporadic nature of traditional advertising does not work for a podcast like ours. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill the podcast still be free?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes.\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely! We hope you will donate, but if you can\u0027t, or just don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s cool with us. Just enjoy the podcast. If you can\u0027t give monetarily, maybe you can help in other ways, like spreading the word to friends, buying\u00a0 jerseys or whatever merch we may offer, supporting us on social media, sending us feed back, giving us good reviews on iTunes or Stitcher... all that crap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn behalf of Mike, Klaus, Natalia and myself, we\u0027d like to say thank you for listening and for all your support. This crazy thing is about to get way better!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- SkullKrusher"
