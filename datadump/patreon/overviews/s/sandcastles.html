    "summary": "In short, I\u0027m an experienced writer. I\u0027ve been writing in my spare time for the last decade or so, I\u0027ve made an \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps\u0026amp;field-keywords=heranes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ee-book\u003c/a\u003e on Amazon, and I have a \u003ca href=\"http://luffy316.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e that\u0027s full of commissioned works and original short stories by me. I have some more legitimate pet projects and done various writing jobs on the side, but I\u0027m looking for a way to excuse myself to do some more random fun smut with a story. I\u0027ve been doing some writing on 4chan threads to some pretty huge response, both to the narrative and the sexiness of it, and by the time people were declaring waifus out of my stories and laughing at the jokes as much as they were aroused, I feel like it\u0027s something I can invest more time into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy specialties\u003c/strong\u003e: female wrestling (got a lot of my early commission work from freecatfights.com), strong female characters (literally), big women, shortstacks, unique body types/unconventional beauty, big boobs, slice of life/comfy stuff, dialogue, strange love/signs of affection, and mismatched pairs/couples,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for those I\u0027m already selling my writing to who find this: I\u0027m still honoring all my deals, and I\u0027m still taking on new customers as you please for specific works, private or public. This shouldn\u0027t affect my normal writing. This is something to do while I stretch in the time between my more hard-working moods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s all this!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to be writing casual, multi-part stories on a regular basis. Not so much fan fiction, but largely original smut stories. This idea was kind of built on shortstacks (short but curvy gals, usually of another species) and ladies wrestling, but I\u0027m trying to expand my writing a bit and very open to suggestions. The final say is up to me in terms of what\u0027s offered, but you\u0027ll always get something that, if I\u0027m doing this right, should make you smile and chuckle on top of give you a good feeling down in your genitals of choice. NATURALLY, all donors MUST BE OVER 18. This gets dirty.\u003cbr\u003eFor a master list of all my posts, feel free to browse through here: \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jYHSZ4hAbyrRQHDh6VxiTwl1NqWiJ-c7Vz4QfyjAzo/edit\"\u003ehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/16jYHSZ4hAbyrRQHDh6VxiTwl1NqWiJ-c7Vz4QfyjAzo/edit\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do you get!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, anybody who throws a dollar in says \"Yea, I like this guy\u0027s stuff!\" It makes me so grateful that I let you access everything I post on here. Any basic stories I post are yours to peruse as you please. And I know it\u0027s going to happen, but please minimize how much you share it around the web. I\u0027m not asking much, but a \"Go check out this guy\u0027s stuff\" helps. \"Here\u0027s a stash of all his stuff\" does not. Besides, the more being paid per month, the better for everyone! More on that in a moment.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, anyone is free to comment and shout out on the Patreon page and you know what? I am a sucker for praise and ideas. I\u0027ll read them all, even the angry ones, and if an fun enough idea is dropped on where to take the current story or a future idea, I might just end up writing it for you all as part of the monthly shipments of smut.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you step up to 2 dollars, you get to vote on what\u0027s posted. I\u0027ll have a few ideas up at a time, give it a week or so, then start posting based on the results. No guarantees that if you vote for a sexy gargoyle that it won\u0027t end up being the shapeshifting girlfriend story, but your voice matters. Then again, you can always up your odds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating 5 money-dollars a month, you get a bonus vote and some exclusive content of my bigger stories. When you vote for content, yours counts twice as much. When you vote, just namedrop your vote in a comment, email or message, and I\u0027ll tally that into the math.\u003cbr\u003eEven more demanding? 10 dollar donors get VIP treatment, and get 5 times the vote. \u003cbr\u003e-\u003cbr\u003eAt $20, you\u0027ll get some grip on the steering wheel. You gain the power to propose a single topic for the vote poll every month, so you request an option and see if the fans back it up. Mind you that you can get the 5 times voting power, but only towards other options than your own to keep it fair. Voting for your own counts as 2 instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$25 gets all of the above, or you can simply pick one item on the monthly polls that is guaranteed to get written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $35 a month, you get my personal contact info on a messenger of your choice and we\u0027ll work out your choice: either a brief story or description, or a couple hours of a scene or character roleplayed with/for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re super supportive and want something more specific, you can donate 50 a month. Get everything above (view it all and VIP vote treatment) and you get a specific, personal short story written for you. They\u0027ll average about 5 pages, and some extreme content may get turned down and asked for another idea (I\u0027m pretty thick-skinned by now, so just keep it legal, folks). Pee? Robots? Fur? Time travelers? Fanfics? Sure! May not be my cup of tea, but you EARNED that $50, sir or ma\u0027am! You spend it on what you want! Feel free to ask me for other jobs if you want a longer or more involved project, or if you want to see if I\u0027ll write what you want for this level\u0027s donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStretch Them Goals!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if it\u0027s not for a tier, you might want to consider donating more (don\u2019t look at me like that; I said MIGHT; I\u0027m not you, man)\u003cbr\u003eAs we start getting higher, I\u0027ll spit out more content. Whenever everyone together reaches $50 a month, I\u0027ll bump up the output: 4 stories of full size guaranteed per month, and I hire on artists to draw out a scene from my stories (also voted on by the group) every other month. If we reach $100 a month, then I\u0027m going to bring in other artists on this EVERY month. I know a few reliable ones I\u0027ve worked with before and will look for more, but I know that myself and others would love to see some art of the scenes I paint for them. A portion of your money will be passed from me to some hungry artist who will draw some suggested or highlight scene or character from the stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for stopping by, keep an eye out for some content, and be ready to vote for your favorite.\u003cbr\u003e"
