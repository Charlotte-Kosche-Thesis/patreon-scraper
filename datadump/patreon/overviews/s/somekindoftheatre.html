By covering our basic costs via Patreon, we are hoping that there will be more money to go around our casts and crews at the end of each production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo everyone who\u0027s supported us so far - by coming to see our productions, donating to crowdfunding campaigns, following us on social media - thank you so, so much.\u00a0 It\u0027s a clich\u00e9, but we really couldn\u0027t do this without you.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSKoT x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
