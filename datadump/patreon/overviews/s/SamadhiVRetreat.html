I arrived at it three times, during our practice, and I haven\u2019t been the same ever since. Whatever happened to me, followed me into the next day. I\u2019m noticing things that never made an impression on me before. Small things seem wonderful. This morning, without any meditational effort on my part, I looked out the window and saw the rain falling, some birds flying, the wind blowing, and the trees swaying, simultaneously, all in the same moment of time, and it captivated me. I experienced Samadhi all over again. It feels like some huge spiritual door has been opened to me, because of what I experienced as a result of our practice yesterday. Thank you.

Now I have vanished. Living in divine nature, seeing you in divine nature, this is the truth. I have so much to say and nothing to say at the same time. These words were already embedded into our hearts at the beginning of time, just expressed or said differently. Sit and be still, listen to your mind, that\u2019s the Source calling like an echo on a mountain top. Can you hear it? Ye are gods! Yes, you, him, her, every atom, we are all connected.

A friend invited me to the Buddha service and I said \u201cwhy not\u201d. After only a month of practicing my breathing exercises and my meditations, I\u2019ve discovered that my entire spiritual journey was meant to lead me here. The mindfulness I\u2019ve developed in my Buddha services has really awakened a more conscious side of me to fully live in the moment and be entirely aware of life has now become the only way I choose to live. --Esteban A. 9/14/16 Boyd Unit, TDCJ, Prison Ministry\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour teachings have helped me let go of a lot of things I did not know I was holding onto: anger, frustration, resentment, also, self-hatred, et.al.

In fact, in discovering how to be free anywhere and putting it in the perspective of: FREEDOM being a \u2018mental state of being\u2019, I\u2019m not really looking forward to being paroled.
