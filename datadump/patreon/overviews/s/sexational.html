I\u0027m hoping to document some of that experience with journal entries and pictures. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been self employed full time since the beginning of 2015. Patreon donations function as a way to pay for content on \u003ca href=\"http://www.sex-ational.com/\"\u003ewww.sex-ational.com\u003c/a\u003e that would normally require a sponsor, for the work that goes into recording audio to help make their work more accessible. \u003cbr\u003e-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Goal: \u003c/strong\u003ehopefully, one day, Patreon support will help pay for equipment that will help me achieve my dream of being able to become a working photojournalist covering social issues, highlighting the work of amazing people throughout the world, and more.
