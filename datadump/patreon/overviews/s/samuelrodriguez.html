I went on a handful of housing project trips with my church in high school, and from there, things really took off. In the spring of 2013, I set out on my first solo adventure. I went to an orphanage in Chiapas, Mexico that my Aunt in Uncle in Mexico City support. I was there for about 2 months and that was the first time I really realized that is what I was going to be doing for the rest of my life. After that, about two years later I went on another solo adventure to Oaxaca to an orphanage that my cousin had previously been involved with. I was there for some time and from there I actually ended up at the orphanage that I\u0027m currently at in Tijuana called City Of Angels. The first time around I stayed at City of Angels for about 3.5 months and then had to go home because we had to shut down due to some government complications and we weren\u0027t totally compliant with a bunch of safety\u00a0regulations. After I left I went back home and bounced around for a while, I went to college and started working. After I finished school I moved back to Oregon where I continued working in marketing. I bounced around for some time until I finally made my way back for a visit to City Of Angels. After about a month of being here, I was quickly reminded that this is what I wanted to do full time, so I quit my job and have been volunteering here since September of 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy should I support your mission?\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally truly I wish I didn\u0027t need any financial help. I am a man of very simple taste, as I do not require very many things to be happy. But, adult life is deciding otherwise. I have bills to pay and a two-year-old dog to feed! I am also in the process of renting an apartment and need a ton of help with that! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
