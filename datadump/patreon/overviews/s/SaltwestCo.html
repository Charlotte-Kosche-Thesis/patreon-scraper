Our short-term goal is to sail to Mexico within the next year.  This is the first country where we\u0027d like to be able to give something more than just our \"tourist dollars\".  Our plan is to become involved in smaller communities to assess their needs, and make donations to worthwhile causes! And this is where you can help us make a meaningful impact on the lives of people in need!! We will be donating 20% of all patron contributions with an initial goal of $1000 per video which will give us the ability to donate $200 per week; that will make a meaningful impact for the chosen causes (maybe the local library needs money to purchase new books, or perhaps the school sports team is in need of new equipment for the children, or the community centre needs money to build a ramp for better access to the facility, etc.).\u00a0We want to bring you in on the action!!  Our \u201cPatrons\u201d will get to vote on where the donations go in the communities we visit and do outreach in, to decide what cause you\u2019d like to see your contributions go toward!!  This is a great way to get directly involved in both our fun travels, fun content, and making positive contributions in the places we visit!!
