On my channel you\u0027ll see some of my crazy laser inventions, as well as other cool science stuff including chemistry, pyrotechnics, and even giant moths. I try to keep my content pure by avoiding product placement and relying only on my AdSense earnings to fund my projects, and have been able to build some awesome stuff using these earnings. That being said, I know I could REALLY step up my game with some extra cash, and have some CRAZY projects in mind that I know I could pull off with some extra funds. Know that if you decide to help support my projects, every penny I get from here will be funneled straight into my work and you\u0027ll get to see some bigger and badder stuff! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is still under construction, so my first donors may have to wait a few days before they can see their benefits. :p\u003cbr\u003e"
