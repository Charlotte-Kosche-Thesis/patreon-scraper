In my works architecture is important character, but not the one. In perfect way, I press the button on my camera at that moment, when my imaginary world is close to real world around as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003eAfter the exhibition \u201cGolden Generation. Modernism in Finnish Architecture and Design\u201d in the Hermitage. I had the idea to do a big project about Finnish architecture. I am not interested in the city sights, I want to create an alternative map of interesting places in the cities. After each trip, photos will also mark on the map where they were made. The first city in the list will \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahti\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLahti.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn gratitude for the support of all the material will be published here in the first , and some only here, thanks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2.downloader.disk.yandex.ru/preview/3da8d71eb068dad86f2b99a7006415f01c31c699aeab3836e3b48afed38068fb/inf/oo4-nujJDR2caQgt6q-lZJtqGcfNiMpN2QmBkQw17mR0r8dGKhtdwJgS-YCqQhHO_LTm4q1NovYzsK4FWLrl2w%3D%3D?uid=7729202\u0026amp;filename=111.jpg\u0026amp;disposition=inline\u0026amp;hash=\u0026amp;limit=0\u0026amp;content_type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026amp;tknv=v2\u0026amp;size=1163x717\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAbout how it all started.\u003c/h3\u003eTalking about my formation as a photographer, it would be better to start with things which have inspired me and made me to start paying attention to architecture and urban space around me.\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, it\u2019s a cinematograph. Two movies, which have inspired me the most are \u00abMetropolis\u00bb by Fritz Lang and \u00abBrazil\u00bb by Terry Gilliam. Actually, modernist architecture is a perfect background for many science fiction films of 1980s.\u003cbr\u003eThe second important component of my inspiration is music, from Bach to thrash metal bands. When I find a pronounced rhythm in music, a rhythm of architecture comes to my mind immediately.\u003cbr\u003eThe third think for me is a \u00ablucky neighborhood\u00bb. One of well-known buildings of Soviet modernist architecture, Research Institute of Robotics and Technical Cybernetics, is located close to my home in St. Petersburg. I think, this building is a successful combination of futurism and its external activities, That is why I want to point its influence.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/99c8f5983e18a19f04c305642d6dbc56/tumblr_nbzjtwBQT11sk1e67o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I started taking pictures of architecture eight years ago, and this building was my first one. During this years I tried to shoot it about twenty times. At first, it was just graphic black-and-white pictures of the facade elements. But finally I made a picture which I was satisfied with. It happened last year, after so many years of trying.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lacittanuda.it/contest2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis picture got the second prize of the photo exhibition in Turin.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAbout modernist architecture.\u003c/h3\u003eI was always attracted by aggressiveness and grotesque forms of modernist architecture. Sometimes I imagine that this is some kind of modern fortifications, not houses. Actually, I perceive architecture mostly in visual way. Maybe that is why my pictures are different from how architects do that.\u003cbr\u003eBut now I\u2019m beginning to get interested in social background of modernist architecture and urban spaces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a69TTw5UMSoJTK9i_tDq6At9wZZ0_vqNR5YuDu16qNLTzhBxNUmL3O-foqKC\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/a44ee2a143c8e17c89df6a71180c9917/tumblr_nbzjovgmBl1sk1e67o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/aa23e18f554aca0f3a9d16531f8fde12/tumblr_nbzjacYU7H1sk1e67o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/3df56556b8ecab0095e4de7e7bcc4578/tumblr_ocix8wFri91sk1e67o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fvVNXhE7xYZ93Gw8SitxubIQlFwE_LLzkXxOmy9YNTvRh273QTKdYEjiqDxR\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/232a10db9ad750e44593c2b068a0e0da/tumblr_nrkteeCqgt1sk1e67o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
