    "summary": "I do everything in my power to bring you great content day in and day out on YouTube, however my resources are not endless by any means. I could use the help of my wonderful, dedicated viewers and subscribers to help fund the creation of quality content on SGU. \u00a0I have been blessed to be able to call running this great Channel my \"job\" for the past few years, but things have gotten a little complicated of late and putting in the hard work and constant content hasn\u0027t exactly paid off in the same way during this last calendar year. With the help of your pledges I can continue to bring you the latest and greatest sports gaming action from new releases and old favorites. You can help widen the catalog of games that we can cover by helping to fund the purchase of new games and DLC updates, etc. With your help I can improve the quality of my recording and live streaming hardware/software including microphones, vlogging cameras, recording devices, etc. Most importantly you can directly help me to remain in a position to bring you FULL TIME consistent daily content and maintain the level of content that you have come to enjoy on Sports Gaming Universe."
