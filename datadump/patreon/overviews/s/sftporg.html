    "summary": "Science for the People is an organization of scientists, workers, educators, and activists dedicated to building a social movement around progressive and radical perspectives on science and society. SftP members use bottom-up strategies to build a science-activist organization that:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ebuilds internal parity for marginalized, oppressed, and exploited peoples\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003erecognizes labor in science and works to organize the science workforce\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eresists the use of science for exploitation, oppression, profiteering, imperialism, war, and environmental destruction\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eseeks radical solutions for problems of energy, environment, agriculture, public health, and workplace safety\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eopposes sexism, racism, homophobia, cisgenderism, ageism, and ableism in science and society\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe original\u003cem\u003e Science for the People\u003c/em\u003e arose in 1969 out of the anti-war movement and lasted until 1989. With radical analysis and non-hierarchical governing structure, \u003cem\u003eScience for the People\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0took on the militarization of scientific research, the corporate control of research agendas, the political implications of sociobiology and other scientific theories, the environmental consequences of energy policy, inequalities in health care, and many other issues. Its members opposed racism, sexism, and classism in science and above all sought to mobilize people working in scientific fields to become active in agitating for science, technology, and medicine that would serve social needs rather than military and corporate interests. They organized in universities and communities, published a magazine offering sharp political analysis, and sought meaningful scientific exchange internationally in Vietnam, China, Cuba, Nicaragua, and other countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the issues we face today have changed in important ways, but fundamental questions of power, ideology, and democracy in science remain. Since 2015, SftP veterans have collaborated with a new generation of SftP members to explore the history of radical science and to rebuild the publication and movement for today. We are rebuilding\u00a0\u003cem\u003eScience for the People\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to organize scientists, activists, students, and scholars to face these issues head-on in research institutions, universities, and communities. We are creating a new\u00a0\u003cem\u003eScience for the People \u003c/em\u003epublication to promote analysis from radical and progressive scientists, to cover the issues facing science and society, and to help build out our movement from the bottom up. With your support, we can\u00a0grow a scientist-activist network and publish the analysis of the thinkers and leaders in our movement.\u003cbr\u003e"
