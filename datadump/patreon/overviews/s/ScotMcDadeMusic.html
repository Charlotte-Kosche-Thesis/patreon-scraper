    "summary": "Scot McDade Music is on Patreon! - Launch Campaign Video\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m one of those curious musician types that explore many worlds of music, from Eastern, to Spanish and Classical guitar, to Rap and Heavy Metal. Anyway, all of this stuff that I\u0027ve become interested in over the years has been stirring around in my thought pot (my skull), and is now spewing out all over my condenser mic. So in other words, I\u0027m creating a whole bunch of music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027ve made this page is, the world of music (professionally) is quickly becoming more and more uncertain, financially speaking (and I guess that then means, creatively speaking also).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that MANY fans out there are trying to support and pay for the music they like. That\u0027s why they\u0027re willing to pay for subscription services like Spotify, or even are willing to buy the music outright with CDbaby or Itunes. But the problem with this is, once the music is made and goes through all these middle men, we musicians and composers are left with not enough to live on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy is this a problem? Well, eventually, we will be forced to no longer pursue a professional career in music. This means our quality of product will never reach a world class standard, and it also makes music a viable career choice ONLY for those who can afford to pay for their child\u0027s success. Music is for everyone, and everyone should be empowered to have whatever career they see fit for their own values. And with Patreon, we may be able to create that opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027m a performing musician. And with Live venues becoming more and more scarce along with mounting touring costs, and less payment for my actual gigs. Your contribution will enable me to tour and perform more frequently across Australia, and hopefully one day across the globe too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd above all else, it will help me keep up with the maintenance costs of my gear and instruments. This in turn will help me produce BETTER MUSIC! Both live and recorded :-o\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is incredibly exciting for me. I love the act of making and performing my music. I also love learning, arranging (or re-arranging) cover songs too. I just really love music, and I wanna make you dance, sing and play to the music I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in supporting my musical journey you should check out the rewards tiers :-D\u003cbr\u003eBUT BY NO MEANS feel obligated to make a pledge. My music videos and Soundcloud uploads have, and always will be, free. And it is an absolute joy to make this music and share it with you. If you have a couple of bucks to spare each month and want to help become a Patreon of my music THATS FRIGGING AWESOME! AND I\u0027M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR IT :-D But either way, I feel so privileged and empowered by you as my fan! :-) :-) Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOW FOR THE REWARDS!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge $1.00 or more\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eYou will have access to my music videos 1 week before they\u0027re released anywhere else!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwFx-dqPlRc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAnd will receive an MP3 Download of my original songs as they are commercially released :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd access to my activity feed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(BARGAIN!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore Rewards to come!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
