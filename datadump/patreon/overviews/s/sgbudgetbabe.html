    "summary": "SG Budget Babe started as a passion project in\n2014 but quickly grew into one of Singapore\u2019s leading voices on personal\nfinance and all things involving money. The site has since been awarded the\nworld\u2019s top 60 budget blogs for its valuable content contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI wanted to create something that was of value,\nand I set out wanting to:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePublish\nunbiased financial tips and content\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eInspire\npeople to achieve their own financial freedom\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eExpose\nscams that are designed to cheat people of their hard-earned money\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eShare\ninvestment tips and knowledge\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut then I ran into roadblocks. Running the\nwebsite was taking up too much of my time, to the extent where I had to start\ncancelling tuition jobs just so I could keep up the weekly writings. I didn\u2019t\nexpect to be assuaged with numerous reader emails asking for help or direction,\nall of which takes up hours to reply. Then came the reader requests \u003cem\u003e(BB, brand X recently launched XYZ product.\nIs this really good? What\u2019s the catch that they\u2019re not telling us?). \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAdd in the free e-books and reader workshops\n(which are all done and hosted for free, even though other course providers\ncharge a hefty fee to teach you the same things), and it was getting tough to keep\nup.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Starting Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe simple truth is because as the site\u2019s\nreadership grows, the resources needed to run it have also increased\nexponentially. Add in the number of requests from readers to investigate,\nresearch and write about a certain brand, service or investment opportunity\u2026has\nalso gone up. And all of that takes time, effort, and often even money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve considered the options commonly used by other\nlocal influencers \u2013 sponsored content, doing ads \u2013 but we all know how that has\nled to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mumbrella.asia/2017/10/the-dysfunctional-influencer-bubble-no-transparency-and-no-authenticity \"\u003ea loss of authenticity and objectivity for many influencers who have gone down this path.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSponsored\nposts are not sustainable\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe majority of social media influencers in\nSingapore make their money through doing ads and sponsored posts. Brands pay up\nto a few thousand dollars for a single Instagram post \u003cem\u003e(do the math, and you\u2019ll quickly realise how much your favourite\nInstagrammers are really earning).\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut the situation has gotten to the point where\nthere is barely any authenticity and objectivity left. Many influencers who rely on\nsuch ads for their monthly income end up \u003cbr\u003e\n(i) working with all the premium brands, because these are the ones with huge\nmarketing expenses (due to high margins on each product / service sold to you) \u003cbr\u003e\n(ii) being afraid to talk bad about brands or products they don\u2019t like, lest they turn off the brand from wanting to work with them in the future\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, the best deals are also often by brands or\nstart-ups who do not have mammoth marketing budgets to promote their offerings,\nsimply because most of their money is channeled towards actual creation and not\npromotion. Do we leave them out just because they cannot afford to pay for a\nsponsored post? Obviously not!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBasically, most influencers earn a living by\nencouraging you to spend, spend and spend.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s not what SG Budget Babe is about. I\nbelieve in helping you to find truly value-for-money products, save and grow\nyour own money so that you can become richer\u2026but that isn\u2019t the kind of stuff\nthat brands want to pay for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition, for many sponsored posts, I often\nget asked to simply hype up the merits of a product without revealing the\ncaveats. And I\u2019ve always rejected those requests, because SG Budget Babe was\nnever meant to be a sales promoter. Sometimes these brands come back later, but\nmost often, they don\u2019t. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI don\u2019t want to ever see SG Budget Babe end up\nlike that. Yet, the truth is that while every other influencer is happily\naccepting monies to promote you a problematic product \u003cem\u003e(\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2017/10/more-accountability-needed-in.html \"\u003ejust take a look at the Beautiful Teeth Whitening Kit saga and how some influencers earned up to $15,000 for selling a kit confirmed to be potentially harmful by HSA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e), \u003c/em\u003ethere\u0027s barely anyone warning you about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelieving that my readers deserve to know the pros AND cons, I exposed the issues in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2017/04/krisflyer-uob-influencers-campaign.html\"\u003eUOB Krisflyer card\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2017/10/better-alternatives-to-uob-stash.html\"\u003eUOB Stash\u003c/a\u003e (while other influencers were promoting it as though it was the best deal ever)...only to have my talent managers at Nuffnang tell me that UOB wasn\u0027t keen to work with me anymore due to the previous expose.

I don\u2019t want to ever have\nto be at the mercy of the brands and beg for their sponsored posts just because\nthey\u2019re the only ones paying me in order for me to continue writing for my\nreaders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo this is where I hope you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Money Will Be Used For\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting \u2013 \u003c/strong\u003eA good\u00a0hosting plan to support the website in order to deal with high traffic and fast loading speeds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMailChimp \u2013 \u003c/strong\u003eThe service we use to\nemail posts out to the subscription list.
