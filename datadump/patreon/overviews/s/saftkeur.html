    "summary": "Welcome, everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Saftkeur, and my passion is storytelling through whatever medium is within my reach.\u003cbr\u003eMore precisely, I am a fantasy/fetish artist and the creator of the fantasy-world of Paeratopa. My content focuses mostly on fantasy with a fetishistic twist - magical giantesses and monstergirls, shrinking magics, vore and more, with lots of both playful and terrifying scenarios as they all come together. What would you do if you suddenly found yourself in a world of such fantastic creatures, bolstered by an innate magic that renders death a temporary inconvenience, but challenged by the fact that you\u0027re on the bottom of the food chain?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who need a bit more of an introduction than that, I should start by explaining some of the fetish content I focus on. Vorarephilia, or vore, is the fascination with the fantasy of beings consuming other beings, generally alive and whole. Though it comes in many... let\u0027s say flavors, for myself, I focus primarily upon scenarios with giantess predators and shrunken prey, always gentle and non-fatal in outcome, though not always experienced willingly. A personal interest in tongues and a few other fetishes often makes itself\u00a0known in my work as well, and I hope the fetishistic elements are balanced out at least slightly by my love of good old fashioned fantasy storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\u0027s pretty simple, really. Similar to fundraising sites like Kickstarter, people can \"pledge\" money towards a creator, with the total sum of everyone\u0027s pledges hitting various milestone goals. In layman\u0027s terms, you can choose to pay anywhere from $1 and up on a monthly basis, and your monthly pledge gets added to everyone else\u0027s to go towards supporting me and my work! Patreon themselves take a small fee to keep their own business running, but the rest of your contribution goes straight to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we paying for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not a fan of hiding my work behind paywalls or forcing people to jump through hoops to see this content I so dearly love to create, so you won\u0027t find any of that here. What your pledges will do is to support me in my work, making it easier for me to continue to share my world with you all, allowing me to rely less on commissions and focus my efforts entirely upon the sort of content I want to be sharing with everyone. Every little bit helps, whether it\u0027s a monthly pledge or just a one-time donation! Even pennies eventually turn to dollars. Your money will be spent on more art supplies, paying my bills, and generally just keeping me afloat so I don\u0027t have to choose between creating art or having a full-time job elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we get for pledging?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now? You\u0027ll be getting more of a say in the sort of stuff you\u0027d like to see from me, and possibly even some requests, if things go well! Other than that though, you\u0027ll just be helping me to keep producing the sort of content I already offer, but more frequently.\u003cbr\u003eFor the most part there isn\u0027t a lot of exclusive stuff you\u0027ll get, but I\u0027m certainly planning to work on upping the rewards if things grow much bigger. For now, it\u0027s a tip jar with benefits; access to WIPs, finished works before they\u0027re uploaded elsewhere, and occasional polls and feedback requests for my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere can I see your work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a full list of my galleries and other profiles right below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://saftkeur.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://saftkeur.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://aryion.com/g4/user/Saftkeur\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEka\u0027s Portal (18+)\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://pixiv.me/saftkeur\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePixiv\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Saftkeur\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e"
