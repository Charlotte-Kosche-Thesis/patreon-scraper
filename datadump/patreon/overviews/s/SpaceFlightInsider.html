In total more than 100 pieces of content are produced each month along with coverage of launches around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat we feature\u003c/h4\u003e\nIn the last few years, \n\u003cem\u003eSpaceFlight Insider\u003c/em\u003e has created one of the best launch calendars currently in use. Additionally, we have an ever-expanding gallery of photographs and video packages and an array of assets including fleets of remote still and video cameras which collect imagery from the pads themselves during launches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, \n\u003cem\u003eSpaceFlight Insider\u003c/em\u003e is the only comparable media outlet to host live webcasts during launches at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. (we hope to expand that to other locations in the near future).\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaSCgvrOg2o\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImportantly, the \"\u003cem\u003eInsider\u003c/em\u003e\" in our name is not us, rather it references you. We do our best to bring you as much information about the space industry to make you an insider. For example, if a user has a question, we do our best to get an answer from someone in the industry, be it an astronaut or an engineer working on a spacecraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, we feature multiple small things that improve the experience of our viewers, including a feature on the upper right side of the website that changes the style from dark with white text to a more traditional light with black text.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy do we need your help?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eProviding these services is a labor of love for the \n\u003cem\u003eSpaceFlight Insider\u003c/em\u003e team. However, regular travel, equipment procurement and maintenance, as well as paying editors, writers and photographers consumes much of what funds we have managed to acquire so far. All of these efforts require a great deal of infrastructure, manpower and coordination to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to create a place where people can turn to for all the information they want regarding space exploration and development. We want to deliver high quality video, audio, imagery and much more to give you an insider\u0027s view of the whole industry. We will go so far as to take your questions directly to those officials within NASA and other space-related organizations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTwo big items we are working on right now include increasing the quality of our SFI Live shows and adding to a new section of our website called, \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/hangar/\"\u003eThe Hangar\u003c/a\u003e.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSFI Live\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the live show, we currently broadcast during most launches at Cape Canaveral. However, we want to begin streaming in high quality from the remote areas most launch facilities are located. But since enough mobile data is hard to come by a special device is needed for higher quality. We already have this device, but the cost to use it per month is nearly $1,000.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want to purchase equipment to support our live webcasts, including professional camera equipment, a sound mixing board, a pop up tent, and lights, just to name a few. These will also help us with exclusive interviews as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere is an example of one of our high quality shows:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ZVGY4isX7M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Hangar\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Hangar is a database of launch vehicles, spacecraft and more. We want to provide you with all the information you could want from the basic all the way down to the details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe plan on rolling this feature out on our website in phases, but to \"finish\" it will take a lot of hard work and dedication. We\u0027d like to be able to pay those on our team that work on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cFFzzdl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy should you care?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe are a news organization that prides ourselves with telling the whole story of space exploration, both the good, the bad as well as the ugly. As journalists, we don\u2019t pick favorites. That doesn\u2019t mean we want anybody to fail \u2013 just the opposite. We want to see every space organization succeed, but in order for that to happen, truth and facts need to be reported.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also do what many other outlets (especially in terms of our live webcasts) have ceased to do in the post-shuttle era, and will continue to do so. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur team has decades of experience covering the space program and we are focused on providing you with the absolute latest on all things space. If we can\u2019t pay the bills, let alone our staff \u2013 which currently consists of mostly volunteers and hard-working space enthusiasts \u2013 then we can\u2019t do everything we can to share the thrill of space exploration with the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like space, and want more space news, launch videos, images and podcasts, then help us by becoming a Patron of \n\u003cem\u003eSpaceFlight Insider\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Gtrvv84.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
