I improved over time and it ended up becoming the only thing that kept me going for\n a while.\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s just say I grew up used to the feeling I have to \njustify my existence by achieving things. I\u0027ve been suffering from depression since\n my early teenage days and have already done a a lot to overcome it, but\n I\u0027m still struggling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was younger everything that I \ndidn\u0027t get from real life people was given to me by stories and their \ncharacters. They became my role models, they encouraged and comforted me\n and they showed me a different life.\u003cbr\u003eFiction saved me and that\u0027s why I wanna create strong and inspiring stories by myself to give something back to the world.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\n really sure that art (in whatever way) is not something unimportant, \nbut something that can influence and change a human being.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I decided to chase my dream and become an illustrator/comic artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n finished my studies at M\u00fcnster School Of Design in 2015 and have been working\n as a freelance illustrator and graphic designer ever since then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever,\n working with depression is incredibly hard, even more so when you try \nto start as a freelancer.\u00a0I have to cover a lot of costs myself that employees don\u0027t have to and I get no financial support from my parents. This leaves me constantly busy with side jobs (that partly don\u0027t have anything \nto do with my actual job), which drains a lot of energy from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n founded this Patreon in the hope to finally find some \"financial peace\"\n so I can really and fully move onwards and focus on my path ahead. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 120% sure I\u0027ll be able to live up to my full potential and create wonderful things with your support.\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider becoming my patron and get access to my work.

They belong to a story with the working title StarCrossed (*X) and it\u0027s my goal to draw this story once I find the time and peace of mind to do so. My current icon and banner belong to *X as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than that I really like to share all kind of advice and positive experiences I make. \u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027ve been focused on my career for more than 10 years now I gathered quite a bit of expertise concerning the market for illustration and comic in Germany and partly international.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides I know how shitty life can treat you and how good it is to have someone or a place you can go to and get a pat on the back and a \u003cbr\u003e\"You did well and I\u0027m sure you can achieve a lot more, too.
