    "summary": "I\u0027m Dustin Krcatovich, a writer and multimedia artist currently based in Portland, Oregon.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://skinlies.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSKIN LIES\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eis the mostly-solo musical guise that I\u0027ve performed and recorded under since 2014, after years of work under the names \"Actual Birds\" and \"Mall Mutants\". The Skin Lies material is improvisational and exploratory, an amalgam of\u00a0\u003cem\u003ekosmische\u003c/em\u003e dream-conjuring, pulsing industrial smear, and minimalist composition/repetition (cf. Fripp \u0026amp; Eno, Cluster, Tony Conrad, Slava Ranko, Ju Suk Reet Meate, Catherine Christer Hennix, etc.). Though experimental, I mostly manage to make the Skin Lies music relatively easy on the ears; in the last year, I was even invited to provide music for yoga classes and a relaxing Friday evening at an eco-conscious mattress store! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince starting Skin Lies, I\u0027ve toured healthy chunks of the United States with \u003cstrong\u003eWillis Earl Beal\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eFred Thomas\u003c/strong\u003e, and shared stages with \u003cstrong\u003eBeno\u00eet Pioulard,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Tenses\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eMatt Nelson (Battle Trance/Elder Ones), Dragging an Ox Through Water (Mississippi Records), Fountainsun (Daniel Higgs), Byron Westbrook,\u00a0Family Planning,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand many others. Videos for Skin Lies material, directed by filmmaker \u003cstrong\u003eMicah Vanderhoof\u003c/strong\u003e, have been featured at the \u003cstrong\u003eAnn Arbor Film Festival, Portland Underground Film Festival\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eBoathouse Microcinema\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first couple years of Skin Lies, I\u0027ve released\u00a0regular digital downloads of recorded material, but as of this writing, the intention is to shift to severely limited (and occasionally ornately packaged) physical releases, \u003cstrong\u003esome of which will be made available exclusively to Patreon patrons.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOME HISTORY:\u003c/strong\u003e My sensibilities were forged in the same mid-\u002700s Ann Arbor, Michigan milieu (specifically, the circle surrounding freeform college/community radio station\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wcbn.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWCBN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) which concurrently nurtured the nascent talents of \u003cstrong\u003eJib Kidder, Beno\u00eet Pioulard, Laurel Halo,\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eJulia Holter\u003c/strong\u003e, as well as many other lesser-known sound alchemists. In that timeframe, I was fortunate to collaborate extensively with some of the aforementioned, along with members of noted Michigan acts like \u003cstrong\u003eSaturday Looks Good To Me, K9 Sniffies, Strange Brew,\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eOur Brother The Native. \u003c/strong\u003eThere were many one-off noise/improv ensembles, along with more \"conventional\" bands. In perhaps the most surreal moment of this period, a home recording of my band\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBlood Necklace\u003c/strong\u003e was utilized in the intro to a viral video of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDc8T9hT2Cw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmerican Idol contestant Andrew Fenlon interviewing Noam Chomsky\u003c/a\u003e while under the effects of psychedelic mushrooms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dedicate countless hours to working on Skin Lies, but it\u0027s getting harder and harder to do as expenses accumulate. Gear needs to be procured or replaced; cars need to be rented for tour, and gas must be put in those cars; cassettes and vinyl need to be reproduced. As such, any help is greatly appreciated, and will be rewarded in kind!"
