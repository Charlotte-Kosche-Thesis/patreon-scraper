    "summary": "Hey everyone, I\u0027m SuperDerek! \u00a0But I suppose that if you\u0027re here, looking at my page you probably already know this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, what you may not already know is that I do have a pseudonym, with which I conduct everyday life. That name is Derek Beins. For the last 2-and-a-half years I\u0027ve been hosting a review show called The Game Collection, in which I play games from start to finish. Mostly Japanese RPGs that can take quite a while to complete.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started making reviews, I did them on a shoe-string budget. My camera was a cell phone, I recorded audio using a lav mic plugged into an iPad I held off-camera. I taught myself the basics of editing with my first review, Earthbound and the rest is history. Over the years I\u0027ve steadily been working on improving the quality of my content and production values, and seeking out more games to review. I\u0027m currently on my 4th camera, and just recently got a set of studio lights thanks to a very generous donation from a viewer. Very little of the production improvements were paid for by ad revenue, some of it was paid for out of my own pocket, and a bit of it is still accumulating interest on a credit card that I scurry to pay down each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so far, this system works. And it will continue to work with or without the financial support of viewers. However, support received through Patreon would go a long way to helping improve the rate at which I\u0027m able to improve my production equipment, and acquire games to stream and review. Support from patrons would also help ease the end-of-month anxiety of scurrying up the funds to pay down the hole I\u0027ve dug myself with the production of the show. And who knows? Maybe in some far off fantasy years down the road, support from patrons may allow me to do this full-time, and potentially increase the frequency of releases? It could happen. And if it eventually does, it could all start here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether you decide to become a patron, thank you, sincerely, for taking the time to read, or comment, or even just watch my reviews, and helping ensure that I\u0027m not just a lonely guy sitting in a room talking to himself on a camera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Derek"

This gradually lead to an infatuation for RPGs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter high school, I thought that my career would inevitably lead me to video game design and scenario writing, and decided to pursue a degree in digital art with an emphasis on video game design. Needless to say I\u0027m not a game designer, (yet!) but I have developed a critical eye and deep interest for game art and mechanics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually it dawned on me that I could use my passion for design and my skills as a digital artist to create videos, and reviewing games! In July of 2013 \"SuperDerek\" was born, with my premiere video covering Earthbound, the game that sold me on JRPGs!\u003cbr\u003e",

No hard drives crash, no cameras stop working, no light-bulbs break, no console dies. This is scary because I know that this won\u0027t hold up forever. So the first thing I will be working on with Patreon is setting up an emergency fund, to help ensure that The Game Collection continues to enjoy uninterrupted releases.",
