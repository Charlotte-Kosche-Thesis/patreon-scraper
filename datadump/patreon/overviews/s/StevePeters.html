    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Steve; I\u0027ve been self-publishing comics since 1992. I won a Xeric Award which allowed me to distribute my comics nationally for a 10-year period from 1997 to 2007. I hope to make a comeback with my current project, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Comicverse\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, a sci-fi rom-com about a comic book shop in space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Comicverse\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a collaboration with my good friend, Bianca Alu-Marr. We often co-plot the stories, then she writes them and I draw them. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComicverse\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is going strong, has gotten a great response from people who have read it, and has won a 3rd place SPACE Prize for Best Webcomic in 2012. We are currently putting together new material for our first \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComicverse\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e collection. We\u0027ve also started a spinoff comic, called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComicverse: Behind The Counter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, with stories written by Bianca and illustrated by other artists, and I have my own spinoff in the works featuring a semi-autobiographical \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComicverse \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003echaracter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 1989 I have worked at the same day job, which has provided me with enough income to support myself while I pursued my dream. However, a series of setbacks have been making this untenable. The company started doing poorly in the late 2000s and began closing a lot of stores. My store closed in 2010, so I had to transfer to a location in Philadelphia. It\u0027s a costly commute, which I thought justified in that I was able to be more productive, getting more drawing done while on the train. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and has been trying to recover ever since. Our contract was renegotiated, and several things were taken away from us. Our hours have been cut severely. I am currently not making enough at this job to support myself, which is quite a shock after being independent for so long!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. By supporting \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Comicverse\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e though Patreon, you are helping to provide an income that I can rely on rather than having to look for a second job, which I think would leave me too exhausted to be productive with my comics work. If I can get enough Patreon supporters I can even decrease my hours at the day job, allowing me to crank out more comics! Thanks so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thecomicverse.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/sp-12-inch-version.jpg\" style=\"width: 631px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thecomicverse.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/cover_front.jpg\" style=\"width: 625px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thecomicverse.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/page-one.jpg\" style=\"width: 608px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
