    "summary": "Thank you for visiting\nmy Patreon page! My name is Sasa. I was born and raised in Hokkaido, Japan which\nis an area well known for its powder-snow and abundant nature. I began drawing\nfan art of game characters (especially from Atlus games) from when I was 13\nyears old. After graduating college and experiencing several jobs (such as\nsales staff, tutor and university office staff), I have been trying to earn a\nliving by what I love doing the most\u2026\n\u003cstrong\u003edrawing\u003c/strong\u003e!!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eWHAT I DRAW\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I am feeling\nwell, I will be drawing one or two pieces \n\u003cstrong\u003eeach week\u003c/strong\u003e like this\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\u0026amp;id=19Ghn9I0LhSznKL6RpoqAUtOkU15kcY1c\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nand this\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\u0026amp;id=1rZJsErMW_zYMB5C2e4UnLXeMXr9uIqMu\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll my digital works are drawn with more than 300 dpi, which is a printable size. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eWHY?\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou might be wondering why I won\u2019t continue to get a \u201cnormal\u201d job.  It\u2019s because I was diagnosed to have \n\u003cem\u003emultiple sclerosis \u003c/em\u003eshortly after I\nturned 29.  This is an autoimmune disorder, i.e. a disease which the patient\u2019s own immune system attacks its own body (in the case of multiple sclerosis, the nervous system). \nBecause of this disorder, I am suffering physical, mental and\npsychiatric problems.  This makes it hard to have a full time job.  Multiple\nsclerosis is incurable, and the symptoms are unpredictable. In my first attack, I lost control in the right half of my body, suffered speech impediment and difficulty in breathing. In my recent attack, I almost lost vision in one eye.  Luckily, the medications I am taking now is\nhelping me a lot (though with fairly harsh side effects) but I have been in and out of hospital a total of 6 times in the past 5 years. My medical expense is extremely expensive and it is eating up my savings. That\u2019s why I decided to sign up as a creator in Patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eBY BEING MY PATRON\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll pledges and support will help me continue drawing, pay for my translator Hiromi (she helped me set up my Patreon page), and most importantly\u2026continue living!! By being my Patreon supporter, you\u2019ll get access to my artwork first. And depending on how much you pledge, you will get different rewards (some are only available at Patreon). I will be setting goals too.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
