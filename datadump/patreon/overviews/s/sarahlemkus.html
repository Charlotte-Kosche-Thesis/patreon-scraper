    "summary": "Hi lovely people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Sarah, a plant-eating health hippie from New Zealand.\u00a0My passion is inspiring people to eat well through plant-based nutrition.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003ewhere it all started\u003c/h3\u003eTowards the end of high school, I began to suffer from some health issues; including weight gain and hormonal imbalances. I was later told by my doctor that I had polycystic ovaries (PCOS). Having suffered body confidence issues for years, and having tried every diet imaginable, I was at my wits end. At the end of 2013 when my husband and I were beginning to think about starting a family, I began looking for a better way. I started researching about the impact of food on hormones which lead me to discover the vegan diet. Basically, everything I had ever been told about dieting and nutrition was a lie. About a month after transitioning to a plant-based diet I fell pregnant, which was a huge answer to my prayers. I happily continued my newly embraced vegan diet throughout my pregnancy and I have never looked back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree years and one beautiful baby girl later I am seeing and feeling the benefits of living off a plant-based diet.\u00a0I want to share my experience to help show women (and men) they can be happy, full of energy and confident with their bodies through plant-based nutrition. Because true beauty, starts from the inside out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003ewhy patreon?\u003c/h3\u003eI get inundated with daily questions and as much as I\u0027d love to answer every one of them, I do not have enough hours in my day. As a Patron, I guarantee to answer 100% of your questions directly on the patron only feed or via email (for more personal emails). I\u0027d love to get to know you on a personal level!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this is to be a community where we can all chat and share information. I will also post updates and recipes from time to time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly though, you\u0027ll know you\u0027re helping me to create better quality and more frequent video content that can ultimately help as many people as possible. That\u0027s the biggest reward, right!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank-you so much for becoming a part of this journey! I appreciate and love you all so so much! xox\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
