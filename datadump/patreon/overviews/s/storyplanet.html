You immerse yourself\nin the new language and end up learning tons, almost without noticing\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019ve\nstarted by writing short stories for learners of German. We want to expand to\ninclude other languages, other writers, published stories, and also finish our\ntechnology that helps you learn as you read.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt\nthe moment, every week we publish a new short story for learners of German. We\npublish one chapter of the story everyday via WhatsApp. Each chapter has about\n50 words, most of which should be familiar to intermediate learners (A2). One\nsentence in each chapter comes from our vocabulary trainer app and has a\nhighlighted word which is just a little bit more difficult (B1). If readers\nwant to, they can learn the highlighted word in our vocabulary trainer app,\nusing the same sentence from the story. It just makes sooooo much more sense to\nlearn words within the context of a story \u2013 and it\u2019s sooooo much more fun too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\ncall this \u201cStoryCorner\u201d. Learn more about it here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.storycorner.de\"\u003ewww.storycorner.de\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLearn\nmore about our vocabulary trainer app here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.vobot.me\"\u003ewww.vobot.me\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s the long-term vision?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOMG.\nWe REALLY love languages and good stories and everyone we talk to who shares\nour passion agrees: we need to build a story-based platform for learning\nlanguages, i.e. StoryPlanet. Imagine you can browse through a large online\nlibrary to find just the kind of story YOU want to learn with, whether it\u2019s\nromance, crime, adventure, biography, you name it. The stories are also\nclassified by learning level, so you can be sure you find just the right fit\nfor you. If there\u2019s any word in the text you don\u2019t understand, just tap it with\nyour finger and you get exactly the right definition as well as lots of related\ntips. Then, you can add the word AND the sentence to your individualized\nlearning list. All without leaving the page and interrupting your reading flow.\nWhenever you want, you switch to the learning mode and can practice all those\nwords you\u2019ve collected in a series of signature exercises we\u2019ve created that\nget successively more difficult as you progress. It really helps those words\nstick, you learn how to properly use the word in a real context AND it\u2019s a lot\nof fun!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019ve\nactually got quite a bit of the necessary software done for this, but there is\nstill quite a way to go in order for almost any story to be transformed into a\nlearning tool like we envision. Try our prototype and learn more about our\nvision here: \u003ca href=\"http://storyplanet.de/try-our-prototype/\"\u003ehttp://storyplanet.de/try-our-prototype/\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeet Anette, Leonore, Battista, Mia (the cat), David, Vanessa and Franck.

Here we go:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWRITE: Writing short stories\nfor language learners and publishing one chapter a day takes time. We love\ndoing it and so far we\u2019ve done it all for free, but yes, it would be nice to\nget a symbolic \u201cthank you\u201d for all our work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eCODE: Of course, developing\nthe technology to support story-based language learning takes time and money,\ntoo.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eBUILD: We really want to build\na learning platform where all the stories and technology live. A really cool\nplatform takes time and money.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eFILL: To fill StoryPlanet with\nlots of really good content we also want to collaborate with publishers and convert\ntheir stories into learning tools. \nAmongst other things that means closing license deals with them and for\nthat we need the support of a lawyer. Oh, and lawyers costs lots of money!\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eEXPAND: German is a great\nlanguage, but there are soooo many other very exciting languages out there\nwhich we would love to help people learn through stories. For that we need to\nexpand our language expertise, which also takes time and money.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eADVERTISE: We love the\ngrassroots approach and growing organically over time as people use our tools,\nlove the results and tell others about them. If we really want to reach a\ncritical mass of people to become commercially sustainable one day, we will\ninevitably need to also invest in advertising.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCONVINCE:\nWe keep talking to investors about StoryPlanet and they like the idea, but are\nskeptical about the market potential. We need to prove to them that there are a\nton of people out there who are really ready to pay \u2013 even a little bit \u2013 to\nuse our story-based language learning tools. So we would immense appreciate any\nmoney you can contribute and anything you can do to help us expand our support\nbase here on Patreon!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to take things one step at a time. The\nmore support we get, the more we\u2019ll also be able to pursue the larger vision,\nwhich includes getting publishers on board, doing more advertising and pitching\nto investors.
