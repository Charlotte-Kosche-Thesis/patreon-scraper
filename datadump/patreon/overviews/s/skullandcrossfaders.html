    "summary": "People often want to know what \u00a0is skullandcrossfaders. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I grew up around rock records and science fiction and/or fantasy books in Southern California. People told me I was smart, so I idolized science. \u00a0I finished a liberal arts degree and was disenchanted by my middle management and substitute teacher opportunities.\u00a0 Annoyed \u00a0about \u00a0evaluation and \u00a0American academic market \u00a0conditions, I failed to finish a terminal degree.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I have read, and still read, an above average amount of the work of now deceased French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (and now listen to as much accuracy-oriented information as I can manage). \u00a0 \u00a0I learned to DJ while conducting fieldwork research in Buffalo, NY in an attempt to fund record collecting behaviors.\u00a0 \u00a0 I had been to Disneyland at a relatively young age; when the Pirates of the Caribbean movies pushed pirate pajamas into every outlet, I had a flash.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The concept art was drawn by JW Caldwell (Las Vegas, NV). \u00a0 A digital logo mock up was done by Tony Caferro (Buffalo, NY). \u00a0 \u00a0I had already obtained all the social media accounts I could manage, more than I could handle really. When I used the mock up on social media, it appears to have been bootlegged quickly. \u00a0 It\u2019s still a thing, look it up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Originally (with this project), I mostly wanted to play records. I moved to Jackson, Mississippi with Lacy Ellinwood. \u00a0She\u2019s a librarian by trade and we moved into a place with neighbors that worked at a sign shop. \u00a0Neighbors became friends that helped make stickers and decals that were sent out into the world, traded with artists that sometimes responded with collaborations or versions of their own. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 As a youngster I wanted to be a theoretician. I didn\u2019t know what that meant for a long time. But now I know. \u00a0My main interest boils down to relative autonomy from exploitation for all. \u00a0My concern is that our species is a little delusional about its importance and centrality in the meaning of life, and maybe more to the point we are delusional about the autonomy of death and what that means about how we should evaluate life. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
