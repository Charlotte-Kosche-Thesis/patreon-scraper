    "summary": "In my close to 30 year career I have built an amazing photography community, more than that I feel like i have built a family with my photography.  I\u2019m now looking for the next leaders, the next patriarchs that will help all of the people in this family grow and get better and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a part of my new mentorship program is not just about making more money, or improving the quality of your photography. \u00a0Those things will happen, but that isn\u2019t the only goal. Becoming a part of this program is ultimately about changing your life and the lives of those around you in more positive way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf we are ALL doing better, if we are ALL making more money, if we are ALL making superior art the community itself is opened to new and unexpected opportunities that none of us could achieve or even imagine on our own.  that is my goal for the rest of my life... I want to make all of this better for everyone and i am looking for truly motivated professionals to really help get to the next level, which ultimately helps me achieve this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBecoming part of this program is about improving the community as a whole.  we all need to be doing better, we all need to be trying harder. I believe helping all of you do all of those things is the best first step for everyone to get better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA community is never built with just one set of hands.  for all of us to rise, we have to lift together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not something i feel like i can just ask for.  in order to achieve this goal i am going to teach you everything I know.  if it can be learned i will help you learn it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately this program will not just be about what I know, this team that I am building will soon be teaching each other.  we will all be working to improve not just our own lives, but the lives and careers of all of us. The leaders I find now will be leading this same program in years to come, and creating their own programs, communities and families.  you as a leader, will become the teacher, and you will give it all back to someone new just like I am going to do for you. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYour life will get better because of this effort and so will everyone else\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
