We\u0027ll cover everything from how to get started, gear lists, equipment reviews, to how make food that will never spoil. Gear and food for backpacking or camping can come with a high price tag these days - we hope to show you ways that you can lower the cost of any trek or trip that you may want to take into the wild; as well showcase our own journeys across our beautiful backyard (in glorious HD).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who will, or have helped us - we cannot thank you enough! Everything we have done and will do has been because of the support of those around us. As of now all contributions are going towards making content possible; we\u0027re getting out and using all possible resources to make this dream a reality. Our monetary goals are meant to aid us in our adventures and keep us going. We hope to continue doing what we love until we can no longer walk, and we hope to bring all of you with us along the way!"
