    "summary": "Hi, and welcome to my patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an east coast cosplayer who started down the rabbit hole of this crazy hobby in 2014. I sew a lot of my own costumes, and also offer cosplay commissions as a chance to make costumes I\u0027d otherwise never make for myself while making some money in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially what brought me here was wanting to separate out all my WIP posts from other social media. It feels to informal to throw them up on Facebook or Instagram, and spamming Twitter with nonstop work in progress photos of cosplay stuff is tempting, but just bogs my account down and it\u0027s impossible to find them later, even in a thread. I figured this would be a good place to keep a log of the costumes I\u0027ve made, and try to make a better effort to document my process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UVo6Kp2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e(pictured above: screencaps posted to my facebook page, which felt like spam at the time and still feel out of place on there!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe other rewards I came up with are secondary to be honest, and kind of just whatever I thought people might be interested in seeing from me! One of the things I\u0027ve gotten some interest in is my patterns- to accommodate that, some of the tiers include pattern walkthroughs, which to me is a cool kind of compromise between keeping my patterns locked down and offering them fully for sale!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very open to suggestions for altering, combining or adding tiers, so if you\u0027d like to subscribe but something is holding you back, feel free to let me know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, I\u0027d like this to be a resource where anyone who enjoys my sewing or general cosplay activity can get more of that while also making it easier for me to produce stuff!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll probably be re-tooling some of the rewards throughout the first few months to work out the logistics of some of the tiers, but I\u0027ll likely be adding more stuff as time goes on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for checking out my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebanner credit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ephotos from left to right are by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RhymeTimeCosplay/\"\u003eRhyme Time Cosplay \u0026amp; Photography\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/goojunky/\"\u003eGooJunky Photography\u003c/a\u003e,\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bnnzrs/\"\u003eBananzers\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/coldblueskyphotography/\"\u003eColdbluesky Photography\u003c/a\u003e, Bananzers,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RyllisResin/\"\u003eRyllis Resin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eplush and clip in third photo made by fondlyregarded on twitter, and xander costume was made by verymuchacosplay on tumblr!"
