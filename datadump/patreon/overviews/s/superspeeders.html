I\u0027ve funded lots of fun videos over the years, $500 car challenges, First to get a ticket challenges, Project car challenges, and more.

As someone giving me money, you are effectively group hiring me to provide value to you, which I will continue to do and invite you to hold me accountable if feel I am not. As a patron you will essentially be part of the Super Speeders Executive team assisting in video ideas, collaborations, and filming locations, with behind the scenes access to it all. Your assistance is totally appreciated and I am excited to keep on bringing you the content that brought you here to support me.\u003cbr\u003e"
