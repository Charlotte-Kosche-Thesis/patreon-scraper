    "summary": "Greetings, I am someone who loves to make artwork, character stories, and make roleplay gaming videos as characters that I create with my own unique background stories for each and every one of them and I had to wonder, why not share this with the world of talent within video, roleplaying and most of all story writing. I wanted to give patreon a go since I figured if talent like this is never often seen elsewhere then I would love to be a founder of an idea or some type of lifestyle that would suit people who love games and love creating their own characters as much as I do. Along with story writing. Hope you\u0027ll be around and if you do then any pledge is appreciated as I\u0027ll be sure to give out rewards in return as well as advancing my role as creating better content, stories, and artwork for you all to enjoy further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t make any income on the side therefore I may figure to try something new which is why I created this page of mine. Perhaps someday if I\u0027m able to continue doing what I enjoy then maybe that dream could come true to make this a lifetime opportunity and you could very well be the ones to fulfill that dream. My goal is to not only make this dream come true but also to try and inspire those to new ways of creativity whether it be through roleplay/gaming or art character stories and writing out the entire stories themselves. Check out the rewards on the side and if you like what I do then I only wish to make it that much more enjoyable for people. All help is greatly appreciated and honestly I\u0027d thank you more than enough for even a small recurring amount each month for this will not only inspire me to continue making better written out stories and illustrations/gamestory videos but even helps raise creativity that you wouldn\u0027t normally see elsewhere. Thank you for visiting my page and perhaps you\u0027ll stick around.\u003cbr\u003e"
