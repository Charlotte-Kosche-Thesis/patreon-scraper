    "summary": "Hi all, I\u0027m Steve Spalding and I\u0027m a writer of fiction. That fiction takes many forms, mostly\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thecoldstorage.com/tagged/onestoryaday\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eshort stories\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://stevereadsstories.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/a\u003e, but I\u0027ve also been known to turn out the occasional comic page, and once upon a time, I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/founders-saga-the-culling/id1035988081?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eeven wrote a game\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBack in 2016, I gave myself the goal of putting together one short piece of fiction, every weekday, for an entire year. On December 31st, to my surprise, I finished --\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://thecoldstorage.com/tagged/onestoryaday/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e260 short stories and poems\u003c/a\u003e in all, and some of them were even good.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, I produced the first twenty-five episodes of my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steve-reads-stories/id1087197185\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efolk lore podcast\u003c/a\u003e, the first two episodes of a serialized fiction podcast about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://atthemidnight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emagic and hotel management\u003c/a\u003e, and continued work on the comic that I will one day finish. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll in all, I consider the year a success. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I discovered, however, is that 3-4 hours a night of writing, when coupled with trying to run a business to pay the bills, is a less than ideal way to retain ones sanity. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStill, for 2017 and beyond, I want to write more, a lot more, but to help justify those sleepless nights, I could really use your support. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBefore we get to that, let me tell you what I\u0027ll give in return:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMore Stories\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2016 was the year of short fiction, 2017 is to be the era of the novelette. I want to take some of the worlds and characters I touched upon in short form, and put a little more meat on their bones. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI plan to do between 10 and 15 of these, which in my estimation will require that I write 3-4 days a week until New Year.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs an example of what I\u0027ll be putting together, take a look at this story set in the\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://monatheseries.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMONA Universe\u003c/a\u003e that I wrote a while back. Most of them will look like this, if not somewhat longer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMore Podcasts\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will also be producing the next season of \n\u003cem\u003eSteve Reads Stories\u003c/em\u003e (25 episodes), and the first season of At the Midnight (10 episodes). In addition, I will be writing season two of \u003cem\u003eAt the Midnight\u003c/em\u003e, and plan to produce at least one more ten episode mini-series.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn top of that, I\u0027ll continue to release selected short stories as a part of\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-fictions/id1159779864?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInside Fictions\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMore Stuff\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the last year, I\u0027ve been working on a comic based in the same Universe as \n\u003cem\u003eAt the Midnight\u003c/em\u003e, and I plan to start showing it off as this annum rolls on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m also working on a video game set in The Gods Isle, which I\u0027m really excited about, so excited that I know better than to say anything else until it\u0027s further along.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith that out of the way, here is what I\u0027m asking for:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Big Ask\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you might have been able to suss out, writing is a full time job for me...another one, one that is mostly done in the wee dark hours when saner minds would be sleeping.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs it stands, all of those hours have been freely given, both because I love the work, and because I want the largest number of people to have access to it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith that said, this kind of output is exhausting and likely unsustainable, and in order to keep producing at the rate I have, I need to take hours from parts of my day that would otherwise be devoted to pay work. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve already started this process, and it\u0027s terrifying. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow This Will Help\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny support you give would be used to offset those lost hours, and provide me with the flexibility and freedom to make more art. Writing is hard in the best of cases, and when you\u0027re tired, stressed out, and trying to juggle twelve things without letting one of them fall and crush your life into a fine paste, it\u0027s only harder. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to give you more podcasts, I want to build more games, I want to write books and do weirder and finer work beside.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich leads to the big \"want,\" I want a budget, a budget so that I can pay artists, sound people, and other creative folks to help fill in the blanks of my worlds where mere words won\u0027t do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now anytime I need art or music of webhosting, it comes out of my pocket, and it would be lovely if this could change. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1. No matter what happens here I\u0027m going to keep writing, and I\u0027m going to keep releasing a lot of that writing for free. That won\u0027t change.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. If this campaign is successful, it means that I can go above and beyond what I already plan to do. The work will be better, stronger, properly edited, and other deeply positive things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Any amount helps, if for no other reason than it shows you care, and when you\u0027re writing at 4AM, knowing someone cares is important.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. It will be super, swell neato to have a place to show off all of the obsessive worldbuilding notes I\u0027ve made. If you need another reason to give, you can add, \"exploring my latent insanity,\" to the list.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n5. You are AWESOME, and I am so grateful for your support. With your help, there is no telling what we can do.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
