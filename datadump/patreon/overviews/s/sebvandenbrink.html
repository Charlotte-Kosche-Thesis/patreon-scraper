I\u0027ve been telling stories since my art academy days back in\n2008, when I graduated with a \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/6559545\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edocumentary about beards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. (Although it\u0027s more about my dad than beards.) When I\nwon an award for that, I was asked if I also did animation, and if I could make\na short animated \"documentary\" for someone. The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.sebasvandenbrink.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003erest\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is history. I\u0027ve\nbeen doing this for almost a decade, at the time of writing. Being self-employed\ngives me freedom - you\u0027d say - but also obligations to paying\ncustomers. Right now I\u0027m pursuing making animations for everyone, yourself included, full time, for free. To do that, though, I\u0027ll need another way to pay the bills. This is where Patreon comes in. I\u0027ve\ntrialled being a YouTuber for a while now, although it requires a lot of work, it\u0027s the most fulfilling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat the videos\nare about\u003c/h3\u003e\nI focus on the everyday, the\noverlooked, the taken-for-granted. How does your coffee machine work? Or your\nelectric kettle? Or what about streetlights and fire hydrants? I find these questions fascinating, with often surprising answers. To figure out how, that thing you use every day,\nactually works is exploring the known. Often leading to that feeling of: \"Oh! So\u00a0\u003cem\u003ethat\u0027s \u003c/em\u003ehow that works!\"\u00a0Sometimes it\u0027s the simplest of principles at the base\nof an entire category of appliances, such as heating elements or electric motors. The videos are designed to not only\nexplain the main subject, but also sprinkle in some extra information. For\ninstance, did you know\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLPKob993yk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003erefrigerator\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e doors use magnets to prevent kids from\ngetting stuck inside? I love design in almost all of its incarnations; from\nindustrial to graphic, from architecture to fashion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHow I make money\u003c/h3\u003e\nIt\u0027s very much a one man show, and making videos - animations in particular - takes time and time is, well... money. Right now I work full time making animations for paying customers, local\nbusinesses mostly, to make ends meet. So the animations you see here and on the YouTube channel are done in my spare time. Suffice to say, time is precious to me, right now. My goal is to gradually earn more through\nPatreon, as it seems to be a relatively stable source of income for YouTubers. As a patron; \u003cstrong\u003eyou will only pay per released explanimation. \u003c/strong\u003eYou pay \u003cem\u003eper creation\u003c/em\u003e, so if I don\u0027t release a video in a month, you won\u0027t be charged. Otherwise, all my videos are (eventually) published on YouTube and will stay free. Yes, ads are enabled, but the revenue on my videos is low, varies and is not reliable. Another source of income\nwould be sponsorships, but so far I have yet to strike a deal. I\u0027ll let you\u0027ll\nknow when a video is sponsored, though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThank you\u003c/h3\u003e\nMy goals are to make good,\neducational videos - \u003cem\u003ewithout\u003c/em\u003e mistakes. I can\u0027t guarantee that I\u0027ll never make\nany, but I\u0027ll be the first to own up to them and release errata or [FIXED] videos (YouTube doesn\u0027t allow replacing videos as Vimeo does,\nsadly). It means \u003cstrong\u003eso much \u003c/strong\u003eto me to hear from you. Whether it\u0027s a like, a subscribe, a comment or even - if you can afford it - a pledge here on Patreon: All of these go a long way to supercharging my motivation to make \u003cem\u003eeven more videos\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo again, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- Seb\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
