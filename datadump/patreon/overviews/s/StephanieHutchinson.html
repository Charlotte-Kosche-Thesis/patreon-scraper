    "summary": "Hello and thanks for visiting my Patreon page!\nMy name is Stephanie Hutchinson and I\u0027m a Playwright/Composer/Lyricist. Four of my 10-minute plays\nare published in \u003cem\u003eThe\nBest 10-Minute Plays\u003c/em\u003e anthologies (Smith \u0026amp; Kraus), as well as a 5-minute play published by Applause Theatre\n\u0026amp; Cinema Books, Acting Series (Hal Leonard). I adapted my 10-minute play MORE PRECIOUS THAN\nDIAMONDS into MORE PRECIOUS THAN DIAMONDS: \u003cem\u003eThe Musical\u003c/em\u003e, doing triple duty as the\nBook Writer/Composer/Lyricist. The show received an excellent review on BroadwayWorld.com.\u003ca href=\"http://www.broadwayworld.com./\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eMy plays and musicals are being produced internationally by high\nschools, colleges and community theatres and have won various awards. My works are entertaining, yet have values and ethics. Please see www.StephanieHutchinson.com for more details.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I was commissioned by an Orange County, CA church to write a\nChristmas cantata.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eTHE BIRTH OF CHRIST:\nPROPHETIC PRONOUNCEMENTS AND ANGELIC ANNOUNCEMENTS \u003c/em\u003eiscomprised of\u00a0four movements, incorporating theatrical elements, foreign languages spoken in\nthe congregation, and music. One of the movements, WONDERFUL COUNSELOR, THE PRINCE OF PEACE, is a spoken-word\nSATB Hamilton-style rap takeoff on \"For Unto Us a Child is\nBorn\" from the \u003cem\u003eMessiah\u003c/em\u003e. The church was so pleased with it that they commissioned me\nto write a spoken-word Easter piece: HALLELUJAH CHORUS II for SATB Choir and\nDrum. Please see www.ShepherdSongMusic.com for more details about my sacred music (songs/hymns for congregational singing as well as choral works).\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m currently working on a one-woman play based\non the life of my great-great-grandmother Talitha (think a naive but feisty Scarlett O\u0027Hara) who emigrated from Kentucky to\nMissouri during the Platt Purchase (pre-Civil War).\u003cbr\u003eMy works are clean, hopeful and joyful!\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your consideration!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
