    "summary": "Welcome! Thank you for your interest in my work.\u00a0My name is Krystal, though most of you know me as Shagpoke, and I am the sole proprietor of Shagpoke Studios. Shagpoke is a colloquial term for a Great Blue Heron, in case you were wondering!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vgy.me/aWSmiH.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently joined Patreon and found myself so inspired supporting fellow creators. It\u0027s been amazing to have a behind the scenes look into how they work and to have a say into their future projects, and I\u0027d love to have a similar discourse surrounding my own work. \u00a0I\u0027m just starting work on two large and very interesting projects, so this seems like a great time to begin! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy journey started with a university program for costuming. After completing that I then worked in the film and theatre industry for a couple of years. While it definitely had its perks, the film industry was full of 14+ hour days, stressful working environments, and overall a lack of appreciation and creative growth. \u00a0After deciding that film wasn\u0027t for me, I then spent some time working for dance studios but I missed making those cool creature costumes that I used to make for film. \u00a0I decided to start a small side business online for the slow season. I fell in love with the creative freedom found in the fandom and decided to make a fulltime business out of Shagpoke Studios. And now over four years later I\u0027m still loving it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vgy.me/mzcZAI.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love what I do, it isn\u0027t always easy. I need to find time to answer emails, send invoices, update social media, maintain my etsy shop, create photo collages, research and order materials, send quotes, package and ship out items... and that is all outside of any time spent actually creating costumes! \u00a0I run an online business and I haven\u0027t even found the time to make myself a proper website yet, and I\u0027ve yet to ever make myself a costume. Because of these time and financial restraints, I find myself taking on more and more simple monotonous projects because they pay the bills. I do still like making parts, but it\u0027s not all that I want to make! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often find myself inspired to create a new style of handpaw pattern, have a great idea for a new product, or hear about a cool new material that I think could really improve my work, but ultimately I cannot afford to take the time or purchase unnecessary materials to experiment with. Even more frustrating, I\u0027m also extremely limited in how many full costumes I take on as it\u0027s a lot riskier financially being hard to predict how much time a project will take. But because of this I\u0027m often disappointed that my skills aren\u0027t progressing as quickly as I know they could be. I\u0027m hoping that Patreon, and you, can help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vgy.me/FTHF6P.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vgy.me/FTHF6P.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support on Patreon, not only will I have the opportunities to try new things and grow as a creator, but we\u0027ll also get to create a community. I can find out what things you want to see from me, through polls and discussions of concepts I have. You\u0027ll be able to help shape the direction that my business goes in! In return I hope you\u0027ll be inspired by my creations, and you\u0027ll also learn from my years of experience and education with WIPs and discussions. I don\u0027t currently have any sort of set up to offer you videos, but if that\u0027s something that patrons are interested in then that\u0027s definitely a possibility for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eShagpoke\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vgy.me/Zw750K.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
