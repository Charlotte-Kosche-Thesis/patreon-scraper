    "summary": "Thanks for coming to check out my Patreon. I\u0027m working on all sorts of great things right now and any support received through Patreon assists with the funding of these and many more future projects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just launched a new brand called Mind of Snaps and it includes a new website (MindofSnaps.com) / blog and a weekly podcast. The initial plan was to also do a related video series on YouTube, but I\u0027ve had to postpone that because it became apparent it was going to be a bit of a challenge to do all of this weekly without any assistance with the filming and editing (I originally had a plan in place for this but it unfortunately fell through). I have had a few people offer to assist me with this for free, but I do not personally feel comfortable accepting unpaid creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to grow this Patreon and the support for these projects so that I can hire a video editor and pay for regular video production assistance. I believe once we get to around 100 Patrons we should be able to get this video series launched. It would also include videos of me interviewing experts on a wide variety of topics,\u00a0trying new activities, and sharing things I\u0027ve learned with you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to launching the video series, I want to do serious good in this world and I\u0027d love to re-launch my non-profit. I\u0027m the co-founder of a non profit org (501 c3) that is on a leave of absence currently and I would love to get that back up and running again. The non-profit focuses on supporting families facing severe financial crises or homelessness. Each month we\u0027d sponsor a new family across the Chicagoland area and we\u0027d collect gifts and money to help get them back on their feet. We\u0027ve had to step away from the NPO because our lives became more challenging and hectic and we couldn\u0027t afford to bring our focus back to this organization in the way it deserved. I believe we can do this together, and not just on a local level but on a National level (with hopes of going Global someday). I have some ideas on when we can likely bring this back, but I do not know exactly what it will take to get there yet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this Patreon grows enough I believe it could be able to make the difference we need to reopen our NPO so we can get back to helping families in need on a monthly basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also currently saving up money to get my old hard drive repaired. It\u0027s been through some shit and I\u0027m anticipating (based on research) a large expense to get all my data back. This data includes 10+ years of my photography work. This work will become accessible to you fully as soon as it\u0027s recovered. So if you\u0027ve signed up for one of the packages that includes regular photography prints, you\u0027d have the option to select your prints out of my entire collection - not just the recent photos I have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have lots of goals for the future, but I promise you: my primary focus is to help others. I want to make fun and interesting content but with an emphasis on Mental Health awareness and assistance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution to this Patreon is incredibly appreciated, you\u0027re helping me to help make a difference and I\u0027m insanely grateful for that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSnaps\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
