    "summary": "Hi! I am Sophia. A textile artist looking for ways to make textile art from waste with zero waste. Inspired by the lifestyle of zero waste heroin Bea Johnson who lives by the mantra, refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, rot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith that in mind I thrift, I collect, I cultivate, I dye and I make. Using only natural resources and which already exists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/15876099_195377030928839_631306462471127040_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago i started out making dolls. One of my dolls was posted on Instagram and from that moment on things got crazy, shops where asking me for wholesale, customers for custom orders and other small business for collaborations. After two years of making the same doll over and over again I started to wonder where the fun of it all was. I wanted to work small, local, idealistic but somehow it all slipped through my hands. So after some reconciliation I pulled the plug out of my Instagram account and stopped making dolls on request. For over a year I did not do much but soul searching. I started making natural dye baths (dyes made out of avocado stones, avocado skins, sage, tea, dried hibiscus, alder cones, basically whatever I could find.) I got more and more interested in Rudolf Steiner\u0027s teachings, aka Waldorf living\u00a0 and started making waldorf inspired soft toys and dolls. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13395052_497063513816864_576128569_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I am doing here you might ask? Well as life is always moving forward and I hate being put in boxes I am walking my own path taking the best of all ways of living. I am not only Waldorf inspired, I am also nature inspired. I am not a\u00a0 minimalist but I do very much relate to Zen Buddhism. I feel that sharing is caring and that I need to spread the word.\u00a0 Seeing a lot of people and children not being acquainted with a lot of crafts nor nature I would like to be an open source and tell (heck maybe even teach!)\u00a0 you how to craft and how to use nature as your material. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-frt3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/16110573_226289494446729_1545954417130340352_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQzNjkyNDE0NDgzMzk3Mzg4MQ%3D%3D.2\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

A label under which I initially started to \ncreate dolls and other soft toys. As i started to grow into the creating\n and crafting I realized I am not very interested in the end product but ever so much more in the process of creating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I got interested in\n zero waste living, I explored living without creating waste which, with\n a family of four is difficult. It lead to mindfulness in our household \nbut we did not get to the zero waste (yet) more interesting was that it made me think of my work.... Although small I was still producing \nand consuming. How about slowing down that process. How about not \nworking from an idea and buying things to create the idea. What if, \ninstead of always longing for more, I could create from what I had.... \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to get back from so much to nothing. What if I peel it all off? What \u003cem\u003ewill \u003c/em\u003eremain? \u003cbr\u003e",
