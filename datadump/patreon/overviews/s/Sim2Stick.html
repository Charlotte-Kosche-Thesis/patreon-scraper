    "summary": "Hey guys. So first, I figured I should tell you a bit about myself. I am a full time public safety officer (police and firefighter) in South Carolina. My goal is to fly in law enforcement for the state. That means I need 1000 hours, instrument rating, and commercial ratings for both single and multi-engine aircraft. To do that, I must build a lot of hours in a hurry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am in the process of purchasing a 1968 Citabria 7ECA which should be home with me\u00a0soon. I figured now is the time to do what I love: share general aviation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to bring you along as I build hours, maintain the aircraft, interview pilots, and plan flights. This will be done with both the use of realworld aviation video and the use of flight simulators. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, aviation is expensive. I have sacrificed quite a lot to be able to fly as much as I need to. I feel that my love for general aviation (especially taildraggers on grass strips!) will translate into exciting and informative videos that should keep the viewers wanting more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this expands, I plan to return every dollar made into the videos, my flight training, and giveaways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFly Cheap, Fly Safe, Fly Happy."
