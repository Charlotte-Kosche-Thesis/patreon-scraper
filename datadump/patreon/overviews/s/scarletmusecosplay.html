    "summary": "You guys have heard of cosplay. It\u0027s nothing new anymore. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re here because you\u0027ve heard of me or seen my work, and I\u0027m here to show you my latest and greatest. I will also share how I made things, and if you have any questions, shoot! I\u0027m all ears (or is it eyes?)

I want to cosplay everything!! But that\u0027s crazy. Right? So for now I will just build, build, build!!! :P \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about myself. Halloween was my dad\u0027s favorite holliday, my parents anniversary, and my brother\u0027s birthday. I was 8 years old when I fell in love with costuming, and have been making my own costumes since 2006 when I attended AKon, my very first convention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to keep the cosplay industry positive and inviting to everyone because when I was young it was very much my escape. In my experience, conventions were mostly the outcasts and people accepting of the outcasts. I got bullied a lot and it was the one place where we all fit in and no one was judging. You could wear or be anyone you wanted for a couple of days without worrying what anyone thought. We were all looking for friends and had our own \"interesting\" going on, so we weren\u0027t going to judge yours. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately it has gotten very competitive, and I have run into a lot of judgmental people making others uncomfortable about cosplaying. I want to make sure that doesn\u0027t become the norm. :)\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cosplay because I enjoy it!! \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplays so far...\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSTAR WARS\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDarth Vader, Princess Leia, Mara Jade, R2D2, Sexy\nChewbacca, Sith Rey, and Slave Leia\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDISNEY\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnna, Ariel, Belle, Maleficent, Sexy Cheshire Cat, and Tinker Bell\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDC \u003cbr\u003e\n\nArtemis of Wonder Woman, Bat Girl, Cat Woman, Green\nLantern, Harley Quinn, Lady Flash, Mera, Poison Ivy, Star Fire, and Zatanna\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMARVEL\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBlack Cat, Black Widow, Burlesque Captain America, Mary\nJane, Phoenix, Spider Girl, Sexy Venom, and Spitfire\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMISC COMICS\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRed Sonja, Silk Spectre, and Sonya Savage\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMOVIES\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbsinthe Fairy, Amber and Baby Doll of Sucker Punch, Dr.\nFrank N.
