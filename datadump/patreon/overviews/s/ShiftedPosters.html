    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is project \"Posterize?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePosterize\u003c/strong\u003e is my first official poster project. I created this project because of my love for design and love to create genuinely positive messages. Though this is just the beginning of the project, I\u0027m shaping to create one poster print every month with a positive message, a story, and a memory. I\u0027d love to make poster prints that you can look at when it\u0027s hung up in your bedroom and immediately think of the reason WHY it was designed. My goal is to take poster design and elevate the meaning behind it all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/36EFrRu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month, you will receive a poster in the mail (signed and numbered), alongside of a postcard describing and explaining the meaning and reasoning behind the poster design I have created. The poster will not be revealed until the day after they\u0027ve been shipped, as it will be completely mysterious. Once they\u0027ve been shipped, an entire blog post will be made (which will include the design) and from there I will work on the upcoming months design.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy posters?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like I\u0027ve had the most impact on myself through posters in my own bedroom rather than prints like car decals and t-shirts. T-Shirts are of easy access, and though I would love to print my poster designs on shirts, I feel like posters would be the \u0027one little different\u0027 thing I do outside of just creating a positive message clothing line. Because of that, I\u0027d like to focus this project mostly centered on poster printing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading and showing interest!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
