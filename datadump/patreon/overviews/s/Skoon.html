     "about": "About me? Well I am a bit of a country bumpkin from northern Appalachia and despite mainly being raised by a handfull of hicks I am a typically nerdy artist. I am also a political outlier in my family, being of left-leaning centrist ilk; whereas just about everybody I am related to is conservative, Christian and republican. My lineage is dominantly Celtic, especially Irish, but I also have a significant branch of both English and Heron in my family line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also, foremost, a total furfag. I live among bronies and they make up a considerable portion of my fanbase, but I am personally a long identified furry. Since 1998 in fact!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am in my thirties and that makes me an old man on the internet as well as in any \"Tales of\" video game. I still call tv\u0027s televisions and refer to paper maps for directions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art has been influenced heavily by three established artists. Two of the furry fandom, one now sadly passed away, and one of major media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey are the late James M. Hardiman of Skunkworks renown; Jeremy Bernal of Sexfur fame; and the early conceptual artwork of one Yoshitaka Amano, known best in America for his art in the Final Fantasy and Sandman franchises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d say that in particular my loose sketching style and fondness for equally loose colors came mostly from Yoshitaka Amano\u0027s designs for the old Final Fantasy games. I am very fond of that old school look. Game design today is too over-done and shiny for my tastes. Everything is detailed to a mind boggling degree. I prefer simplicity.\u003cbr\u003e",
