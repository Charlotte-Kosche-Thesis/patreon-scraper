    "summary": "You have found Sharkk Heartt, which is both a band name, and a brand of activism which believes that often being vulnerable is the fiercest way forward; which encourages speaking when we have the opportunity to speak or be silent about something that matters; which believes that standing on the right side of history means always working for a world in which all of us have the right to feel safe and be treated as equals, regardless of sexuality, gender identity, race, religion, or ability. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why Sharkk Heartt wears rainbow face paint when performing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why Sharkk Heartt sings feminist anthems and songs about what it means to be part of a human family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why Sharkk Heartt will make donating to organizations that work for social justice, equality, LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights part of its artistic mission. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMagically, you are here reading this, and you now have the opportunity to become part of the community that brings Sharkk Heartt\u0027s mission to life. When you become a patron, for as little as $2 per month, you will gain access to EVERY NEW THING Sharkk Heartt creates, as well as updates on creative progress. When a new song has been written and its first tentative bedroom performance recorded, you will get to hear it. When a song grows up a little, becomes ready to share at a live show and gets immortalized on video, you\u2019ll be the first to see that video online. When a new album is in recording and we are perfecting studio mixes, you\u2019ll get to hear the imperfect ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSharkk Heartt will share a version of a new song at least once per month, but never more than twice - this way you will never be charged more than twice a month for the amount you choose to pledge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, Sharkk Heartt has eight new songs ready to be produced and recorded. Demos of several of these are READY TO SHARE WITH YOU in video or audio form. When we reach the first $100 in patron support, these songs will begin to be released exclusively to you, the patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, we will activate matching donations that will double that month\u2019s fundraising and support organizations working for equality. Exciting, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means that by becoming a patron, you will NOT ONLY get exclusive access to songs-in-progress as they get produced and recorded, you will ALSO be helping to unlock EXTRA fundraising potential, AND your contributions will make it possible for this music to give back to really good causes that keep us moving toward equality for all. It\u2019s a trifecta we can all feel really, really good about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. Let\u2019s do this. Sharkk Heartt is ready. Are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
