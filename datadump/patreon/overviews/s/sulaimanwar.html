I\u0027m a self taught game developer working in collaboration with youtube channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/CyberGothTatsumaki\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTats Top Videos\u003c/a\u003e for a new video game title based on their SCP:Sedition series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSCP:Sedition\u003c/h3\u003eSCP:Sedition is a series created by the talented team at Tats Top Videos set in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSCP Universe\u003c/a\u003e in which lead character \"Watch\" asks SCP entities a series of questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Project\u003c/h3\u003eThe project I\u0027m working on is a video game based on the SCP:Sedition series. It will be a narrative driven game with elements from multiple genre such as RPG and puzzle games. I am the only developer working on the technical aspects of the game such as art, design and programming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/h2\u003eAs I\u0027ll be studying full time in 3dsense Media School, this will mean I will have to balance what little time I have between developing the game and working part time in order to support my family\u0027s financial needs as well as to cover my daily expenses at school. I\u0027ve reached out to Patreon in hope that it might assist me with these.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHow will your contributions help?\u003c/h1\u003eYour contributions will allow me to cover my daily expenses and household bills, lifting my family\u0027s financial burden. It will allow me to cover the expenses of softwares and hardwares that will greatly assist in the game development process. This will also mean that I will have more time to work on the game. SCP:Sedition is something I am very passionate about and it will mean the world to me if I could make this game and share this to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat else?\u003c/h3\u003eBefore I started studying in 3dsense, I was an instructor in the local Civil Defence and have developed a deep passion for teaching as well. Hence, I intend to use some of my free time to share my knowledge by creating game development related videos such as tutorials and video essays to upload it to my channel. Your contributions will allow me to purchase the recording equipments as well as for stock contents like music and sound effects for usage on these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere to find out more?\u003c/h3\u003eYou can drop me an email at sulaimanwar18@gmail.com.
