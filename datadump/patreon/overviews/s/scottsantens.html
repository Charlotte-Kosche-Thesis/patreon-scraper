Without an income platform set just above the poverty level as a bare minimum, I believe poverty and inequality will continue to grow, the middle classes will continue to shrink, and the livelihoods of all but the top fifth of society will continue to slip away. But it doesn\u0027t have to be that way. We\u0027re better than that. We can turn all of this on its head, and instead of things continuing to get worse, we can make things better than they\u0027ve ever been. We can reduce risk and so propel innovation and creativity to new heights. We can reduce fears of unemployment and purposely eliminate low-skill jobs better performed by machines, freeing us to intrinsically do all the work that drives us. We can stop wasting so many resources on fighting the fires of our lives, and instead prevent them from ever lighting in the first place. We need only make the choice. The path is ours to take.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2013, my most popular article I\u0027d written about basic income became was \"\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/working-life/why-should-we-support-the-idea-of-an-unconditional-basic-income-8a2680c73dd3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhy Should We Support the Idea of an Unconditional Basic Income?\u003c/a\u003e\" It made \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/top-100/june-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMedium\u0027s Top 100 in June 2014\u003c/a\u003e, but it was surpassed by my article, \"\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/basic-income/self-driving-trucks-are-going-to-hit-us-like-a-human-driven-truck-b8507d9c5961\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSelf-Driving Trucks Are Going to Hit Us Like a Human-Driven Truck\u003c/a\u003e,\" in 2015 which was republished across multiple media outlets and has likely altogether garnered over 1 million views.

In 2017, my most read article was \"The Real Story of Automation Beginning with One Simple Chart.\" When not writing articles related to basic income, I am further researching the idea, and reading and writing comments as a moderator of the basic income community on Reddit - \u003ca href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e(/r/BasicIncome)\u003c/a\u003e, where I\u0027ve helped grow the community from the less than 2,000 subscribers it had when I joined, to \u003ca href=\"http://redditmetrics.com/r/BasicIncome\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eover 50,000 today\u003c/a\u003e. I do what I can there to help make it a central place for discussion and learning in hopes of gradually gaining momentum for the social movement it will require to eventually be realized. I also run multiple social media accounts in support of basic income: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/basicincome\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@BasicIncome\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/basic.income\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBasic Income on Facebook, \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rBasicIncome\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@rBasicIncome\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rBasicIncome\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003erBasicIncome on Facebook\u003c/a\u003e, and help with the social media outreach of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Basic.Income.Earth.Network\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBasic Income Earth Network (BIEN)\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/US-Basic-Income-Guarantee-Network/206792926015200\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eU.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network (USBIG)\u003c/a\u003e, and now Manna.

As I explained in \u003ca href=\"http://www.scottsantens.com/basic-income-observations-log-entry-one-security\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea blog post about security\u003c/a\u003e, it is a key emergent component of basic income, and therefore a basic income of $1,000 per month funded by 1,000 people is far more secure and stable than the same amount funded by 100 people. So please, if you support the work I\u0027m doing thanks to the passion I have for helping make this idea happen in the world, please don\u0027t worry that $1 per month is too little. To the contrary, that and over 999 others doing the same, is extremely close to the security of a government provided basic income. And the support of 1,000 people here on Patreon will also show that much more support for the idea of basic income itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support my travel to various basic income-related events, I\u0027ve also setup \u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/2arwje4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea separate crowdfund specifically for my travel expenses\u003c/a\u003e.

Right now, it\u0027s possible for one person to drop their support for whatever reason, or for pledges to be declined, and as a result reduce my basic income to below the poverty level. However, that would not be the case if I had as many as 1,000 patrons each pledging $1 per month. In that case the greatest loss to my basic income by one patron would be $1. So that is my next goal, to spread out my basic income among a thousand patrons, while continuing to pledge everything over $1,012 to fellow creators who have taken the BIG Patreon Creator Pledge for their own basic incomes.\u003cbr\u003e",
