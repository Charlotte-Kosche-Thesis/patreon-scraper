    "summary": "The Shipyard, and Warp Core Breach, are projects that I\u0027m passionate about. \u00a0I love Star Trek Attack Wing, I love the worldwide community that\u0027s associated with the game. \u00a0Star Trek fans are truly the best fans and you all prove it on a daily basis. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why a Patreon? \u00a0Well, simply put, stuff isn\u0027t free. \u00a0Hosting fees exist for the podcast and equipment costs money. \u00a0Also, it takes a lot of time to record and edit every minute of content that goes out. \u00a0I\u0027m not looking to get rich here, I\u0027m not looking for anything really. \u00a0I\u0027m offering a means for people to support what I do, and help me continue doing it. \u00a0Also, to allow me to start/continue with awesome prizes. \u00a0If no one supports, then realistically, nothing changes. \u00a0If the masses support, then who knows? \u00a0But the reality is, the content flow stays about the same because it\u0027s what I have the time to do. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll sneak in some early content for supporters, or maybe the occasional bonus video for you guys. \u00a0Can\u0027t give you early access to the prize stuff, but there\u0027s other things that will be worthwhile, like bloopers, random musings, maybe some live hangouts, stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank-you for considering helping out what I do, and continuing to make Star Trek Attack Wing a positive and enjoyable experience for many."
