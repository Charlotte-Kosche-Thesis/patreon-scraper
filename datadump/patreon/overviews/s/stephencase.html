    "summary": "A good friend of mine, and incredibly talented artist,\u00a0 Harvey Chan was telling me about a project he\u0027d love to do, which is to draw every Coen Brother character. As he was talking I stopped him and said he shouldn\u0027t be telling me this - because I\u0027d steal! To which he replied, \"Well why don\u0027t we collaborate?\" which I think is a great idea. Of course he\u0027s incredibly busy so I don\u0027t know if he\u0027ll be able to. Mind you he also works fast and is very prolific so hopefully he can. Anyway since he doesn\u0027t mind, I figured I\u0027d start. It\u0027s such a great idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I found out about Patreon I thought this might be a good place for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of the Coen Brother\u0027s movies and/or caricature you might enjoy this project. Also to anyone that might sign on as a patron, let me say a big thanks to you right now.\u003cbr\u003e"
