You might remember me as the author of \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/sailornothing\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSailor Nothing\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/unrealestate\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnreal Estate\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/anachronauts\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eanachronauts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/cityofangles\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCity of Angles\u003c/a\u003e, and my most recent work, \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFloating Point\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily write science fiction, dabbling in a bit of comedy here, a bit of drama there, sometimes a twist of cosmic horror. My primary influences are similarly thoughtful scifi and fantasy authors such as Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. (My earliest online handle, Twoflower, hails from Pratchett\u0027s Discworld series.) I don\u0027t like limiting myself to any one genre or style; I mix it up, sometimes multiple times within the same project, to keep things lively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile to date I\u0027ve focused on \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/store\"\u003epaperback novels\u003c/a\u003e, my current project is a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel\"\u003eVisual Novel\u003c/a\u003e named \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/arcadespirits\"\u003eArcade Spirits\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, written in the \u003ca href=\"https://renpy.org/\"\u003eRen\u0027py\u003c/a\u003e engine. It\u0027ll be a mix of a workplace sitcom and a romantic comedy anime, taking place in a classic retro arcade, with gamers and employees as characters you can meet and greet (and possibly date and stuff.) If you like my writing style in my novels, you\u0027ll love this game, no doubt!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game will eventually be released for Windows, with ports available for Linux and Mac. We\u0027re still in the early development at this stage, but that\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you join this Patreon, you\u0027ll get an early access inside look at the development process, and be directly involved. Sneak peeks of artwork, demos and limited builds, voting on features, and more! While much of this material will eventually also post to the \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/blog\"\u003epublic development blog\u003c/a\u003e, you\u0027ll get the inside scoop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s more, if you contribute a total of at least $25 over the course of the game\u0027s development, you\u0027ll get a copy of the game when we\u0027re finished! Your backing goes into an ongoing fund to pay for art and music contracts, and other business expenses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"I thought you were a book writer. Have you ever made a game before?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes! In my earliest days I released Pong Kombat, a silly parody game that spread far and wide in the heady days of the early 90s. I\u0027m also an award-winning module designer for Neverwinter Nights (Penultima, Elegia Eternum, the HeXcoda). And notably, I\u0027ve successfully run a profitable fishing game for the last ten years called 7Seas. While this is my first standalone Windows game, I\u0027ve got plenty of experience. My partner in this venture, Aenne Schumann, is a veteran of numerous indie game jams and has several industry writing credits to her name. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t pretend we\u0027ve got this whole indie game thing licked -- it\u0027s going to be a wild ride, and we\u0027re still sorting out a lot of what needs doing. But both of us have experience, are reasonable adults, and are determined to see this through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"When will the game be released?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen It\u0027s Done(tm). Seriously, we don\u0027t know when, indie games are pretty crazy adventures. You can join and leave the Patreon any time you like; as long as over the course of development you\u0027ve contributed at least $25, you\u0027ll still get a copy when we finish.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027d rather just read novels.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s okay! I\u0027ve got \u003ca href=\"http://stefangagne.com/\"\u003eplenty of those\u003c/a\u003e. If you don\u0027t want to back my latest fiasco, this indie game, that\u0027s fine too. But I\u0027d suggest keeping tabs on it anyway via my blog. You might like what you see!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"I really want to support you, but I just can\u0027t afford to get in on this.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s fine! One of the best ways you can help is to simply follow he public development blog, and spread word of the game across yon Internets. Word-of-mouth is how fully independent creative folks get traction, and you can help me with that for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who want to go above and beyond, well, the Patreon\u0027s for you! Sign up for reoccurring monthly pledges, or just pledge a $25 wad for a single update and then unsubscribe. Whatever combination you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far. Thanks for considering becoming a patron. Whether you\u0027re just along for the ride or in for a penny and a pound, I\u0027m happy you\u0027re with me. Thanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e"
