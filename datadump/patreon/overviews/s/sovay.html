My name is Sonya Taaffe; I am a prolific reader, the author of four collections of short fiction and poetry, and I watch a lot more movies than I used to think I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor about ten years now, I have been writing about film on my journal \u003ca href=\"http://sovay.dreamwidth.org/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMyth Happens\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Recurring subjects include classic movies, cult movies, pre-Code Hollywood, B-pictures, queer cinema, character actors, and directors I can\u0027t understand why everyone doesn\u0027t already know and love. Once a year I stay awake for twenty-four hours of science fiction film marathon at the Somerville Theatre. More often I rely on the good graces of Turner Classic Movies and my local arthouse theaters. I have occasionally written about film for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://weirdfictionreview.com/by/sonya-taaffe/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWeird Fiction Review\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, but I am looking for support for my reviews on a more regular basis. I see lot of strange things these days. I\u0027d like to share what I find.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your support, I can guarantee a minimum of four full-length (more than 500 words) film reviews a month, variably scheduled as availability of movies allows. All reviews will be made freely accessible at my journal (currently \u003ca href=\"http://sovay.dreamwidth.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDreamwidth\u003c/a\u003e\u2014there\u0027s no cutting-edge social media around here), but patrons will receive additional notes about the viewing or writing process along with their updates, as well as the chance to make requests, encourage poetry, and appreciate my two frequent co-viewers, Tybalt Autolycus Taaffe and Hestia Hermia Linsky-Noyes.\u003c/div\u003e"
