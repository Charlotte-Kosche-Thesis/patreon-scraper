Even just a visit really means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Danny Gallows, but you can call me \u0027Stormy\u0027 and i am a musician, artist, writer, reviewer and creator! The reason that i decided to come over to Patreon is that i have spent my entire life as an artist, creating and being involved in all different kind of projects. I have been in a movie, been featured as a comic book character, spent 4 years in the US Navy and now, i have finally found a home on social media!\u003cbr\u003eOn my Youtube/Twitter channels, i am combining my talents as a writer, actor, video creator, artist, musician and massive Star Wars fan to showcase truly creative, unique channels for all ages to enjoy. Sharing the love of Star Wars,\u00a0Vlogging, Movie Reviews, Food reviews, as well as my books / art / music / paintings and other creations!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOn my Soundcloud page @studiogallows you will find collections of my music spanning about 10 years of my life, as well as current music \u0026amp; albums i am creating, which is always free for download. I also create background music that may be used for content creation.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, i am a full time worker and a daily up-loader on Youtube. I am working on writing my Grandmothers memoirs, as well as a few Fantasy/Sci-Fi novels i am preparing to publish on amazon. And finally, i have several music albums which i am constantly working on and plan to release throughout the year.\u003cbr\u003eThis page gives me a chance to bring all of my abilities to the table, and if you like what you see, i appreciate the support! All money generated here goes directly back into my projects, to continue to bring you all content daily. My goal is to do this full time and share this with the world.\u003cbr\u003eThank you again, and May the Force be with You! Here you allow me to build my dream."
