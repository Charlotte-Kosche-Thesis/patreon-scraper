If you back at the higher levels, some of it will be physical. (I have kept these levels \u003cem\u003eextremely\u003c/em\u003e limited, because the point here is to create and conduct research, not to spend all the funds on mailing things around the world. That gets expensive fast.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two main avenues for projects: my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.toosexyforcontacts.com/\"\u003ewww.TOOSEXYFORCONTACTS.com\u003c/a\u003e and my independent art company, Storm Shadow Is\u0027kwe (LLC). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach is a little different in terms of content, with TSFC being more \u003cstrong\u003eburlesque\u003c/strong\u003e/blogosphere based, and Storm Shadow Is\u0027kwe showcasing my works as a visual artist (including glassblowing, sculpture, and illustration.)

The Journey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHosting: web space for two different websites, as well as associated fees for domain names and webmail server space through DreamHost. \u00a0I have included these costs in the first wave because these are all things which must be put in place and paid for in full before I leave the United States, to ensure uninterrupted continuous service. Total cost is \u003cstrong\u003e$140\u003c/strong\u003e for the year.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeebly: I maintain one of my websites with them, and must pay for premium service in order to have it forward to my domain name. \u00a0This costs $8/month (\u003cstrong\u003e$96\u003c/strong\u003e for the year).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOngoing web development: It\u0027s a website, so there are always upsetting glitches coming out of nowhere and occasionally, I may want to add a new site feature. Currently I don\u0027t have any programming skills, so I need to pay someone to do this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMe. I need to continue to eat things and wear things and turn on lights as I write and draw posts. I\u0027m just one gal with no dependents, so needs are minimal, but I do need some new kitchen items (among other things) to help me settle in.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSoundCloud: I would like to be able to purchase a premium SoundCloud plan for hosting upcoming podcasts (a premium account has enough storage space to allow me to do this without having to delete past episodes). This costs \u003cstrong\u003e$135\u003c/strong\u003e for a year.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWordpress Premium: Currently, I run my blog using a free version of Wordpress. I would like to upgrade to a premium account so my blog can be ad-free. This costs \u003cstrong\u003e$99\u003c/strong\u003e/year.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. The Residency\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt Supplies: mostly paper, but also some other implements, such as colored pencils or watercolors. \u00a0It will be easier and more cost effective to purchase these things in Romania than to take up space in my luggage bringing them over from the USA.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConferences: Application fees, hotel accommodations, food and train fare to conferences outside of Romania to present my linguistic research and photograph cultural landmarks.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMe. Still gotta eat, even across the Atlantic. \u00a0I will also need money to take trains across the country as I do my research on linguistic dialects and photograph people/places, including travel to conferences.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePostage: For sending postcards home to friends, fans, and family, of course!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. The Show\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExhibition Space/Gallery Rental: Upon my return to the United States, I will curate an exhibition of all the artwork created abroad.  I will need money to secure a venue for the show, as well as pay someone to help me hang the show. This will be the greatest expense for this \u0027wave.\u0027\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinting: To cover the cost of printing physical copies of my digital photographs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFraming: To cover the cost of purchasing frames for my artwork, as well as nails/hooks/wire.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn Assistant: I know several people who have much more experience in curating and hanging art shows than I do, so I would like to be able to hire one of those individuals to help with mine. \u00a0I need to be be able to fairly compensate them for their time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSnacks! \u00a0Wine! \u00a0Other Assorted Delicacies: \u00a0I\u0027ve been to a lot of art shows, and my least favorites are the ones that don\u0027t serve snacks. \u00a0I will not be one of those art shows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdditional Grab Bag Surprises: Cost of creating items for the VIP swag grab bags.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThis goal would feel great to achieve, but simply being supported by fan generosity makes this demon endlessly grateful, no matter what else happens. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my first time using Patreon, so this will be a learning experience for me too. I hope you can join me. \u003cstrong\u003eMiigweetch [thank you]\u003c/strong\u003e for any support you can offer if you decide to, and thanks for being a fan!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMi\u0027iwi [that\u0027s all] \u0026lt;3"
