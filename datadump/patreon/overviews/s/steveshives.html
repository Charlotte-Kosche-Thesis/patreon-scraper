My YouTube work continues to be the most creatively fulfilling thing I\u0027ve ever done. I\u0027m here because I want to keep doing this, and keep getting better at it. This is the only thing I\u0027ve ever felt like I\n was really good at.

You might not like everything (in fact, given how eclectic and idiosyncratic my stuff is, you probably \u003cem\u003ewon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e like everything), but you might find something that resonates with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re a regular or a newcomer to my stuff, I\u0027m asking you to consider supporting me with a pledge. Since my output is so frequent, I\u0027m taking donations on a per-month basis rather than a per-video basis. If this is something you\u0027re interested in and able to do, I\u0027m flattered beyond words by that. Whether it\u0027s $1, $5, $10, $20 or some other exotic number I surely could never imagine on my own, you have my deepest gratitude. And be sure to check out the rewards I\u0027m offering for being a patron, particularly if you\u0027re thinking of pledging at the $10 level or higher!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your attention, and thanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"

When I reach this milestone, I will do just that -- but not by merely releasing the audio of the previously released videos. I\u0027ll record fresh, new, high quality audio versions of every \u003cem\u003eAn Atheist Reads \u003c/em\u003eseries to date, starting with \u003cem\u003eAn Atheist Reads The Case for Christ\u003c/em\u003e, and continue to record audio podcast versions of new series as I produce them!\u003cbr\u003e",
