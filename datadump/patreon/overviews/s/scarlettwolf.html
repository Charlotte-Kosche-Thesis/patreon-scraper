    "summary": "My name is Clarissa, although most know me by the name \"Scarlett Wolf\" online. I have been a freelance artist for 3 years, and I am a full time college student looking to get a business degree and hopefully go to art school later in life. \u003cbr\u003eThe majority of my time is spent on school and my artwork. I have found it increasingly difficult to work on personal ideas, new mediums, crafts, and merchandise. There are so many products I would love to offer but do not have the time to experiment on and develop into a full product or commission type. I have also had to set aside a novel that has been in the works since I was in 6th grade. I have always wanted to be an author, but my freelance work has shoved that idea into a dusty corner that is hard to reach. My love for my little universe and story ideas have never ceased, and I still wish for the day I can bring it to life along with my other ideas. The reason I have started this patreon account is so I can work on my own personal projects and product ideas without having to worry about making up the money lost from spending time on them instead of my commissions. Here are my ideas!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwisted Souls\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is my first and only novel I have attempted writing. I have pages and pages of concepts and ideas, and plenty of scrapped chapters for this story. For the time being, I would love to turn this into a world building project where I release illustrations of the characters and environment this story takes place in. This story follows the life of Scarlett Wolf, a powerful shapeshifter who must struggle as a pawn between two sides of a bloody war. She must decide who her true friends are and how she will escape from the barrage of manipulation and dangerous threats that rein upon her. Eris is the name of the world, dubbed by its shapeshifter kind. It is a world after humans which lies in ruins but is rich with unique wildlife and revolutionary technology. My ultimate goal would be to release a fully illustrated novel. I will not give away all details because that would spoil the story! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eStickers! Pins!

New patrons who have pledged $5 and up will receive their thank you drawings a few days after payments have been processed. Monthly raffles will take place mid-month and be completed within that week. I plan on setting up a streaming profile so I can broadcast while I draw the raffle prizes and work on personal projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so so very much for supporting me.
