    "summary": "Hello, and thanks for taking the time to check out this page and \u003ca href=\"http://synapticism.com\"\u003eSynapticism\u003c/a\u003e, my blog! I regularly write feature-length articles about obscure, neglected, and unusual themes, especially related to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://synapticism.com/places/taiwan\"\u003eTaiwan\u003c/a\u003e, where I have spent most of my time over the last few years. I don\u0027t do anything out of an interest in making a name for myself or becoming a professional blogger or anything like that\u2014I\u0027d much rather keep it personal and pursue whatever strange and unusual stuff arouses my curiosity. I do, however, take great care in researching what I write about, and this attention to detail and basic respect for the often uncommon subject material seems to have attracted a bit of a following. Now and then people ask me if there\u0027s any way to support what I do\u2014so I\u0027ve set up this Patreon page on the off chance anyone would like to buy me a coffee or whatever ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://synapticism.com/x/taiwan-nantou-checheng-my-kingdom-450x450.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePresently the main focus of my blog is Taiwanese culture, history, and geography. I have been especially interested in documenting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://synapticism.com/meta/taiwan-urban-exploration/\"\u003eabandoned and disused places\u003c/a\u003e before they vanish,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://synapticism.com/meta/taiwan-temple-culture/\"\u003etemple culture and local spiritual practices\u003c/a\u003e, and scenes out of everyday life here in Taiwan. A big part of my motivation is simply that Taiwan isn\u0027t widely known in the English-speaking world so there\u0027s a rare opportunity to do something at least somewhat original. Writing about Taiwan is also a means of learning more about it, for I try my best to be at least somewhat diligent about researching what I\u0027m publishing these days. I also happen to care deeply about Taiwan and would like to think that I am making it more approachable for an international audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a more general sense my blog is a reflection of the kind of content I enjoy finding on the open web: reasonably well-informed, thoughtful, meticulously arranged, and free of advertising. I started this project hoping to make some small contribution to a media landscape dominated by clickbait headlines, invasive advertising, and superficial, sensationalized garbage and it seems to be working.\u00a0I am also interested in finding out if micro-patronage sites like Patreon can serve as a viable monetization strategy for indie bloggers disinterested in sponsorship deals and product placement. I dunno, is this something people are interested in? Let\u0027s find out! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApart from hundreds of features about all sorts of weird and obscure stuff (a lot of which you won\u0027t find anywhere else on the English language web) I have also released more than ten thousand photographs under\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://synapticism.com/terms-of-use/\"\u003ea permissive Creative Commons license\u003c/a\u003e for noncommercial reuse, a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=172R8JObYYbtpZ43Hq4jgrANDpFQ\u0026amp;hl=en_US\u0026amp;ll=25.033565557461618%2C121.50331177156374\u0026amp;z=11\"\u003emap of working cafes in Taiwan\u003c/a\u003e, a free suite of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/synapticism/synaptic-lightroom-presets\"\u003eAdobe Lightroom development presets\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/synapticism?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026amp;tab=repositories\u0026amp;q=wordpress\u0026amp;type=\u0026amp;language=\"\u003enumerous open source projects\u003c/a\u003e for the WordPress blogging platform. Ultimately I aim to polish the theme I use on my blog today for anyone to use on their own blogs but it\u0027s not quite there yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an aside, if you\u0027re also an indie blogger covering Taiwan or related subjects with an eye for detail and a focus on quality, let\u0027s talk! I\u0027d love to see a little network of bloggers sprout up here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyhow, you are very welcome to support my work on these projects with a pledge as low as $1 a month! I don\u0027t have any expectations here and will continue doing what I do because I love doing it\u2014but I hugely appreciate your support and will put the money to good use!"
