A lot. Which is good, because I am a professional illustrator. This means I\u0027m usually working under a contract to produce artwork for various companies, or I\u0027m creating paintings for\u00a0private commissions. I\u0027ve done a lot of sketch card work, especially stuff with fantasy and pin-up themes. You can find my portfolio on my website,\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.therealmofsam.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.therealmofsam.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat The Hell IS Patreon???\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m assuming most of the people who stumble onto this page may not be familiar with this platform. But if you are, feel free to skip this boring ass paragraph to something more interesting. Patreon is a crowd funding platform strictly for creative people. It\u0027s a lot like Kickstarter or GoFundMe, but unlike those platforms, you are paying a recurring amount every month. In return you get certain rewards based on how much you pay. These rewards might be as simple as having access to my Patron exclusive feed (which the public never sees), or early access to art reveals. Depending on your pledge level, you might also get digital downloads, high res images, post cards, sketches, and even full color art. Your money will be directly funding a creative and their passion (I hope it\u0027s me! \ud83d\ude03), and that is a really big deal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I made a Patreon Account\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI initially made this account to help supplement my monthly income so I could focus more on personal projects and less on paid projects. I have been working under constant deadlines since 2011, and between the stress from the work itself and the financial stress from knowing my art alone can\u0027t pay the bills, I have been dipping in and out of some serious creative burnout for the past year. In July 2017 I picked up a day job to help me steady things out, so sadly I have even less time to dedicate to art. BUT, the good news is, between my day job and the small monthly income this account has begun to generate for me, I am getting that chance to step away from paid work and begin pursuing my True North again. And the first project...is super dumb. \ud83e\udd13\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe First BIG Project: I\u0027M TOTALLY WORKING ON A GATCHAMAN FANFIC AND COMIC YO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou heard me. Look,\u00a0I\u0027m not usually big into fan art. I dabble, but most of the \"fan art\" I\u0027ve created has either been sketch card related or for private commissions. There are so many fandoms I love and so few I have drawn. Someone makes a suggestion and I\u0027m all \"Eeeeeheuuuuuuuhhhhhh\" but then they hand me money and I\u0027m immediately like \"I GOT THIS.\" I\u0027ve just never been inclined to dip my toes in into that pool on my own. That is, until I fell back into the Gatchaman fandom, a.k.a. Battle of the Planets, a.k.a. G-Force: Guardians of Space, a.k.a. that horrible Eagle Riders version that I absolutely refuse to watch...(NO.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I was bitten by the creative bug and that itch won\u0027t go away until I get this ridiculousness out of my system. This project was supposed to be a short and simple experiment with script writing and sequential art story telling (i.e. comic books). I have no interest in working on super hero stuff for the big guys, but I have lots of little original stories of my own that I would love to self publish. But they are precious to me. What better way to jump in than to start with something that already exists, so if I royally screw it up, who the hell cares? There\u0027s only one problem. While this is still an experiment and totally fan made (and I will be giving the entire thing away for free as a digital comic because this is not my I.P. and I have no intention of making a penny off it), the story has grown into something fully dimensional and huge. It basically snowballed when I had my head turned, and now I\u0027ve got a monster to feed. Starting in May 2018 I\u0027ll be taking a year long pause from contract art and commissions, basically any art for anyone who isn\u0027t me, and I\u0027ll be shifting my entire focus to this dumb 1970\u0027s anime (that I love with my entire stupid heart). Months ago I began outlining the script for a Gatchaman origins fan fiction that gives us a look the childhoods that shaped the Science Ninjas. There are now two scripts in the works, the first focusing on the Eagle and the Condor growing up together, (somehow surviving their tweens...), and eventually meeting and training with their teammates. The second is a companion piece that will give us the history we never saw for the Swan and the Swallow. And yes, I absolutely plan on tearing your heart out just like the show did. My goal is to capture that endless summer atmosphere, a false serenity tinged with ominous undertones of something rotten slowly corrupting the world, and the broken innocence of the childhoods that will soon be lost as our five little mini-ninja birds grow into who they were always meant to be. I\u0027m keeping everything as canon and true to the show as I possibly can, but there will be a few tweaks due to timeline inconsistencies stemming from the show itself (lol imagine that). I am fortunate to have bumped into a fierce Gatchageek who has been quite helpful in digging up obscure information for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/23167770_10155913072713619_6637642581164008212_n.jpg?oh=64abf62a9c93a51e1242d1fc85af86f0\u0026amp;oe=5AB6C6C6\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJun\u0027s Endless Summer - A 13-year-old Jun riding with a 15-year-old Koji Yabane.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo...Can I handle a project this big?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. I can. At the end of 2015 I completed my largest project to date, a coloring book for adults titled Quest, which was released last June, 2016, by Blue Star Premiere as part of their Masterpiece Collection. Not only is it a coloring book, it serves as a collectible art book, and the entire thing is a wordless narrative detailing a little faun, her fairy friend, and their epic quest to save the love of her life. I somehow managed to write the script, conceptualize the characters, and then draw and ink the entire 40 pages in about 3 months. And those are 40 pages of scenes, no repeating motifs or single character standing on a blank background bullcrap. SCENES. I\u0027m...still not sure how I finished this with my sanity intact (it isn\u0027t), but I feel fairly confident that if I could do this, then I can finish my Gatchaman Origins project. (And if you want to check out the madness I mean process for creating Quest, you can totally find everything right\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.therealmofsam.com/Quest-A-Fantasy-Coloring-Book\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4157/35571212836_5819e25ce7_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut I Will Need Your Help\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis account isn\u0027t just to help me generate a little extra income to cover for the fact that I\u0027m taking a break from paid work for an insane side project. It\u0027s also for accountability. That deadline stress that I was grumping about earlier? A lot will kill you, but a little is very beneficial (just like medicine!). I need to know I have people waiting on me and expecting me to keep at this project. If I were to quietly work on this all by myself without telling anyone it, I\u0027d probably never get it done. I never get anything done that way. But with an audience looking over my shoulder? Oooohhh man, the pressure is on!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get Out Of This?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOk, first off you get a front seat view of the balls to the wall insanity that is about to follow. Seriously. Hold on to your butts, I\u0027m not entirely sure what I\u0027m doing and there\u0027s gonna be mountains of art as I figure it all out. I still post my sneak peeks on Instagram and across my social media, but Patrons get to see behind the curtains. Plus, I feel more comfortable sharing larger images and full images here than I do publicly. You get to see the process as it happens, as well as my ensuing meltdowns as I work on the biggest most ridiculous and utterly useless project of my life to date. It\u0027ll all be worth it though, as I am sure this will lead to an even bigger, far more ridiculous, yet much less useless project. That\u0027s typically how it works.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve setup various pledges and rewards so you can find the one that agrees best with your pocket book and sign up for this wild ride. These rewards will grow and change as this account grows and changes and as I grow and change as an artist. (Because I\u0027m in my mid-30\u0027s, and nothing but my hair better be growing and changing at this point.) I\u0027m all about throwing goodies at you though, be they digital arts or tangible shinies. I love being able to share my work, and finally having a chance to share all of this, my whole heart really, with an audience but not quite a public audience...well. That\u0027s just perfection for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4114/35480086591_f5281f68b1_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
