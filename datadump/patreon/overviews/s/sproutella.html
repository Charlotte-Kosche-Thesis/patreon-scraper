I\u0027ve made a few small interactive fiction pieces you can see at my website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.skeleton.space/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eskeleton.space\u003c/a\u003e, and right now I\u0027m working on my first commercial release, a visual novel called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dateordiegame.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDate or Die\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love telling stories about romance and relationships of all kinds, as well as writing about the media I enjoy. I think the characters I create and stories I tell are interesting things not a lot of mainstream media cares about - it\u0027s like I\u0027m King Midas, but everything I touch gets really gay. Fantasy and horror are some of my favorite types of fiction to write, and I also like writing fanfiction (oops) and blog posts about anime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will help keep me financially stable enough to find time to write for myself again, which means more (and better) writing for you as well! I used to release small stories for free, and I miss being able to do that, but it\u0027s hard to justify taking time to do that when it\u0027s hard to support myself. \u003cstrong\u003eThis isn\u0027t to fund one particular project - you\u0027re helping me have room to grow and breathe and be able to try new things.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my work gets more recognized, I\u0027ve also been asked to attend more conventions, and that\u0027s awesome! Except for the part where traveling is expensive! I love being able to talk to people about game writing and romance and to share new ideas, but conventions are pricey and it\u0027s hard to justify if I can\u0027t reliably supplement my income. So supporting this means I\u0027ll be more likely to be able to speak at conventions and maybe meet you in person and I think that would be great!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support you can give would make a big difference, and I thank you so much for your generosity."
