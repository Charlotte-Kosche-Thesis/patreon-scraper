    "summary": "I\u0027m a circus artist based in Halifax Nova Scotia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in British Columbia knowing I wanted to perform. So, upon graduation from high school, I ventured all the way to the other side of the country to attend Dalhousie University for Theatre. I love creating, but sometimes university can kill a love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I graduated, I was burnt out from theatre but still needed a physical creative outlet. That\u0027s when I found circus. I\u0027ve been training aerial hoop since 2013, adding pole, silks, trapeze and hammock to my aerial repertoire in 2015. I\u0027m also a contortionist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009 I was involved in 2 car accidents that destroyed the cartilage in my knees. I was told I\u0027d never be able to dance professionally which had been a goal of mine. I have dislocated my right shoulder 4 times, and have quite a few body issues to work with. Circus is a harsh mistress and I often find myself with bruises and welts, but I love it. A goal of mine is to work through my mobility and stability issues to be the best artist that I can be (and that means keeping joints in their sockets!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 I was lucky enough to become the administrator of a circus and Pilates studio in Halifax. Since joining the team I have taught aerial hoop, aerial silks, hammock, trapeze, flexibility, and Pilates reformer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn September 2017, I stepped down from my administrator role to focus of teaching and performing full time. That\u0027s where you step in! I love what I do and hope that you appreciate my art form to support me."
