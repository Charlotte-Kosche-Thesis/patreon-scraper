But has lately moved out to be more independent. \u003cbr\u003eIn her daily life she is training to make it as a sound designer and performer. Making small designs for theatre shows and smaller indie games.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp Sofie taking the next big step in her videos and music life, she\u0027s desperately searching for education to better herself on these fields, unfortunately education takes money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me make better videos and better music projects in the future, support my education and further development into these fields. \u003cbr\u003eEvery single dollar will be a life saver, and will help me to keep on releasing new content on the enternet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless off any support I will continue in both these fields, though thus far I have spend far much money on either side than earning. \u003cbr\u003eAny money given to this patreon will go to sustaining the videos, and in the unlikely even of surplus money they will go into a saving account and be used for either education or upgraded video content, perhaps even real life research. I would only love to go to some different game developing companies and talk to them, giving back any observations or information. \u003cbr\u003e"
