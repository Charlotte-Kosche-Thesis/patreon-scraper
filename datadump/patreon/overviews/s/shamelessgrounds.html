    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout\nUs:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nShameless\nGrounds is St. Louis\u0027 first and only sex-positive cafe and\ncoffeeshop.  Our friendly location in beautiful and historic Benton\nPark, offers a full Cafe menu, delightful coffee (and non-coffee)\ndrinks, and we host a wide variety of free or\nlow-cost educational, social, and activist based meetings, events,\nand gatherings, including workshops, classes, meet-ups, hang-outs, munches and more \u2013 all in the furtherance of responsible and joyful\nsex-positive culture!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur\nMission:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur\ncore mission has always been to provide diverse populations access to\na non-judgmental, sex-positive, radically-inclusive gathering place; to be a community center of sex-positivity.   Food and drink is just how we\ntry to make enough money to pay the bills in order to provide that\nspace.   In addition, as a supporting mission, we work to provide\neducation, outreach, and advocacy to those persons and groups in need\nof that support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\nhave a small space.   We have a unique theme and message that tends\nto limit our cafe clientele.   We are faced with the financial\nrealities of competing with large chains and larger corporations with\nmassively larger purchasing power and influence.   And lastly, we\nstrive to pay living wages to our employees because we believe that\u0027s\nthe only ethical way to run an establishment \u2013 in an industry where\nminimum wage and price competition is the rule.   With those hurdles\nin our path, there\u0027s often too much month left at the end of our\nmoney \u2013 and we have difficulty competing on a playing field that\u0027s stacked against us. \u00a0 So we end up working long hours, sometimes without pay, in\norder to keep our beloved Shameless going. It takes a lot of work to keep the free Human\nSexuality lending library running...\u00a0 \u00a0to continue to offer free space\nfor folks who want to have educational classes, meetings, social\ngatherings, and discussion groups...and just to be here for folks who\nwant to learn, or relax, or spend time in a safe and non-judgmental\nspace.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve\nmanaged to make it for seven years now, and it\u0027s been full of fun and joy, but it has also taken a toll.  We\nsimply can\u0027t sustain this thing we call Shameless forever without just a bit more help. \nSo the deal is, we need just a little extra support from folks to keep this a\nfunctioning community asset.  When you sign up as a supporter at any\nlevel on Patreon, you\u0027ll be working along side of us to help keep the\ndoors of Shameless open for everyone.  You\u0027ll help us create more\neducational resources, help us advocate for sex-positivity, and help\nto offer a safe space for folks simply to be who they are.   In\nshort, you\u0027ll help us keep this place going in an ethical and\nsustainable fashion, for years to come.  AND you\u0027ll get some pretty\nnifty and exclusive rewards for being our patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow\ncan I participate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\n\tSubscribe\n\tat the level that feels comfortable for you\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\tHelp\n\tspread the word \u2013 enjoy the rewards of your patronage, and share\n\tthem with others!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\tSend\n\tus your questions, comments, thoughts, and ideas for what we can do\n\tfor you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\nThank\nyou for being Shameless, folks!
