When you reach the end of it, I will ask you for a donation\u2014one that comes with perks, yes, but a donation nonetheless. But I hope you\u0027ll stick with it until the end, because it\u0027s a heartfelt letter, it\u0027s not a long one, and it has a point to make. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom the look of it, the conversations, debates, and, let\u0027s face it, all-out fights in the poetry world are taking place at a rapid pace in the public world of social media and in the private pockets where friends go to think and commiserate. But I want to make the argument that having the opportunity to be face to face in the same room, and to talk, be angry, and be happy together there, remains a vital part of the picture, a part that we can\u0027t neglect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s not a controversial or groundbreaking argument, I know. But it\u0027s still one we need not to forget, because unlike the seemingly free-and-easy Internet, it costs money to hang on to these spaces, to bring poets and artists from elsewhere to perform in them, and to give staff members the freedom to work hard at creating innovative and provocative programming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI know you\u0027ve been asked already this season to become a member of Small Press Traffic, and perhaps you already have done so, in which case, thank you! But even if you have, I want to extend the invitation to support Small Press Traffic with a small, recurring donation which will provide the collective and necessary operating funds to survive. \u00a0In gratitude, we\u0027ll send you some cool swag. Kind of a win-win, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound good?
