Nowadays, I mostly shoot Boudoir, Fashion \u0026amp; Glamour for ladies, which is the niche I love and that allows me to really push my limits and my creativity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been organizing\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003esome \u003cem\u003eWeekends Cr\u00e9atifs\u003c/em\u003e (\"The Creative Weekends\") for a few years now... Every few months, we choose a theme, a special setting and aspiring models and amateur photographers get together to create stunning images. It\u0027s an awesome opportunity to learn from others, share ideas and get inspired, and it\u0027s always been lots of fun. \u00a0I also organize some photo workshops, on different themes as well, and offer some creative spaces for artists to rent, but I\u0027d like to do more... organize these events more often, be able to rent awesome spaces to shoot, hire a team of makeup artists and stylists to achieve the looks we want, \u00a0and for those who can\u0027t make it to the actual shoots (we are based in Montreal, Canada), stream the events so you can assist from wherever you are, as well as offer more workshops, posing tips, tutorials, how-to videos, and behind-the-scene previews to help all of you unleash your creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nPour mes coll\u00e8gues francophones, j\u0027aimerais aussi vous partager quelques ateliers en fran\u00e7ais ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s get creative together: help me help others and i\u0027ll make sure you also benefit from it in the process ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. If you do not want to get involved right away, follow our page on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/weekendscreatifs/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0and I\u0027m sure soon you will get inspired and will want to follow the creative movement ;)\u003cbr\u003e"
