I teach women and girls Gutsy Leadership, the magic of creativity, to trust\ntheir intuition, speak their truth and to be the leaders of their own\nlives. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have a wealth of knowledge and learning gained from trauma, transition and\npersonal transformation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a\ngutsy leader, artist, speaker, teacher, sacred activist and writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I got here\u003cbr\u003eI started Gutsy Girl 6 years ago as a handmade hobby pursuit where I created mixed media art and eco-friendly recycled sterling silver jewellery. This evolved into workshops and more. Over the past 3 years I have guided \u0026amp; taught more than 200 women and girls through my online, in person workshops, guest speaking \u0026amp; teaching. My Gutsy Mantras empowering inspiration cards are now in their second printing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy 2018-19 projects include: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eCreating a podcast.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

I am a work in progress. My personal obstacles of racism, bullying, physical and sexual assault, anxiety, depression and PTSD are lived experiences which have made me more resilient, gutsy and confident to share my stories. I want to end the stigma associated with mental illness. We are whole people no matter what breaks or cracks us open. I am a dot connector. I see how my stories have helped others and I see how I moved forward in spite of the personal challenges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here to help more and more people move forward and beyond their pain, their trauma and their stories. Every time I speak my truth I feel this simmering, this boiling beneath the skin and in my belly like a volcano about to rupture. It feels both euphoric and vulnerable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is how I know that I am standing in my power. I will not be quiet. I will not be silent. I will not yield. I will not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u2019s anything you should know about me it\u2019s this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI am an intersectional feminist, I am a biracial first generation Australian woman and a Mother. I believe in social justice, compassion and activism. \u003c/em\u003eI am moving forward from a 3 year period in my life which has been very challenging. I was diagnosed with PTSD following workplace bullying and it rocked me badly. I almost lost hope. I had an existential crisis and questioned my being-ness. It is so difficult to speak up after Trauma. I should know. I remained silent about sexual assault in my teens until my late 30\u2019s. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m following my dream to publish my book to take the silencer off my story. Through my art and writing, I\u2019ve found that telling my stories is the salve. I want to document and remember every minute of my rising from all that I\u2019ve faced and I want to help others live gutsy lives too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that we all have a role to play in this world and as one of my role models Dr Jane Goodall says, \u201c\u003cem\u003eYou cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make\u003c/em\u003e.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrices are in US dollars.
