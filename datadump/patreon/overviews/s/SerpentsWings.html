    "summary": "Thank you so much for visiting my Patreon page! My name is Naomi Craig, but you\u0027ll typically find me under the handle Sly Eagle or just Sly online.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re here, it\u0027s probably because you love and miss my comic \n\u003ca href=\"http://jaadrih.comicgenesis.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Prime of Ambition\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. That comic ran from 2006 into 2008, and during those years I was working on it full-time. This thing happened (coughcoughBABYcough) in 2008, however, and due to family and health issues I have not been able to update the comic since.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/057/7/d/lonelyhours_by_slyeagle-d785xj3.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eI have never given up on the dream of bringing this comic back. I want it badly, even though the amount of work sometimes seems insurmountable. For years, efforts to\u00a0resuscitate this project has been me squeezing as much work as I can into dark, lonely hours. \u003cbr\u003e\nBut now you can help me!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eMajor Changes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nA lot has happened in six years. For one, you may have noticed that the title of the comic is now \n\u003cem\u003eThe Serpent\u0027s Wings\u003c/em\u003e, with \u003cem\u003eThe Prime of Ambition\u003c/em\u003e being downgraded to the Book 1: subtitle. I\u0027ll spare you the grizzly details, but here are the important points:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe Prime of Ambition is now a solo project.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAfter years of struggle, I \n\t\u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e been diagnosed with a physical ailment and am currently being treated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMy children are now in preschool full-time, leaving me with actual art time!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/057/e/8/hotiron_by_slyeagle-d785xj7.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eIn other words, the iron is hot and it is time to strike! My aim is to have the first three chapters of the comic completely finished before I commit to an update schedule and relaunch the comic online.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eHow Does This Work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have always been committed to making this comic, and I will continue to do so come hell and high water (which I really shouldn\u0027t tempt because high water is now a thing here in Vermont). But thanks to Patreon, you, dear reader, have a chance to make this easier for me! You can pledge as little as $1 per relaunch task (or also as much as you want), and every time I complete a task, Patreon charges you $1 on my behalf. You immediately get to see the thing that I have completed, even though that thing will be available no where else on the internets. This does not mean the comic will have a paywall now. The old pages will continue to be hosted for free on comicgenesis and the new ones will be available on the new site for free once it goes live. But by becoming a patron, it means you no longer have to wait for perfectionist me to be ready to show it to see it. Chances are I will be completing a task every other month or so, but if you\u0027re worried about breaking the bank, you can set a monthly limit in case I end up completing five in a month or something (which would be so awesome I don\u0027t even). $1 may not seem like a lot, but if 20 of you each pledge $1, it means I don\u0027t have to chase after every scrap of commission work that comes my way and focus on the comic more! And more time to focus on the comic means more comic to be had!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/063/b/4/patreon_by_slyeagle-d78eonv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eWhat Is A Task, Anyway?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nSo glad you asked (because I totally didn\u0027t ask for you)! What I\u0027m calling a \"relaunch task\" is any one of the million little things between me and the comic relaunch. The following things are the things you would be paying me money to finish and then you would see in your special Patron-only section:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePages.\u003c/strong\u003e The most obvious barrier between me and updating a comic again is having pages to update the comic with. This will be the most common (and hopefully frequent) task.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter Roughs.\u003c/strong\u003e A whole scene (or several small scenes) of script in thumbnail form. It is my dream!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSets.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Because I\u0027m very bad at drawing buildings, I build my sets in Google Sketch-up. Only a fairly elaborate set will count, but I do have a few of those left to go.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Designs.\u003c/strong\u003e My major characters are all designed, but I have some minor characters I need to design. Only talking speaking roles, here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebpage Templates.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m designing the new website, but thankfully, I will not be coding it. I just need to get the images done and pass it on to my code-wiz brothers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Fonts.\u003c/strong\u003e For those of you who don\u0027t recall the Ambition-verse, I had constructed a few languages for it. These languages have their own alphabets and therefore need their own fonts, as well as Romanized fonts for when the characters are speaking in that language and the POV character understands it. I\u0027m also working on a new title font.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/057/4/1/worksinprogress_by_slyeagle-d785xiv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eThank You.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nFor taking the time to read that and consider supporting my efforts to make my dream come true. If you do choose to become my patron, you will get instant access to the new prologue in whatever state it\u0027s in (currently partially drawn and in tone roughs). If you still want to help but can\u0027t make a financial commitment (and even if you do and can!), please spread the word about the Patreon campaign. No matter what, I hope you\u0027ll at least enjoy my comic, whenever it\u0027s ready and whenever you see it!"
