Patreon. When you do one of these videos you\u0027re supposed to introduce yourself and also introduce Patreon. But Patreon has been going for a while now, and I think word has gotten around. But in case you missed it: Patreon is like a recurring tipjar. You set it up to donate to a person or project every month. Whereas Kickstarter is crowd funding for one-time projects, Patreon is crowd funding for people who make content on a regular basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for introducing myself? See, the thing is, if you don\u0027t already know who I am then I\u0027m really uncomfortable with the idea of asking you for money. If you\u0027re interested, then check out my website and the webcomics and the free books. Read my posts where I explain graphics programming and game development. Watch my quasi-educational YouTube videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if that\u0027s not enough content, there\u0027s always the collaborations I\u0027ve done: Video Series, Webcomics, or the weekly podcast. I\u0027ve been at this for eight years, so I\u0027ve made a lot of content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf some of it makes you happy and you become a fan, then maybe think about coming back here and donating to my efforts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you have been following my work, then maybe you\u0027re wondering why I\u0027m suddenly doing a Patreon. Well, it\u0027s actually because I had a fight with Google. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s back up eight years...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know in movies how they sometimes have a crazy foreigner character? Someone who is visiting America from an exotic part of the world and is therefore unaccountably insane? Long Duc Dong from Sixteen Candles. Ben from Short Circuit. Peter Sellers in like half of everything he ever did. Borat from Borat and Crocodile Dundee from... you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been fascinated by this. Writers use it as an easy excuse to put a really crazy character in their movie. Why is this guy so strange? He doesn\u0027t know our foreign American ways. Why do we put up with him? Same reason. Of course, Long Duc Dong wasn\u0027t strange in a particularly Chinese way. People in Australia don\u0027t actually act like Mick Dundee. People from Russia don\u0027t actually act like Yakov Smirnoff. And I really hope you already knew that Borat is not representative of  the people of Kazakhstan. The important thing to note is that it doesn\u0027t matter where they\u0027re from, only that they\u0027re not from around here. The writers aren\u0027t commenting on their culture, they\u0027re commenting on ours by contrasting us with a mad alien.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I wondered what this would look like from the other side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen about eight years ago I went through an anime phase. In the series Ai Yori Yoshi, I found the Japanese version of the crazy foreigner character. Tina Foster is an American expat living in Japan, and she\u0027s basically bonkers. She has this thing where she grabs the breasts of other girls. Now, this is not an American thing to do. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a Japanese thing to do, either. I\u0027ve never been to Japan. The only things I know about Japan I learned from anime, which means as far as I know everyone that isn\u0027t a mech pilot is a Ninja. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut whether it\u0027s really socially acceptable to grab breasts in Japan or not, within the context of the show it\u0027s seen as a kind of prank, like giving someone a wedgie. The show even makes it clear that this is supposed to be comedy. The art shifts into this derpy style to make it clear that this isn\u0027t sexy fan-service, it\u0027s slapstick. Tina is not a lesbian and her goal is usually to get the other person to loosen up and stop taking themselves so seriously. Again, it doesn\u0027t matter if this makes cultural sense or not or if you find it funny or not. The point is that the writers wanted to have an outlandish character, so they made her a crazy foreigner. An American.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was thrilled when I found this example, and I got to see what it was like to have my country as the home of the loony foreigner. So I wrote about it on my blog. It was just a short post talking about Tina Foster and her breast-grabbing prank. Nobody really read it, because back in 2006 the only people who read my blog were my friends, and that was only because they were afraid I\u0027d ask them if they\u0027d read my blog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward eight years. I made a webcomic, started a show, became a videogame journalist, got some sort of nominal internet-fame, left my day job, wrote a couple of books, and jumped into this internet personality racket. The pay sucks but the hours are awesome and the work is basically play. I have nothing to complain about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing, until Google AdSense sent me an ominous message telling me that my website was in violation of their terms of service. I had content that didn\u0027t adhere to proper standards and I needed to fix it in three days or have all ads on my site blocked. The message didn\u0027t say what I\u0027d done wrong or what was objectionable, but they did offer a link to my eight-year-old post about Tina Foster as an example of what I\u0027d done wrong. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I don\u0027t make my entire living running ads on my site or anything, but they do bring in a couple hundred dollars a month and they do represent a non-trivial portion of my income. So I was pretty worried about losing this. Looking at the Tina Foster post, I figured maybe someone had a problem with the images? They were small and the whole point of them was to show how non-sexual the breast-grabbing was, but maybe showing a cartoon hand over a clothed cartoon breast was breaking the spirit of the law if not the letter. Maybe Google had begun outsourcing their content monitoring to Amish people who weren\u0027t used to seeing this kind of thing? It seemed pretty obnoxious to me, but I pulled the images and got over it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree days later Google emailed me again to let me know that because I still had objectionable content on my site, I had been removed from the service. Then I realized that I wasn\u0027t dealing with a person. Someone hadn\u0027t looked at my site and found a problem with it. The google robot probably saw the words \"breast\" and \"lesbian\" and decided the post was adult content based solely on the presence of keywords. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s no way to communicate with Google to let them know their system is broken, and their entire AdSense interface seems to be engineered to limit communication. The post is read by robots, flagged as inappropriate by robots, then I\u0027m given a warning by robots and ultimately banned by robots. You can\u0027t actually communicate with a human until after you reach the appeal stage, and even then you\u0027re only given a little Twitter-sized box to make your case. And it\u0027s clear they don\u0027t want to hear it. The Twitter box isn\u0027t even for arguing with them. It\u0027s where you\u0027re supposed to explain what policy changes you\u0027ve implemented to make sure this sort of offense never happens again. If you use that limited space to tell them their robot is broken you risk having the appeal rejected and having your site banned forever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo a certain extent, I can grudgingly accept this. Yes, it\u0027s outrageous that they treat the words \"breast\" and \"lesbian\" like they\u0027re profane. I have no idea how you\u0027d write about gay marriage or breast cancer, for example. But whatever. I understand Google is selling ad space on websites that are out of their control and I accept that advertisers are really skittish about where their ads appear. I\u0027m sure Dove Soap wouldn\u0027t want their ads appearing on some sleazeball site dedicated to celebrity wardrobe malfunctions and Walt Disney wouldn\u0027t want their stuff appearing on a blog dedicated to Harry Potter / Wizards of Waverly Place slash fiction. They\u0027re paying the money, and I don\u0027t object to them erring on the side of caution. But the problem is actually worse than just having a broken, over-sensitive censor bot with no human oversight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy problem is that the system is incredibly hypocritical. In the past I\u0027ve had to deal with these crass, obnoxious ads from sketchy pay-to-win web games like Evony, Civony, and Call of Roma. These ads appear on my site even though I specifically said that I don\u0027t want adult oriented ads. And technically the product being sold is a completely non-sexual strategy game. But the ads themselves are incredibly suggestive and provocative. I mean, how can my using the words \"breast\" and \"lesbian\" in a non-sexual way be out of line, but \"HAVE A ROMAN ORGY\" over a picture of a half-naked woman be ok? And it\u0027s not like this was just a one-time deal. I\u0027ve banned these guys again and again. They change their URL and suddenly I\u0027ve got ads for Roman Orgies on my site again. The ads are using the exact same image from the same company, and Google doesn\u0027t seem to notice. Google literally banned me from their AdSense service for posting content LESS offensive than stuff THEY put on my site. Repeatedly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd maybe I could tolerate this. Okay, it sucks, but I\u0027m a software engineer and I understand that your technology doesn\u0027t always work the way you want it to. If this was just a case of Google needing to work the bugs out of their system, I wouldn\u0027t be so mad. But it\u0027s pretty clear that Google doesn\u0027t care if the system works or not. The system is broken and unfair and there\u0027s no way to fix it or even let them know it\u0027s not working. Their system can flag any content at any time, and you\u0027re forced to remove it or be banned. They won\u0027t tell you what you did wrong, but you\u0027d better not do it again or you\u0027ll be banned. They won\u0027t tell you how their system appraises content, but you\u0027d better not offend it or you\u0027ll be banned. It\u0027s a system where you can be wrongfully accused and your only recourse is to admit guilt, accept punishment, and THEN make an appeal and hope there\u0027s a human being on the other side who will listen. That\u0027s not just a buggy system. That\u0027s grotesque. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to spend my time haggling with the censor bot or worrying about pissing it off. I don\u0027t want to worry about discussing Batwoman and be afraid to use the word lesbian. I don\u0027t want to comment on Ms. Marvel\u0027s costume and be afraid to use the word \"breasts\". Those are not salacious topics and I shouldn\u0027t have to categorize my website content as adults only for talking about them. I don\u0027t want to worry that the Google Smut police will have a problem with one of the other four thousand posts I\u0027ve written over the last eight years and oblige me to kill more of my content to appease it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not worth the worry and the hassle. So I\u0027m getting rid of it. I\u0027m doing a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know last year Penny Arcade did a Kickstarter to get rid of the ads on their site. A lot of people didn\u0027t like this, and so I\u0027m trying to avoid making similar mistakes for fear of upsetting or offending people. For the record, I\u0027m getting rid of the ads no matter what. They\u0027re gone now, and I\u0027ll take whatever the Patreon gives instead. I don\u0027t want you to feel like I\u0027m holding the site hostage for money or trying to charge for content. The ads are gone, and I plan to keep producing content like I always have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have any stretch goals. I already spend a majority of my creative time making content, so I can\u0027t promise to make more. I don\u0027t have any backers-only content planned, although if I have anything to say about the campaign I might post it in the backers-only section of Patreon. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m making this up as I go along. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway. That\u0027s the plan. Whether you decide to chip in or not, thanks for listening and thanks for reading. \u003cbr\u003e"
