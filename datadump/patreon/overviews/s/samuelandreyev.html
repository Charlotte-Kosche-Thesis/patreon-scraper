    "summary": "I\u2019m a composer. So far,\nI\u2019ve written about 30 works that have been performed, recorded and broadcast throughout\nEurope, North America and Asia. I\u2019m also passionate about communicating the work\nof \u003cstrong\u003emodern and contemporary composers\u003c/strong\u003e to those who would otherwise not encounter\nit. I teach composition and music analysis, and my goal is to take this sort of\ndiscussion out of conservatories and musicology journals, and into a \u003cstrong\u003emuch broader\naudience\u003c/strong\u003e by creating \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube videos\u003c/strong\u003e discussing modern and contemporary music.\nThe videos allow me not just to deliver a lecture, but also to incorporate\nsound, images and diagrams into my presentations, effectively allowing me to\ncreate short films that are a combination of analysis and historical\ndocumentary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am obsessed with communicating\nprecisely what makes a piece of music great, and why we should bother to get to\nknow it. It\u2019s not only a matter of quality, or of beauty; great musical works encompass\nan entire world view. They can embody \u003cstrong\u003ethe highest aspirations of humanity\u003c/strong\u003e\nthrough a medium that is both sensual and abstract. Important works of contemporary\nmusic are tools we can use to experience profound meaning, and to have our\nunderstanding of \u003cstrong\u003ethe ideas and aesthetics of today\u003c/strong\u003e vastly broadened and\nexpanded.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCommunicating and explaining\nthis \u003cstrong\u003eincredibly vital art form\u003c/strong\u003e has become a passion of mine, and I want to\ndevote more of my time to it. The response to my first YouTube video lectures has\nfar exceeded my expectations. This shows me that they are fulfilling a real interest.\nRegular monthly support would allow me to improve their technical quality, and\nto devote an adequate amount of time to them. I would aim to create between one\nand four new videos a month. Thank you for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewww.samuelandreyev.com"
