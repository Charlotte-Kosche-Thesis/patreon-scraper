We just have a little work to do first - that of changing the world (and ourselves) to embrace sensitivity. So where do we start? By finding each other, learning tools to thrive, gaining courage, and learning from each other how to live a sensitive life in a soulful way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYears ago, I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sensitivityuncensored.com/blog\"\u003eblogging\u003c/a\u003e about sensitivity, spirituality, and the tools and skills needed to live in a culture that was designed by and for people who are not highly sensitive.

Part memoir, part manual, the book covers my journey of finding a spiritual path that feeds my soul, how sensitivity affected me growing up and when I how I embraced it, how I learned to trust my intuition (and tools to help others do the same), ancestral healing, love, parenting and the pitfalls along the way. My intention is to create a manuscript that hsps will turn to again and again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThis year, I also started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sensitivityuncensored.com/soulofsensitivity\"\u003eThe Soul of Sensitivity Podcast.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is a place for\u00a0highly sensitive people to hear stories from other sensitive, creative pioneers as well as my own thoughts, teachings and tools. I explore everything from common health issues of the highly sensitive person, to spiritual responsibility and social justice. This is not the beginner\u2019s guide to sensitivity, but rather the place for sensitive souls to gather up their courage and pioneer their way into a life of personal freedom and spiritual sovereignty.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I type this up, I\u0027ve been running the podcast from the office of Sensitivity Uncensored for eight weeks and have received wonderful feedback from listeners.
