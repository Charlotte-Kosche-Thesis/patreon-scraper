It is amazing to design something on my computer and then be able to get it printed and have it in my hands.\u00a0 As an artist I like to do all kinds of things like geek stuff, gamer, cosplay, hacks, fantasy, etc etc, but my main focus would be BJD (ball jointed dolls). I make my own line of tiny BJD, as well as doll accessories and props in a variety of styles and sizes. I also do more then just doll stuff, so if your not into dolls or think they are kinda creepy, no worries, I do all kinds of things\u00a0 such as jewelry, cosplay accessories and props, geeky accessories, and any other fun designs I can think up from phone cases, to steam punk hair combs with moving gears.

     "about": "Part artist and part geek/nerd/musician/singer/actor/LDS/gamer/otaku/...a bunch of things okay? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started drawing in 6th grade and quickly decided I wanted to do something in the field. One of my goals in life was to be creative and that has been almost\u00a0 a mantra to me. It took quite a while to finally get to where I am now. I knew I wanted some thing to do in the art field but also wanted something I could be creative and have fun with. After several different schools I graduated from the Digital Animation and Visual Effects school at universal studios Orlando. Unfortunate for me, my health had taken a turn and I became aware of several health problems during school (fibromyalgia to name one). Finding a job was all but impossible until I remembered something said by my teacher in a casual conversation. 3D printing. Being able to turn your models into real objects you could touch. As I looked into this, I also became a fan of a type of doll called a Ball jointed doll.\u00a0 I wondered if I could make my own dolls and doll accessories as well as just about anything else.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got my first 3D print from shapeways in January 2011, and I was hooked. Soon I started making my own little ball jointed dolls as well as other items. I have been a guest at a couple of BJD conventions, as well as done workshops, lectures, classes on 3D printing, dolls, and various other arts and craft topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a living doing what I love with my skills developed and of course give back to others. I want to teach , create, share, succeed, dream,....etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with the help of patrons, we can do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEileen Bowen\u003cbr\u003eLady Silverbeam\u003cbr\u003e",
