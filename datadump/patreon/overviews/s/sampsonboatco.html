    "summary": "Hi! My name is Leo and I am an English Boatbuilder on a mission to rebuild and relaunch a historic wooden sailing vessel that was built in 1910, called TALLY HO.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, many thanks for showing an interest and dropping by. This project is the biggest thing I have ever undertaken, and it\u0027s both labour-intensive and expensive. I am experienced, hardworking and dedicated, but I will struggle to finish this project without the support of people like yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I considered taking on TALLY HO to save her from being destroyed, I knew the amount of work and expense would be extraordinary. As I thought about ways to tackle it, I developed the idea of documenting the rebuild, and involving volunteers. I hoped this would not only help make the restoration possible, but also turn it into a wider-reaching project that will be of interest and benefit to a range of boatbuilding and sailing enthusiasts, and also introduce others to the craft and the way of life that has bought me so much satisfaction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sampsonboat.co.uk\"\u003ewww.sampsonboat.co.uk\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTo see other ways to support the project, click \u003ca href=\"http://sampsonboat.co.uk/how-to-support-tally-ho/\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sampsonboat.co.uk/how-to-support-tally-ho/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTo see some sneaky pictures of progress on Tally Ho in between videos, follow my \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sampsonboatco\"\u003eFacebook Page\u003c/a\u003e and my \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sampsonboatco/\"\u003eInstagram feed.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee my \u003ca href=\"http://a.co/9lD0PRz\"\u003eAmazon Wishlist\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving moved the boat 600 miles to a site on the Olympic Peninsular, WA, the rebuild is now progressing well. We are still in the deconstruction phase, although I am currently sourcing large amounts of timber to start putting fresh wood back into the boat early in the New Year (2018). I have begun to take on volunteers, and although the documentation does take up a lot of time, it is generating great support around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to restore TALLY HO with as much historical accuracy as possible, whilst maintaining the highest standards of materials and workmanship, so that she will last for at least another 107 years. Eventually I plan to sail the boat back from the Pacific NW to the UK, which will be a journey worth documenting in itself, and race her in the famous Fastnet Race, which she won in 1927.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have been saving money as hard as I can for the last few years, this project promises to be ludicrously expensive. The cost of timber and of bronze fabrications will be the first major hurdles, but I am perfectly willing to return to paid work periodically to top up the funds. Any financial support I receive through Patreon will help me to keep this project flowing and minimise those interruptions, helping to pay for timber, tools and materials, food and expenses, filming equipment, and so on and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want my videos to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their means, so I will not be featuring much \"patron-exclusive\" content. However, credit to individual Patrons will be given in my videos, and I am working on a range of ideas, such as unique gifts, that will show Patrons my appreciation for their help in saving this historic sailing yacht.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sampsonboat.co.uk/\"\u003ewww.sampsonboat.co.uk\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTo see other ways to support the project, click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sampsonboat.co.uk/how-to-support-tally-ho/\"\u003eHERE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTo see some sneaky pictures of progress on Tally Ho in between videos, follow my \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sampsonboatco\"\u003eFacebook Page\u003c/a\u003e and my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sampsonboatco/\"\u003eInstagram feed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSee my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://a.co/9lD0PRz\"\u003eAmazon Wishlist\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0"
