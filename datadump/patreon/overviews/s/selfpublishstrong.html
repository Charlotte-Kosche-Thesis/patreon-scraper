I love writing, I love marketing, and I love teaching. Through my Self-Publish Strong \u003ca href=\"http://selfpublishstrong.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://selfpublishstrongcourses.com/\"\u003ecourses\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2BBp5bw\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://selfpublishstrong.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0027m helping others generate buzz for their books, reach more readers, and grow a devoted following.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you to my fans and patrons for helping me reach that goal!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, a little about the podcast: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first section of the podcast is where I give a shout out to our Patreon supporters, updates on my projects and life, a motivational quote, and tips on marketing/publishing. (Especially marketing. :-)) I\u0027m super passionate about this topic and love teaching it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last segment is dedicated to movies and entertainment. My husband, Nolan, and I are a huge movie buffs. We discuss popular (and some not-so-popular) movies, what they did right, what they did wrong, and we tie everything back to writing and self-publishing. We believe every movie has something to teach about being a good writer. Whether it\u0027s a good lesson or not is the question. ;-) :-) Come join us to discover your favorite movies all over again in our podcast. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Andrea:\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eUSA Today \u003c/em\u003ebestselling author Andrea Pearson has published over two million words under three pen names, including 35+ novels, several non-fiction books, multiple novellas and short stories, and over a hundred articles for professional blogs and websites. She has been interviewed on several podcasts including the \u003cem\u003eScience Fiction and Fantasy Marketing Podcast\u003c/em\u003e, the \u003cem\u003eRocking Self-Publishing\u003c/em\u003e podcast, and the\u003cem\u003e Author Hangout\u003c/em\u003e. She has guest posted on JA Konrath\u2019s A Newbie\u2019s Guide to Publishing blog, and her tips have been mentioned several times on the \u003cem\u003eSell More Books Show\u003c/em\u003e. She was executive director for Indie Author Hub for a year and a half, and she is frequently invited to teach about successful indie publishing at conferences and conventions.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Nolan:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNolan\u0027s fixation with the cartoons he grew up on in the 80\u0027s led him to pursue an art degree from Portland State University. However, through some strange twist of fate, he ended up studying and making a career in molecular biology. Undeterred by these circumstances, he has constantly had several art projects on the side, including creating book covers and illustrating for clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe classes he took in drawing, painting, and printmaking prepared him to make works of art in a diverse array of media. His favorites include pencil, pen, and sculpey, though he spends most of his time producing digital art on Photoshop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen he isn\u0027t creating something new, he enjoys reading, team sports, hiking, and spending time with his wife. They live with their children somewhere in the western half of the United States."
