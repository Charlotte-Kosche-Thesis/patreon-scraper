I am known as Spicy Otaku. I\u0027d like to take a moment to thank you for taking a look at my page. It means a lot to me. I am one person and while I intend to make this game to fruition with or without donations, your donations will go a long way towards aiding me in speeding up this process. I\u0027ve been dabbling about in game development with Unity and Unreal engine in my spare time for a few years now. I have a passion for making games and would love to make it more than just a hobby! With this being my first attempt at a full game, I\u0027ll be starting small with Renpy and see how it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6ZjtqSO.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAssuming Gender\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eIt is a visual novel with different characters and a choice of girls (or guys?) for your own tastes.\u003cbr\u003eSome decisions may seem trivial but they could have lasting repercussions later on.\u003cbr\u003eThe love interests have their own quirks and traits. Their own likes and dislikes. It is for you to try and understand them to achieve a \"happier\" ending with the person of your choosing. Beware though, because some choices may have adverse and unwanted repercussions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eStory\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eYou are a guy sat at home. Every college has slammed their door in your face and it looks like this maybe the end for your education until you\u0027re enlightened by some news.... literally. The Gender-fluid movement. You have no shame or respect for others. Can you use this new movement to your advantage? Will your opinions of the SJW movement change? Will you even be a cis-gendered straight male at the end? How will you deal with the issues that pretending to be gender-fluid individual may present? These are choices I intend to let you make as you progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Please note; While the main character starts off as a jerk, it is my hope that he comes to a more rounded opinion of sexuality for himself and those around him. This is not an attack on the SJW community. As we take this journey, maybe the gamers, such as you and I, may come to better understand individuals of other sexualities too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hwDTfDr.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eFETISHES, PLANNED SEXUAL CONTENT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnal\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLesbian\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVoyeurism\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExhibitionism\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGroup sex (MFF)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCorruption\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGay\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHY PLEDGE?\u003cbr\u003eTime investment:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI work full time hours within 2 jobs but on a flexible contract. I\u0027m actually only contracted to 4 days a week but work all the overtime I can. For every $50 reached, that\u0027s 1 day a month I can stay at home and spend on the game. At $250, that\u0027s a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePicture output:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is the most time consuming. The rendering on PC. I have an under-powered PC for rendering. For high quality images, a good rendering process takes time. I usually do this of a night or while at work but even if I was at home, rendering an image brings progress to a standstill until it is completed. Sometimes I need to render a scene separately to add characters separately as the PC can\u0027t handle both. This doubles the time frame. With enough donations, a second, more powerful unit can be purchased to increase my output.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd Patreon rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, check out the Goals section to see what\u0027s planned for when we reach those milestones!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you can\u0027t pledge, don\u0027t worry! My games are going to be \nfree for the public eventually, of course patrons get to enjoy them \nfirst.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I want to give a HUGE Thank You to everyone who supports the game, it \nfeels really great to see other people like and support my work! \u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
