What is Sour Bags \u0026amp;\nTotes? It\u2019s a small business based in Montreal, QC. I make one of a kind\nhandmade bags from reused and recycled fabrics. Some fabrics are donated and\nsome I purchase secondhand. I started this business on Etsy back in 2007 ( www.sourbagsandtotes.etsy.com ) as a\nside gig but more recently made it my full time job. I really love the freedom\nof making my own schedule and being my own boss but along with those freedoms\ncomes a lot of struggles.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a one-woman show. I photograph everything myself, I sew everything myself\nand I create everything myself but I need your help with something. The\nmoney you pledge would help me to produce more\nbeautiful one of a kind handmade bags and also develop a T-shirt line I\u0027ve been\nwanting to do for the longest time! You can choose from some pretty fun rewards or you can pledge whatever dollar amount you like!\u00a0 You will also receive updates on what I\u0027m making even if you\nonly pledge 1$ a month. Every little bit counts! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKasey, \u003cbr\u003e\nSour Bags \u0026amp; Totes"
