    "summary": "Hey I am Scott Ackerman AKA unrested. I have been making videos from Osaka, Japan for 10 years on youtube. Recently I have decided to take this hobby to a new level in my life and am working to bring my viewers more content via patreon. The more I can garner in donations the more I can take time away from my day job by hiring staff that allow me to focus my full attention on you guys, the most amazing viewers, fans, and subscribers in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what am I working on? Well, a lot. Currently I have started LAL which is a non profit program that seeks to answer life advice question live while streaming on YouTube. Most recently we have branched out into LAL Japan where every 3 months I go through hundreds of applicants to find 8-12 lucky people to coach through a journey to Japan and then train to be teachers or send off to pursue a career or simply a relaxing vacation in Japan. My biggest reward is the smile I see on people\u0027s faces when they arrive at the airport and the excitement they exude upon landing their first job. On top of that my Life Advice Live show leaves me with an incredibly satisfying feeling that I was not able just to see my viewers comments but talk with them 1 on 1.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo so if you need a shoulder to lean on, an ear to listen, or a major change in your life that may or may not include moving to or visiting Japan, I am your man. Contact me on here or any other social network for more details or should you have more questions and thanks for visiting. Stay wonderful you amazing people.\u00a0"

     "description": "COMING TO JAPAN DVD. There is a documentary/instructional video I have wanted to create for a very long time simply called COMING TO JAPAN. In this dvd i plan to film on a cannon mark 4 at 4k and document not only my own journey of how i got to Japan, but interview other foreigners like myself who have made it over here to the big red dot and created a life here. Through the narration and documentation I plan to cover a nearly step by step process anyone can follow to get to and live in Japan or just simply visit. I also will cover a step by step process explaining how you, the viewer, can also get to Japan, get a visa, live here long term and more. If this sounds like something you would be interested in please support the project and the tier associated with it to receive a digital copy when the goal is reached and the project is complete.",

     "description": "JAPAN NEWS NOW is a show I have wanted to start with 3 other long term lifers here in Japan. This is a professional quality news show that will be hosted by myself, Tiger (aka superman in japan on youtube), Mikey, and Sanni. Each one of us will be reporting on and giving a view of Japan from 4 different perspectives. I wil continue my coverage in the way I always have as Unrested. Tiger will be covering a view of Japan from the small but tight knit black community here in Japan as well as working outside of the teaching field, Mikey will cover a Latino perspective, and finally Sanni will be covering living in Japan as a female and information on the LGBTQ community through out different parts of Japan. The money in this project will be split between travel and reporting expenses, setting up a professional news desk, lighting, audio and camera work. Finally, keeping the lights on in our very small studio we wish to build to give you a more diverse look at Japan from multiple perspectives.\u00a0",

     "description": "The Japan Intern, Exchange, and Tour program JIET is a small side project I have been running on the side for three years. It has allowed me to help show around new comers to Japan, help tourist find and schedule multiple visits and destinations without any grasp of the Japanese language and even set up multiple internships at my company and others as well including localization and gaming companies through out the Osaka and Tokyo area. If you see this as goal for future please think about helping to build our foundation to reach more people in this quest to show the world Japan. Currently we can only accept 1 person a year and we end up spending alot out of pocket. If we can get this up and running as a full time gig then we can open up more homestays, internships, and tours to a far larger audience at minimal cost. A break down on how the money would be spent on this goal would be a branching plan of multiple expenditures that I can send out to those serious about participating. For this small box of text an abridged version includes using funds on transportation, hotel reservations, housing, food and dining, translation services, on site pick up for guides and so much more. Please feel free to email me personally at scottmackerman@gmail.com for a hyper detailed breakdown if you want to learn more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
