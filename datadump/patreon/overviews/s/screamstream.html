    "summary": "Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page. Scream Stream is your weekly spoiler-free guide to horror entertainment. Blindly picking a horror movie can be frustrating and time consuming so, let me do the work for you. Each week I review a streaming horror movie, cover industry news, and let you know what the week\u0027s new releases are. So, join me every Monday as I separate the best from the worst of streaming horror so you don\u2019t have to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScream Stream originally ran from March 31st, 2014 through December of 2015 and produced 54 episodes. After that time, I needed to take break from podcasting and focus on new changes in my life. This year I\u0027ve brought it back to life because I just can\u0027t let it go. I hope you enjoy my content and consider becoming a member of the Scream Stream family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is essentially an ongoing virtual tip jar. If you decide to become a patron, you\u0027ll put some cash in jar each month to support the content I produce. So, if I save you from wasting a couple of hours on a terrible movie, you can say, thanks James! Here\u0027s a couple of bucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWill Scream Stream still be free?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, the podcast will always be free and available through many podcast distribution services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can support the show with a dollar or more, you\u0027ll get early access to reviews and access to the patron exclusive feed. You\u0027ll also get the patron exclusive podcast, When the Screaming Stops, which is a weekly behind the scenes look at Scream Stream. Also, as a special bonus, you\u0027ll get access to the original 54 episodes of Scream Stream which will be released weekly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDo I have to give $1?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNope, you can how ever little or more you like. Every little bit will help the show continue to run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hello! I\u2019m James Gass, host and creator of Scream Stream.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a horror fanatic since early childhood. The first horror movie I saw was Creature from the Black Lagoon. I remember they showed it on TV in 3D but you had to get the glasses from 7Eleven. My brother invited his friends over and they were nice enough to bring me a pair so I could watch with them; I must have about 4 at the time. And while I don\u0027t remember much much about that day, I do remember being facinated by the film and the 3D effects. I think the film that really ignited my love for horror, however, was A Nightmare on Elm Street. My parents rented it on Pay Per View, and I snuck downstairs and hid behind my dad\u0027s big recliner so I could watch it unnoticed. I remember telling myself, if it was real, the cameraman would be dead too. And that was how I quickly got over my fear of horror. \u003cbr\u003e",
