That\u2019s primarily the reason why I\u2019m on Patreon, because I need your help to make the next iteration of it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.

You know, like Jackie CHAN.) I am a comics creator, illustrator, and writer. I primarily work in comics, though I\u2019m not limited to only that. As you also already know I created the graphic novel series THE GOD MACHINE, and I\u2019ve worked on FRAGGLE ROCK, MICE TEMPLAR, two of the GRAPHIC CANON books, and various other comics projects. I\u2019ve also done album covers, storyboards, character design for animation, and various other things.

It is here that she concocts her uniquely abstract and elongated art and comics. Intensely interested in the incorporation of psychology into her art, she focuses on the unconscious and human aspects of her characters. In addition to The God Machine, she has worked as a digital painter on the comic series Sullengrey by Ape Entertainment, a colorist on the comic series Mice Templar by Image, and as an illustrator on Jim Henson\u2019s Fraggle Rock by Archaia. She also provided digital paintings for the illustrated prose novel, Conspiracy of the Planet of the Apes, and has illustrated numerous album covers. She has adapted as well as illustrated T.S. Eliot\u0027s The Waste Land for the comics publication The Graphic Canon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
