    "summary": "Hi friends! I\u0027m the author of the gripping manuscript, Yoga for the Zombie Apocalypse-- an enlightening look at surviving the perils of the undead but with the zen and grace of a guru. I\u0027ve written and published a fair amount of short stories, poetry, and essays in my time and edited and produced some newspapers and journals in the school era days as well. So, the kids might say, I like to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not writing, I work with plants and alternative healing modalities through essential oils, herbal medicine crafting, yoga, spiritual wellness, divination and general lifestyle overhaul. I suppose you could say my creativity goes to helping real people craft their own character development. I also work with children in a Steiner school (or Waldorf Education) which I\u0027m learning more about weekly, now.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, I can be considered busy as a mom with two kids (hence working at the school) and a personal business with high aspirations of returning to my creative sphere. And that\u0027s why I\u0027ve turned to Patreon! I treasure the ability for people who believe in my art and artistic merit to be able to support me in creating it as well as just generally show me that what I\u0027m doing is exciting to them. To know that you, my patron saints, believe in me is the magic and love that fuels me through the challenges inherent in following your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect from me? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you haven\u0027t followed me or my work in the past, a good place to get an idea of what I do is through my various online endeavours. I have a few blogs with creative writing (though far more is on papers and disks elsewhere) and try to write daily on at least one or more platforms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCatch my vibes: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blog.sarahmascarah.com\"\u003eblog.sarahmascarah.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/sarahmascarah\"\u003einstagram.com/sarahmascarah\u003c/a\u003e \u0026lt;------ I update regularly\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/sarahmascarah\"\u003etwitter.com/sarahmascarah\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sarahmascarah.wordpress.com\"\u003esarahmascarah.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e \u0026lt;------ blog\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sarahmascarah.tumblr.com\"\u003esarahmascarah.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e \u0026lt;------------ I\u0027m here a lot \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/sarahwomeryoga\"\u003efacebook.com/sarahwomeryoga\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for supporting me!
