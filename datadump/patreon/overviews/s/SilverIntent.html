You can be involved with the growth of this Patreon with a contribution as little a $5 pledge, and still be given access to stuff we will not post elsewhere, like works in progress and discussions. Higher pledges offer bigger benefits, while still having access to previous tiers. Think of it like a ladder: the first step is just as important as the rest. It all leads to the potential reality we are striving for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat is LNC Illustrations?\u003c/h4\u003eI\u2019m a freelance artist trying to get the ground solidly beneath my feet, while doing what I love to do. I like to create art, but it\u2019s really not an easy endeavor. Like custom pin-ups (chosen by Patron votes) of fandom favorites, as well as unique, one-of-a-kind sculptures (including reptile hides, decor, and bowls), and much, much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003ePatreon is a platform similar to Kickstarter in that both provide an easy way for artists to be funded for their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy Did You Join Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003eI want to sculpt, paint, and create. I don\u0027t want my dreams to stay dreams, and I\u2019m finally getting to a place where I can turn my dreams into reality. I plan on doing videos to give a sneak peak into my artistic processes, time lapse videos, tutorials, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFuture Goals?\u003c/h4\u003eI am working to relocate to my own place; so I can work freely on real media projects and have the space to simply exist. With my sights set on this future house, I have a lot of plans. These future plans include the purchase of a kiln, updated wiring, and installation of a fume ventilation system for safety. With Patreon, you will be contributing to my efforts to create content I love to make, without depending on a job in a factory.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
