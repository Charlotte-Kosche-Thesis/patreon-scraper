    "summary": "\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eINTRODUCTION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve come together to create this original animation series called \u003cstrong\u003eLove Sucks\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s themed as a supernatural fantasy drama that will be posted to watch freely on our YouTube channel. The series takes inspiration from shows such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed and Ghost Whisperer etc.\" but based within the same universe and with my own original characters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is about a young man who was cursed with immortality spell and became a vampire, he ends up spending centuries to find a way to break the vampirism curse. In 1883 England a boy \u003cem\u003e(Dennis)\u003c/em\u003e and his brother \u003cem\u003e(Joseph)\u003c/em\u003e was turned into vampires, they had planned to run away as they were in fear of the hunters / slayers that patrol the town. But after Dennis found out about his brothers\u0027 betrayal he had abandoned him, leaving him to try and survive eternity alone against their enemies. Dennis spends centuries moving town to town trying to find a witch strong enough to break the curse that was put on him. By the year 2015 he had found a small town \u003cem\u003e(Wilborne Hallows)\u003c/em\u003e where he had come across a trio of witches said to be the charmed ones\u003cem\u003e (strongest witches of each generation).\u003c/em\u003e But it\u0027s not long before others find out about Dennis\u0027 plan and chaos begins as others try to protect the immortality spell from being lifted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY WE\u0027VE STARTED A PATREON PAGE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been fascinated by vampire stories from an early age with my introduction to the supernatural world being \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\" and it\u0027s spin-off show \"Angel\". My love for the adventure, friendship, and the hidden meanings brought me to want to create my own story and characters. Filmmaking is something I\u0027ve have always wanted to do and until now it was only a hobby but I\u0027ve been working on a project with a cast and we want to bring this project to life. Originally I had planned to self-fund this project but I have come to realize if I want this project to be made at the standard we had imagined\u00a0or at all then it would be near to impossible to do so alone. So far the progression we\u0027ve made as a group towards this project has mainly been the storyboard for each episode. We are happy with how the plot is turning out but the programme we\u0027re using to portrait the series \u003cem\u003e(Moviestorm)\u003c/em\u003e is very limited on animation, graphics and effects, which is why we plan to re-animate the complete series in a higher end 3D animation software\u0027s\u00a0\u003cem\u003e(including: iClone 6-7, Daz 3D Studio, 3DXchange \u0026amp; Maya)\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/teNKCiRhjEU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe equipment and software we need to complete this animation project has become very expensive and I\u0027ve not long ago had to find the money to replace and re-build PC from scratch in order for it to be able to handle the higher end quality animators and software that will have to go into this project. This project is really important to me, it\u0027s not a hobby anymore but more as a passion that I hope one day I could do as a job. Truthfully I would prefer not having to ask for help with funding this project but at the same time it\u0027s really expensive and the time it would take me to save the totally amount would only delay the project further to the point it probably won\u0027t reach completion, So I know I can\u0027t do it alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe greatly appreciate all contributions\u00a0and thanks a lot for just checking our project. This campaign was created by creator Sheeny \u003cem\u003e(Dreadhead Beanie)\u003c/em\u003e and hosted by Thomas Clinch \u003cem\u003e(Marcos Alantino)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this!
