Focusing mostly on what is a Shramanera - sometimes translated as novice monk, but actually a tradition that predates Buddhism. I\u0027m more of an eternal beginner putting the teachings i have accumulated into practice in a creative way - travelling, writing, making poems and photos - introspectively contemplating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got 14 years as a Buddhist monk behind me and I may one day re-ordain but for now i\u0027m surviving out on my own. I\u0027ve been on the road for 8 months and i\u0027m planning to stay in foreign countries keeping distractions to a minimum for years - you can help me in my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not seeking to teach these are my shared experiences as i keep seeking to find the middle way. Engaging the world this way is to engage the wider internet community, facebook comrades, friends from my past days as a monk and hopefully many new friends to come through Youtube and meeting people on the road.\u003cbr\u003e"

It costs me very little money because i do the work myself - so your contribution goes very far. Digital photography is instant satisfaction - and it can be equally good - but i use film because i find it has a beautiful look and the work to process it makes it more valuable. I see the images, and review them over time to remove judgement from the process as much as possible and realise the best artistic potential.",
