Let me tell you a little about who we are and why you should consider supporting us, and all the nice things you can get from us for doing so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192,145,0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192,145,0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(127,96,0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149,179,215);\"\u003eABOUT US\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWe\u0027re \u003ca href=\"http://www.ssp-comics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSleepless Skink Productions\u003c/a\u003e (or just\u00a0SSP). We\u0027re a group of friends that all love making stories, we\u0027ve all banded together in order to try to share our comics with as many people as we can. Right now, we make stories and comics, but in the future we want to make much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think this description is a little vague, its because it is! We have very few rules for putting stories in the site, everyone is fully invited to make as many pages for as many series as they can handle at any one time. This means that we\u0027ve got a great variety of series, ranging for demon infested thrillers, to phantom infested mysteries, pokemon filled adventures, and all the way back. We update nearly daily, with an average of 8 pages every week. So, even if you decide that you cannot support us, you can still check our site, all of the content we create is free. And with a little help from you, we hope to keep it that way! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(127,96,0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(184,204,228);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149,179,215);\"\u003eWHAT YOUR PLEDGES GO TO\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eSo you\u0027re interested in helping us keep this site going? Great! Honestly, there is a surprising amount of hidden costs to keeping up a site up like this. But basically, we\u0027ll be paying our site bills, and then distributing the rest money amongst the team members.\u003cbr\u003eLooking forward a little, there are other mediums that we want to try our hand at, things like games, or animations. However, the software to get these things is often not free. By helping us, you\u0027ll be giving\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ssp-comics.com/artist.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSSP team members\u003c/a\u003e the freedom to try out new and exciting venues for their storytelling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all love making stories, but the truth is that its a time-consuming and difficult process. We want to repay all of the artists for their hard work and dedication to the stories they want to tell, and enable them to continue to tell them in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149,179,215);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOU GET\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eThis, however isn\u0027t a one-way street, if you do decide to help us, we have many, many different rewards for you to enjoy. We tried hard to include as many kind of rewards as possible. Lots of awesome stuff, ranging from getting to know the artists, comic-related social events, getting exclusive previews from things yet to come in our series and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(217,150,148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe may still be working out some sKINKS on the way we are doing things, but thank you for considering supporting us.
