It is SO cool to design something that I like for myself, and then see it used in screenshots and on YouTubers\u0027 channels! I want to make more, do more, bring more designs \u0026amp; mods \u0026amp; worlds \u0026amp; options into the game. I\u0027m a mid-career publishing guy, working at home for many years now. I have a family and a mortgage and car payments. And I hate having to juggle my love for this creativity, on the one hand, with putting bread on the table, on the other. I\u0027m here because, with your support and help, just maybe I can do both!"
