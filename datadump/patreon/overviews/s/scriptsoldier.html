Run by a veteran and writing enthusiast, you can get all of the nitty-gritty details about the military you need right here. How does basic training work? What are the duties a captain would have? What\u0027s it like being exposed to tear gas? All of this is just the beginning, recruits! With thirty to forty posts a week, including both asks and original posts, who knows what\u0027ll be covered next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy tumblr and all of my content will always be free of charge, but if you\u0027re able to give even a dollar a month, your patronage would be profusely appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is ScriptSoldier?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tobias, but on my blog I go by Specialist Kingsley. I\u0027m 25, physically disabled, neurodivergent, and bisexual. We\u0027re currently living off of my disability while my husband goes to school for networking. We drive Uber and Lyft to help make ends meet, but I\u0027m juggling medications and mental illnesses that make it hard for me to get by, and I can\u0027t always pull my weight around the house as much as I\u0027d like to. We also have loads of bills to cover and debt to repay, and while I have medical coverage, my ND husband does not, and he really needs psychiatric help too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReceiving support on patreon would go a long way for us, even if it\u0027s only a few extra dollars a month. If we can reach financial stability, that means I can put 100% of myself into the blog. If I start making enough on patreon, I can even quit doing Uber/Lyft and make ScriptSoldier my full job. I can write ebooks about military tropes, answer even more questions, write even more original content, and even pull in some guest speakers. The sky\u0027s the limit!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut while all of that\u0027s a long way away and I don\u0027t want to assume I\u0027ll even get there, I can promise to keep trucking as long as I can to keep adding worthwhile information to this blog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting me, even if all that means is liking and reblogging my posts. I eternally appreciate it. Running this blog has given me a sense of purpose I haven\u0027t had in a long time, and I genuinely hope to keep it that way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Yours, SPC Kingsley\u003cbr\u003e"
