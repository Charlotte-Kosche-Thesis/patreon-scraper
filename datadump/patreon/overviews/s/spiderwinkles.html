And foodstuffs from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Tracey, a developer, gamer, wandering fool and enthusiastic, \noptimistic adventurer. I\u2019ve been working as a backend java developer for\n the past five years. Before that, I worked in wireless communication, \nspecifically physical layer software radio. My degree was in computer \nand electronic engineering and I am a big fan of fiddling with things \nand finding out how they work. All of which I will be able to do more of with your help - while travelling I hope to explore new place, meet new cultures, try new foods and I will share all of that with you. I\u0027ll also be making things like video games, social apps and the aforementioned mechanical doodahs, which again I\u0027ll share the progress I\u0027m making, thanks to your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI (Dave) am a game designer and writer (currently I work with \u003ca href=\"http://www.greenheartgames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGreenheart Games\u003c/a\u003e on secret project and I write the \u003ca href=\"http://darksidedetective.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDarkside Detective\u003c/a\u003e cases with Isometric Dreams). The thing is that being a game writer isn\u0027t a big-money maker and I want to continue to make these things, and more - I have a complete novel that needs redrafting, and another one underway (both comedy fantasy). I have a tabletop RPG I want to finish up and Tracey and I want to work on video games of our own (some small arcadey games, some board/card/TTRPG fun, the odd social game, a bit of adventure-game fun and some simulation-management games, all going to plan). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny help you can throw our way would be really apprectaed! \u003cbr\u003e"
