    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Sanjana and I am an illustrator from New Zealand. I love making videos that showcase the creation of my watercolour paintings. My passion involves taking you on a cinematic journey through the creation of a new painting, and I love filming the process and showing how each piece unfolds. My goal is to increase the frequency at which I output these videos, and to bring more of my personal ideas for paintings to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started creating art when I was a small child, and my childhood was filled with a lot of pain which is ongoing. Art served and still serves as a solace, and it is a way to bring colourful things into a painful reality. The act of creating things was empowering and allowed me to focus on something positive even when things were crazy around me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn some ways we are the architect of our own reality, and from a young age I learned that art could bring colourful things into a very bleak world. Seeing how colourful ordinary things could be really has gotten me through some tough periods of my life. I make my videos so that I can share with you my happy place, free of anxiety and stress and share with you the sense of solace I get from the act of creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you will be charged on a \"Per creation\" basis. This means that you will be charged every time I release a new video, and I typically create 2 videos per month. You can cancel your pledge at any time.\u00a0My Patreon page uses \u0027Charge Upfront\u0027 so you will be charged as soon as you pledge, then per each new video I release thereafter. More about that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208404313-Why-was-I-charged-immediately-Will-You-Charge-Me-Again-\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a pledge of $1 per video will go a long way in reaching my goals of getting new equipment to improve the quality of my cinematography and to cover the cost of materials. Each video takes a lot of time and energy to produce, and I want to keep doing this to give you the pleasure of watching them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge means the world to me and makes me feel that what I am doing is appreciated, and has a place in the world. Thank you so much for watching my videos :)"
