     "about": "\u003cdiv\u003eBuenos dias, buenas tardes \u0026amp; buen d\u00eda to you all! My name is Spyke O\u0027hanlin and I am a content creator and creative artist looking to entertain people with my ideas and overactive imagination! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA little bit about me before I talk about my work.. First and foremost, I love rising to a challenge, especially when someone tells me I won\u0027t be able to do it. I have overcome a lot of things in my life, both personal and professional and I do not give up easily. I\u0027m a positive, and sociable person who works hard at everything and very rarely quits when something seems impossible. I am a filmmaker at heart, I spent most of my life not knowing what I wanted to do with it and eventually found the magic of the edit room. I\u0027ve experimented in a lot of areas of the artistic world, painting, drawing, sculpting to list but a few but film is the most creative I can be. You have the ability to build entirely new dimensions, new worlds, shape the destinies of characters you\u0027ve created and mould the emotions of your viewers. Film holds something truly magical and I feel so thankful to have found it. So much so that I enrolled, completed and graduated from a BA (hons) degree in \"Film\".\nThe years I spent before finding filmmaking I mostly spent in and around nightclubs, first DJing and then went onto organising events. I\u0027ve spent over 10 years doing events for nightclubs and the past few years I\u0027ve been doing local community events for different groups. I started \"Plymouth Street Basketball\", that turned into a group of over 100 people who meet up multiple times during the week and play ball! I also started and run the largest local Pokemon GO Facebook community in the United Kingdom, housing over 4,000 people from the local area. Pokemon GO Southwest Trainers formally Plymouth Trainers. I still organise events for people of all ages in the area.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNow for the projects I currently do/plan on creating:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFirstly, I have the Machinima I\u0027ve created and still in the process of writing and creating more episodes for... \"The Commonwealth Chronicles\". It\u0027s a Machinima set in the Fallout Universe. It is my take on what I think the Commonwealth of Fallout 4 would be like 100 years after the end of the game. I\u0027ve created my own version of the universe and brand new characters to fit the bill. These characters are brought to life by voice actors from all around our world. Thanks to Reddit I have met some true talents that I very much enjoy working with.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA series I started last year and will continue this year is my \"GoPro Heroes\" series. In the city of Plymouth where I am from, we\u0027re lucky enough to be a city on the sea front. So during summer and sometimes winter depending on how crazy I feel, we don\u0027t have to wonder far to find the sea and jump in. This series follows our adventures in and under the water as we free dive and explore all that Plymouth and the surrounding areas have to offer in the world beneath ours! This series will also be continuing into my travel documentary project that you will read about a little later.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNext I have a project that is purely in the writing stages at the moment and that is the dystopian drama series dubbed \"Britopia\". This series is set in a world created by myself and my fellow writer, Ludo Kellow, in a post-economical disaster that not only affected our country, but the entire world. With a lack of funding this project is a long way off, However, I have written and currently am writing some 1-2 minutes shorts based in the world of Britopia that I plan on shooting during the summer of 2017. There\u0027s some really deep and emotional stuff that if you decide to support me, I\u0027ll give you a little insight into! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNext I have my travel documentary designed around inspiring altruism in my viewers, the Allxplore project. It is my aim to travel to place to place outside of my home country of the United Kingdom and assist the people and places I meet in anyway I can while expecting nothing in return. This is an ongoing project and will take a lot of work and funding to see flourish. However it is something I am very passionate about. I have also created a few documentaries on Tourette\u0027s Syndrome.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA video series named \"Kill Your Friends\" which is a series I make using footage from games I play with my friends. I have a large group of friends and associates who play games together on a very regular basis. Games like, Grand Theft Auto 5, Dead By Daylight, Depth, DayZ, World of Warcraft, Ghost Recon Wildlands, The Division, Star Wars: The Old Republic and more. These videos are made entertaining by the personalities of the people in them! I have some really funny friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA few final thoughts before I leave you to enjoy your day... in regards to the videos I produce, all my work is hosted on YouTube. I\u0027m a big fan of the work they do and what YouTube has become. I mainly started using Patreon as a means to hopefully fund my ideas and projects. The one issue I have as a filmmaker is a lack of funding, partly due to my location and partly due to being someone who has neurological conditions such as Tourette\u0027s Syndrome, ADD \u0026amp; OCD. Finding and keeping regular employment when you have very noticeable tics can be quite difficult. Needless to say, I do not let these conditions hinder me in any way what so ever and try and focus on the positive things that can come from having them. For example, my very overactive imagination. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThank you ever so much for reading this and even more so if you consider supporting me! I hope I can bring something new and entertaining to the table.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
