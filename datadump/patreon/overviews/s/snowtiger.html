    "summary": "We\u0027re working on a CYOA visual novel computer game called \"The Gift of Cthulhu\" set in the dark and chilling world of H.P. Lovecraft. The game features our original writing, original horror music and loads of vintage public domain black and white period photography to bring in an authentic 1920s feel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe game features multiple choices, multiple endings, sandbox and RPG elements. Our heroine, an ambitious and highly competent woman, arrives in Arkham to try and break into a medical career \u2013 after all, while the best hospitals and medical schools may turn their nose up at a top graduate merely because of her sex, a provincial town might want for good hands enough to be willing to put prejudice aside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is compatible with Window, Mac and Linux computers. We have decided to release the first chapter for free, as a demo, and public version can be downloaded here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://thegiftofcthulhu.com\"\u003ehttp://thegiftofcthulhu.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re a team of coders, artists, producers and writers creating visual novels and choose-your-own-adventure text games in our free time. This is our second project. The first one was a text-only game based on the blood-curdling and nerve-wracking sci-fi novel \"Beetle in The Anthill\" by the Strugatsky Brothers. We have developed a taste for creating a sense of foreboding and doom in our readers, and with this second project we pay our dues to that old master of horror who has inspired so many of us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince this is a much bigger project than our previous one, we have chosen to use Patreon and ask for your support. This project requires a lot of time and energy from coders, designers, writers and musicians and we want nothing more than to move forward faster, but alas, we all must spend our days in unrelated toil, for even the most dedicated cultist must have enough filthy lucre for appropriate sacrifices to the Elder Gods. Enough support, however, would let us turn this project into our job. Then we will dedicate our days and nights to weaving spells to bring this tale out from the abyss of ideas and into the light of true embodied manifestation as quickly as our dark rituals will allow us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are ever so grateful for your support \u2013 and we hope to see you in Arkham, somewhere between its glistening hotels and its morbid destitute outskirts. There are, after all, so many secrets to discover...\u003cbr\u003e"
