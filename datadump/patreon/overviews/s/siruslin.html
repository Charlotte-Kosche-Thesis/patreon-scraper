I am producing travel videos about my daily life everyday, if you enjoy the videos i produce,\u00a0now\u0027s your chance to get involved and support me so I can produce more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge at least $1 per video, you\u0027ll become an official Walking boots, and I\u0027ll include your name in the credits of my videos. Once you pledge, you are under no obligation to continue support, and you can cancel your subscription at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow payment works: If you sign up, you will be billed once monthly. Since the amount you pledge is \u003cstrong\u003eper video\u003c/strong\u003e, the total monthly bill will vary depending on how many videos I produce in a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEx: if you pledge $1 per video and I produce three videos in a month, you\u0027ll be billed $3 at the end of the month. (You can also put a max cap on the amount billed to ensure that you are never surprised by the charges.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you decide not to pledge to Sirus Lin, I\u0027m just so happy and content you\u0027re here, and I hope you continue to watch my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Am I Using Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3 Main Reasons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWith your support I would like to be able to show you more awesomeness, I have so many ideas and adventures I would like to bring you along, but don\u0027t have time or money for them all. With your support I will be able to spend more time making even better videos, I will be able to plan bigger projects \u0026amp; adventures, as well as replace broken gear. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMany of you guys have asked if there was a way to support me and be more involved. As an option for some of my biggest fans Patreon lets me show you guys a little bit more on a personal level, more behind the scenes, as well as keep you connected. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube protection\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. Lately YouTube has been doing some strange things such as failing to notify people \u0026amp; unsubscribing fans without their knowledge. There is no creator support or way to contact YouTube if there is a problem. Patreon allows me to have an exclusive platform to stay in contact with my greatest fans like you. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Much Should I Support?\u003c/h3\u003eYou decide how much you want to support, as low as $1 a month. It is setup up as a monthly subscription and you will receive exclusive perks based on your choice of commitment. You can easily cancel at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan I Still Watch Your Videos Free?\u003c/h3\u003eYes, all the videos I put up on YouTube will always be free, in fact Patreon will allow me to improve the quality, consistency and variety of adventures I upload to YouTube. Please do not feel obligated to pay, this is only for people who want to support and receive the bonus rewards I offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan I Stop My Subscription?\u003c/h3\u003eYes, if you decide it\u0027s not for you anymore, or money is tight, please feel more than free to opt out. You can always come back later if you want. Or don\u0027t if you don\u0027t. I promise I will still like you just as much as I already do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Do You Make Videos?\u003c/h3\u003eI am making these videos because I love to share my adventures(Travelling around the world) and teach people things that I learn. I am told by my subscribers that I put a smile on their face everyday and I want to continue making people happy. The subscription will help continue my passion towards my videos and adventures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, my fellow friends\u003cbr\u003e-Sirus Lin"
