It is truly therapy for me.\u003cbr\u003eMy passion for woodworking really came by accident. I turned our breakfast room into a mudroom outfitted with coat hooks, benches and shoes cubbies\n which really got me hooked. My oldest son was young at the time and \nwatching him mock me with a hammer and a screwdriver got me thinking \nabout what kind of example I was setting for him. It was then that I \ndecided to build the shop that serves as Stone and Sons Workshop today.",
