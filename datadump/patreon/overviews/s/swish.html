Essentially we want to be able to dedicate more time to our productions without pressures such as having a student wallet, having to work in what could be Swish dedicated time and costs for us now to get together and create. We hope you check out our channel to see what we\u0027ve done already and leave us a comment to let us know you came from here! Already we have amassed a committed following of people who we love to interact with, and we do so on a daily basis! Because of this we can\u0027t wait to grow, make more friends across the globe and share all we have with people. To those with us at the moment, new or from way back at the beginning, we honestly love you. There\u0027s never a day where we aren\u0027t excited by a new message, a new face interacting with our content and this leads to many a content grin at each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt would be appreciated from the bottom of our wallets if you can pledge any amount and we hope you can see your difference in our content, now and in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch Love,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSwish boyz - Gabriel Michael \u0026amp; Mattie McDonagh"
