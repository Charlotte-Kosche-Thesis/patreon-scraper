    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings, Patrons! Thank you for checking out my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support allows me to work more frequently with models, and to spend more time with them and pay them better. Your support allows me to grow creatively and to collaborate better with my fellow artists on the other side of the camera. Your support helps celebrate the diversity of human sensuality through creative photography! In return, you get unprecedented access to my creative process, including behind the scenes stories and photos, and deep sets of never-before-seen images from dozens of photo shoots!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackground\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a photographer all my life, but really got my start the summer after my freshman year of college, when I worked for the summer at Grand Canyon National Park. My grandfather gave me his old Pentax K-1000, and I began learning about light and composition in one of the best natural laboratories in the world. Photographing people came later, when I discovered the creative and rewarding challenge of capturing personality and telling stories through pictures. I figure that I crossed over from amateur to professional when I became more interested in communicating ideas than just capturing moments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVision\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that there is strength and beauty in diversity. I believe that we share a common humanity that is expressed in a thousand different ways, among all genders, fraces, ages, body types, sexual identities, and lifestyles. I believe that human sensuality is something to be celebrated in all of its forms, not stifled and proscribed and put into boxes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that it is my mission as a photographer to convey the humanity of everyone I photograph, to reveal the soul that shines through, in spite of the layers and barriers we carefully build to hide it from one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is for this reason that I shoot figure nudes, often in natural light, and often in natural settings. The human body in its natural state, stripped of cultural artifacts, is one of the truest mediums available to convey our common humanity. Our bodies express our most unique and personal identity. They simultaneously reveal our vulnerability and inner strength.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is also for this reason that I work with diverse models of all ages, races, and body types. My work is built on a profound respect for the unique experience and perspective of my models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, where does Patreon fit into this artistic journey? I invest in my work because it\u0027s a creative passion. But there is so much more I could do with financial support to offset the cost of camera equipment and model fees.\u00a0Every dollar you contribute will be reinvested in this creative journey. Much of it will be\u00a0passed on to support other artists who make their living through creative expression. We appreciate your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy public website, including free portfolio images from most of my photoshoots, is \u003ca href=\"http://sensualight.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSensuaLight.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. You\u0027ll also find me on Instagram\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/sensualight\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e@SensuaLight\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Check out my work! Only a tiny percentage of my photos ever make it to the public page. As a patron, you\u0027ll gain access to my vast, password-protected archive of edited photos, behind the scenes shots, raw files, and work in progress.\u003cbr\u003e"
