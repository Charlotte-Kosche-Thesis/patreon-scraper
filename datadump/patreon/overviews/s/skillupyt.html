I also make\nYouTube videos about them aiming to cast a light on why games are a legitimate\nart-form in their own right. I love this industry a great deal, and YouTube is\nan incredible chance to share that love with other people. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I have a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs of Jan 5th, 2018, I am now full time on YouTube since I\nquit my job. I am now all in on this, and that\u0027s a little scary... \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those that don\u2019t know, due to some changes to YouTube\u2019s\nmonetisation policies it\u2019s now a lot harder to reliably make money on youtube.\nThe biggest issue is that guidelines around what sort of videos can and cannot\nhave ads at the front of them have become a lot more strict. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI had a chat with my youtube\npartner manager who informed me that using certain words like \u2018kill-streak\u2019 on\nyour title can now demonetise your video, and obviously depictions of war and\nviolence will often see your video flagged and demonetised. Worst of all, one\nvideo could be totally fine and the next one unexpectedly flagged for\ndemonetisation, because the filter tool might have happened to have caught one\nspecific frame of action that it deemed to be gratuitous violence. And after\nthat your video really isn\u2019t going to be making any money at all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIs it really that bad?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI think the real moment of awaking for me was earlier this\nweek when I uploaded a video about Warframe. It was a highly scripted, highly\nedited 10 minute thought piece on questing on videogames, and it was\ndemonetised for reasons that I\u2019ll never fully know. But I\u2019ll guess it\u2019s because\nit contains violent scenes from The Last of Us and Warframe. Clearly, being\nreliant on a system as silly as this was not a way to build a financial future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI know what I\u0027m about now,\nand ready to do more of that\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis last year, I\u0027ve transitioned away from being a guy that\ncovered only one game, to someone covering ALL THE GAMES, with a strong focus\non reviews, analysis and commentary. I\u2019m proud of the content I put\nout on youtube because I put a lot of work into it, and I think it shows. I\nwant to continue to put out high-quality content to elevate the way that we all\ntalk and think about videogames.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat rewards will I offer to Patrons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe only reward I\u2019ll offer at this point is\nat the $5 tier, where I\u2019ll be making specially, professionally designed versions\nof my scripts available to people. I put a lot of work into writing them, and\nthe graphic designer I work with does a great job of bringing that work to life\nin the printed form. Anyone at the $5 tier and above will get access to these scripts\nas a \u2018thank you\u2019 for the support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll be doing YouTube\nforever, because I love it\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAny donation you choose to make is of course appreciated, but\nregardless of how the Patreon goes, I\u2019ll still be doing what I\u2019m doing right now.\nThe truth is, I\u2019d still keep doing youtube if it didn\u2019t pay me a dime because I\nlove videogames, and I love sharing my passion for video games with other\npeople. The point of the patreon is to get to the point where I can do more of\nthis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway that\u2019s me. I\u2019ll soon hit 300k subs and it\u2019s been an\nincredible journey to this point. So thank you everyone for your support.\nWhether you donate to the patreon or sub to my youtube channel or just casually\nwatch my videos from time to time, I want to say thank you helping me do what I\ndo. It really does mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
