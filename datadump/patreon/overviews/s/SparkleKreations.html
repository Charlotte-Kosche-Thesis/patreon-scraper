     "about": "Hello! Our names are Sparkle \u0026amp; Dazzle, and we run Sparkle Kreations!\u003cbr\u003eThis company was originally \u0027kreated\u0027 in 2007, when Sparkle started to delve into a world of costume-making. He had made many costumes before, but this was an epic moment of realization as he started his first \u0027Fursuit\u0027 or Animal Costume. After working hard on costumes as a side-hobby for a few years, he left his job at fast food and focused all of his time and energy into the small business in 2011. In 2016, Dazzle started learning from Sparkle, just to help out, and soon joined the company officially as a full-time team member. Since then, it has been both of our goals to make every customer, every person, smile and laugh at the sight of the costumes; whether they are purchasing an item from us or simply watching us pass them at a convention or event.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have more \u0027Kreations\u0027 not posted here!\u003cbr\u003eTo see our full gallery, please visit:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sparklekreations/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/sparklekreations/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we should reach or exceed all of our company\u0027s goals, we want to take the excess and donate to local \u0027Furry\u0027 conventions so that they may too, grow and improve, and extend our wonderfully fun community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCONTEST INFO:\u003cbr\u003eWe like to hold a contest occasionally, and often the prizes come out of our own pockets, in terms of time and money. We hope to hold another contest soon, and will announce it on our Twitter, FA, and Facebook when it starts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave an Idea or wanted to share something with us?
