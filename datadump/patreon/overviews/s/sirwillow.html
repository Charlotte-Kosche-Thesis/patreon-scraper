    "summary": "A behind the scenes look at what a former worker at Disney World, Silver Dollar City, and Busch Gardens Florida experienced in his time working at the parks.  From driving large safari trucks around live wild animals while cracking one silly joke after another, to spending 5 years as a photopass photographer at Walt Disney World and seeing and experiencing all sorts of things, to being a conductor and train robber on the famous Frisco Silver Dollar Line at Silver Dollar City.  With 10 years of working in the parks, there\u0027s lots of stories to tell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI release a new \"Confessions of a Theme Park Worker\" video every Thursday telling stories and thoughts about when I worked at the parks.\u00a0 It may be encounters with guests, it may be about how parks operated, how we did things, different events that happened, or a ton of other things.\u00a0 Additionally, I also release a \"Sir Willow\u0027s Park Tales\" episode every week or two talking about my visits to parks, favorites, reviews and fun moments.\u00a0 My typical overall releases total between 7-9 videos a month approximately.\u00a0 This doesn\u0027t include live chats, special bonus videos and other extras (which I don\u0027t charge my patrons for!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I have it set up to charge per video, you don\u0027t have to support that way if you don\u0027t want to.\u00a0 You can set a \"monthly maximum\" for your pledge at whatever level you would like, and reach that with one video or with a few, however you would like.\u00a0 Just look for those options when setting up your pledge.\u00a0 That way you can pledge and support for whatever level you are comfortable with and would like to do.\u00a0 I am very grateful for all levels of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m constantly working to expand my repertoire and have added a green screen and better equipment to allow me more flexibility and variety.\u00a0 I\u0027ve also been able to branch out a bit with my \"Park Tales\" videos allowing me to shoot at parks, doing vlogs of visits and a variety of other things.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "The ultimate goal- to be able to visit Disney\u0027s parks at least once a year, maybe more, and be able to produce more videos from Disney.\u00a0 This level of sponsorship would allow me to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\n sponsorship grows, I\u0027m also able to cut back other \"work\" and spend \nmore time on the channel.  That means the more sponsors I have, the more\n time I can afford to spend producing videos, and the more videos that \nyou\u0027ll get to see.  Not only will it allow me to do more of the videos \non my long list of topics to do, but more videos on questions that \npeople ask and new locations and people as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you so \nvery much for your support and helping my channel grow!  I\u0027m humbled and\n very appreciative of you and your support.",
