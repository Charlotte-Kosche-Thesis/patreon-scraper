    "summary": "|||==UPDATE==|||\u003cbr\u003eAs you probably already know, I am re-vamping this page in an effort to help cover expenses after my recent injury. On December 4th I shattered my arm in a fall. I had to undergo a 7 hour major reconstructive surgery and now have a BUNCH of metal in my arm. On my second day in the hospital, I was let go from my job (hilariously I was working for a healthcare company at the time) and if it weren\u0027t for the fact that I\u0027m still young enough to be covered by my parents\u0027 insurance, I would have lost coverage immediately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m looking at physical therapy for the better part of this year, if not all of it, and come April I will no longer be covered by my mother\u0027s insurance. Being let go kind of sabotaged me, job wise. My specialty is tech support, which requires a lot of typing, which typically requires two hands. I can\u0027t downgrade to a manual labor job either because, yanno, you need two arms to lift things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now for the sappy woe-is-me part. I can\u0027t perform. I can\u0027t dance or spin fire without feeling incredibly silly, or straight up hurting myself. I don\u0027t have any gigs set up, which aside from being depressing to my creative self, if a pretty big blow to my finances. So, here we are. I\u0027m focusing more on modeling at the moment because it\u0027s pretty much the only creative outlet I have. If you\u0027re here, thank you so much for your time and support. I seriously don\u0027t know how I would have gotten through the last two months without the amazing inflow of love I\u0027ve received across communities, as well as the hands-on help from my friends and family. Thank you again. \u0026lt;3 -Saborg/RoboSabe\u003cbr\u003e-----------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eWell, here it is, internet. Thanks for stopping by. I\u0027m Sabor Insanity and I create a wide range of alternative/deranged art that I plan on keeping this page stock full of. From weird and creepy stage performances to alternative/fetish modeling and neo burlesque.. This is where you can stay updated on most everything I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started on this train of chaos when I left my small town and moved to Austin Texas. With 10 years of classical dance training under my belt I was plucked from an EDM club\u0027s dance floor and thrown onto the stage at Texas Industrial Fest. From there I became a core performer at San Antonio\u0027s annual Temple Of Flesh fetish ball, a grinder girl for the band Bind.Torture.Kill\u0027s live shows, a stage dominatrix for Bozo Porno Circus, and eventually a core member of Austin\u0027s very own Frisky Business Burlesque. Scattered between all of those things were dozens of other projects that I either produced or performed in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring those adventures, I met the handful of people that pushed me to start modeling. It\u0027s been a very satisfying and very therapeutic form of expression and definitely something I want to continue. I\u0027ve been trying to book shoots as often as I can on my days off from my day job, but between performing and recovering from the inevitable desire to eviscerate my coworkers, it\u0027s been a slow moving process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also trying to start creating videos again. Before stage performing, video editing was my big passion. I love making weird and horror-esque art films to my favorite music. I actually even went to college for it...for a year. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut anywho. That\u0027s the gist. I\u0027m a giant dork with a demonic aesthetic and a taste for all things dark (and fried). Why am I on Patreon? Consider it like a full access peek into my projects. A view into the \"behind the scenes\" of the oh-so-goth Sabor Insanity. You\u0027ll get to see what I\u0027m working on first hand before anyone else even knows what I\u0027m up to, and also probably a few image-shattering selfies of the life I lead off stage and off camera (lots of cats, lots of food, lots of fox ears). It will also help me evaluate my own work, see what it is my watchers enjoy, hear suggestions and garner support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thanks for stopping by. It means a lot, and I hope you stick around. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The only performance that makes it, that makes it all the way, is the one that achieves madness.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Sabe\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
