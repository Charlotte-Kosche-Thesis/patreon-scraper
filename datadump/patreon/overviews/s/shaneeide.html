There you will find fiction, our journal called \u003cem\u003eThe Burning Block\u003c/em\u003e, which I edit as well, along with our blog, which is updated frequently.\u003cbr\u003eI write novels, novellas, short stories, vignettes, poetry, essays, aphorisms and fragments which sometimes defy genre.\u003cbr\u003eOne could say that my fiction, ultimately, is comical or satirical, with touches of the surreal, the absurd and the fantastic. I\u0027ve published one book of short stories in digital form called \u003cem\u003eArtists go to Hell\u003c/em\u003e. The blog at Emergent Hermit is where one will find my essays and other writings, as well as featured items from \u003cem\u003eThe Burning Block\u003c/em\u003e. In these writings, I deal with philosophy, metapolitics, religion and spirituality, culture and social commentary.\u003cbr\u003eAs most of my work is currently digital, your help is greatly appreciated as it will further my endeavors to put my work in print. Also, in the future, I plan to start a podcast with my wife, Kathryn, an artist, but we lack the necessary equipment.\u003cbr\u003eEvery contribution will go toward augmenting these projects to their full potential and the creation of new projects, as well as freeing up more time to continue and enrich these projects. It will also help me pay some bills and provide for my growing family. I offer my heartfelt thanks for taking the time to experience and enjoy what I have to offer and for any generous gift you\u0027re willing to contribute.\u003cbr\u003e"
