I\u0027ll find games and determine whether they\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003egood or not. \u003c/strong\u003eMy philosophy is that \u003cstrong\u003eevery bad game has it\u0027s moments, and every great game has it\u0027s flaws. \u003c/strong\u003eI try to shine as best of a light I can on games, while still showing flaws that may or may not inconvenience the player.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust Give Me A Minute \u003c/strong\u003eis a show where I play the role of a door to door salesman!
