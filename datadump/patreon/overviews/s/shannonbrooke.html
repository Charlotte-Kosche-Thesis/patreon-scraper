    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! I\u0027m Shannon Brooke, a freelance photographer\u003c/strong\u003e specializing in powerful and empowering portraits of women.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been absolutely addicted to photography since I was a silly little 18-year-old girl (1999), stuck in a darkroom for hours and hours like a vampire.\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 I learned to shoot on 35mm film, and then 4x5 large format film.\u00a0 I didn\u0027t start shooting digital until 2005, which gave me a 6 year brutal film boot camp. And I loved it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy super power is seeing the beauty in every single person I meet.\u00a0 Using photography as my medium, I can combine my two favorite things in this world...lighting \u0026amp; making people feel strong and confident. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/244970500\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrently, I am working on expanding my team so I can shoot more often for my own personal projects.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Now that I have been shooting for 18 years, it\u0027s time to hire full time assistants and extra camera operators to capture behind the scenes.\u00a0 (I want my followers to see my process!)\u00a0 I need help to keep creating imagery that makes me feel alive, and share with you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank all my followers and fans enough for all their support throughout the years...\u003cstrong\u003eI would not be here living life as a full time photographer without you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 As I thought about my following and fans, I asked myself, \"What would they want to see from me that I have not shown?\" This was a scary answer, because I knew it meant that I would have to show you guys WHO I AM!\u00a0 If you haven\u0027t worked with me, you probably know nothing about my personality and/or how I work.\u00a0 I have been very much behind the camera all this time...I am not shy, but I would say that I have focused on showing my work rather than showing anything personally about me.\u00a0 Which was intentional, but I think it\u0027s time to show you guys a little more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am hoping that this page will help me raise the funds I need to create bigger and better things for my business.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eI am hoping to start this page out with behind the scenes videos, outtakes from my monthly photo shoots, and eventually, I want to add educational videos and live chats.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a Patreon bonus, I will be offering special releases to my Patrons first, before they are released to the public.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 For example, I have a stack of my new book, Vroom!, signed by cover girl Gia Genevieve.\u00a0 There are only 13 copies, and they are all signed and numbered by myself as well.\u00a0 This will be released here, to my number one dedicated fans, first!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also receive discounts and little surprises here and there.\u00a0 I love personalized mail, and I will be treating you to little goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eENJOY, and THANK YOU ALL!\u003cbr\u003e"
