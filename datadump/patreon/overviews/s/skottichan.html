    "summary": "While I\u0027ve gone to college twice and walked away with two separate Master\u0027s as well as a Bachelor\u0027s of Arts, I\u0027ve come to discover that\u00a0well-paying jobs for people with my skill set are shockingly few and far between. Rather than give up on my dreams of doing art for a living, though, I\u0027ve done my best to survive as a self-employed artist for the past few years. Recently, though, I\u0027ve become aware of a rather unfortunate catch-22 when it comes to attempting to make money off original content:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you sit at your computer all day working to create a universe that you can hopefully monetize at some point in the future, you have no money to live off of.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you sit at your computer all day doing work for others so you have money to live off of, you end up so burnt out that you don\u0027t want to spend your free time creating a universe of your own.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nI have ideas for fan comics. I have ideas for original comics. I have ideas for print series, and wall scrolls, and keychains, and even a few for assorted wearables. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have the time to sit down and flesh ANY of them out into something commercially viable because I\u0027m stuck bouncing from project to project to project to project to make sure that I have a roof over my head and food on the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want your help to change that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, I\u0027m going to focus everything my generous patrons are willing to give me on ensuring that I won\u0027t be caught flat-footed by a hardware failure in my aging primary work machine. After that? I plan to restructure my Goals, and use any and all funds raised to chip away at my living expenses. The less I have to rely on corporate work to survive, the more time I can spend bringing my myriad ideas to life... and to your computers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI mean seriously, would you rather me spend five hours arranging required safety labels on a doll box? Or creating stuff like this?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/224/c/3/anya_maximoff_by_lexikimble-d7uy3yj.png\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can find many more samples of my work here:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lexikimble.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mutantlexi.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/pictures/user/skottichan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHentai Foundry\u003c/a\u003e (NSFW)"
