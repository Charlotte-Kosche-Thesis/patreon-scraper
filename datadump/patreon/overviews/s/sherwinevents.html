     "description": "So every year for my Prom edition of \u003cem\u003eQueer Slowdance\u003c/em\u003e, I like to provide a free photobooth for participants! I like to have a snazzy backdrop with a cheesy landscape. But it\u0027s costly. I get the backdrop printed and I pay my photographer and rent the lights. But at $25 a month, I will be able to provide the photobooth stress-free for the foreseeable future!\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "Years ago I made the ironic product \u003cem\u003eThe E-Z Purr: The Virtual Cat! \u003c/em\u003eAn album with over an hour of cats purring. I even put it online, on iTunes and Spotify. Anyway, over the years its made me about $50 every six months or so, which I then donate to local no-kill cat shelters and fostering programs. But one thing that would be amazing to do with the album is to get it on vinyl. If I am ever fortunate enough to get up to $330 dollars a month, this is something I want to get done. A vinyl record with cats purring? How ridiculous! But how awesome!\u003cbr\u003e",
