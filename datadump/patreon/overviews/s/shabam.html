    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cWho are you guys and what are you doing?\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, we\u2019re Shabam! We\u2019re a bunch of filmmakers, educators, and producers who have teamed up to create a new type of educational science show that blends fictional stories with real science. We created this show because we all share a love of science and a frustration at the growing volume of \u201cunscience\u201d entertainment that is out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you, like us, watch movies and wonder, \u201ccould that really happen?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the real story behind that?\u201d or \u201cyou can\u0027t taser a zombie!\u201d then our show is meant for you. Each season we\u2019ll create a different original story as a backdrop for a variety of science topics. And through the magic of sound design (a film term for explosions and mood music), learning stuff feels like watching movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cThat\u2019s very generic, give us an example\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn season one it\u2019s the Zombie Apocalypse. Three kids get separated from their parents and over the course of 10 episodes we follow their quest to reunite with their families. While they\u2019re struggling to survive we\u2019ll delve into topics like whether a zombie apocalypse is even possible, why we don\u0027t get sick all the time, and what it\u2019s like to live without water? We\u2019ll also go back in time and find out who the real John Snow was (no he did not carry a sword). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re going to use humor and music...I\u2019m not sure that works with science\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of people have asked us: will you add silly songs and jokes to your show while still maintaining a robust educational program? The answer is of course: yes. We do research and talk to experts who know stuff, like infectious disease detectives who know about viruses or neuroscientists who know about brains. However, we don\u2019t use the phrase \u201crobust educational program\u201d because it makes it harder to come up with silly songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between your podcast and the million other science podcasts out there?\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the total awesomeness that we jam pack into every episode and the fact that we hate commercials, our biggest difference is repeatability. Just like we enjoy watching a good movie multiple times, our goal is to do the same with audio. So while technically it\u2019s a podcast where we produce episodes and publish them on an ongoing basis, our episodes are grouped into seasons which are designed to be complete stories that can be listened to multiple times. To that end we\u2019ve specifically tailored the science content to have a longer shelf life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cWhy do you need our support?\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously the goal is to make the show sustainable because right now we are all donating our time and money in order to write scripts and make sound effects with our mouths. More importantly though, awesome science is being done by scientists all around the world and it costs money to go and talk to them. We also prefer to pay actors who turn what we write into dialogue that sounds real. There are a lot of people who donate their time and energy to make this show as good as it can be and wherever possible we\u2019d like to reward them for that. And finally, if you feel the need for educational content that\u2019s entertaining and you\u2019re the person who secretly fumes when movies get the science wrong, please support us!\u003cbr\u003e"
