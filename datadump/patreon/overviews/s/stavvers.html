    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHello everybody. You probably know me from my twitter (@\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/stavvers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estavvers\u003c/a\u003e) or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://stavvers.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e. Or indeed, both of those things. Anyway, you likely clicked here because you enjoy my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting and opining is a form of affective labour, which up until now I\u0027ve been doing for free. I\u0027ll probably continue doing it for free, because, bluntly put, I\u0027ve burned a lot of bridges. The paid outlets aren\u0027t interested in me because I criticised them and their business model of throwing marginalised women under the bus, or criticising their petulant problematic faves. I\u0027ve also pissed off a lot of other outlets by having the gall to ask for money (a bit of me is wondering if it would be worthwhile spilling the beans to people who give me money on here). So, it looks like I\u0027m independent, and it\u0027s going to stay that way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile that\u0027s all very well and good for my own principles, it doesn\u0027t exactly pay the bills. I work part time at a day job, and that \u003cem\u003ejust about \u003c/em\u003eleaves me breaking even each month if I don\u0027t do things like go out and see other people (and then be inspired to write things complaining about them), go out and see films (and then be inspired to write things complaining about them), attend events and plays, read books\u00a0(and then be inspired to write things complaining about them). It would also probably help my health no end: I am epileptic, and more than three days a week in an office has caused an uptick in my seizures. I\u0027m hoping that by switching my working habits to something more at-home based will reverse this trend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I\u0027m asking you to consider sponsoring me a little bit of money each month. I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027ll give patrons anything special, but I\u0027ll try to give you first access to any non-time-sensitive stuff I write, and perhaps if I can get my head together and stop worrying about money, you\u0027ll be the first to see my forays into fiction writing (right now, real-world pressures are a little bit much for enabling me to even think about that).\u00a0So, if you can bung me a fiver each month, I\u0027d be eternally grateful, because you\u0027d be giving me the means to \u003cem\u003elive \u003c/em\u003erather than just surviving \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven the lowest pledge is greatly appreciated. I won\u0027t think you\u0027re cheap for giving what you can afford--I\u0027ll be proud. I mean it; $1 a month makes a huge difference to me. It\u0027s some chocolate or a fizzy drink I wouldn\u0027t have had otherwise, but more importantly, it means I know you\u0027re following me and I know you\u0027re interested. Thank you xxxxx"
