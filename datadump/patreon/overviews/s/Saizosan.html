You play the role of Trina, a thief now caught in an inescapable web of events in consequence to her theft of something that should never have been disturbed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eCurrent public version Alpha 1.04 (Act 4)\u003cbr\u003eDownload\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!U1oEjLSI!p2bGMouKfuHjJX-cyFHwInGmWBnbRDQ2-H6lWpR8Hys\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Author:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy real name\u0027s off-limits not because you shouldn\u0027t know it but because I go by my moniker more often (that, and I almost forgot my real name. to the point I have to type it down under my facebook profile name to remind myself, LOL) But you guys can call me Takahashi Saizo, or Saizo-san for short.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a 21-year old illustrator by choice and web designer by trade though I really hate web design and I rue the day I chose this course. I mostly stick to my desk, either playing Skyrim with 140 mods or watching Game of Thrones and listening to grand concertos on two different video outputs. I love the color Apple Green and am currently married to my desktop, having a love affair with my Wacom, and dating my laptop all at the same time (pls don\u0027t tell them). I also hate vegetables and am an avid meat lover. Sorry to all vegans out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough trained in web design, my true passion lies in creating stories for my characters and I\u0027m a self-trained illustrator. However, the scenes I drew for this game are meant to be simplified in order to match the in-game graphics and artstyle, and I apologise if anyone thinks I\u0027m cheating them by not presenting my usual quality. This is actually for two reasons; 1. Consistently drawing at my usual quality would mean I would take AGES to draw even 1 scene, which I deem unwise. 2. it would mess up the consistency of the in-game aesthetics and throw my schedule off-point, and I\u0027m still studying btw so I honestly can\u0027t spend too much time fine-tuning the illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the game\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe story of Zealot: Genesis is based on a manga I made in collaboration with my best friend 3 years ago. Although the manga only lasted some 40-odd pages, the narrative itself has been completed and updated numerous times over the 3 years to create an extensive and touching story involving many individuals and the choices they made to build the path to an uncertain future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWith this in mind, the core feature of this game is obviously the narrative, the characters, and the RPG style battles. There will be\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eH-CG Artwork\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and Story Scenes aplenty but it acts as a support to the narrative rather than being tossed in scene after scene without appropriation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe game also features numerous interactions and NPCs that provide a clearer understanding of the story. Talking with some NPCs may also initiate side-quests or story related quests so it\u0027s recommended to speak with all the NPCs (Also, it\u0027ll make me happy since I wrote every single line of dialogue in game and I really want someone to read it all XD) I also plan on including numerous Special Features like Monster Arena, Coliseum Battles, and Puzzle levels provided I receive enough support and can spare the time. There is currently \u003cstrong\u003eone special feature in-game:\u003c/strong\u003e The Trials of the Divine, whereby you\u0027re basically put through a \u0027Run the Gauntlet\u0027 system that requires you to fight through numerous powerful enemies to reach the end where you will be rewarded with rare items, gold, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eInitially, this project started out as a University project when the brief suggested I try different softwares for developing projects.

With each Act, the story progresses a significant amount and I plan to release at least 1 - 2 fully working Acts every month. With the current story and narrative + possible Patreon rewards, it may be possible to reach as much as 30 Acts! With time and hard work, I intend to create a game so large that you have an actual WORLD to explore. This creates chances to insert even more events, characters and scenes! I can see myself doing and working on this game long term provided I receive the support.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
