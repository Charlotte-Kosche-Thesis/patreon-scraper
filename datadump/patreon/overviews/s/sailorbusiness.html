    "summary": "Hello everyone! We\u0027re Chris, Jordan, Allison, and Jake, and we\u0027re the people behind the weekly Sailor Business podcast. For a hundred episodes and counting, Chris and Jordan have been been going through the classic 1992 \u003cem\u003eSailor Moon\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0anime, and we just recently launched a biweekly sister podcast, Xena Warrior Business, where Chris and Allison are watching every episode of \u003cem\u003eXena: Warrior Princess\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had a lot of fun doing the show, and we\u0027ve made a ton of great friends and heard from fantastic listeners, but as you\u0027re undoubtedly aware, recording and editing the podcasts takes a whole lot of time. That\u0027s why we\u0027re turning to our listeners to help us keep things going smoothly! There\u0027s a lot that we want to do, including bonus episodes for both shows and fun (but sadly non-magical) items for our fans, and with your help, we can make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting us, and until our next episode, keep your mind on Sailor Business!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
