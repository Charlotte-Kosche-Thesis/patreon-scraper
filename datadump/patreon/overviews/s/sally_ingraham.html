At this moment in time this feels especially important - carving out and preserving a space for women and for arts education - incredibly (unbelievably) this is where I\u0027m making my stand, fighting back on a local level, one woman or child at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want more girls to make and read comics! With that in mind I am developing a female-focused comics curriculum that I am already taking into my classrooms, one that is aimed at girls aged 6-16. I teach in elementary schools, high schools, and college classrooms around Pittsburgh, crafting a new course in education as I go. Funding for arts education continues to decrease in schools of every economic level, from community centers to private schools, and yet the need for visual literacy and strong storytelling skills has only increased in this digital world. Comics are important. The curriculum I\u0027m developing is essential to building a vibrant generation of young people who can navigate our intersectional world with dignity and humor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKids are born storytellers, and developing their visual literacy early is key. They seem to put the two things together with instinctive ease from a very young age. I have handed a 6 year old a piece of paper with a grid of panels on it, offered no further instructions, and been given back an elaborately plotted tale that \"reads\" with as much elegance as work I\u0027ve enjoyed by professionals. It\u0027s like learning music by ear - kids are naturally good at it. Everyone can draw - and everyone can draw comics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSystemically, however, drawing comics is not always encouraged and kids often stop telling their stories through sequential drawings at a certain age.\u00a0I want to combat that trend. I want to take my comics curriculum into schools and libraries and museums here in Pittsburgh, and beyond, and prove their power.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to working on my comics curriculum I plan to host comics clubs and boot camps for young ladies and women of any age this summer. I am building a library of comics made by women, and in my writing and research I am focused on archiving the history of women\u0027s comics and documenting their current state. I have worked on a local and international level to make spaces for women to talk about and share their comics and will continue to do that as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these projects take a lot of time and energy, and I have organized my life so that I have plenty of both. The toss up is that my financial state is one of constant \"hustle\". That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of my Patreon team you will be giving me the gift of peace of mind. Your financial support will allow me to focus on providing the best comics education possible to the young girls (and boys) that I am lucky enough to teach. I will be able to develop a truly amazing curriculum, keep building my library of women\u0027s comics (which I dream of packing into a bus and taking on the road!), and offer low-cost or free classes to the under-served kids in my community here in Pittsburgh.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also love to get your creative help. As a member of my Patreon team you will be able to tap into the process of creating this unique comics education. I need your financial support but also hope you will share your ideas. I draw on my own experience, and the wisdom of folks like Lynda Barry, Frank Santoro, and Ivan Brunetti - comics teachers extraordinaire - but I welcome the insight and passion of any creative individual and will channel that into the exceptional educational experience that I am bringing to the next generation of cartoonists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me on this journey!"
