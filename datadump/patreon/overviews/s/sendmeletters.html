    "summary": "I\u0027m a cartoonist, this means I make comics and sequential art and I really love sharing them with you guys. I do a mix of digital and traditional work, this includes methods like inking with a brush and nib, colouring with water colours, markers, or digitally and even doing pages entirely in coloured pencils! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently do a \u003cem\u003eweekly water colour comic that updates every Monday\u003c/em\u003e. This comic is an exercise in \"minimalist whimsy\" with melancholic undertones. Each week\u0027s comic is inspired by two first word impressions based on that comic\u0027s water colour base, these words are all provided almost exclusively by my patrons so \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eif you do pledge to me, you too will have a chance to be a part of this great project!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on a project called Esterwilde, it\u0027s an ongoing comic about a small sea town and its inhabitants that spans across history. On top of these two I have a number of short comics available to read and will occasionally add to this collection as well! If you enjoy my work and you want to help keep an artist happy then you know what to do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help to keep me fed and watered and will hopefully even give me a means to pay rent on top of buying paper and ink so that I can continue making the art and comics that you guys love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unable to donate, don\u0027t worry, you can help out just by leaving a comment on your favourite piece or by sharing this page with your friends and anyone else who might be interested!

I\u0027ll try not to go too crazy with it you know?) So if I reach this goal I\u0027ll definitely be doing up some tea towel designs and maybe some new badges and clothes designs that I\u0027d like to get printed. I\u0027ll probably ask you guys what you\u0027d be interested in and we can work out what your ideal merchandise will be, and then I SHALL MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF YOU!!! Awesome!\u0026nbsp;",
