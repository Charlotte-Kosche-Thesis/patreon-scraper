Surviving as a freelance artist is tough and producing content while trying to keep your financial sanity is even tougher. Patreon feels like that sweet spot between Kickstarter and YouTube to have my production content expand and show everyone what I can do when \"TIME\" doesn\u0027t become an issue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of my patrons I can put full focus on my personal production under the Onixan Productions banner and at the same time be able to post my own personal works. I wanted to keep the option open of varying what I can do rather than focusing on just my production work.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v733/digitalbucket/Patreon/image_zpsqmkefiuq.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be able to show what I go through when I create as well as what I do when I\u0027m working on my commission works too. To say I\u0027m having a blast isn\u0027t essential enough, I want you guys to see me rocking out pieces and answering questions you may have for me about the equipment, camera set up\u0027s and even techniques I use to get the jobs done! I\u0027m on Patreon not only for me but also for YOU. Learn as you support, the perfect trade off without breaking the bank!
