Historically, artists, composers and explorers had patrons who funded their endeavors. With Patreon you can contribute a tiny amount, monthly, to enable us to do things which you may not be able to do, yourself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon site is for the purpose of giving you \u003cstrong\u003eammunition\u003c/strong\u003e to fight our crusade against cruelty and for raising funds for the most important work on Earth. Many of you already contribute to charities which help animals, as I do. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is not a charity\u003c/strong\u003e. Getting the message out to the World takes time and money.

If one thousand people became patrons I could afford to work full-time rescuing animals and set up an animal rescue sanctuary here in my home town or in yours. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to meet with corporate heads and government officials, to lobby for support of vegan alternatives - to bring the price down, thus attracting more non-vegans to eating vegan food instead. We could create (or, at least, fund) TV ads showing the violence to animals, caused by consumer choices. I\u0027ve started a campaign to get every restaurant, caf\u00e9 and fast food outlet, to have vegan choices. Your patronage will help that campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to devote my whole life to instigating your wishes, whilst providing a safe haven for hundreds, even thousands of rescued animals, employing dozens of people to promote veganism around the World and truly helping to create a vegan paradise which will become the norm for future generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I still have my \u003ca href=\"http://www.paulseymour.com.au\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e,\n which has been described as \u0027stunning\u0027, and where you can read my \nphilosophical blogs, sample my music, read synopses of short stories, \netc. That\u0027s a separate enterprise, where people can also purchase my \nwares.   \u003ca href=\"http://www.paulseymour.com.au\"\u003ewww.paulseymour.com.au\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve had these plans for years.

Relying on my own income wasn\u0027t enough. When I discovered how many people like you, have been excited and inspired by my writing and my ideas, I realised that you, my comrades, are our greatest resource. Knowing your money was going directly towards these sorts of goals, and that you\u0027d see the results posted on this page, you\u0027ll be happy to contribute, I\u0027m sure. Honestly, you wouldn\u0027t even miss $4 a month, or even $10 or perhaps\u00a0 $20! Others can even afford $100!
