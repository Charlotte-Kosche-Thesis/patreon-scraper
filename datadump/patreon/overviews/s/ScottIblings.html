    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am an artist and musician who loves to create. I have a soft spot in my heart for early computer graphics of the 80s and early 90s. I was a child of the 80s, and I used to spend hours doodling on my family\u0027s Apple IIe computer. One program, Dazzle Draw, had an amazing 16 colors (up from the usual 6), with two of them the exact same shade of grey! Even with all the amazing advances in digital art and sound, I still love to create pixellated images and tunes that sound like they could\u0027ve played on an NES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/taREEKD9CoM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have the same problem as many other creative people: Not having enough money and time to be creative. I am a dad with two young kids, which of course require lots of time and money. Totally worth it though, but it\u0027s a fact of life. In recent years I have been creating music videos on my YouTube channel. I was hoping I might get some income from it, but my slow pace of content creation and weak self promotion skills keeps it at a frustratingly\u00a0slow crawl. I was recently thinking of launching a Kickstarter project, but the single limited time period didn\u0027t seem to work with an ongoing project. As I was gearing up to attempt one, I found about Patreon. I felt like this was such a great thing for continuous creators and I had to jump right on in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/k2RpTjRm2lU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy videos contain completely original art and music (with occasional voice clips) created by myself. They aren\u0027t really related to each other, except for some character cameos. The graphics mimic 8-bit to 16-bit technology. I try to have at least some part of my songs have a classic electronic instrument sound. All songs are instrumental, and any words within the visuals are minimal, so there is no language barrier. I make sure my music has a mostly positive note to it, where the songs are fun and energetic, silly, or sometimes relaxing. I want my channel to be a place where people can go to escape the world for a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/TASqPoctCx0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I were to receive help for my project, it would give me much more time to work on it. I could create more detail and depth of shading in my visuals, more frames and layers of animation, and better polished music. My current rate of video releases is sluggish, with a new video done every 1-3 months because of time restraints. With support I hope to complete a higher quality video at least once a month, or if things are going very well, twice. I also love the ability of being able to connect with others in this creative space, which is something I have been struggling to find.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would be so grateful for any aid given. Even at the lowest pledge I will list your name after every video made from now on. Every contribution means that much to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for reading my story! I hope you enjoy my creations!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nScott\n\u003cbr\u003e"
