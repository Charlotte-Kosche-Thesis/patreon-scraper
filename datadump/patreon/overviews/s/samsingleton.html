Ingersoll, Colonel Bob,\nlet me introduce the man they called the Great Agnostic, who, one-hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago, was one of America\u2019s most celebrated public figures. If\nhe were alive today he\u2019d still be ahead of his time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am Sam Singleton. Brother Sam. I make my living putting on\none-man theater pieces about life as a nonbeliever. I\u2019ve been at it for years,\nand have appeared in hundreds of towns, all across the continent, and, truth be\ntold, I am not especially famous. Turns out that billing yourself as an atheist\nevangelist is not a sure path to super-stardom. But on the chance that that\nexperience may in some small way equip me to give voice to Colonel Bob\u2019s words,\nI am pleased to make the attempt.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a writer Colonel Bob was esteemed by such peers as Charles\nDickens, George Barnard Shaw, and Walt Whitman. As an activist his admirers\nincluded Eugene Debs and Elizabeth Caty Stanton. But it was as an orator that Colonel\nBob made his name. Mark Twain said he was the best he\u2019d ever heard. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nColonel Bob could\u2019ve turned his rhetorical skill to\ndemagoguery, or followed his father into the ministry, but he elected to\ndedicate himself to advancing the idea that humankind alone can meet\nhumankind\u2019s challenges. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI encourage you to read Susan Jacoby\u2019s excellent biography,\n\u201cThe Great Agnostic: Robert Ingersoll and American Freethought,\u201d and to listen\nto these recordings as an adjunct, or vice versa.   \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs for why I am doing this, the issues that Colonel Bob\nreturned to time and again are ones that we deal with to this day: religious\ndogma versus science, God in government, the value of being a good neighbor, a\ngood citizen, a decent human being. I am undertaking this project because it excites\nmy passions for oratory and human rights, history and philosophy. I am doing it\nfor the purely selfish pleasure of reading aloud some of the loveliest language\never committed to the page.   \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nScratchy wax-cylinder recordings are all we know of Colonel\nBob\u2019s voice, aside from the descriptions of people who heard him speak. He must\nhave had a hell of a set of pipes, since he regular addressed crowds of five\nthousand and more in the days before amplification. I will make no attempt at\nmimicry, but I will endeavor to convey something of Colonel Bob\u2019s dynamism. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe project could take years. No end-date has been set.\nI plan to release one recording per week. I\u2019ll be able to get all the way\nthrough some of the pieces; others will require serialization. The typical\nrecording will be between fifteen and thirty minutes in length. You can\nparticipate right here on Patreon by subscribing for one dollar per\ninstallment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
