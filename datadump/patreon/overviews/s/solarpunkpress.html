    "summary": "We (Faith and Watson) want to see Solarpunk happen. We\u0027re starting this magazine out of our pockets, and if in a year we\u0027ve published 12 stories, spent $2000, and have to close shop, we won\u0027t be kicking ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we\u0027d love to do so much more than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have ideas. Some are small, some are big, some are ridiculous. We\u0027ll tell you as much as we can about what we want to do up front, but we want your input.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main thing we\u0027re excited about seeing with Patreon, and we really hope you all want to participate, is the polls. We want to ask you what our stretch goals should be. After we hit sustainability -- after we know we can keep doing this after we run out of our own money to spend (which won\u0027t take long, because we\u0027re both poor college students) -- from there on out, we need to make real decisions about how to spend additional funds raised.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the additional things we\u0027d like to do, if \u00a0(a.) the money is there, (b.) it looks like it might actually work, and (c.) it\u0027s popular with the voters:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePay SFWA rates! We\u0027d love to be a SFWA qualifying market, because we want to attract the best possible fiction, and we want to do our best to pay great writers what their stories are worth. (And we really believe that Solarpunk will both attract and produce some great writers in the next few years.) To qualify for SFWA, we\u0027ll need to raise our pay rate to $0.06/word (up from the current $0.03), stick around for a full year, and reach over 1,000 audience members per issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublish more stories! This is a tricky one -- It may take more than just doubling the costs as they exist now, because the two of us aren\u0027t exactly loaded up with free time. It may involve hiring help, or paying ourselves a little bit so we can quit some of our jobs (of which, currently, we both have at least two). But if things go really, really well, I think we could get it up to 2 stories a month by the end of our first year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublish journalism! Both of us studied journalism in college. Watson has also worked for two newspapers, as a journalist and a web editor. Insofar as we are competent at anything, this is it -- and Solarpunk is as much a real-life movement as it is a genre of fiction. If any science fiction web magazine were going to attempt to sustain some science and political reporting, too, we might be the best candidates. \u0027Course, we have no clue if anybody wants to see that. But if y\u0027all show it some support, we\u0027d be thrilled to give it a try!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther things that could be pursued, if we saw some interest: Getting some more people doing the podcasts, including paying voice actors rather than just us and our friends doing it for free; getting more, or more varied, art; merch; etc.\u003cbr\u003e"

This will increase our costs per issue generally in the area of $30 to $60 per issue. The remainder of the difference is to put us in a more secure position with respect to varying costs, and to start building up a slush fund, so that we can put money into experimenting with new solarpunk projects and put together material that requires a more significant upfront investment from us.",
