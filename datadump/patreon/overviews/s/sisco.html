    "summary": "Hello and thanks for checking out my Patreon account. My name is Sisco Polaris. I\u0027m the author and creator of the Heat Universe and the On the Run series, along with dozens of stand-alone works of furry erotica. I am a writer who specialises in furry erotica, mostly gay. I have been writing furry erotica for the last twelve years. I take time to develop characters, invest in the story and prefer to let the erotic elements happen when they feel natural. I write stories with erotic elements, not sex with a vague frame of a story to excuse it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy stories are regularly featured in So Furry\u0027s most popular works and are generally very well received. Some examples of my work are linked below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sofurry.com/view/841372\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.sofurry.com/view/841372\u003c/a\u003e Late Submission\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sofurry.com/view/810525\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sofurry.com/view/972479\"\u003ehttps://www.sofurry.com/view/972479\u003c/a\u003e What\u0027s it like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sofurry.com/view/849192\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.sofurry.com/view/849192\u003c/a\u003e Nothing but the run\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on an Anthology of stories with another furry author and an artist. I have had a story accepted for the next Sofawolf Press issue of Hot Dish and several Thurston Howl anthologies, including Seven Deadly sins and Breeds wolves. I have also had my novel, The Stable Boy accepted and published by Thurston\u00a0Howl Publishing. I have published my\u00a0own novel Dyeing to be with you and an anthology of Orc erotica, all of which was shared with Patrons as I wrote them. I plan to continue to work on novels, in between producing as many short stories as I can.\u003cbr\u003esome links to my novels\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0777JD9BK\"\u003eForn-Orc-Ate\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stable-Boy-Sisco-Polaris-ebook/dp/B077RKBD2T/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003eThe Stable Boy\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dyeing-Be-You-Sisco-Polaris-ebook/dp/B019EU9PWU/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003eDyeing to be with you\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy So Furry account, where all of my work has been published, can be found here \u003ca href=\"https://sisco.sofurry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://sisco.sofurry.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMy fur\u00a0Affinity account where I am also publishing regularly is here\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sisco/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/sisco/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have set my Patreon to charge per story, because you should only pay when I produce. The number of works I will charge for per calendar month will be limited to two. I did this so that you know the most you will be charged per month. If I overproduce, as I sometimes do when my muse hits me strongly, then you reap the benefits with no additional cost.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn order to post, as a chargeable submission on Patreon, the story must be at least 5000 words long and fully proofread.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
