    "summary": "(Thank you to Kristinn Hermanniusson for the beautiful picture of Grr)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\nname is Steven James Finch. I am an emerging writer from Perth. I was\nthe managing editor of dotdotdash, a creative journal of art and\nliterature, for 4 years. I am studying a PhD part-time in literature.\nI have been writing a novel about time travel and what it means to be\na good person. I am about to do something incredibly ridiculous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nhave built a yurt. Amazing friends have helped me do this. I plan to\nlive and work in it for a year. It is my grr. I will stay in\nbackyards and public spaces, collaborating with local residents and\nartists. I will grow gardens. I will host creative salons, book\nlaunches, community dinners, gigs, exhibitions, and theatre shows in grr. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my dream. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwill have help with this project from an incredible team. Janet\nCarter (OpenKitchen collaborator), George Finch (Dad, Construction\nConsultant), Lincoln Russell (Filmmaker) and Sal Briggs-Goodridge\n(Filmmaker, Performer), Desmond Tan (Designer), Kate Greenaway (Art\nDirection), Kristinn Hermanniusson (Photographer), and Claire Bushby\n(Permaculture Consultant, Art Direction). \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\nproject is less about being self-sustainable or living off the grid.\nIt is about sustaining selves, it is about turning the grid into\nsomething that engenders care and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwant to help local art communities flourish. I want people to live\nand breathe art. I want to help grow what is beautiful and invokes\npassion. What gives people the feeling of being part of a rich\ntapestry, the feeling that \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyes, we are together\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, and\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etogether, we make good\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. We all know this to be a\ndifficult time for the arts. It\u0027s a time to rally behind the art that we believe in, and help each other. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003egrr will be an open space that hosts productions from theatremakers,\nartists, musicians, writers and creatives. If you want to perform a\nplay, have a salon-style exhibition, or launch an ep or a zine in the\ngrr, then I will help you. I will share all I have. grr will be a place of peer support, skill exchange and creative dialogue. So in supporting this project, your funds will also go to supporting\nother creative people in Perth. And by collaboratng with\ngrr, you can tap into the wellspring of other collaborators.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003egrr is everything I love: living\nmore simply for personal, creative and ecological betterment,\ncombining my artistic practice and my life, and creating tiny\nbeautiful things with good people. I will live in this way no matter what. This is the\nlife I have always wanted, and I want to share this with you and tell\nyou that you can have the life you\u0027ve always wanted too.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\nthe whole of our lives is an accumulation of tiny moments, then we\nshould make all of these tiny moments mean something, so even when we\nare at the beginning we will already have won. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nyou will get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwant to start off by saying that this is a HUGE EXPERIMENT! Some of\nthe creative outcomes will be dependent on collaboration. Supporting\nthis project means believing as I do that this idea\nwill be wonderfully giving. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\nasking you to trust me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwill be producing a lot of my content for free. Almost all of my\nwriting, my journal entries and photos from the project. As well as\nsome free events and dinners. The project will be filmed and short\nvlogs will be uploaded for free to my website. I will do all this\nbecause I believe that art should be freely shared. But I also need\nyour help to make this project of living and working become something\namazing. So I am also offering books, dinners, exclusive blog entries\nand video, postcards, events, zines, skill sharing and more to\npatreon subscribers. I will also offer anything extra that may come\nup. If another surprise collaboration happens, or I get a huge\nbreakthrough and produce more content, I will gladly share it with\nyou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwill be charging per residency rather than monthly, as I do not want\nto unnecessarily charge people, and there may be possibly slow months\nwhen I move to a new place because I will need to get settled in. And\nI think it is easier to send out all the creative material that we\nhave produced in a package at the end of each residency. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause\nI believe in being as transparent as possible: 25% of your funds will\ngo toward supporting me financially while I do this project\nfull-time, while 75% of your funds will go towards my collaborators,\nhosts, and making the grr and grr project into things of wonder. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough\nit is subscription-based, you may cancel your subscription before\nreceiving a residency package at no cost to you. You can also set\nlimits on how much money you donate if you need to. If you are\nstruggling financially then email me if you would still like a\npackage. I will help you how I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis\nis all very new and wild! \u003c/strong\u003eSo I will adjust everything according to\nwhat you, the patreon subscriber, think is best. I will be in\nconstant communication with everyone during the project. In terms of\ncopyright, everything I produce will be shared under the Creative\nCommons \u201cAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)\u201d\nlicense, which means others can remix, tweak, and build upon my work\nnon-commercially, as long as they credit me and license their new\ncreations under the identical terms. And the copyright of all\ncollaborations will be negotiated with the person I am collaborating\nwith. I will strive to make the grr project as fair and useful as\npossible. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nNear Future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt\nthe end of the project, I will write a memoir that\ndetails my entire experience, and together with film-making friends we\nwill film and edit a documentary. Both these things will be launched in\nthe months following the completion of the project in July 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePending\nGrr\u0027s success, I will travel to regional places in WA, then\ninterstate, and finally internationally. I will continue to use grr\nas a living and working space. It may change form, or be adjusted to\nbe suitable for longer distances of travel, but it will still\nfunction as an artistic and collaborative node that engages with\nlocal art communities. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nFar Future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf\nthis project is super successful, then I will use funds to establish\na nomadic residency program for WA creatives. I would love to\nestabish a reasonably central creative arts house that offers\nlong-term residencies in tiny (possibly nomadic) houses.I think that\nkind of living support network would help early career creatives\nbecome self-sustaining, and would help the growth of a beautiful\nsupportive Perth arts scene. Because becoming a writer or an artist is not just something that you work on full-time, it is something that you live and breathe. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "I will turn the Grr into a salon-style exhibition space, and use these funds to develop a nomadic visual arts program. These would involve redesigning the space to better accommodate the display of artwork, acquiring objects (podiums, hanging equipment, and lighting), and developing visual and online communication to better market the artwork. The program\u0027s focus will be on both giving new life to artworks that have previously been exhibited, and on exhibiting ephemeral artworks made specifically for this unique nomadic space. New and emerging artists will be given preference, but all artists would be welcome to collaborate. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI understand that this is audacious. Part of what makes me excited about this, and about the project in general, is that it embodies a willingness to prove the dictum that \"If we can do this with nothing, then we can do this with everything.\" That is the magic of this, and that is what I want to share with you. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith regards to all objects, I am going to negotiate with local residents of Perth so that these items may be time-shared.
