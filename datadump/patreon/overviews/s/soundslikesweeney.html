    "summary": "Dearest friends. I\u0027ve been writing and producing music since the early 90s. I started out in the local bands like The Millards, Sweet William, School of Two, Pretty Boy Crossover, Mist \u0026amp; Sea and Par Avion. There\u0027s been releases on cassettes, 7\" and 12\" vinyl, CDs and downloads. I have released on various indie labels (Sensory Projects, Morr Music, Shelflife, Matinee, Sound in Silence, cocosolidciti, Clan Analogue, TenWest) since 1996. My most active recording/music projects are Winter Witches and Panoptique Electrical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen to:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/panoptiqueelectrical/a-vow-of-silence\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Vow of Silence\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a prolific composer - and, at a guess, would say I\u0027ve made about 2000 pieces of music and songs since starting out. My life is about creating music and embracing the gentle, the quiet, the introverted and the possibilities of peace through sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThrough Patreon I am looking to produce full-length \u0027volumes\u0027 of quiet, ambient music - made especially for you! It will be available and exclusive only to you as a patron. These might be themed or inspired by requests from patrons. My desire is to keep creating and offering low-volume music, to gift back \u0027quiet\u0027 sounds in order to slow down our fast-paced, over-stimulated world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will start making music for you as soon as you pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be music for relaxation, music for sleeping, music for meditation, music to help quieten the mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I reach $100 per month I begin composing and producing the first in the series of ambient music volumes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I reach $500 per month in patronage, I will start producing four volumes of music per year, sent directly to you for downloading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I reach $1000 or more per month ... well, the possibilities are endless. You might even be offered a private performance in the comfort of your own home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of yourself as a potential investor in new Australian music or being part of a community-driven, crowd-sourced recording company, with me as your faithful recording artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will be supporting:\u003cbr\u003e- The making of new and original Australian music\u003cbr\u003e- Assisting me with ongoing music studio rental costs\u003cbr\u003e- Music equipment maintenance\u003cbr\u003e- Internet costs\u003cbr\u003e- ... and the less quantifiable support of artistic practice.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo, a little more about me:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the early 2000s I have been commissioned to create sound scores and experimental compositions for Zephyr Quartet, FourPlay String Quartet, State Theatre Company of SA, pvi collective, Chunky Move, Restless Dance Company, Version 1.0, Tanja Liedtke, DV8 Physical Theatre, Force Majeure, Closer Productions, SOIT (Belgium), Pacitti Company (UK).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the world of art I have also been making many participatory music-based projects. My most successful to date was \u2018Stereopublic: Crowdsourcing the Quiet\u2019 \u2013 which was awarded a prestigious City 2.0 TEDPrize. \u0027Stereopublic\u0027 was a music-based app and online work that encouraged members of the public to seek and record quiet locations and places of solace in urban space and cities, in return for original compositions. I spoke at New York City\u0027s TimesCenter in November 2013 for an official TEDTalk about this project and the process of composing for quiet spaces.
