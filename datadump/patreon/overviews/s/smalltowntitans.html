We are from Harrisburg, PA and we\u0027ve been a band for 5 years. We formed on May 4, 2011 and 4 years later, we had a decent local following, a driven desire to tour, and we purchased a shuttle bus so we could hit the road. Our fans helped us accomplish this through a crowdfunding campaign and we can\u2019t thank them enough for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we came home from our first tour we broke even financially. We hired a manager and pushed forward. We secretly recorded a new record with the help of our investors at Round 2 Records. Our fans loved the new songs, and we went on tour again, playing in front of an average of 20 people a night. This time we came home and made $4000, all touring expenses included. Then we spent $1000 to repair our bus. $1200 to restock our merch. A few other necessary minor expenses and we had $1000 left. We put most of that back into the band, and for the first time in our career, we paid ourselves. $150 bucks each. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe waited for our manager to seal the deal for more tours. It never happened. Promises fell through. We made calls to friends and contacts we had in the music industry, and were told this is pretty standard today for a band at our level.  We fired our manager and called our investors, determined to still pursue playing music for a living. They were still interested in working with us, thanks to us keeping track of everything while on the road. New subscribers to our email list, attendance numbers, merch sales figures...everything. We began to discuss other ways to make money besides touring and record sales. That has led us to right here. Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are in love with what this platform is doing for artists. Here at Patreon, artists are free to create until their hearts are content.  The relationship is much more personal.  If you join us here, we\u0027re gonna be hanging out ALL of the time!  But we need your support to keep doing this. Giving us as little as $1 for each video is an amazing contribution.  Every dollar counts.  Think of it as an ongoing crowdfunding campaign, where instead of giving us a larger amount one time for only one thing, here you give us MUCH smaller amounts and get MANY more things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe the music industry is changing rapidly.  If we write more songs and do things the old school way, we would then pay to record them in a professional studio, pay to put them on CDs for shows, pay to put them online on services such as Spotify and Apple Music, and then we would make 1/5 of a penny every time you listen online!  Right now, NO thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo we want to tour again? Absolutely. When it makes sense. We are very proud of what we\u2019ve done, proud of the relationships we\u2019ve made in this business, and proud of the fans and friends we have made that love and support what we do. And for now we want to focus on them (yes that\u0027s YOU)! Here at Patreon we are getting very creative. We\u2019re gonna give you new original songs, new covers, podcasts, poetry, drawings...art. Lots of art. NOTHING is off limits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in becoming one of our patrons here, Patreon has made it very simple for you to contribute.  Simply pick your reward level to the right.  You can also set a monthly limit to your contribution.  That way if we upload lots of content in one month, you won\u0027t pay more than the limit you set.  For example, if you want to spend $2 a month and we release 2 songs that month, no worries!  You will still only be charged $2.  We are not trying to rob you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you give us as little as a $1 per thing, we thank you. If you give us more, you get more and again, we thank you! We don\u2019t plan on doing this for only a week, month, or year. This is going to be our new home. Check out our rewards to your right.  While you\u2019re there, check out our new song \"Social Drift Away\" and let us know what you think. We\u2019re excited to start creating a lot of things for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you with us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. \u003cbr\u003eAny one time contribution of $500 to us means we are contacting you and coming to play an acoustic show at your house. Invite all your friends. :-) You pay travel expenses if you live more than 50 mi away from Harrisburg, PA (we provide receipts).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.P.S. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you sign up you\u0027ll get a special 25% discount code for our official online store that never expires!\u003c/strong\u003e"
