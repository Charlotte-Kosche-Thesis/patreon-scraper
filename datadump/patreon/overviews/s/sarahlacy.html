    "summary": "In the fall of 2017, Harper Business will publish my book about motherhood and entrepreneurship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSpecifically the book is about how becoming a mother needn\u0027t be a career setback. In fact, it can actually make you more successful at work and everywhere else in your life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wasn\u2019t planning on writing another book anytime soon. But I felt compelled to write this one. I wish I\u2019d known before having kids just how wrong society\u2019s perception of motherhood is, and just how much of a life-changing and career changing advantage it would become. This is not a book that argues every woman needs to have children or every mother needs to work. But it is a book that argues being a mother will make you stronger at anything else you want to achieve. That being a mother is not a disability.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe book is also part memoir: The story of four years spent building Pando while growing my family and dealing with all the usual challenges of entrepreneurship (raising money, finding revenues, hiring a team) and a lot of very unusual ones (ousted board members, over $300m in legal threats, taking on some of the most powerful companies on the planet)... and one that was utterly horrifying: A $1m proposed plot by Uber to \"go after\" my family.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs part of the research for the book, I\u0027ll be interviewing dozens of women about how becoming a mother has made them stronger. Inevitably I\u0027m going to end up with a lot more material than I can possibly fit into the book, and so I\u0027ve decided to create a podcast. Each episode will feature an interview with a different woman (and the occasional man) about parenting, entrepreneurship and where the two overlap.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery episode will be available to stream/download right here for free. But this is an entirely separate project from Pando, and I\u0027m producing it entirely myself. For that reason I\u0027ve decided to use Patreon to help cover the costs of production, and also hopefully leave a little extra to help cover some of the additional costs of writing the book (Harper is very kindly paying me an advance for the book, but I don\u0027t get the bulk of it until after I deliver the manuscript.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor starters, I\u0027ll be producing one episode every two weeks. Backers will be charged for a maximum of two shows a month. But if the Patreon exceeds $1000 per episode I\u0027ll move the show to weekly. (Backers will still only be charged for the maximum two shows a month -- the extra two will be freebies!)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your support! I hope you enjoy the show!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTOP PATRONS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://holmusk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/pando-assets/uploads/holmusk-logo-on-white.png\" style=\"width: 224px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.floodgate.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/pando-assets/uploads/floodgate.png\" style=\"width: 224px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.idealprojectgroup.com?utm_source=slpodcastm\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/pando-assets/uploads/ideal.png\" style=\"width: 224px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
