    "summary": "Hi friends. I use to hesitate to ask for support because, frankly, I was a bit uncomfortable asking people to give to support something I love doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use to think of raising funds as\u00a0asking for myself, but it finally dawned on me that this is NOT \"for me.\" This is to help spread the word and allow for more people to learn of God\u0027s love and provision for all people. \u00a0It\u0027s also for all of you who would like to play a part in this ministry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no longer hesitant to ask for all the help I can get. I need more people on this team! Getting these materials out costs money and without support it will not happen. If you want to help me get that word out then join this team and let\u0027s get to work! And if you know others who can help please share this link.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is how it works: \u00a0You simply pledge to give a set amount of money each month to support the work. This helps with the blogs, podcasts, hosting fees, video productions, books and other materials being created to spread the word of God\u0027s self-sacrifical love for every man, woman, boy and girl. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really need people who give each month as that is what pays for the monthly bills, but if you\u0027d rather just make a one time donation online through PayPal, you can do that by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/Soteriology101\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCLICKING HERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is how your financial support helps:\u003cbr\u003e1) With more resources comes better equipment...with better equipment comes better sound, more guests, more cool features and more shows. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) With more resources comes more bandwidth...with more bandwidth comes more material. Libsyn, the host for our podcast, charges by the amount of content I upload. 10 minute podcasts are cheaper than 1 hour podcasts, and the more I record the more it costs. \u00a0Your support allows me to record more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) With more resources comes more advertisement...with more advertisement comes more listeners. Every month I promote our shows and articles through google, Facebook, twitter and other social media outlets. \u00a0Every time I run a promotion new listeners subscribe and share our material. The word has to be seen to be known (Rom. 10:14). \u00a0Help us spread it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) With more resources comes more production...with more production comes other means to spread the word. \u00a0Podcasts and blogs are great, but to reach this generation we need video resources and curriculum pieces available for distribution. This does not happen without a team of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a dream of producing a professional quality documentary to counter the ones Calvinists are about to release but we need some big sponsors to get behind that kind of project. \u00a0If you know of any large donors who can help us underwrite a huge project please let me know and I\u0027d be happy to meet with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would rather not sign up as a monthly partner and you can\u0027t donate through the link above, but you\u0027d still like to give, then please contact me directly at soteriology101@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you help \u00a0spread the word by becoming a Patreon?"

This is to help provide a cutting edge resource to counter all the Gospel Coalition and other Calvinistic groups are producing. \u00a0Right now we have no budget for this project or others I have bouncing around in my brain. I am going to write the material for my studies regardless of if we reach this financial goal, but my field mentor for this project, who is a production manager, suggested I add this goal for those who may want to help make it a top quality video production, rather than just written material. \u00a0Creating and producing top notch video curriculum takes funding and as long as we have resources I will work my tail off putting out good quality material. \u00a0We make videos for Youth Evangelism through my work at the Texas Baptists convention already, but these doctrinal projects are not funded. \u00a0I have the people who can produce them, and I am writing the material, so we just need funding to start putting out high quality resources. \u00a0Why not start somewhere and see where the Lord takes it? Pray about it and give if you feel led! \u00a0Blessings",
