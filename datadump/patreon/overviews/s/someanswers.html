    "summary": "\u201c\u003cem\u003eUm I don\u2019t know the answer\u003c/em\u003e\u201d I replied to the two blank faces staring back at me and occasionally blinking.  \u201c\u003cem\u003eYeah, I guess I am still trying to figure this stuff out\u003c/em\u003e\u201d. I was at a coffee shop with two dear friends of mine who did not love Jesus, yet were meeting up with me on a weekly basis to go through the Bible.  I suddenly felt very embarrassed.  I was a Christian who was meant to know EVERYTHING thing there was to know about God right? They continued to stare at me and I was desperate to suddenly have the ability to read minds. Were they thinking I was a complete fraud? I left that meeting and went home in utter despair and humiliation.  I had no answers to the question they were asking and I felt like I had let them down.  I complained to my husband and shared how I felt completely unequipped to continue to meet up with these girls.  A week passed and when I next met with them, completely armed with answers from last week\u2019s questions, one of them stopped me.  \u201c\u003cem\u003eI just want to thank you for being honest last week.  You admitted to having no clue and it was actually a relief.  You have had the answers to everything we have asked, that it was nice to hear that Christians are still figuring things out\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eIt just makes me think that figuring out this God is a journey and you don\u2019t always have to know all the answers\u201d. \u003c/em\u003eNow it was my turn for my face to go blank.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  If I was a cartoon, a light bulb would have started to slowly flicker above my head, as an idea started formulating in my brain. \u003cem\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be great if people could listen to the testimonies of other Christians in a comfortable and familiar environment so that they would have the space and time to figure out what they think about God of the Bible?\u003c/em\u003e I really liked this idea but wondered how on earth this was going to develop as I was a mum of two small children as well as juggling a part time job? \u003cem\u003eStart a podcast and interview Christians about their life and then end with the question, why the heck do you follow and believe in Jesus? Do it Sam, you know that you have always had a desire to do talk back radio.  Well this is the closest thing to it and you can do it around your families\u2019 schedule. \u003c/em\u003e So with this crazy idea I went to the one person who I trust the most with idea, my husband. He liked the idea and began scheming ways that I could record these interviews.  I then told a few friends and family the idea and I set a deadline.  Suddenly I was thrown into a world of researching, coding, website building, editing, designing and networking.  I felt really overwhelmed and was not even sure if I was going make deadline or worse if I was doing the right thing.  Then on 1st October 2013, \u2018Some Answers\u2019 was born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \u201c\u003cem\u003eAlways be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect\u003c/em\u003e,\u201d 1 Peter 3:15.  There are days where I am not even sure if it is worth doing this podcast, if people are even listening, if I have the time to do it well and if we can continually financially invest in this project.  I then record an interview or I receive some feedback and I\u2019m encouraged and inspired. I have interviewed a person with terminal cancer, to a professional athlete, to someone who has had massive tragedy in their life, and I always find it amazing to hear their reason for their hope and faith in this God of the Bible.  These stories are reaching further than I could imagine and the thought of what sort of impact they might be having truly encourages me.  Who knows where this project will go or how long I will do it for, but my biggest desire is that people will hear how, despite us, the God of the Bible is remarkable and totally worth following.\u003cbr\u003e"
