I produce videos for my audience and I seek to give them an emotional connection to the work I produce. I want to pursue a career in filmmaking/video creation because the feeling I get when I see an entertained audience is a feeling I can\u0027t explain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I create videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started with a school project that I was assigned in my world history class. I was tasked to tell a story that involved the crusades, I decided to make a video that went along with it. I think I have never worked so hard on a project before, I really wanted that A. When I presented it to the class they were amazed and so was the teacher, they loved the detail of the video and story. That was the beginning of this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward a year later I made another video for my school. The yearbook is a major thing in my school, we have a whole day near the end of the year where we present that year\u0027s yearbook to the student body. I was selected by the yearbook adviser to lead the \"Video and Technology\" branch of our yearbook team. It took me six months and over 200 hours to complete this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eLlTQa_als\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e but I did it and solidified my desire to create videos. When I showed this video to my whole school in an auditorium full of students, staff and business representatives a wave of excitement filled the room. They loved what I had created. Ever since then I have had the desire to produce more videos for the world to see because I seek to not only make that emotional and mental connection but also to entertain people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support Siberjinx?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started this path I didn\u0027t have the necessary equipment to make it look entirely professional but I have gotten upgrades since then but these, unfortunately, require income. I do not monetize my videos for a number of reasons, one being ads are pesky and two I do not meet the new requirements that YouTube has implemented.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may be small on the YouTube scale of things but I love making these videos and sharing them with the world. I\u0027m very grateful to receive such support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis page exists for those who want to support me and my channel out of the goodness of their heart but there are now perks! Yes, that is right if you become a supporter you get benefits like a permanent shout out on my videos and Discord perks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhether or not\u00a0you decide to support me, I will keep pumping out videos for you guys to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003eI love all the support I have gotten and that just encourages me to keep on doing what I love.
