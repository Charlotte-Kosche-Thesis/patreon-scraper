    "summary": "Hello. My name is Shawn Waller, otherwise known as \"The Outsider\", \"Ultralazuli\", and occasionally Genghis Shawn (but only by my friends).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an independent creator, and have made video content for Youtube, music for myself, and more importantly, thrilling and dangerous adventures for my players in the tabletop-style role-playing games Dungeons and Dragons, Blades in the Dark, Apocalypse World, Parallels, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over 17 years, I have played, and primarily Mastered (created a set of adventures and worlds, called \u0027campaigns\u0027 for players, in the above games) those games, and have grown accustomed to certain mechanics, styles, and role-playing objectives of those games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027ve never truly been satisfied with any of them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of them, such as Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, and Parallels, have too stringent or meticulous a ruleset, and it often becomes a case where the story, roleplaying, and general in-character play is so retarded by the ruleset to the point where the story adapts to, because of, and for the mechanics. This style of game ends up causing rifts where the mechanics of the game damage the storytelling and narrative of the campaign or hold it back in such a way that the narrative no longer makes sense when paired to the rules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOthers, however, do tell a more narrative story. Systems like Blades in the Dark, Apocalypse World, and Vampire: the Masquerade. These systems often encourage the Masters to allow the narrative to take the spotlight, letting the rules be simply an example and guidelines as to what a character can do, without becoming hard rules that NEED to be followed. These systems often work fairly well at letting characters converse and play their own roles how they see fit, but only within a certain setting or theme. This is usually something like a cyberpunk future, a medieval fantasy realm, an ocean of outer space filled with piracy and interstellar megacorps, etc. The problem with these is that they never stray outside of their appointed setting. This usually isn\u0027t a problem with short campaigns, but I always want to see more than what I\u0027m shown--to have the possibility of a futuristic space soldier being thrown through time into the 100 Years War, or vice versa--and see how they do. These kinds of games can of course be \u0027homebrewed\u0027, or customized and adapted to play in a different setting with the majority of the same rules, but the inflexibility of setting holds them back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Synthesis comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSynthesis is a new and unique tabletop narratively-driven role-playing game which not only allows for the story to take the stage, and for the rules and systems to be more mutable, but also allows for infinite settings, scenarios, and potential universes to be used. Want to run a typical dark fantasy game, but want there to be alien technology? Done. Are you a DM/GM/MC, and want there to be rules for any ability you could think of that might be appropriate for the setting your players are in? Totally cool. Not only do I plan to have a metaphorical boatload of powers, skills, and abilities laid out, there will also be suggested settings, themes, and directions for those abilities and skills--effectively giving Masters the power to easily dictate which abilities are appropriate for the settings, themes, playstyles, and ratio of Conflict-to-Story that each individual Master wants for their campaigns, and their players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe system does have some hard rules, but doesn\u0027t drown you in them. It doesn\u0027t dictate how much damage a character can take when falling from a 50 foot height to the ground, or what a plesiosaurus might do once it has captured a homoerectus in it\u0027s mighty jaws. It only details a character\u0027s general overall level of power and scope, and then gives them the opportunity to take what skills, and abilities their character should have for the current or future scenario--giving the players back the power over their characters, rather than having to adhere to a leveling system and/or looking forward to the next set of class powers they gain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSynthesis is a system which is built upon the idea that ANY scenario or setting should be supported, rather than deconstructed. The idea that no matter what a Master decides to create for their players--whether pronounced or subtle, gross or profound--neither Players, Masters, or the story, is left unsatisfied, or unsatisfying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting this Patreon specifically means you\u0027ll be helping to cover some living expenses, as well as art, ideas, and creativity for Synthesis\u0027 mechanics and effective total package for the foreseeable future. Since Synthesis is currently in the Alpha Production stage, the by and large majority of support from this Patreon will go directly to that. Once it is essentially \"on-paper\", I will be using the funds for any related legal and patent costs, as well as any publishing or distribution costs. Once those are done, all support goes to further updates to Synthesis. This could include, but definitely isn\u0027t limited to: packs of new abilities, balance changes, suggested and highlighted character and adventure ideas, new rules or variations widely requested by the community, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ll join in with your support, we will Synthesize a bright new future for RPGs, and a new world of adventures for all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003etl;dr: I\u0027m creating a new type of pencil\u0027n\u0027paper RPG system, you can support me and it\u0027s creation on the right. Multiple d6\u0027s rollin\u0027 at the same time, multiple tiers of skills, custom abilities and classes. Hope you can join me and others in supporting the creation of this system! Thank you!"
