Although Valve are clearly making an effort to make games more discoverable, with recent features like the discovery queue, I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s enough. \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/928680024512892929\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam is growing at an exponential rate\u003c/a\u003e and the platform is struggling to provide consistent exposure to games that deserve it. Some people wait around for the next big release not realizing the gold that\u0027s already there. Stream 250 is changing all that with its commitment to \u003cstrong\u003esolving the Steam game discoverability problem\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy join Club 250?\u003c/h4\u003e\nClub 250 is Steam 250\u0027s members-only club. Become a member by pledging here on Patreon and gaining access to \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive club rewards\u003c/strong\u003e as detailed in the rewards section. Rewards are something I\u0027m constantly thinking about so expect more exclusive goodies in future. Moreover, \u003cstrong\u003eyour contribution is the sole determining factor of how much time I can spend improving Steam 250\u003c/strong\u003e. With enough patrons we\u0027ll be able to make the best games ranking site we could ever build. Nothing makes me happier than when we get a new club member! \ud83d\ude03\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u0027s next?\u003c/h4\u003e\nSince you\u0027re investing in the future of the site you deserve to know what\u0027s in its future so you know what you\u0027re investing in.

This would be expensive not only in terms of time but also server hardware, but would open up a lot more possibilities, including some of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCreate your own rankings\n\u2013 Find exactly what you\u0027re looking for by entering your own search criteria.
