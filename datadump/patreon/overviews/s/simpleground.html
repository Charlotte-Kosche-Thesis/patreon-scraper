    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWow... so we are starting a Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI must admit that I am excited and terrified. Things have come a long way since since I started the Simple Ground YouTube channel. I had limited experience with a video camera but I had a strong desire to share my passion for self-sufficiency and living simply like they did in the old days. I wasn\u0027t sure how far it would go and I am still shocked at how far it has come! Now, due to popular request, I have started a Patreon page. This is a little hard for me as I am not used to people wanting to support me directly. I am truly humbled. Let\u0027s take this next step together and see where it leads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Will Start as a Trial\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I have done my research about Patreon and how various people run their Patreon pages I see that there are a million ways to structure rewards. Some creators do a great job of matching the rewards to the patrons, others don\u0027t. Some genres pair well with the world of Patreon, others really don\u0027t. So, launching my Patreon page will be a little bit of a shot in the dark, but you can help. I will start with an equal reward system with a few rewards. Then you all can help guide the boat as we move forward. We can make this a team effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently the rewards will be simple, equal, and few. If you chose to contribute any amount (and really you can enter a custom amount) you will receive all of these things. First, you will have access to the patreon feed where I will post a handful of things and where you can join in the discussion and help shape the channel. Second,I will send you a postcard with a personal (handwritten) thank you. I\u0027ve designed these postcards with a picture from our journey (they look really cool).\u00a0Third, You will have access to a monthly audio or video (I will have to see what I can do) newsletter. I\u0027ll update you on the progress of the month and give you a sneak peek of what is coming up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Ways to Contribute\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon isn\u0027t a good fit for everyone. If you want to see all the ways you can contribute, you can click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://simpleground.com/supportus\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. But the biggest help of all would be sharing our journey with all of your friends. Anytime you see something you like, share it with someone else who might like it. The simple act of sharing makes all the difference.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
