You may know me as SlaveDeMorto, PrettyPonyPlot or simply as Backymod (for obvious reasons).\u003cbr\u003e\nYou might ask yourself \"Why is this person on Patreon anyway?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnswer is pretty easy. Even though some people say that \"money won\u0027t make you happy\", I don\u0027t think so. Money is a great thing and if you have enough of it, you can make your dreams come true. But what is more important is that money is needed for living (food, rent etc). So basically if you become my Patreon, you will support me monetary (duh). Right now my Patreon income can\u0027t cover my living expenses, but the bigger pledging gets, the less I need to worry about drawing commissions and instead focus on the blog full time.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nMore about the blog:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static.tumblr.com/2db6a28cdff5c282bec970326e75054a/zq8nh3e/Xjemlwuw2/tumblr_static_header.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis thing is a header for my sfw-ish and adult-ish Tumblr \n\u003ca href=\"http://ask-backy.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAsk-Backy\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\nSince 2013 it\u0027s been out there intimidating everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBlog has been updated daily since it\u0027s start on 7th of February 2012.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n As of February 2017 there are more than 1300 posts.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYears 2015 and 2016 were really horrible for me, so I had to stop posting for personal reasons. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nYet I made myself a promise to make 2017 great again so daily updates are the thing once more.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently there are 8 posts per week. Daily posts plus story on Friday.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are milestones/goals that big?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBetter founding means better quality of content. Normally I can spend hours updating Ask-Backy as it is (imagine trying to find a\n question and drawing an answer each day). Adding anything such as shadows will increase the time\n I spend on updates greatly. And thus I will have less time to work on \nanything else. So the money are to make sure that I can freely work on updates.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is there no cool rewards for becoming a patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis patreon is made for the solo reason of Ask-Backy fans supporting me\n in creating the blog. And since I don\u0027t want to hide behind the \npaywall, there is not much I can offer in exchange. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever I am \noffering monthly sketches in one limited tier as well as icons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAm I obligated to become your patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNope. I am obviously not charging anyone for following me or my blog, \nPatreon is (but a simple argonian maid) just a way of supporting artists\n like me. Sure there are some Patreon only features such as early \nupdates posted here, but you don\u0027t have to become patreon to fully \nexperience my ask-blog on daily basis. Every cent counts though, so I would really appreciate your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegarding the Tiers:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n1 usd tier: you get an early access to blog updates as soon as I am done with one. (8 - 48 hours). In a middle of a month (about 15th) you also get to see 20 usd Tier rewards. 1 usd tier posts become public the day after being postsed (cool new patreon feature). In addition tier 1 posts have sai files attached to them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e15 usd tier: I owe you a colored shaded icon with colored lineart. Which is being posted publicly unless you specifically ask me not to do so! This is one time offer, meaning that I am not drawing you an icon each month, so after you get an icon and you feel like lowering your pledge you are free to do so!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you are at 20 usd tier: You get an icon just like a 15 usd tier, but if you stay on 20 usd tier you will be also getting a monthly sketch which is being posted publicly the next month. Meaning for example that after you get billed for January, I will draw you a picture and post it under 20 usd tag so that you and other \"Sketchy Business\" Tier patrons could see it; Then, at February I will upload it to my public gallery for everyone else to see your request. Also these said sketches are re-uploaded to Patreon in middle of each month for 1 usd pledges. That is obviously unless you want your request to stay private, but you need to warn me. You are also free to upload your requests anywhere any time if you want to.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegarding the 20 usd tier sketches:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quick recap: I will post these as soon as finished to patreon with 20$+ usd tag. I will reupload them to Patreon with 1$+ usd tag in middle of a month (about 15th of each month) and post them online to my Tumblr at the end of the said month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eImportant notice:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons (15 and 20 usd tier) get their special rewards after they have been billed and since I got my hands on pay upfront feature there is no more reason for new patrons to wait for the 1st of the month. Yet in case if I somehow forget about drawing you a reward even though you pledged please don\u0027t be afraid to remind me!\u003cbr\u003e"
