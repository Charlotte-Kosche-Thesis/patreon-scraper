Discovering the world has been a lifelong personal journey of self-discovery. Recording what I see has given me an increased empathy and connection to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started painting, I painted dark, mostly in black and white, and based mainly on difficult and challenging personal experiences. At a certain point, I realized I could no longer paint in black and white, I needed color.  It was as if I had worked through the obstacles, and could now experience the joys of life on my own terms, to do more of what I like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion is painting places I am travelling to, people that I meet and stories that I hear. Painting helps me search deeply and intensely for expression and connection with my subject even in the darkest of circumstances. Looking into the eyes of others has served as my own reflection and helped me realize that we all share one world with similar dreams and aspirations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInteracting with strangers is one of the greatest gifts travel has given me. Traveling and welcoming the unknown has changed my life for the better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my Instagram for the latest news.\u003cbr\u003eInstagram: \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bycristinarusu\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/bycristinarusu\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite: \u003ca href=\"http://www.cristinarusu.net/\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.cristinarusu.net/\"\u003ehttp://www.cristinarusu.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cristinarusu.us/\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cristinarusu.us/\"\u003ehttps://cristinarusu.us/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nWorking freelance is sometimes a bit rough. Personal projects\nespecially tend to suffer. If you are able to help, I\u0027d love to put more time\ninto pulling the images out of my head and into existence!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Patreon? How does this work?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nPatreon is a platform that allows anyone to become\na patron of the arts. This is a stuffy way of saying that here we have a\nstreamlined way for you to support an artist directly.\u003cstrong\u003eThink of it sort of as an ongoing, online tip jar\u003c/strong\u003e; if you like an artist\u0027s work, and can\u0027t afford or don\u0027t\nwant to necessarily\u003cem\u003ebuy\u003c/em\u003ethe artwork regularly, but still want to support\nthem in some way? This is a great way to do it. It\u0027s a nod of your head,\nsaying, \"hey, I like what you do, thanks for sharing.\" It\u0027s all\ntotally optional, you can quit doing it at any time. When you pledge, you will\nbe charged only once per month, and you can cancel any time you want. Only want\nto tip once? That\u0027s totally okay! \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can\nread more in the FAQ here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003eif you have questions about how the money part\nworks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAre there any rewards? Are you just getting money for \"free\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUnlike something such as Kickstarter, where a\ncommunity teams up to fund a single, large, amazing project, with Patreon you\nare essentially sponsoring an artist  to keep making art over the long\nterm. For the most part, you aren\u0027t buying anything here, the way you would be\nwith kickstarter. That said...\u003cbr\u003e\nI am happy to share stuff with my patrons.\nEveryone that supports me, even at only $2/month, gets to see bonus stuff such\nas sketches and works in progress. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile I do, of course, share paintings and sketches elsewhere\nonline, I will let patrons see a few extras, especially the sort of stuff that\nI can\u0027t post publicly yet. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatrons that are able to sponsor me at higher amounts will\nget my thank you gifts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFolks that show their support not with money, but instead by\nsimply viewing my work, sometimes adding a comment, or taking even a moment to\nappreciate it\u00a0\u003cem\u003eare\u00a0\u003c/em\u003evalued! I will keep sharing the same majority of\nmy artwork online for free for as long as I can make it! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat do you do with the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAny gain from Patreon will be applied toward: for opening\nmy studio \u0026amp; gallery, promoting my art, exhibiting, creating new works,\nbuying art supplies, travel for my art, making a museum with the work of\nself-taught and outsider artists, painting workshops for kids.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPersonal artworks are not done on commission and can be a bit\nrisky for a full-time artist, because there is no guarantee that I will ever\nsee a return on it. \u003cbr\u003eWhile I hardly create art just for the money, the financial\nreality of the world means that I must make ends meet if I wish to continue making\nart as a full time career.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n When I am supported by\nfolks like you, it gives me a little more time to make things that might or\nmight not earn me any money, and that is a beautiful thing!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

For many years painting was just a way to disconnect... I have studied Mathematics and Informatics, Political Science and History but I always knew that is not what I want to do.\u003cbr\u003eI consider myself a \u2018self-taught\u2019 artist. The most important aspect of \u2018teaching yourself art\u2019, is ensuring you get enough practice. You need to set aside time regularly to devote to practicing the things you\u0027ve learnt, until they become second nature.\u003cbr\u003e",
