I\u0027m a big queer harpy living in Philadelphia and I\u0027ve been a poet since I can remember stringing words together. I set aside 2017 as the year that I would get started on the path to publishing my work. And I made a huge dent in that goal last year. This year I\u0027m re-launching this Patreon with the idea that I already am A Real Poet. I have so many things to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that good art should be a way for artists to get paid. But I also think that having an audience of dedicated humans who are invested in the production of that art can push artists to create better, richer things. I want you to be in that audience. I want to hear from you about what resonates with you in the things that I and others create. I don\u0027t want my poetry to be senseless naval gazing. I want it to reach you. I want both of us to reach together toward the things that move us. I want to write things that feel like I wrote them just for you (yes, I mean you).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo take a look around at the rewards I have on offer and decide what level works best for you. I have some great rewards that I\u0027m really excited to get to give away every month!\u003cbr\u003e"
