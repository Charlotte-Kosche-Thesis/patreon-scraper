    "summary": "Skeleton Crew Sailing is a living, evolving story in partnership with \u003cstrong\u003eMission 22\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eabout friends breaking from a near\ndecade of confinement to societal institutions by\ntaking a leap in the opposite direction. Throughout our journey around South America, we\u0027ll be posting \"episodes\" of our adventures. Because of our commitment to quality, we will only be publishing videos every three to four weeks, with the goal of garnering enough footage by the end to produce a feature-length documentary. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, video equipment is incredibly expensive. Without a formal sponsor or production company backing us, it\u0027s going to be difficult (if not impossible) to maintain the quality of filming and production we\u0027ve set out to achieve without your help. So to become a patron and have access to our videos today, click the button at the top left that says \"Become a Patron\"! You won\u0027t be charged until we post our first episode, and you will only be charged once a month for every video afterward. You won\u0027t have to worry about us releasing videos every week, running up your Patreon bill, because we\u0027re committed to producing quality, gripping videos that show only the best of our experiences. Meanwhile, Patreon will notify you every time we post a video - so you can withdraw your commitment at any time! Your donations will also be contributing to a great cause, since while we are\u00a0working to increase the visibility of \u003cstrong\u003eMission 22\u003c/strong\u003e, Skeleton Crew Sailing will also be contributing 20% of all our Patreon revenue to the various treatment programs offered by Mission 22.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a crew with an experienced videographer / published\nauthor and a licensed captain, we are well prepared for the adventures that\nlie ahead, and equally equipped to document this trip. We just need your help to bring the raw realities of sailing around the globe directly to people at home. It\u0027s gonna be one hell of a ride - we hope you decide to join us!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "goal_text": "Each dollar raised on this site represents one nautical mile of our journey, and we\u0027ve set a conservative estimate of fifteen-thousand miles to circle South America. Our \"Ole Lady,\" while reliable and refurbished, is going to need repairs throughout this trip if she\u0027s going to endure some of the harshest sailing conditions at the southernmost point of the world - and that\u0027s not to mention provisions, equipment, or our any of the other expenses to date. So if you believe in our cause and our dream to conquer Cape Horn--to go where few men or women have gone before--then become a \"Patreon\" for Skeleton Crew Sailing today. Help us to return intact by purchasing a few nautical miles, and we promise to raise awareness for veterans everywhere through our mission and our story.",
