Hate Imams are usually part of misogynistic mosque communities that also silence critical Muslim voices.

They\u0027re not equipped to be scholars, counselors, interventionists, community organizers, political commentators, and they certainly don\u0027t have the religious authority to be propagandists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://muslimreformers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_2308.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you.

In 2017, I launched a successful petition and campaign against the rhetoric of imam Ammar Shahin (Davis, California) that lead to a new coalition and campaign to to challenge hate in houses of worship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started as a campaign against one hate imam incident, lead to a realization that we have a crisis in our mosques -- a feeling shared by many Muslim Americans. From my research and talks, I quickly came to the conclusion that alienation is widespread in the human experience.\u00a0The articles, videos and podcasts you find here reflect the crisis in the Muslim community, but also how the crisis of alienation affects all people regardless of the identity labels we\u0027re born into.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Views of speakers are their own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
