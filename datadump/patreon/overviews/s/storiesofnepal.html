I am also the creator of photo blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StoriesNepal/\"\u003eStories of Nepal\u003c/a\u003e. For the past four years, I have travelled to rural and remote villages in Nepal and shared stories of the everyday Nepali people. These stories are humbling accounts of great hardships and difficulties, of generations of struggles, but also stories of great hopes and aspirations and triumphs over a chronic lack of opportunities.\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been featured in \u003cstrong\u003eBBC World, BBC Newsroom, Associated Press, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times and Yahoo\u003c/strong\u003e. I am also a recipient of the \u003cstrong\u003eEd Murrow\u0027s Program for Journalist\u003c/strong\u003e, a premiere exchange program of the U.S Department of State. Through the Stories of Nepal photo blog, I have successfully worked towards raising funds for individuals and communities effected by poverty and natural disasters. Providing immediate relief and post-earthquake reconstruction to the survivors of the Nepal Earthquake 2015 which took over 9000 lives, is one among several others. I continue to share stories of the everyday Nepali through social media, primarily my Facebook page and website Stories of Nepal\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy project, Stories of Nepal is completely self-funded. I do not sell prints and to ensure that my work remains authentic to the stories and the people who share their lives with, I stir away from brand deals and paid collaborations that require me to promote an organisations\u0027 agenda. SON is a calling and is completely passion driver. Today, Stories of Nepal has an audience over 330K and is continually growing. However, the lack of funds to support my project has limited and restricted my work in reaching more places and people and bringing out there stories to share with the world. Also with other family obligations, sustaining Stories of Nepal has become a challenge. When I heard of Patreon, it seemed like an ideal platform for me, as I could see that it could enable me to reach out to my biggest followers to support a project they love reading everyday on the newsfeed. And with the funds I could keep on doing what I am truly passionate about - bringing the stories of Nepalis to the world."

Over the past couple of years, I have roamed the streets of Kathmandu and travelled my country to talk to people, hear what they have to say and listen to their tales of sorrow and happiness. I started off as a photographer, capturing moments and people, but inspired by Humans of New York I started sharing these pictures along with the conversations I had with individuals. After all, a picture may say a thousand words, but a few words can change the story. That was how Stories of Nepal the Facebook page was born, and its community has come a long way.",
