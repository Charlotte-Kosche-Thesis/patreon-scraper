From the\nvery moment I started modeling I immediately felt like this was my passion, my\noutlet. I\u2019ve tried to work the standard 9-5 job and it literally weakened me. I\nwas wasting away behind a desk, striving for more to see, to be, to express,\nand there I was just settling\u2026 Finally I decided that no job was worth any\nmental and emotional stress, so I left and invested full time into modeling.\nThis is my career, my livelihood, my passion. Every day I wake up and invest\nhours to meet new creative individuals to collaborate with for the sake of\nartistic expression.  I\u2019m a muse. I\u2019ve\nbeen fortunate to have found my best friend, my partner, my soul mate. We\ntravel across the U.S currently to spread our artistic visions with others and have hopes to travel to other countries as well. We\nhave spent countless hours creating together days in and out and it has helped\nme become the model I am today. I am constantly growing, evolving in this\nindustry and having him be a part of it every day brings joy to me. It motivates\nme to push harder, to strive for more, to become what I was meant for in this\nlife.

It\u0027s a huge impact that digital has made in our physical and\u00a0internet world. Now, with just a simple click of a button on a phone anyone can have the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to capture their lives or events. The\u00a0simplicity and\u00a0opportunities\u00a0it provides to everyone is a huge plus. With modeling I\u0027ve been\u00a0fortunate\u00a0enough to work with\u00a0the\u00a0seasoned pro to the\u00a0amateur.\u00a0Digital\u00a0gives everyone the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to create what they want or to capture the vision they so desire. It also branches off into other\u00a0art-forms\u00a0such as digital illustration and composites.

I think it\u0027s because it was the start of where we are today. I love the patience film ingrains in you. To develop something from a negative and see it convert to what you imagined is something so inspiring ...Like the method or process of film, in its on right is an art form. Learning the process of shooting manual, knowing that their could be some slight imperfection, like a shake in the camera or a light leak, or the camera in general just\u00a0malfunctioning.\u00a0To\u00a0appreciates\u00a0the\u00a0aesthetic\u00a0of film your respecting\u00a0the very foundation of photography. I enjoy the grain,the imperfections, the shallow depths of field,\u00a0the way you to have physical teach yourself every step with out knowing what will\u00a0actually\u00a0be the\u00a0outcome. With today\u0027s world we sought after the perfect image, but with film... I see beauty in the imperfections. The way film creates an image, it literally tells a story without any necessary words..\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eModelographer\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eWith being a muse, model \u0026amp; an artist. I\u0027m in a slow process of learning what it takes to be behind the lens and in front too. With traveling the U.S. with Chris it has given me the opportunity to meet other great models to collaborate with and not only model with them but shoot them as well. I\u0027m definitely not a pro but everyday I am learning something new, even if it\u0027s just helping me with modeling or learning about directing. I have hopes to eventually invest into a digital camera ( I have a 35 mm film camera I\u0027m currently learning on) that will give me the opportunity to create the hundreds of concepts I envision as well. \u00a0I\u0027ve also dabble into the process of self-portraits... with your support and pledges it will allow me more time to spend on learning the process of photography as a - modelographer.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGenres-\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eI\u0027m into a wide variety of genres but majority of my work that will be published on here will be my uncensored work such as artistic nudes, fine art, erotica, fetish, lifestyle, and even nude fashion.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eTravel Expenses- \u003c/i\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eWith being a Freelance Model there are travel expenses that are not always covered with paid projects.
