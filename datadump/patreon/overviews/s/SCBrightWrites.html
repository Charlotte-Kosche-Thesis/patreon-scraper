Bright here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e I\u0027m a Las Vegas based LGBTQA+ Urban Fantasy, Romance, and New Adult writer with several projects going on at any given time. I\u0027m an Anthropology student (focusing in folklore, specifically vampires) and I regularly apply my research to my writing.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0I spent my teen years wedged in between library stacks while having a crisis about my sexuality. I\u0027m sure many of us can relate to that, or at least I hope so, and I\u0027m sure many of us can relate to the very sparse LGBTQA+ fantasy. YA and New Adult series very rarely feature LGBTQA+ protagonist and if they do have an LGBTQA+ character they\u0027re usually a quirky best friend with like five scenes. In recent years there are definitely more LGBTQA+ fantasy books out there and a lot of amazing LGBTQA+ writers but I want to contribute my (very self indulgent) LGBTQA+ fantasy stories. For 13 year old me, and for everyone else who sat there wondering why there were none of the books that had people like them in their library.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I use the pledge money for?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWhile you are indeed paying to get access to my stories, I\u0027m sure you want to know what exactly I\u0027m using my pledge money for. I\u0027m glad to reveal that here. All of my pledge funds will be going towards things that help me to continue writing, as well as things that help promote my Patreon and myself as a writer. This includes things like making sure my internet bill is paid (can\u0027t market without social media), making sure I\u0027m caffeinated, and buying promotional materials such as business cards, stickers, magnets, and t-shirts with my brand logo and Patreon information on them!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e",

So this new tier will include everything that the Fangtastic tier includes (Monthly story, cover image, etc.) but for three extra dollars per month you will not only receive early access to promo images and content, you\u0027ll receive critique and feedback (not editing) each month for up to:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2,500 words of prose \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2 poems \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2 pieces of artwork \u003cbr\u003e\n (Limit only one type of media but you can choose different ones each month) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately I have to limit this to 20 Patrons per month as critiquing does take quite some time, but if you need critique or feedback for a one time project (Such as a school essay or story for school) please contact me via email at stormcbright@gmail.com to discuss rates.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
