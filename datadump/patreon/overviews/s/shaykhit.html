    "summary": "We have launched a new-ish podcast where we are determined to show the\nlighter side of British Muslim life. \u201cThe Shaykh It Show\u201d is a weekly podcast\nhosted by us: Dr Faraz Ali and Dr Abdul-Azim Ahmed (known as Raz and AA), from\nCardiff in Wales, discussing popular culture, current affairs, food and the\nlighter-side of being British Muslim.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe really felt there was a gross misrepresentation of what\nit means to be a Muslim in modern Britain and we wanted to show\nanother face, away from all the headlines on front-pages of newspapers. We realized there is a whole side of British Muslim life that people don\u2019t get to see, and actually Muslims don\u2019t get to hear about that side of their lives either in media.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have taken a light-hearted and humorous\napproach towards creating this show, but we care about the world we live in, so\nwe discuss major headlines of the week from the political scene to\nentertainment, pop culture, food and technology.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe 2011 census indicated over half of Britain\u2019s Muslim\npopulation are under the age of 25, and British-born. They\u2019re increasingly\neducated, with university degrees, and ambitious in the job market. The Shaykh\nIt Show is aimed at similar Muslims, both in Britain and globally, with\nlisteners are far afield as New Zealand. We have gained hundreds of listeners from over 50 countries in just two months (or at least that\u0027s what SoundCloud says).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFaraz, aged 32, is a medical doctor by profession, and a passionate filmmaker and creative artist.\u003cbr\u003eAbdul-Azim, aged 29, is an academic and researcher of religion. We have been friends for about 12 years and The Shaykh It Show is a love-child of our friendship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe recorded our second episode from the back of a car, leaning over the microphone while drinking Starbucks. So we are desperately in need of funds and a proper set up!\u00a0We are also looking to grow the show by\ninterviewing guests, particularly those who are shaping Britain\u2019s future\nlandscape and eventually venture in to video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really want\nThe Shaykh It Show to be more professional, so we\u2019re looking for Patrons to\nhelp us with equipment and running costs. In the first year we want to raise at least \u00a3904 to raise the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Hosting costs: \u00a310 per month on SoundCloud\u003cbr\u003e2) Second microphone \u00a3189 (Blu Yeti Mic)\u003cbr\u003e3) Windbreaks x 2 = \u00a353\u003cbr\u003e4) Mixer = \u00a348\u003cbr\u003e5) Microphone stand x2 = \u00a342\u003cbr\u003e6) Wires, cables \u0026amp; related kit = circa \u00a3280\u003cbr\u003e7) H4N Zoom = \u00a3172\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe above will also be made available in a Muslim Educational school (that is also a charity) and will be used to for beneficial purposes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who has supported us thus far, but there is still a long road ahead!\u00a0So please do help us in our dream to really Shaykh things up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove\u003cbr\u003eRaz \u0026amp; AA\u003cbr\u003e"
