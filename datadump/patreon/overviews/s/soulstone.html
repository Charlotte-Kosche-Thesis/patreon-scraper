    "summary": "Greetings Fellow Soulstoners! Likely you know who we are and about the show, but there is a chance that you have stumbled upon this Patreon campaign on the insistence of a friend or family member. So let me take a moment of your time to explain who we are and why we are running a Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eOur show, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shatteredsoulstone.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShattered Soulstone\u003c/a\u003e, is one of the longest running fan-podcasts devoted to Blizzard Entertainment\u0027s Diablo game franchise. Starting in October 2011 - under the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thedawnforge.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDawnforge Network\u003c/a\u003e umbrella - our show has produced years of content prior to the launch of Diablo III.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur show takes a community focus approach relying on creating conversations with our listeners through mediums such as Twitter, audio submissions, and email. If any of our listeners takes the time to submit something to us, we take the time to share it, discuss it, and sometimes even tangent off of it. This is the foundation of our show and is the inspiration behind the phrase \"This show is powered by you, the listener.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We are Running a Patreon Campaign\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWith our\u00a0past decision to move the show to a weekly format we anticipated that the shows would be half as long as they used to be, but that has not happened. In fact, we have seen our shows grow in length following the change. While moving back to biweekly shows may have an impact, it\u0027s hard to say for sure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might have imagined, this has increased the workload for our producer and audio editor as well as the network data usage our show consumes. We are running this campaign in an effort to offset these increases in audio editing/producing so that our future shows can continue to be produced at the quality level and priority that they currently are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eBy even visiting this campaign site you have shown interest in supporting our show. We appreciate the time you have taken coming here and reading this and we thank you for that. It is people like yourself that continue to inspire us to produce the show. Without our listeners the show wouldn\u0027t be the same. We love you!\u003cbr\u003e"
