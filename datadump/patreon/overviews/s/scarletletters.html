My hobby art is often politically driven - however I spend most of my time doing commissions which are usually portraits, and am hoping this Patreon will encourage me to create art for myself and the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am halfway through a Bachelors Degree in Social Work, which I navigate through on a disability plan, enabling students like myself to complete university in their own time and with support. As a person who\u2019s been mentally ill as long as I can remember, having outlets like Patreon are a fantastic way to support my studies, as I currently live on a student allowance and side hustles such as my artwork due to finding typical customer service working environments overwhelming and very difficult to tackle. However I am striving to cope with my difficulties and hope to one day enter the social work industry - preferably focusing on mental health.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also represent Amnesty International as a chairperson (soon to be Vice President) on my campus - this site will be a great outlet to share the work I do and even get feedback from everybody in which events and causes we can focus on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will aim to update this as much as I can and you can expect a range of things, but will mostly be my original visual art and writing. I will also upload videos from time to time too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!",
