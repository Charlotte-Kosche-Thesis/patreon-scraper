    "summary": "As I have gone through my life and learned about myself, I have always wished that there were more heroes like me, a fat, non-binary, gay mixed kid. Well, it has never really happened for me, so I have decided to put my drawing and writing skills to good use so that the next generation of kids has the diverse heroes I never did. I have set off on my quest with a goal to make comics that reflect the our own diverse world.  So, with my love of high fantasy and magic filled worlds, and my artistic skills, I went about building my world from scratch and filling it with stories to share with the masses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have done most of the work on my own;  built the world, created the stories, wrote the outlines, and started on the artwork, but all of this is taking its toll. Production has been slow; I need to work and that takes time away from art. By becoming a patreon and pledging to me I can spend more money and time on getting this comic out into the world.  \u003cbr\u003eWhat projects am I currently working on? \u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am working on my first major comic \"Tales of Questing the Youth\".  It is about a small band of heroes saving a town from the hands of a band of slavers. Meanwhile, the group learns about themselves and their relationships.  \u003cbr\u003eAlso, in addition, there is always a sprinkling of fan art, some original character art, and some furry art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you working with?  \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently I am working on an Asus laptop with Medibang, and a Wacom Bamboo pen and touchpad. I\u0027m currently in the process of saving up to buy a Surface Pro to make my arting even more mobile. \u003cbr\u003eMy traditional stuff is done with a combination of Prismacolor markers, Micron pens, colored pencils, and watercolors.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get by spending a little more?  \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy spending a little more you get early access to art and comics, HQ downloads, a monthly sketch raffle, and access to a private telegram chat, chat with me directly about my world and comics. And the highest tiers get free art and a free commission.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much will comics  cost on release?  \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, this is pending.  It will depend on how long comics will be and how much printing fees will be when i get to the point of printing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow often are post made?  \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently it will be every other week at the minimum. Be it a new page for my comic or a new piece of art.\u003cbr\u003e"
