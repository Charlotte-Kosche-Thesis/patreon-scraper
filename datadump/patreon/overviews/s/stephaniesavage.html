Then, suddenly, my life became as absurd than my fiction.\u00a0I suffered a series of strokes\non both side of my brain and fell into a deep coma. My doctors proclaimed me\nprofoundly brain damaged and told my loved ones to give up hope for my full\nrecovery.  I wasn\u2019t expected to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSix weeks later, I awoke with no cognitive damage\nwhatsoever. Miracle? Hardly, unless you mean a miracle of modern medicine. But\nthat\u2019s not the way countless theists have seen my unlikely recovery. The first\ntime someone referred to my recovery as a Miracle of God was the very day of my\nawakening. The nursing home priest took one look at me, and said, \u201cGod is\ngood.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut for what? So many theists joined the hallelujah chorus that I began ironically calling myself Miracle Girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI had to relearn how to walk, and it\u2019s been a hard road\nback. But as my recovery progressed, I began to write nonfiction about my\nexperiences. As a long-time atheist whose first published work appeared in\n\u003cem\u003eAmerican Atheist Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, it was natural that my new nonfiction career would\ndrift toward the secular press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy first published nonfiction appeared in \u003cem\u003eSkeptical Inquirer\u003c/em\u003e. \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.csicop.org/si/show/covert_cognition_my_so-called_near-death_experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCovert Cognition: My So-Called Near-Death Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u201d is about the covert awareness I experienced\nduring my coma, which shared many elements of classic near-death experiences. I\ncontend that near-death experiences are in fact forms of covert cognition, like\nmy own coma-dream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve also published two essays in \u003cem\u003eFree Inquiry\u003c/em\u003e, and another one is tentatively scheduled for their\nOctober/November 2016 issue. In addition, before I began my Patheos Atheist\nblog Miracle Girl, I was a regular contributor to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/secularspectrum/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Secular Spectrum\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2017 or 2018, an essay about my recovery that isn\u2019t for the\nsecular press will be published by the disability magazine, \u003cem\u003eKaleidoscope\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u2019ve been published\nby such major publications; why do you need my support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShockingly (at least to non-writers), many large magazines\npay little or nothing to their creators, especially ones run by nonprofits. I\nreceived bupkis for the works published in \u003cem\u003eSkeptical Inquirer\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eFree\nInquiry\u003c/em\u003e, and that\u2019s leaving out the postage I paid for the mail submissions\nto \u003cem\u003eFree Inquiry\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatheos does pay me according to page views (or will, when my blog is established enough to garner enough readers). But I don\u2019t\nhave a day job beyond writing. What energy I have left is devoted to exercising\nfor my continuing rehab. Meanwhile, the medical expenses not covered by my\nhealth insurance remain a drain on our family\u2019s expenses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCue the violins.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I get from\nthis?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBeyond the warm glow of knowing you\u2019re supporting a\nlike-minded creator, I have a number of rewards for my patrons. For instance, a\nmere $1 pledge\u2014$12  a year\u2014will bring a\npassel of nature, botanical garden, and wildlife photos taken on my weekly\nrehab hikes, along with accompanying essays. Some people enjoy following me on\nmy path to recovery, but it seems a lot of people simply appreciate the\npictures for their beauty, varied landscapes, and variety of wildlife. See\nnature without getting off the couch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor only $5 a year, I\u2019ll post all of my previously\npublished articles and essays. But wait, there\u2019s more! For $10, you\u2019ll also be able to\nread my newly published secularist works before they appear in print (as long as you don\u2019t\nshare them with more than a few friends). A number of the publications have purchase all\nrights. Grumble, grumble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFeeling generous? Check out my higher rewards. Together,\nwe\u2019ll fight the good fight against creationism and other forms of theocratic\nignorance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about my writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy short fiction has appeared in numerous\npublications, including, \u003cem\u003eJewish Currents,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eSnicker\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003ePotpourri,\n3:am Magazine\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://www.3ammagazine.com/short_stories/fiction/ugly_green_bug/page_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"The\nUgly Green Bug\"\u003c/a\u003e) and was\nfeatured by the Beverly Hills Library\u0027s New Short Fiction reading series (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Uf-Klc2Xo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Zombies from the Vast\nWasteland\"\u003c/a\u003e).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Plans\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will soon make time in my burgeoning secularist writing and blogging career to write a memoir about my coma recovery, the very event that led me on this path. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to use my writing to advocate\nfor the vegetative. According to recent research, as many as one in five of\npeople with consciousness disorders have what is called \"covert\ncognition.\" I was one of them. The doctors advised my loved ones to give\nup any hope for my full recovery, even as I was hearing much of what was going\non around me. Doctors, loved ones, and the public at large need to know about\nthe recent findings about covert cognition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil recently, it was believed\nthat being in a persistent vegetative state meant that there was a complete\nabsence of conscious awareness. \u00a0Neuroscientific studies are increasingly\nproving otherwise. Too many vegetative patients, with a rich mental life like I\nhad, are having their plugs pulled because doctors say they are vegetables\nwithout hope. I would like to give a voice to the voiceless, and your donation\nwill help me do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
