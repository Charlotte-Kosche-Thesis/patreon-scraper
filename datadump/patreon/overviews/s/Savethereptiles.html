    "summary": "At Exotic Reptiles, our goal is to rescue and rehabilitate every mistreated reptile or amphibian that crosses our path, and educate the public on these misunderstood animals and their specific needs. We are located in Visalia, California, are family owned, and have over 150 animals that are up for adoption as of today. \u003cbr\u003e\nEvery week we get MULTIPLE animals brought in that are victim to improper husbandry, insufficient diet, or that simply aren\u0027t wanted anymore. Some come in worse shape than others, but each and every one is treated, fed, and cared for like our personal pets until they are rehomed to a family that knows their background and care requirements. \u003cbr\u003e\nMost often, lizards are brought in in too small an enclosure with no proper lighting, and are already suffering from Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD). While there\u0027s no cure for MBD, we do the best we can with the supplements and lights we have to stop it in its tracks and reverse some of the more severe side effects. Lighting and substrates are most commonly needed, as we are constantly getting new animals in, and both need replacing often. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe strive to provide every reptile and amphibian with everything they could possibly need to live a long, happy, healthy life, and while many are quick to donate to the fuzzy critters, not so many are as generous when in comes to our scaley friends, who deserve just as much love and respect as any other animal. \u003cbr\u003e\nItems most used here at Exotic Reptiles are supplements, medications, bark substrate, 10.0 uvb bulbs, undertank heaters and hides etc. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe appreciate everything you guys do for our scales companions. Thank you again for your time and we look forward to hearing from you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
