    "summary": "Hey guys, it\u0027s Vampyre Mike from Sega CD Universe. I am reluctantly creating this Patreon as people have been asking to leave me donations on occasion for my very low-tech Youtube videos.\u00a0You at no time will ever be asked to leave me a donation on my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand my approach is very simplistic, I will never capture video game footage with a capture card, nor do let\u0027s plays or professionally edited/produced videos. Please keep that in mind before donating any money to this Patreon. I\u0027ve always wanted to make videos like I was on the couch chatting with a friend and having fun, and that\u0027s exactly how I approach this. I mainly just talk about anything I am interested in at this point in time, but primarily video games and movies. If you\u0027d like to donate to this Patreon, the money will be used towards a game, a movie, or something else to cover on the Youtube channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to put up a Youtube video once every week or so, just so you have an idea of the timetable. I normally film from my couch, dining room table or car. Some people lovingly refer to these car Vlogs as, Drogs or Driving Vlogs. ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have had a small website called Sega CD Universe since 2001 which has some old data, reviews, and screen captures regarding one of my favorite video game systems, the Sega CD. I don\u0027t update it much, but I leave it there for informational purposes. Feel free to peruse that as well.\u003cbr\u003ebitly.com/segacduniverse\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank all of my supporters on Youtube, Twitter and my Facebook page who have found humor, friendship and anything at all interesting over the past few years. The friendships I have made and the people I have gotten to know means a great deal to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe good,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVampyre Mike\u003cbr\u003e"
