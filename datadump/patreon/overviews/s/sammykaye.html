    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Write\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI got the writing\nbug from my father, but channeled it through music all the way through college, and as I started a family of my own\nand worked through a succession of corporate jobs. But as the millennium\nturned, I began putting my thoughts and ideas to paper, and published an\nindependent romance novel - The Chevalier d\u0027Argentolle, which won an IPPY award\non its release. I\u0027ve since expanded that novel into a series called Passion and\nGlory. I\u0027m also branching \nout from historical fiction to science-fiction/fantasy, the two genres I\nlove. Through this site, I\u0027m hoping to attract a wider audience of readers, and\nalso to solicit feedback and conversation on the great topics impacting\nhumankind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThemes in my Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work always has the tension between man and woman at its core,\nbecause I believe that love, or the lack of it, hugely shapes our notions of\nself and how we relate to the wider world. My writing seeks to expand the dreamscape of imagination, while always keeping sight of the common bonds of humanity, that bind us all. It also strives to link the reader to the\nemotions of the characters, so that the reader sees and feels the world as the characters see it. I also like the naughty bits (sex scenes) because that is a normal part of life, and as beings of flesh and sensation, drives more behavior than we like to admit. I also deal with the themes of skin-color, which mostly means that there will be characters you\nwill see and relationships that will be made in my work, that you might not find in standard commercial stuff. (I\nsay skin color not race, because race, in its common usage, is a false construct.\nWhen it comes to humans, there is only one race, divided into many cultures and\nethnic groups, which are much more fluid than many of us think--the same with gender by the way, which I also deal with in my writing. Working on or through these subjects tends to melt the mind popsicles preferred by most agents, so often, self-publishing becomes the route to sharing the work.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo My Patrons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all of you,\npatrons and visitors, but especially patrons, I want to thank you for allowing\nme to pursue my dream of creating art and ideas and sharing it with the world. I also\nhope to be able to share thoughts and plots and pre-release versions of works to\nget your feedback, and perhaps even help get me unstuck, when the creative pipes\nbecome clogged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin my digital subscribe list for book discounts, coupons and writing updates. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Text \u003cstrong\u003eSKVIP\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to \u003cstrong\u003e55678\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
