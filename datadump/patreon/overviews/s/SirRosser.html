My name is Ross, known in gaming circles as Sir Rosser, and I\u0027ve been making my own style of \"Let\u0027s Play\" videos for several years now. For those of you who don\u0027t know, a \"Let\u0027s Play\" video is gameplay footage of a video game with either live or post-produced commentary from the player, players or guests. For mine, I use live commentary so that you get my genuine reactions and thoughts as I play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a pretty wide variety of games, including both new and old, ranging across genres. From NES to the latest PC titles, RPGs to first-person shooters, and great games to terrible ones, I have something for most video game fans. I also do fan-made maps, game hacks, and challenges from the fans! Often times there is some amount of alcohol and cursing involved. And in case you\u0027re wondering, yes, I do take requests!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut sometimes it gets difficult to keep it all up with the cost of living going up and the cost of gaming tagging along with it.\u00a0 So I need your help!\u00a0 With just a little extra income, I\u0027ll be able to upgrade my equipment and game library, and devote more time to creating content.\u00a0 My videos will always stay free, but any help is very much appreciated.\u00a0 You could even get to shape the course of my channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you feel so moved, pledge a little extra cash my way! Every little bit helps, and I look forward to growing my channel and bringing you lots of great videos in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eSir Rosser\u003cbr\u003e"
