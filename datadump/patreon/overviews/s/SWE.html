We\u0027ve loved bringing you quality videos over the last couple years, and it means so much to us to read all the wonderful comments you guys leave us. Reading how our videos have brightened people\u0027s days makes this all so worth it. Thank you so much for all your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll keep it simple: We love making videos, and we love that Something Witty Entertainment has become our full-time jobs. Beyond paying our employees a fair wage, anything we make will go into things like better recording equipment, and working towards making more wholly original content, unfettered by the surly bond of pre-existing shows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should be clearly stated that \u003cstrong\u003ethese pledges are not for SAOA or MHAA; they are for Something Witty Entertainment.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0While those shows are obviously what we\u0027re known for, we cannot profit off of it. Your pledges will merely give us the freedom to make all kinds of shows, including SAOA, MHAA, and eventually, our original content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want to be totally clear: \u003cstrong\u003eWe are not going to charge you for new episodes\u003c/strong\u003e. Making these videos is our passion, and we\u0027re gonna keep making them regardless of how well this does. We\u0027d just rather spend more time making videos than working terrible jobs, and we need all of your help to do it. Even if you can\u0027t afford a lot, we\u0027re still immensely grateful to all of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in closing, sorry to be so weirdly genuine here. I promise we\u0027ll get back to being snarky asshats ASAP. But seriously, thank you all so much. You have no idea what this means to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eSomething Witty Entertainment"
