Some of the old school viewers may even know me from the times I was editing the \u003cstrong\u003eWarcraft Final Fantasy Style \u003c/strong\u003eseries\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand other Machinima projects (\u003cem\u003eI love you guys!\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started out as videos intended for friends to view and reminisce over ended up drawing greater attention than I originally planned and even amassed my own little corner on youtube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a few occasions larger channels such as Machinima.com extend an offer to smaller channels (Like mine) of becoming a partner. Or Youtube may advise monetizing videos in order to reward users financially for the content they produce. But in doing so you expose yourself to restrictions limiting your content, having ads plastered everywhere you go, having your channel devoured by the larger fish and as time progresses you risk losing sight of your original goal. I\u0027ve been signed up with Union For Gamers for well over a year now as they offer the most fairest options; this in turn generates a small amount of income from my videos as well. How do I make you ask? About \u00a310.00 a month if I\u0027m lucky, I know what you\u0027re thinking, \"Damn dude you\u0027re RICH!\". /Sarcasm Off!.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy subscribers want me to keep producing videos on a regular basis and I would love to meet that expectation. I took a break from creating new content around the start of February 2015 as I needed to support my family financially during a difficult period of time. As a result I am currently working Full-Time and on my days off I prefer to just rest rather than spend several hours creating new videos. Doing both at the same time is mentally exhausting! If I had an alternate means of receiving a little extra income, (That would be you guys!), I could reduce my hours at work and dedicate that free time towards creating more videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo some folks might think, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Sef, dude, this is clearly a cash grab. How could you?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually no, regardless of how this Patreon project turns out I will continue to release videos as often as I can. The most effective way to help me out is the good ol donation route. You are free to give whatever amount you feel is fair whether it\u0027s\u00a0$1.00, 5.00, $10.00. If you feel that the donation route is a bit of a stretch, don\u0027t worry! Subscribing to the channel and letting someone else know can work just as well since it all helps one way or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to sum up, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGIVE ME YOUR MON\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e-- Err...*Ahem* :) Some tid bits of info below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- You do not need to pledge to view my videos.\u003cbr\u003e- I will not limit my content in any way.\u003cbr\u003e- I will continue to create content to the best of my ability.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- If there are any delays or issues you will be notified. (You can pause or cancel your pledge, no hard feelings!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks once more for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Sefearion-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
