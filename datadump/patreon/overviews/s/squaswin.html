    "summary": "Right, where to start...\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, my name is squaswin and I am a programmer/developer in my final year of University. However! I have a long running project going on to create a Discord bot. This bot is 42!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been at it for 2 years now and in that time, I\u0027ve written and rewritten 35000 lines of code and 42 has been added to over 4000 servers!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, onto the actual Patreon stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNote: No existing features will be paywalled\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat do we get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nI have added a new set of toys for my supporters to play with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMore coins. Each day you can claim 1500 instead of 300.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMore profile slots. 8 custom profile slots instead of the default 6.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBio. You can add a bio to your info page to tell the world more about yourself.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eGeneric Tags. You get to create tags that can be used on any of 42\u0027s servers!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eStatuses. You know how 42\u0027s playing status spins through different stats? You get to add more text to that\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nWhile I wanted to keep all the new toys on the $1 tier, I decided against doing that for statuses since those are viewable by all servers and can\u0027t be turned off \u0026gt;\u0026lt;\u003cbr\u003e\nOther than all these brand new toys, 42\u0027s commands will always be available to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, if you stop pledging, your generic tags won\u0027t be forcibly removed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nSimple, First things first, it will go towards paying for server costs, website costs, etc, and the left-overs will be put towards keeping me alive, y\u0027know, poverty class student with barely enough money to buy food... u//////u\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eDoes this mean 42 is finished?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nWell... I do have a lot of work for University, so until that is over I\u0027m not gonna be able to do much work on 42, however this isn\u0027t the end. I want to add more things, both free and supporter, and for the most part, I will be keeping everything on the $1 tier!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThank you.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003esquas, you forgot to tell them how to add me to a server, and lots of other stuff too...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nR-right 42...\u003cbr\u003eIf you want more information on what 42 can do, or how to use her, you can visit my \u003ca href=\"http://42.rockett.space\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, and to add her to your server, you can use \u003ca href=\"http://42.rockett.space/join\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e.

Reaching this goal means I will be able to get some dedicated server hosting for 42 meaning faster start up times and a more responsive bot for the users.\u003cbr\u003e",

I\u0027m not expecting to ever reach this goal, but if I do, then I will be incredibly happy as it will allow for an even faster server, and also help fund my travelling.\u003cbr\u003e35 is an established, but private, bot initially made by Roadcrosser, but currently owned by Ovyrus. She is lets say, less serious than 42 is, having more silly features like +imagemagic and other such nonesense.\u003cbr\u003e39 will be a music bot that will be available to Patreon supporters and will work similarly to any other music bots I guess?\u003cbr\u003e",
