    "summary": "Hey everyone, it\u0027s your girl Sloane Maxine Cee here, revamping her Patreon a bit! So let\u0027s get started, yeah?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has been pretty inactive, as I\u0027m sure y\u0027all can tell, but I want to fix that if I can! Which also means, I\u0027m going to slim this down a little bit to line up more with what I\u0027m doing and what I plan/hope to do. So here\u0027s what the focus of my Patreon will be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, Daughters of the Stars development. I\u0027ll give updates, art (when it\u0027s ready and I get permission from my artist), simple things like that. Considering the game is an episodic visual novel, I\u0027m going to really have to figure out what kinds of updates to create (past art sneak peeks, episode titles, stuff like that). But, no matter what, I\u0027ll figure out what to do and I\u0027ll feed updates for Daughters of the Stars over the course of the 10 episodes. This is going to be the core focus of this Patreon and what the work that comes from it/is featured on it will entail, due to it being the core project I\u0027m working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, I\u0027ll do my best to start actually putting up little original short stories every so often. I don\u0027t want to put a strict goal, because with school coming up, I\u0027m going to have very set commitments of school + Daughters of the Stars as my focuses, but I would like to get up one little 3000-5000 word story a month, if possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, of course, what would I be without offering my thoughts on games, game design, and other topics in the forms of short little essays. I have ideas for some things I want to write, and we\u0027ll see how these go. Again, these will be a bit more on the backburner for when I have the spare time and the energy and mental health to do so. I have a lot of things I\u0027m inspired to talk about, and it\u0027s really just time and energy. I\u0027ll do my best though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll stories and essays will be exclusive to Patreon supporters for a limited time before being put up on my tumblr for public viewing! Just a little something for the people who like me enough to help toss money my way. And supporters will also receive downloads for each release of Daughters of the Stars set of episodes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much else to say, is there?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to check out some of my work, you can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://waifhipster.club/portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere!\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://waifhipster.club/portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all support, whether on Patreon or in general, means the world to me. If you do give me money, I only ask that you do it if you think I am worth the money and you have the expendable, disposable income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, and I hope you enjoy my work \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
