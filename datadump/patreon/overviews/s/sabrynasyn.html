I\u0027ve been pursuing modeling since 2012. I try to dabble in a number of genres when it comes to modeling, from glamour to artistic nudes to almost anything in between.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve been going under the alias \"Sabryna Syndrome\" (inspired by my favorite band \"\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGemini Syndrome\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\") since 2014. This was mostly due to the fact that I share the same name with an actress who starred in a TV series in the late 70\u0027s-80\u0027s. Despite the big age difference (and not even looking alike) I would get contacted on my social media sites as if I were her. I also decided to go under a different name when I started doing more implied nude and topless work, although I\u0027m not ashamed of what I do at all, it just felt right to basically \"start over\" with the name thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not modeling I work 4 days a week at my night shift retail job or playing video games. I\u0027m mostly on PC nowadays but I recently got a PS4. I\u0027m into games such as Pokemon, The Elder Scrolls, Monster Hunter, Tales Of series, Harvest Moon, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI also have a number of pets. I currently have 3 parakeets, a cockatiel, a cat, and 2 dumbo rats.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027m not really someone that likes to talk about themselves, so I prefer to share my pictures instead, but I\u0027m always up for conversation with my followers/supporters :)\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FUWZ1lf.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I would appreciate your help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tAlthough I do have a part time job and I do get paid for most of my modeling gigs, it is still quite costly to keep up with modeling expenses. I often have to buy new wardrobe, makeup, and other miscellaneous things. The money I earn from my part time job goes all towards paying my rent and my bills. With the money I earn with modeling, it\u0027s essentially the same thing, so I don\u0027t often have too much left over to spend on wardrobe and whatnot. Even with $5 a month, it helps me with buying new wardrobe, makeup, and even travel costs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PGPhTFZ.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/PGPhTFZ\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat To Expect On my Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eYou can expect me to post photos I don\u0027t end up posting my social media sites, or photos that I will post here before posting anywhere else. Most of the photos I share on here will be of my nude work, which for obvious reasons I can\u0027t share on Facebook or Instagram. You can also expect to see sneak peak photos from shoots, behind the scenes photos, etc. I also post status updates about how things are progressing with my modeling, and sometimes \"blog\" sort of posts whenever there\u0027s an important update with my life or with my modeling. That\u0027s basically it, but I will definitely update if I add any reward levels or make any changes, and I\u0027m always up for suggestions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/57Mn5F7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/57Mn5F7.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
