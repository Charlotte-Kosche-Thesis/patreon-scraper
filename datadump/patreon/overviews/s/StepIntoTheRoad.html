I love telling them, listening to them, and sharing them with others. We live in an exciting time. We are at a point in time where the future is becoming the present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been releasing stories for free on my blog Step Into The Road every Friday since November of 2017. I\u0027ve also written three rough drafts of novels, one which is about to be self-published on Amazon. I\u0027ve written for an hour a day for nearly 500 days in a row. I\u0027ve been pursuing this storyteller goal at full throttle, and I\u0027m getting traction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, that traction has been slipping because of the expenses of writing. Costs for hosting a website, hiring professionals to make stories better for you, along with general living expenses have started to pull me away from creating more art. To keep sharing stories and lessons I\u0027ve learned I need your help. I need you to join me on Patreon, and together we can create a future filled with our stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the 1800\u0027s painters and other creatives had to go out and find an aristocratic patron and this pairing had a cost. They couldn\u0027t make the art they wanted to make, and it hindered them from making art that could change their world. Now, in the 21st century, Patreon has built a way for anyone to be an aristocratic patron. Additionally, it has enabled artists to find harmonious patrons. This Patreon is for people like you, who are willing and able to fund Step Into The Road, can now help it grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReview the rewards on the side of the page and discover where you fit into the equation. By becoming a patron, you help me bring more stories to you. Not just my stories but the tales of other talented writers, and creatives. I look forward to seeing you on the other side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!"
