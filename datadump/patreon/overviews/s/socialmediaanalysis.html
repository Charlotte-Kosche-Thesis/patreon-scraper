If we haven\u0027t met, I\u0027m the guy behind \u003cem\u003eSocial Media Analysis \u003c/em\u003e(SMA), the industry\u0027s only dedicated news site. If you ever wondered about the \"team,\"\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://socialmediaanalysis.com/about/nathan_gilliatt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere I am\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been watching the business and technology of working with social media data since 2006, and it\u0027s always been an interesting and active market (and are you \u003cem\u003ewatching\u003c/em\u003e the headlines lately!?). I started out writing buyer\u0027s guides and continue to offer strategy consulting through my company,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://socialtarget.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSocial Target\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSMA\u003c/em\u003e is a place to collect information that I want, as well as something I do for visibility, but it needs to start paying its own way. I subscribe to hundreds of blogs, PR feeds and mailing lists from everyone I can find who has anything to do with social media analysis. I follow vendors, consultants, academics, associations and outside specialists, and\u2014of course\u2014I use some tools to catch industry news wherever it appears. It\u0027s a lot of work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are getting real value from what I post to \u003cem\u003eSMA\u2014\u003c/em\u003eif you want me to keep going\u2014please consider supporting my effort with your subscription here. I\u0027ve suggested some support levels on the right, but your contribution at any level will help me justify the ongoing effort to maintain the site. If enough people sign on, I can do some needed updates to the site, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that this works as a monthly payment, not a one-time thing. I don\u0027t want you to be surprised.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: I\u0027ve added a Sponsor level to replace the ads that used to be on the site. At the $100 level, you get visibility on all forms of SMA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re still reading? I didn\u0027t think people still did that. Thanks for sticking with me. You must care about what I\u0027m doing with the site, or you would have moved on already. Please consider supporting the site, and I\u0027ll do my best to make it worth your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
