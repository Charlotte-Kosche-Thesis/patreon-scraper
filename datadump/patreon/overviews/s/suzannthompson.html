    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Suzann Thompson. Thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/suzpuzzling.gif\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started making textile art with knitting and crochet in\nthe 1990s, after a long journey of figuring out exactly how I could make it my\nown. My signature method is to make quilts with knitted fabric and embellish with crochet, buttons, and whatever else works. In\u00a02016, I added fabric-pieced quilting with vintage crochet embellishment to my portfolio. (Please visit \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website \u003c/a\u003efor pictures of wall hangings, my resume, and more.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy wall hangings have been exhibited in the United States\nand abroad, and this has been a wonderful journey for them and for me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/tfqks2015c.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo\u2026now what? Thanks\nfor asking!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wanted to find a way to expand the scope of my art to\ninclude more people. Sure,\nmore viewers and purchasers would be good, but I was really looking for actual participation\nby other people in my textile art world. I wanted to create community around knitting\nand crocheting.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first big step in this community art experiment is the\n\u003cem\u003eCelebrate Doilies\u003c/em\u003e exhibit, opening in July 2017 (\u003ca href=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/exhibition-schedule\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esee venues and dates here\u003c/a\u003e). The\nshow features:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- Stories and photos of family heirloom crochet from people in my local community and beyond, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e -- Works inspired by family heritage crochet by poet Sandi Horton, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e -- And my own doily-themed wall hangings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/Afternoonforweb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt took a while for all this to develop, but essentially, an aspect of my art\u00a0became a focus for people to tell me their family\nstories and share the beautiful work of themselves or their family members.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTwo more community-inclusive art projects in the\nplanning stages, which will keep me busy through 2021.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhy I\u0027m on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating and curating an exhibit like Celebrate Doilies (and\nfuture exhibits) takes a great deal of time and organization. My usual money-making activities, like\nteaching and designing for publication, are falling by the wayside as I\nprepare the bigger, more inclusive project.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m asking for your sponsorship in this endeavor of creating art\nand community. For as little as $1 per month, you can help me make my art\nand organize exhibits that feature contributions from many people (including\nyou!), whether they are artists or not.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery dollar will be greatly appreciated.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/sweethome.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHow Your Money Helps\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour patronage will make it possible for me cover internet\nand web hosting costs, pay for printing and mounting stories and photos for my\nexhibits, insure my artwork, pay for my studio space, and more. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI post a lot of free content about designing and creating\nart on my blogs and other online publications. I reach out to people through Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Your\nsupport will allow me to continue creating a web presence to publicize\nmy work and opportunities for people to take part in my projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/worthweb2.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/worthyweb2.gif \"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRewards for Your Sponsorship\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease have a look at the rewards list in the right-hand\nsidebar. I named the reward levels after\nsemi-precious stones, because they are beautiful and accessible, exactly like I\nwish my artwork and projects to be.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery level of support comes with rewards, from patron-only\nposts here on Patreon, to Twitter meetings, to discounts on merchandise. I hope to add rewards in the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to be especially clear that every single\nPatron will be acknowledged by name (or whatever your preference) at my exhibit. Patrons at higher\ndollar levels will see their names on my website or even on my artwork. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI look forward to a long and mutually beneficial\ncollaboration with you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.textilefusion.com/newspapervalentine.GIF\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind me on Instagram @suzannthompson, on Twitter @textilefusion, and on Facebook at \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/suzannthompsonauthor/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/suzannthompsonauthor/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
