    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m Shane, and I have a passion for pixel art! Specifically, the kind you find in video games from the 16-bit era that I played when I was growing up. In my humble opinion, some of the prettiest games ever made were found on the \u003cem\u003eSuper Nintendo\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSega Genesis\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eGame Boy Advance\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a freelance game artist for a few years now. I take direct commissions for all sorts of things, and will continue to do so, but Patreon allows me to share a growing collection of great pixel art assets for only a fraction of the cost of exclusive assets. This page is for amateur game designers and developers who want some great royalty-free art assets to use in their games, but can\u0027t afford the high cost of custom sprite sheets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you get: I\u0027m going to be creating various pixel art assets that fall within a cohesive theme. I\u0027ll be making icons and objects, backgrounds, animated characters, creatures, and more! Most of these assets will be usable with each other, so the longer I continue, the more you\u0027ll have to work with. I\u0027ll also be posting previews of upcoming projects, works-in-progress, my layered source files, and more! You can find detailed pledge options on the right side of the page, but here is a quick summary of what you get with each tier:\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1 pledge:\u003c/strong\u003e This is a simple donation pledge. Show your support, get updates, post comments. Good times :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$2 pledge:\u003c/strong\u003e This is for hobbyists who want to use my art in personal projects. $2 lets you use everything I\u0027ve ever shared here, but only in non-commercial works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5 pledge:\u003c/strong\u003e This is for commercial projects. Everything I post during the month you pledge is yours to use commercially with no royalties or conditions (I don\u0027t require attribution, but it would be nice). If you want to use something I posted in a month you didn\u0027t pledge, everything is available for individual purchase, just send me a message about what you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 pledge:\u003c/strong\u003e This is a new tier for my fellow artists who want to see how I do things. I\u0027ll be posting previews of works-in-progress and PSD source files (as in the image above), just for you! In addition, I\u0027ll be available to answer any questions or provide suggestions or feedback on your own artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$20+ pledge:\u003c/strong\u003e This is a variable pledge for developers that want custom assets for their project. I normally don\u0027t take private commissions for less than $100, so this is a great budget option for indie devs who just need a few things every now and then. You can pledge more than $20 if you want, but for every $5, you get a custom 16x16 sprite (you can combine them for bigger stuff) exclusive to you (no one else will see or use it). If you\u0027re OK with my other patrons using it, then you can get twice as much! In general, this is a great pledge if you are using my art in your project, because I can make small additions or changes on a regular basis to keep your game looking unique and original, without the high up-front cost of a bigger private commission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
