Basically the plan was to get big enough so a publisher (or publishers) would monetize my content by selling it as books. And guess what: the BOOK publishing industry is in any number of degrees of flux/change/peril, depending on whom you ask. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI made the decision along the way that I have to do work that I get paid for. Hence a new idea: that perhaps it was time to quit writing.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"But you\u0027ve had so much success!\" you say, or \"But I want you to keep writing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd of course bills need to be paid. This takes time spent on work that pays. What I\u0027ve come to realize this year from great authors like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mikebennett\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMike Bennett\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/stantlitore\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStant Litore\u003c/a\u003e and others, is that Patreon is a way to monetize the content that people really want: AUDIO fiction, MP3s, podcasts. Media that comes to you instead of waiting for you to seek it out, buy it, and find time to sit down with it in solitude and spend some Quality Time, as books invariably do. Will I give up the \n\u003cem\u003ewritten \u003c/em\u003eword? NO! But it\u0027s high time to make some changes around here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThus, Patreon. Some of you will remember back in 2011 when I did this successful\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sethharwood/jack-palms-ii-this-is-life-and-other-ebooks/updates\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKickstarter Project to publish \u003cem\u003eJACK PALMS II: THIS IS LIFE\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eRemember that? It was awesome, it \u003cem\u003eworked\u003c/em\u003e, and it did something great for us both: helped me get a book out, make some money, and gave fans an awesome way to contribute to what I was making, get involved in the process, and buys books.\u00a0Downside: it took a lot of work and wasn\u0027t sustainable.
