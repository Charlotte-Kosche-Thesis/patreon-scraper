Its very difficult to make a living and to cross over from Semi-Professional enthusiast to Professional Recording Artist. But I am using whatever resources I have now to create music and music videos. As I can afford to I will do some high quality professional recordings in some major studios. Also I have Children I support so I do have a day job too."

     "about": "Hi there I\u0027m Slamuel. I\u0027ve heard it said you shouldn\u0027t do music unless you have no other choice. And that\u0027s the way I feel. I\u0027ve been learning how to write songs and express these emotions for years and I feel I\u0027ve just found my voice actually. I\u0027ve released material under my band \"Runes of Eden\" in 2012\u00a0 we released an EP \" Chiffondle me\" with a lot of space between not really having an avenue to put my music out I wrote in the shadows, cultivating my craft. In 2015 I reunited a band of mine \"Sam and The Clams\" but that project was short lived and then in 2017 I tried to raise my band \"Runes of Eden\" from the dead but some of the members didn\u0027t want to work at it. Then I started my own Youtube Channel in 2017 and I have been writing heavily.And I released an Astros Fan Song \"My Heart Bleeds Orange and Blue\" in 2017 right before the MLB playoffs and of course before they won the world series! Lots of new song material. I plan to release 2 separate\u00a0 albums in 2018. \" Whiskey Gut Shot Demos\" 16 song demos from 2006-2010, And \" Stuck Here in Neverland\" 9 songs about tragic romance. And I have much more I am trying to raise money for a proffessional studio Single or EP or Album as I can pay for it.",
