    "summary": "Ever seen Forrest Gump? \u201cAre you crazy, or is ya just plain stupid.\u201d Well, here we are\u2026..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what drives a family to do this; take off for a year and sail with our kids, and a cat? Here\u2019s our story:\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012, our lives took a turn. We sailed St. Maarten, along with some of our closest friends from Missouri. Upon returning, my business partnership finally came to a head and I sold my shares in the company. Over the next month, Emily, the boys, and I toured all over America. From Yellowstone and the mountains, all the way to the Eastern Seashore, we found out what it was like to take an extended time off with each other as company. This is probably about the time that we realized that someday Emily and I wanted to take the family, leave behind possessions and experience life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 19, 2015, forever changed my life. That was the day that my father passed away from an extended fight with lung cancer. I came home one night at about that time and announced that we needed to seriously consider taking a year-long sabbatical. I was positive that she would say \u201cYou\u2019re crazy\u201d or \u201cWhat the hell are ya thinkin?\u201d. Instead she looked up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that I was quite ready for her to react that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs they say, the rest is history. If you\u2019re reading this, your likely one of our friends or someone that is possibly considering a crazy idea that involves leaving everything behind. What we would like to tell all of you is that we have come to the realization that life is NOT about material possessions. It\u2019s not about who has the fanciest car, biggest house or the clothes we wear (That sounds like a Zach Brown song). It\u2019s about life experience and loving those folks around us. The good Lord has blessed us with the realization that we only go around the sun so many times. We hope that all of you will come to this same conclusion and then go out there and find contentment in your own adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to raising our kids in a new environment, we hope to share our adventures through our VLOG. Hopefully, we will provide our viewers with a taste of the goods and the bads. We also hope to raise awareness of some of our passions such as Climate Change and slowing the destruction of our oceans, which we\u2019ve seen the effects of first-hand on every sailing trip we\u2019ve ever been on. Finally, we hope to be involved in several charitable Christian-based events/organizations while we\u2019re out there. Maybe, just maybe, we can give back a little for the many blessings that we\u2019ve been permitted.\u003cbr\u003e"
