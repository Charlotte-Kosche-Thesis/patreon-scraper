    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://www.studioartfx.com/ImageStuff/Inline01.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a kid, and an animated series called Robotech flashed across my television screen, I knew what I wanted to do. When computers like the Amiga came along, and began to make this dream possible, I dove right in! I spent years developing my skills and the methods by which I would create my original animation, and at the dawn of the millennium, I released my first film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince that time, I traveled that winding road, going back and forth between creating my own animation and working for publishers and studios like Electronic Arts, NBC/Universal, TOKYOPOP, Zoic and Sony. I never lost sight of that dream of fully diving into creating my own shows. The key, and question, is how to make a living doing so?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, the internet has developed to the point that there are numerous avenues that an artist can use to fund their creation. I have this idea that a creator can work like a manga artist, or comic studio, releasing short films and monthly chapters of a much larger story. Patreon makes this possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.studioartfx.com/ImageStuff/Inline02.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor just One Dollar a month, you can support this creative dream, and, on top of that, get access to all of the blog and video content in the exclusive patron-only feed on tis page. You will go behind the scenes of each project and follow the creation step by step. You will also be treated to various \"how-to\" videos, progress gifs, and many other insights into the world of an indie artist! All for just one dollar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to pledge more in support, you will find options to go even deeper into the world of independent animation and content creation, with various chat options to connect with the creator, including an exclusive voice chat group through Discord, or even one-on-one video chat sessions via Skype. If you are also a creator, or dream of following this path, you don\u0027t want to pass this up!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.studioartfx.com/ImageStuff/Inline03.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how will the money be used?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eStarting out, the majority of funds will go toward living expenses, rent, food, medical and support for me and my family. The goal, of course, is to be able to do this project full time and not take on any side work which would distract from this creation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs things grow, the goal is to expand and enhance the production itself, including hiring additional voice actors and getting things to the most professional level possible.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEquipment is another important aspect. A better computer and better drawing tablet would, naturally, mean better quality for the show. I also, for example, am in great need of a MIDI keyboard of doing the music. The music in the intro video above was done playing the QWERTY keyboard on my laptop!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe possibilities are endless in this new digital age. Who knows how big this could get?!"
