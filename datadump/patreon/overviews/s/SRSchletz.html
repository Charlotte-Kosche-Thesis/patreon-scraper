But let\u0027s break that down...\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I gotta give the awesome folks at Patreon their cut! That\u0027s about 10%, so -$50 ($450)\u003cbr\u003eDivide that over the course of a four week month. ($112.50 per week). Still sounds pretty good, right?\u003cbr\u003eOne last fixed expense...shipping. It\u0027s about $10, so that gives us a weekly pay rate of $102.50.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow let\u0027s look at time. I can paint a basic mini in about 30 minutes and a nice one in about an hour, but we\u0027ll assume I do at least two minis, one basic and one nice one. (We\u0027ll ignore materials cost for now, but remember it\u0027s there). \u003cbr\u003eI can right and edit a story in about 8 hours (If I\u0027m lucky). So, total for the project portion is 9.5 hours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSee where this is going?\u003cbr\u003eSo at this tier, all of you who support me and are up for this awesome mini and story are basically supporting my services at a rate of $11/hour. \u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not terrible, but in my state skilled craftsmen make closer to $40 and spend most of their time sitting around on coffee breaks.\u003cbr\u003e(Maybe we creative types should unionize!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHope the breakdown makes you understand that while it\u0027s only $1 to you and the other supporters, it adds up to make this whole venture not only a pleasure for me but also helps cover the cost of my daily coffee habit.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s enough babbling from me.
