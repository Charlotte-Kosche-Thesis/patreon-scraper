I love making things. Whether it be sculpture, costumes, or paintings\u2026I love to keep my hands moving. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever\u2026my love of art is also a constant reminder of my shame. A strange combination of love and hate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m 35 years old and have just recently begun to use my voice. As a child, I was encouraged by my family to keep quiet. \u201cNo one wants to hear you talk\u201d is something I remember being screamed in my face.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I put a gun to my head to see how I would feel about it. When I took it out of the holster I had no intention to pull the trigger, but I also acknowledged that minds can change quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForemost I wanted to know how the metal would feel against my skin. It didn\u2019t feel cold like I thought it would. I wanted to know if I would feel scared. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did not feel fear. I did feel really odd though. Not awkward or embarrassed, but something I can only describe as feeling energized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI felt like I had a lot of power at that moment. I get to make a very big decision. And I decided to put the gun down. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a strong desire to push past my shame. In order to do this, I want to address issues that are important to me. Issues and subjects that everyone can relate to even if they can\u2019t say it aloud. Not all them are pleasant unfortunately. And they shouldn\u2019t be. Sometimes the most meaningful things are also the most painful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a strong desire to push past my shame. I hope you support my Patreon so I can do just that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting my work on Patreon will allow me to spend more time in the studio. It will allow me to buy materials for projects and upgrade tools/equipment. I\u2019ll be able to pay models and photographers for their time and talent. I can submit artwork to more exhibitions. I could even travel to the openings and meet with other artists all over the world. You\u2019ll also be helping me do things like eat food and keep the lights on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/29vlydc.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Death by Disease\" 2016.\u003c/strong\u003e Costume by Sarah McFadden.

It is very much like having a subscription to a monthly magazine. It\u0027s not like Kickstarter where you donate to one big project, it\u0027s more for someone who creates on a regular basis. Some creators here on Patreon set their pages to collect pledges per creation or per post. I have set mine to collect once per month on an amount YOU set.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/10gb5fl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat brought me to Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am here to be a professional artist full-time. I\u2019ve worked many 9-5 jobs over the years. Some good, some NOT so good. I spent 6.5 years in the U.S. Army believe it or not. In the end, all paths come back to my love of creative endeavors and the strong desire to be my own boss and share my voice. I am not sure where this path will lead me, but it\u2019s a path I want and need to follow. That\u2019s why I am here at Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/343tb0p.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHow do I pledge? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJust click the orange \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button in the upper right-hand side of my page and sign up!
