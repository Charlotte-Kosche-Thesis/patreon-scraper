On the other hand, love to film video clips even made website (like this one), take pictures is also one my hobbies, I just love to enjoy life that way, not just being on stage playing guitar and at studios recording them, I really like\t to make and to know the whole thing of this profession! Although doctors tell me to calm down a bit but the truth is that it is a little hard for me, I must always be doing something.\u003cbr\u003eGuys, It\u0027s enought of \"About me\", if there\u0027s something you want to ask me you know where to find me thanks the internet, you\u0027re always welcome, I\u0027m here because of you and many people that support me.\u003cbr\u003e",
