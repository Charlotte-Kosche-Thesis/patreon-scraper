    "summary": "Hello Sunbeams!! And many welcomes!! Thank you for stumbling onto my Patreon page! First off I want to thank you for checking it out. If you had this link you probably follow me and for that I cannot thank you enough. It makes my little nerd heart so happy to know that there are amazing people out there, like YOU! So thank you for being a fan and for following my wacky adventures! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that at times my cosplay schedule is at best, sporadic, and I spend more time crafting for and going on fun adventures (RE: Disneyland, friends weddings, family events) than I do on my cosplay and content. I\u0027ve been doing a lot of thinking and I really want to kick things up a notch and create more content and tutorials and silly videos where you learn with me and in order to do more I need some help and thats where YOU come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know if you know this but I don\u0027t get paid to cosplay. I actually use the money I make when I entertain at an event to go towards my projects (my ball gowns have literally paid for themselves... and everything else..) And while I don\u0027t ever really expect to get paid just for my adventures I would like to work on providing more content and building an audience so I can reach more people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"But why do you want to do that Stephanie?\" Well I\u0027m glad you asked little Sunbeam! Because it just so happens that I wanted to talk to you about my biggest dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always want to help people, I knew I wanted to reach out into the world and make a difference but I didn\u0027t exactly know how. When I first started Stay Classy I didn\u0027t really expect anyone to care but then I realized that what I posted mattered and that I was helping to make a difference in peoples lives just by being my positive bubbly self and if you think that doesn\u0027t make me cry happy tears every time I think about it you don\u0027t know classy. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I hope to have more regularity in my costume creation and convention attendance. The goal is to start with at least one photo shoot a month while creating new cosplays, tutorials, and most exciting to me.. videos!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe kinds of rewards you can get will range from access to the special patron only feed (I will be posting whole sets of photos and lots of selfie spam from my day to day and from my progress!) I will also be doing exclusive chats with certain tiers and adding new benefits and perks as we go. As a follower you are automatically inducted into the Sunshine army but this is a way to contribute to the cause!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be clear that you are not obligated to donate! If you can\u0027t afford to but you love what I do just keep being your awesome self and drop me a comment on Facebook or Instagram sometime. But if you are so inclined and able to do so any amount of support would mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks Sunbeams and remember to shine on!"
