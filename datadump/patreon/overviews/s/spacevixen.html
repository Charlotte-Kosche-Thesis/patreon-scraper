I\u0027m Cat, and my brain is a leaky faucet that I simply can\u0027t turn off, constantly dripping with cool ideas for stories, music, art, and all the cool cartoon-y things I loved as a kid. Join me as I learn how to turn my leaky faucet into a perpetual water source for all the people out there thirsty for new content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou like fiction novels? I write those! Most of my stories are absurdist adult fantasy stories (think the late great Terry Pratchett), written for an audience of nerdy queer adults like myself. Support me here and you can get early access to the first draft for each chapter as I finish them! I\u0027ll also put up some sneak peeks and concept art for future projects (trust me, there are A LOT of them)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe music is why you\u0027re here? I compose original chiptune-style video game tunes, usually inspired by cartoons and other video games. I\u0027d love to compose music for games one day, so if you\u0027re hiring, hit me up! Support me here and you can get access to song previews and maybe even .xm files that show you how the song was built, if that\u0027s your kinda thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe you\u0027re just here for the occasional artwork? I don\u0027t doodle as much as I used to, but I intend to post character doodles and short comics from time to time as well. Support me here and be the first to see these before I release them into the wild!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I want this Patreon to be an open platform. Got comments, questions, or suggestions! Is there something you like/dislike about my work? Or is there a particular reward you\u0027d like to see? By all means, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, you made it to the bottom of the Patreon description thingy! Thanks for hearing me out! Believe in your dreams and believe in yourself! That\u0027s the only way you\u0027re ever going to get where you\u0027re headed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eCat"
