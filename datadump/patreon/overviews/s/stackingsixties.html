Funds raised through Patreon would help us to explore other content avenues - gameplay videos, huge giveaways, and even live shows are all things we\u0027d like to do in the future! Additionally, our Patreon helps to cover the other miscellaneous costs associated with recording and hosting a podcast - web hosting, domain registration, server space, editing costs, and the like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you charge per episode? What if you release a squillion episodes in one go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe charge per episode as it seems to be The Done Thing amongst podcasters on Patreon, and apart from Riley\u0027s fixation on making Aryel, Knight of Windgrace work, we\u0027re not huge on going against established wisdom. As for releasing multiple episodes, we\u0027ll never put up more than one episode per week. If, for some reason, we do put up multiple episodes in a single week then we won\u0027t charge for more than one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \"Feature Match\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003eFeature Match is a monthly video we create, where two of us - usually Toffel and Jamin - pick a deck each and battle in a best-of-three series of matches, accompanied by commentary by the three of us. If you join the Thoralf\u0027s Dwarven Hordes, you get to submit the exact 60 cards you want us to play - as long as it\u0027s a legal Brawl deck, we\u0027ll play it no questions asked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \"Buy My Voice\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBuy My Voice is a segment held at the end of each calendar month, where Riley reads out messages sent in by the revered listeners of Stacking Sixties. If you join the Knights of the Reliquary, each month you can send in any message you like for Riley to read out on the podcast - as long as it\u0027s not unreasonably long and is SFW, he\u0027ll do it, no matter what.
