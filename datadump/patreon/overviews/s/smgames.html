    "summary": "Art is divine. The artist... is not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, Patreon! My name is Queen Jenny, otherwise known as Shanemagi, and I\u0027m the lead dev of SM Games, my own little ragtag group of dedicated voice actors and jacks of all trades that want to make games. Not just any games, however. We want to make stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in the merit of passion over greed. Every minute of gameplay you find in any of my games, such as ExoSpace, has been filled to the brim with heart and soul. I believe a great game thrives when its creators are passionate, and thus, ExoSpace has been my life for the past year and a half. I\u0027ve made some amazing friends on the journey, and I\u0027ve still yet to tell some amazing stories. For a game that is going to be released for free, this has so much love and quality going into it and I want the internet to feel the same love I have for my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027ve been skirting by on the power of friendship (yay) for quite a while now, there are some things I feel money is an increasing necessity for - real life obligations, commissions for resources, even paying back my friends who have toiled so hard to bring my silly little idea to life. So, I started a Patreon as a means of not only soaring beyond what I can already do, but to give back to the friends and fans that have brought me so far already.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and while we don\u0027t absolutely need your donation, every cent helps a dream come to life, and a story of a lifetime a little bit closer to being told. And of course, we appreciate all the support we can get in whatever form it takes!\u003cbr\u003e"
