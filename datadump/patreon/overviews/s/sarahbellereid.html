The \"things\" I make aren\u0027t easily categorized, and don\u0027t really belong in a specific genre... I make spontaneous, deeply personal music with trumpets and electronics, I make performance art, I write computer programs that generate visuals, I invent and build musical robots and augmented instruments... I don\u0027t know exactly what I\u0027ll do next, but I can\u0027t wait to share it with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/h4\u003eIf you like my music/art and want to support me in the creation of new things, this is the place to do it. My art is experimental, a lot like this journey. This is ALL an experiment, and I\u0027m so grateful to have you here with me, in my inner circle. Here\u0027s the thing: I will always be an artist, and I will never stop dreaming up crazy ideas and making things. But in order to do this in a way that is sustainable for me, I need YOU. It\u0027s almost impossible to find enough consistent funding to keep projects going, get new things off the ground, and to pay collaborators what they deserve. It\u0027s exhausting (for me and my fans) to launch individual fundraising campaigns with every new project or tour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron means that you are agreeing to make a monthly pledge in support of my artistic career. Every bit of your support goes directly to me and to funding my art. Trust me when I say that your contribution makes a difference. Whether you\u0027re backing me for a dollar or ten, THANK YOU.\u00a0All of the \"things\" I make have meaning because \u003cstrong\u003eyou give my voice a way to be heard\u003c/strong\u003e. Because of your patronage I am able to spend more time creating, I am free to take more risks, to aim higher, and most importantly, to share more art with you (and the world).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy believing in me and making a monthly pledge \u2014 no matter what amount \u2014 you are contributing to a movement. An incredible, game-changing movement to make independent art possible. Thank you for being part of this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut wait...
