    "summary": "Hi there, my name is Sam Varnerin, and for the past two and a half years I\u0027ve been a professional snuggler (and I\u0027ve been a fulltime one for the past year!).\u00a0I\u0027ve been featured in a few places, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/make-money/professional-snuggler/\"\u003eThe Penny Hoarder\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://sidehustleschool.com/episode/become-a-professional-snuggler/\"\u003eSide Hustle School Podcast\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/featured/how-one-woman-makes-money-snuggling/\"\u003eStudent Loan Hero\u003c/a\u003e, and my local paper\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://scoutsomerville.com/snuggles-hard-money/\"\u003eThe Somerville Scout\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0stumbled upon professional snuggling by accident in October 2015, and I started working for a national agency shortly after while working as a construction engineer.  About three months in, I realized I hadn\u0027t been taught much on how to prepare for a client, how to de-escalate a situation from turning sexual (really important for a woman!), setting boundaries, being proactive about the session, connecting with clients deeply and appropriately... basically I felt like I got less than the bare minimum for training. And with the training I did receive, I didn\u0027t feel safe enough doing the work. But I had enough clients at this point that I wanted to keep on doing this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I created my own systems to operate sessions safely, professionally and abundantly without sacrificing quality of the service.  In February 2017 I officially launched my personal teaching business Snuggle with Sam. I had the idea of a professional agency as well (and have trained two women,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.snugglewithsam.com/katne\"\u003eKat\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.snugglewithsam.com/amynyc\"\u003eAmy\u003c/a\u003e), but have since put that on hold since I really wanted to intimately know and train the people I work with. Instead, I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.snugglewithsam.com/snuggleprotocols/\"\u003eI created my first course for professional snugglers\u003c/a\u003e that may be starting at an agency that doesn\u0027t provide training.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally didn\u0027t want a national agency. I wanted a few quality people that worked really well and have a boutique version of an agency. I believe Kat and Amy are like that. But in 2018 my thoughts on creating a national agency began to change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2018, I got contacted by one of the largest national professional snuggling agencies in the U.S after they saw my course sales page. After some argument about the training for snugglers that they give (or lack thereof), they asked if I could come on board and provide training for their snugglers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow exciting! I was about to bring quality training to people that will see more clients in one day that I could in a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept the agency and I could not agree based on both business practices, marketing tactics, or even ethical boundaries of their company. After some back and forth and digging into my own business morals, I decided to walk away from the deal.\u00a0 It was really hard to walk away from because I really wanted to help people, and this felt like the biggest way I could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith encouragement from friends, they suggested I start my own national agency, train them the way I see fit, and provide quality professional snugglers across the country and help as many people as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost national agencies are primarily internet-based, so that idea of wanting to know my snugglers well when I take them into my agency was really hard to conceptualize with a national agency, which is usually just internet-based. I didn\u0027t want my business to just be internet-based. I wanted to take this business into people\u0027s faces so they knew this service existed and that I existed. I wanted to train snugglers in person. I wanted to be IN the communities where the people that need it are directly exposed to the work that I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.snugglewithsam.com/snuggletour\"\u003eThus the idea for the first Snuggle Tour was born.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJune through September or 2018, I will go to the most prominent cities that I\u0027ve researched as most open and under served for professional snuggling and put myself and others in the field right in front of their faces. This is for the purpose of building my own agency that will be run as high quality and personal as possible. Yes, there will be an internet presence, but this tour will mostly be run through the local places in each town.\u00a0 I want to meet the people that need snuggling in their life and the people that would make great snugglers and bring them training, resources, and their first few clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot of work to be done to make this happen, and going from a three woman band to many more is a HUGE jump for me.\u00a0 Not only that, but there\u0027s quite a bit of travel costs and maintenance of my own living space while I\u0027m away I\u0027ll need to do. AND, not only that, but I want to be able to support the many people that will be away during the time that I\u0027m gone, be it through videos on snuggling, finding more people locally for them to work with, or finding and hiring people to run events while I\u0027m gone. There\u0027s a lot of costs, and I\u0027ve realized that I can\u0027t keep up with all of them for this dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNormally I\u0027d put a very specific dollar amount on it (I\u0027m an engineer; I like numbers), but because the ideas and concepts are still growing since no one has done this before, I can\u0027t say that I need, say, $20k to make this whole thing happen. In fact, it may start as $20k, but then something huge may come up and I\u0027d need to make it $50k. PLUS I want to plan for the costs a couple months ahead of time and in the future plan for a second Snuggle Tour. PLUS I want to continue to create and make things for my community of snugglers and non-snugglers even while I\u0027m working on focusing on my Snuggle Tour. It makes sense to me to turn to Patreon for cashflow rather than a one-time crowdfunding so that I can create before, during, and after the Snuggle Tour for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what do you get out of contributing to my Patreon? Well, see my tiers and see how you can help and benefit!\u003cbr\u003e"
