href=\"http://www.shiftythrifting.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShiftyThrifting\u003c/a\u003e started over on Tumblr in\n2013 as a way to entertain my Regretsy friends and to keep myself busy\non my many thrifting trips. \u00a0I always found myself wandering\nthe stores I visited, marvelling over some of the strange things that\nwould turn up. \u00a0Who donated this? \u00a0Who bought this in\nthe first place? \u00a0Who will give it a good home next?\n\u00a0I found myself buying a lot of the weird things I found,\nincluding but not limited to a giant faux bear rug, a bootleg Hello\nKitty/Pikachu crossover cookoo clock, and well... see below:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg

finest, strangest goofballs on the internet. \u00a0This blog is\nstill going because I love you guys, I love weird shit, and I love\nthrift stores.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I started this blog, I went to the store once a week and took\nabout six pictures on average. \u00a0Now I go to three stores a\nweek and take as many as I can. \u00a0In 2013 we ended the year\nwith about 150 posts I think. \u00a0Now in 2018, we\u0027re up to nearly 10,000. \u00a0That\u0027s a lot of fuckery for you guys to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the

\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m based in Worcester, Massachusetts but visit shops in other states\nwhenever I travel. \u00a0My favorite things to find are Pokemon\nrelated anything, weird\nlittle statues of animals making strange faces, scented candles, and\ncomic books. \u00a0I hate shell art and Sillisculpts.\n\u00a0Smash a Sillisculpt today to recieve 5 free Didi

Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe simple answer here is that the blog has almost gotten -too- big for\nme to handle on my own. \u00a0I spend 2+ hours a day on submissions\nalone, and I still haven\u0027t seen the bottom of my inbox this year.\n\u00a0The wear-and-tear on my car eventually claimed its life, and\nnow I can only go out when my fiance\u0027s car is free or he\u0027s willing to\nbe drug around the local Savers while I threaten to cover our home in\nvelvet unicorn paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe other answer to this is to give something tangible back to the\ncommunity. \u00a0Junk Boxes are fun to get and fun to shop for, and\nso far I\u0027ve had a blast with them.\u00a0 Now with Otter helping, we can send out even
