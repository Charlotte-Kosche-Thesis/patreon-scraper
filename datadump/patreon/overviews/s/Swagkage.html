    "summary": "Hey there, and thanks for stopping by to check out the Patreon. You might have come here from my YouTube channel, since my videos are what I\u0027m primarily known for, but this page has nothing to do with them. I\u0027ll be using this Patreon to support an upcoming manga series that I\u0027m working on called \u003cem\u003eHigh Art\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a project I\u0027ve been conceptualizing for a while (a couple years, since 2014 if my memory serves me correctly) that I initially planned on writing as a series of novels. However, now that I\u0027ve found a really talented comic book artist, I figured that it would be even better to make it into a series of graphic novels, (specifically a manga, since that\u0027s what the story is most heavily inspired by) since that\u0027ll really help bring the story to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously my artist isn\u0027t going to do any work for free, and since I plan on having this series running for a while (the world is big as it is heavily inspired by shonen and seinen, so if possible I want to make this thing exceed a few hundred chapters) I\u0027m going to need some kind of revenue stream to support the project during its early stages. That\u0027s where this page comes in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the project is currently in its infancy, the rewards and goals may be subject to change, but if anything I\u0027ll just be adding more rewards and tiers as I get a better understanding of production costs and all that. None of the rewards currently listed should be removed for any reason unless otherwise specified.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everyone who\u0027s shown the project some love so far. The support I\u0027ve received has been overwhelming and I\u0027m incredibly excited to get the ball rolling here - the only barrier I\u0027m facing is a financial one. Any help would be appreciated, but if you don\u0027t want to pledge to the Patreon page, that\u0027s totally fine! You can show your support by simply reading each chapter when it\u0027s posted online.\u003cbr\u003e"
