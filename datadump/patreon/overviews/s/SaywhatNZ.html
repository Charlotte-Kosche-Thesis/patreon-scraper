    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDecember 2017\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... this is the next step in the rest of the journey that is \"Say what... Magazine\". It\u0027s been four years so far... 48 \"official\" issues preceded by one \"trial run\" issue in December 2013. It has been a wonderful, thrilling, terrifying, stressful, exhilarating, joyous, tearful, entertaining journey so far, and now it\u0027s time to see who is willing to drop a few pennies in the cup to help kick it up to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last four years, I have been fortunate enough to have been gifted content from some great individuals and companies but to really make some progress I need the resources to pay key contributors for premium content. As a labour of love, this magazine has required me to downsize my external commitments, reducing my working income to the point where I can\u0027t generate the funds needed by myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a very small contribution, you can help me to raise the bar to the next level. In return, there are some rewards on offer - small to start with but sure to grow as resources and revenues increase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for coming to check the page out, and I hope you\u0027ll see fit to add your\u00a0name to the patron\u00a0list!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease Note: \u003cem\u003eIf you have a reward that involves your details, links and/or an advertisement \u003c/em\u003e\u0026lt;g\u0026gt;being\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt;\u003cem\u003e included, you will be contacted early in the month of payment processing. In the case of this example, early February.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003eBecause of the way Patreon works - where your pledges are processed from your credit cards on the first of each month, you will, in effect, be supporting the issue following payment processing.\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is because the magazine is already fully designed and built BEFORE your pledges have been processed successfully. So, a pledge made in January is processed Feb 1st. Your pledge will be applied to, and recognition will be given \u003c/em\u003ein,\u003cem\u003e the March issue. (Hope that makes sense!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlso, it appears that Patreon charges per \"paid \u003c/em\u003epost\u003c/del\u003e\u003cstrike style=\"\"\u003e\", so to avoid any confusion or hassle, I will ONLY be posting\u00a0ONE \"paid post\" per month - a reminder ahead of publication - and any other posts I make will be \"free and public\".\u003c/strike\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrike style=\"\"\u003e \u003c/strike\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE - February 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eI have switched to Patreon\u0027s \"pay monthly\" system. This means that I can post as many Patron-only posts as needed, but you will NOT get charged more than once, to the value of your pledge! You can relax and read all the patron-only posts and not worry that your credit card is getting hammered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis also means that, as long as you don\u0027t decide to cancel before the payment goes through, your support will be reflected in the very next issue after you make your pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon are\u00a0testing a new \"pay in advance\" system. As soon as that comes into full effect, I will look to switch to that system which will mean you can start enjoying the benefits of your patronage immediately - no waiting for the month to roll over. #WatchThisSpace\u003cbr\u003e"
