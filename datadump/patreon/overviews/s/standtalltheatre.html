    "summary": "Whether you\u0027ve been to one of our Stand Tall Theatre productions watched our documentaries attended a workshop or class, or experienced our performance art, we are super glad you\u0027re here and appreciate your time! Clearly, you\u0027re looking for a new way to support Stand Tall Theatre and we need that support. Being mostly self-funded and independent, pushing the boundaries of destigmasiation and revaluation of neurodiversity (mental health) We need all the help we can get to make more documentaries to reach wider audiences support our rehearsals and hours of research that largely is supported in kind by theatres and other institutions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your help, we can make a difference in peoples lives and give voices to those that need it.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s be honest: it\u0027s difficult to support the arts, even if you want to.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour schedule gets away from you, and you miss buying tickets for shows you want to see.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u0027s difficult to approach the theatre in person, shake their hand and slip them a \u00a350.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou don\u0027t live near the group you want to support, and even if you send money, you\u0027re unsure what you get in return for your support.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStand Tall Theatre run by co-artistic directors Stevie Williams and Carley Dawson working with charities, and creating exciting, pioneering, new work. Stand Tall has grown and changed exponentially since its early BeeCreative beginning where we began our journey of confidence in drama. We\u0027ve offered T.I.E, confidence through drama workshops and toured productions raising awareness to mental health since then, alongside collaboration with various institutions.We have successfully funded the performance\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSchizophrenia\u003c/em\u003e from the small beginnings, based on support from Groundlings Theatre -- don\u0027t ask us how, because we\u0027re still not entirely sure how we pulled that off, but want to keep trucking and raising awareness further.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStand Tall Theatre has managed to do all of this largely because of people\u0027s generosity of time and skill -- not money. Since our incarnation, we have self-funded, worked double sometimes triple jobs and freelancing, for all our annual budgets. For Stand Tall, we\u0027ve learned that the business of producing artworks is best if we work modestly and focus on design and skill rather than on expense. When you support Stand Tall Theatre, you know that those monies get spent on \u003cstrong\u003ecreating art\u003c/strong\u003e that you can see and consume, and not on renting large halls to host fundraiser banquets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur endless thanks \u003c/strong\u003ego to those who do and have supported us every day, and that includes our unofficial resident members, technical workers, directors, actors, designers, venue hosts (Groundlings Theatre), artists and goes right down to anyone who reads and shares one of our Facebook statuses, Twitter posts or anything we share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd now (fingers crossed), that includes you! Thank YOU!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you can jump on board with a monthly Patreon contribution to Stand Tall Theatre. We figure this is much easier than attending a large expensive annual banquet where your money won\u0027t get spent effectively anyway. We\u0027re sure that a \u00a31, \u00a35 or \u00a310 monthly subscription will much more easily find a comfy home next to your Netflix or monthly sandwich subscription. Then, you won\u0027t have to think twice about coming to see a Stand Tall Theatre show because your ticket is already paid for alongside our almightly thanks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DOES THIS DO FOR\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.standtalltheatre.com\"\u003e Stand Tall Theatre\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreat question!
