    "summary": "Greetings, salutations and tail wags!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m Sera and I am a siren. I find myself pursuing all sorts of art including freelance modeling, photography of my own, poetry, visual art, theatre performance, music and dance. I love the different avenues of expression that I can utilize in order to release my soul as well as contribute to the world in order to connect all of us and understand our own humanity. I am humbled and honored that I am able to not only explore myself and the world through the arts, but also call what I do my \"job\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter taking a two year hiatus from modeling to study poetry, non fiction writing, theatre and physics in college I have recently relocated to LA in order to pursue freelance modeling, acting and writing full time. I have been modeling for about eight years and I can\u0027t think of any thing else that I love as much. (Maybe gluten free cupcakes and cats). Modeling to me means that I am able to utilize all of my talent and soul in order to breathe art into existence. I get to connect to the people I am working with as well as those I have never had the pleasure of meeting. Traveling, making connections and creating art helps me to realize how beautiful the world is everyday. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been writing poetry since I was four. I have no idea how it started, but I have been doing it ever since. After studying poetry in college I realized that my descriptions of life can have an impact on others, much like the words I used to read and take to heart. I have been very shy about showcasing this side of myself, but I am looking forward to finally releasing it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour love and support is the greatest feedback. I am excited to finally have a home to display all of the work that I\u0027ve done. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003eXOXOX\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.moderncrusaders.tumblr.com\"\u003ewww.moderncrusaders.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003einstagram: @sera_ferron\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

For the last four years I\u0027ve been using a hand-me-down that has done a very resilient job, but now it\u0027s time to upgrade so that I feel as though I have a reason to ask for other models time. I want to create the visions that I have in my head. I want to help showcase another models soul. Help me bring to life some photographic magic!",
