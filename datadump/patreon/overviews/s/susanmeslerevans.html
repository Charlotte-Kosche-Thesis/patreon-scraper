As the title of my blog implies, I am a writer. I\u2019ve\nbeen making up stories for as long as I can remember, and recently, I\u2019ve\ndecided to against what logical sense and 90% of society tells me, and try to\nmake a living at it. It may surprise you to know that I\u2019m already a published\nauthor \u2013 I\u2019ve published two poems and a short story. Of course, none of these\nendeavors paid very well. In fact, none of them paid at all. But writing is\nwhat I was born to do, and I\u2019m determined to make my way into the publishing\nworld. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am currently in the process of trying to sell my first\nmanuscript, but in the meantime, I will be running a blog,\nsusanmeslerevanswrites.com, where I will be posting book reviews, top 10 lists,\nrants, and a great number of other writing and reading-related content. So, if\nyou\u2019d like to help me get to the point where I can (hopefully) one day update\nthis blurb to say that I have published at least one book, please, please,\nplease consider becoming a patron! Patrons will receive access to polls, bonus\ncontent, and maybe even free books. Even if you can\u2019t contribute, simply\nreading and sharing my work is a huge help to me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to watch this video,\nand especially thanks to those of you that decide to become my patrons.\nHopefully, with your help, I\u2019ll be able to become one of those lucky few\nfull-time writers. \u003cbr\u003e"
