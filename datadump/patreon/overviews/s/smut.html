To my surprise, it got a huge response, with dozens of people friending me to find out more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after, my website - \u003ca href=\"http://www.lessonsinsmut.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.lessonsinsmut.com\u003c/a\u003e - was launched. This is a Patreon for people who have found that website useful, and just want to say \"thanks\" (or get opinions on their work, suggest topics for me to write about, or - if my site has really helped - say \u003cstrong\u003esuper\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0thanks).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a huge fan of the crowdfunding model - a significant chunk of my income comes from my erotica campaign (\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/pan\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/pan\u003c/a\u003e) and so rather than write an ebook about how to write ebooks or hide the information behind a paywall, I\u0027d rather put it all online for free, and let people support the site through Patreon if they\u0027re able/interested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign is per \u003cstrong\u003eupdate\u003c/strong\u003e, because my schedule is sporadic at best. I will likely update once every week or two, so if you want to set a monthly cap (in case I update four times in a month) that\u0027s something Patreon easily allows you to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, or there\u0027s something you\u0027d like to see on this campaign that doesn\u0027t yet exist, please let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
