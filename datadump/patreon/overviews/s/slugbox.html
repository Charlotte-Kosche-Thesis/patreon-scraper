None of it is really EXCLUSIVE. And if it is, it\u0027s only for a week or two. It\u0027s mostly a good way to support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d rather have MANY people support me a little instead of a few people supporting me a lot. I can make more content to everyone this way. Your cash funds request streams, source files, Cteno updates, and all that good stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll also get to vote in the polls and stuff! Every week I\u0027ll do one nice drawing, with the spicy version posted here before anywhere else. The subject of that weekly drawing is chosen by you guys through suggestions and then a poll!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe used to have goals but they fluctuated WILDLY by hundreds of dollars... and usually once they were met, they were De-met because then people unpledged so... I guess let\u0027s save those for later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much can, or should, I pledge? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s no exclusive rewards for pledging or donating more than someone else! You can pledge one dollar or two dollars or a thousand dollars. Someone please pledge a thousand dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any amount, you get access to the Patreon, which is usually source files for pretty much everything! Commissions aren\u0027t usually included. I don\u0027t really like the idea of having EXCLUSIVE paid content, at least at this point in time. This means I can\u0027t really give a good sales pitch here as far as exclusive rewards... Universal karma is a good reward though! VERY occasionally I\u0027ll have some exclusive stuff, but nothing that isn\u0027t posted everywhere. If it\u0027s exclusive, it\u0027s more like private access request streams and stuff! \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s a FANCY TIP JAR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Pab2hA6.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can I do with the source files?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, you USED to be able to use them as bases, but since that led to mass reposting, you can no longer do that. But honestly, no one of consequence was doing that. You\u0027re still welcome to study them and learn from the layer structure, but no more bases.
