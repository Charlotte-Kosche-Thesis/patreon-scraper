    "summary": "Greetings, and welcome to my Patreon page,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA good story, like anything worthwhile, takes time to create. While you may get all the essentials out in one glorious evening of ink-sloshing, paper-bending, coffee-swilling fun (the plot, the characters, the point, all that jazz), the finer details still need work. You have to edit, and editing always takes more time than the initial piece did (where did that elephant come from? And why is he angry?). As it is, I currently work labor jobs to pay for silly things like housing and food, while I would much rather be creating worlds and plotting the next way to scare my readers \u2013 to make them think, and feel, and stay awake at night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I\u0027ve created this page. I will use all funding to pay for living expenses, gradually cutting back the hours I do at my normal job. If I can make enough, I can turn writing into my full-time job, allowing you more content, and myself some peace of mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would I pay for work I\u0027ve never seen?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that\u0027s a fine point. I will post one story at the end of this, free, gratis, completely available for you to read, and you can judge me on my own merits as a writer. If it isn\u0027t your cup of tea, then I thank you for your time, and wish you well. If you do enjoy it, I hope you will consider becoming a patron of my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo what do I get by becoming a Patron?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eYou get the satisfaction of helping to create literature... Wait! Come back! \u003cbr\u003eAlright, you also gain access to an exclusive feed for patrons only. Therein, I will keep people appraised of what I\u0027m up to, what stories I\u0027ve had come to mind, snippets of story basis\u0027s, random videos and the like. It will also allow you to post comments, pictures, videos, etc. that you would like to share. And that\u0027s just the dollar tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRight, so where\u0027s that story?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eYes, of course. Here you are. I hope you enjoy it. \u003cbr\u003eThis tale is from my first book of collected short stories, entitled \"A Glimpse into Madness\" \u003cbr\u003eIt is titled:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe\nNight the Dolls Came\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe chill winter wind blew from the\neast, trying with all its might to blow away the small town full of tiny,\ntwinkling lights that lay in its path. It shook the windows in their frames in\nSusie\u0027s bedroom. Her young mind conjured up a collection of monsters that were\ntrying, desperately, to break in and gobble her up, then they would go for her\nsisters. Her parents would awaken the next morning and lament not installing\nbetter windows. Another violent gust hit the house, sending tremors through her\ntreasured porcelain doll collection on its high perch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie squirmed lower under her blankets\nand shivered. She watched the shadows dance on the walls and listened to the\nhowls of ghosts long dead coming out of the chimney. Her eldest sister had told\nher all about them last Halloween \u2013 how the house was constructed on an old\ncemetery, and how, try as they might, they could never locate thirteen of the\nbodies. Her mother said the sound was just the wind, but she knew better. After\nall, her sister wouldn\u0027t lie, and parents were always making up lies so as not\nto scare her.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe steeled her nerves and got out\nof bed. Her bladder would not allow her to remain idle any longer, and she\ndared not wet the bed again. It had been months since the last time, and she\ntook it as a point of pride when she awoke in the morning to dry sheets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe got to the bathroom down the\nhall and used the toilet. The seat was cold, which she hated, but she knew that\nif she took too long, a vengeful spirit would emerge from one of the mirrors to\ndrag her off, and her family would never see her again. She finished as quickly\nas she could and avoided looking at any of the mirrors as she washed her hands\nin the moonlight. She caught a glimpse of one mirror, on accident, as she was\nleaving, and could have swore that an old crone was glaring out at her through\nstitched-shut eyes, with her bony arms resting on her decaying hips.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie ran down the hallway and dove\ninto her bed. She burrowed her way from the bottom of her blankets to her\npillow, then crawled around in a circle three times, just as her dog did, to\nget comfortable. It never seemed to work for her. She was just beginning to\nwonder why her dog did it at all when one of her porcelain dolls fell from its\nhigh perch and landed with a crack on the wood floor. Susie started, and stared\nat the fallen doll, watching for any movement. The shadows on the walls\ncontinued to dance, and the windows still shook in their frames, but nothing\nelse stirred. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSlowly, she leaned herself towards\nthe foot of her bed, then crawled to the edge. She stared at the doll intently,\nnot even blinking, like a cat unsure if what it saw was predator or prey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThen the doll slowly lifted its\ncracked head and looked at her, its dead eyes staring as only dolls can. Susie\ntried to scream, but fear had stolen her voice. Instead, she turned and threw\nher blankets over her head, certain that they would protect her. She tried not\nto breathe as she listened to the doll\u0027s tiny footsteps run back and forth in\nthe room. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Su-u-u-sie,\" a small,\nsweet voice called out from the darkness, \"where did you go?\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nChills ran down Susie\u0027s spine. \"Go\naway,\" she said, trying to keep her voice steady. She felt a tug on her\nblanket and immediately regretted saying anything. The doll was on the bed with\nher, walking above the covers, getting closer with every passing second. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Su-u-u-u-sie,\" the doll\ncalled to her. She felt the weight of it on her leg, making small steps up to her\nstomach. \"Su-u-u-u-u-sie.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn a flash, Susie flung the doll off\nof her, throwing her blanket to the foot of her bed with the effort. She reached\ndown and pulled the blanket back over her head as quickly as she could, only\nthen realizing that she never heard the doll land. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe listened for any movement in the\nroom, eyes shut tight, but even after several minutes, she heard nothing. \u003cem\u003eWhat if it\u0027s hanging from the ceiling?\u003c/em\u003e She\nthought of the old brass chandelier that hung in her room, and imagined the\ndoll there \u2013 pictured it staring at her bed with its porcelain smile, frozen\nforever in forced pleasantry. Would it wait for her? \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSlowly, carefully, she pulled the\nblanket from her face. She opened her eyes, and gasped. Before her lay a sea of\npale dolls. Every flat surface of her room was covered in them, and all of them\nwere looking at her, sitting, waiting in menacing silence. She wanted to run,\nbut where could she go? The doll with the cracked head sat on her bed, at her\nfeet. It laughed, cheerfully, and said, \"Susie! There you are! Let\u0027s\nplay!\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd then the moon went out. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere was a rustling in the\ndarkness. The air moved around Susie as she sat, unable to budge. Even in the\nmidst of absolute terror, she felt a solemn guilt when she noticed that she had\nwet the bed, despite her earlier journey. Tears fell hotly down her face, more\nout of shame than out of fear. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd then the moon lit up, and the\ndolls were gone. Along with her shelf, and her toy chest, and her bed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt first she was elated that she had\nnot, in fact, wet the bed but had wet the floor, instead. Then she began to\nwonder where exactly all of her belongings had gone. She looked around her bare\nroom until her eyes fell upon a standing shadow. It was smiling at her through\ndarker lips and a single smokey grey eye. She wished she still had covers to\nhide under. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Don\u0027t be scared,\" said\nthe shadow in the voice of a small boy, no older than she was, \"I chased\nthem away. I couldn\u0027t stop them from taking your things, though.\" His\nvoice was full of sympathy and remorse.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Thank you,\" Susie\nreplied, quietly, and meant it. \"What\u0027s your name?\" she asked. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Jacob,\" replied the\nshadow. The windows rustled and shuddered in their frames. \"A horrible\nnight, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie nodded. \"What happened to\nthe moon just now?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJacob shuffled his shadowed feet and\nlooked at, presumably, the floor. \"That was me. I had to distract them.\nI\u0027m sorry if it scared you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs far as Susie was concerned, if he\nwas sorry, everything was alright. \"What are you?\" she asked, unable\nto resist the question any longer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Just a shadow,\" Jacob\nsaid, and chuckled, \"What else could I be?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"You could be a demon,\"\nSusie replied, sure of herself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"You\u0027ve met the closest thing\nto a demon in these parts. Besides, demons are...pointier.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie conceded with a nod. \"But\nwhere did you come from?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Oh, I\u0027ve always been here. I\nhave to be, there\u0027s nowhere else to go.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie looked at him, curiously.\n\"Are you real?\" she asked, innocently. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Of course I\u0027m real. Are\nyou?\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe glared at him. \"It\u0027s not\npolite to ask someone if they\u0027re real or not,\" she said, as haughtily as\nshe could manage. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"But you asked me first,\"\nthe shadow pleaded. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"That\u0027s different. You\u0027re in my\nroom.\" Susie was sure this was the proper way of doing things. Almost as\nan afterthought, she continued, \"And besides, you\u0027re a boy. It\u0027s okay to\nask boys that kind of thing.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Gosh, I didn\u0027t know that. I\u0027m\nsorry.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie nodded, curtly, certain that\nsome unspoken protocol had been observed. \"Can I hug you?\" she asked.\nJacob seemed to demure. His head fell low, and he started to fidget. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"I don\u0027t think you can,\"\nhe said, finally. \"I\u0027m not all here, you see.\" He shuffled on the\nwall just above the floor, then lifted his head with a jolt, and said\nexcitedly, \"But if you really want to do something for me, you can... that\nis, if you want to, you can...\" he faltered. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"What?\" Susie asked. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"...You could give me a kiss,\"\nthe shadow said, finally. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Is that all?\" Susie\nlaughed, then stood up and walked to the wall that Jacob was splayed against.\nShe stood up on tip-toe to reach, and kissed him on what she assumed to be his\ncheek. Jacob smiled, broadly. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said. His\ntone grew suddenly lower, \"Uh-oh, I\u0027ve got to go. It\u0027ll be dawn soon, and\nthe sun will chase me away.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Don\u0027t be silly. Everyone knows\nthat the dawn only scares away bad things, and you\u0027re not evil, Jacob.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe shadow hung his head once more.\n\"You don\u0027t know that,\" he replied. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Well, you can\u0027t go,\"\nSusie said, \"I forbid it.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"I have to. You don\u0027t\nunderstand... I can\u0027t see the sunlight. Never again.\" Susie could hear the\ntears that Jacob was shedding, even though she couldn\u0027t see them. \"I\u0027m\ndead, Susie.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nA chill crept across Susie\u0027s body as\nhe spoke those words, and the cold pit in her stomach told her that what he\nsaid was true, but she refused to believe any of it. Then she, too, began to\ncry. \"Will you come back?\" she asked. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"I can\u0027t, not for a long time.\nI could only come tonight to save you. It\u0027s just the way things work.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJacob began to fade as the sky\noutside Susie\u0027s window grew lighter. She reached out and tried to hold his\nhand, but all she felt was the cold wall, and when she pulled back, only her\nown shadow remained. \"Goodbye,\" she heard Jacob say from somewhere\nperhaps far away, but it could have been the wind.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie went to the center of her room\nand sat down. \"Don\u0027t go,\" she whispered, sadly, and whatever beings\nthere were who answered the pleas of small children ignored her. She went right\non crying straight through the morning\u0027s twilight. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe sun peeked over the distant\nhills to find her slumped in the middle of her empty bedroom floor. She blinked\nat the rising dawn through red eyes and faded complexion and wondered what kind\nof life it was that would allow the sun to rise after such a night. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe rose and opened her bedroom\ndoor, automatically heading for her parents\u0027 bedroom. On her way she passed the\nbathroom, and once again she saw the old crone in the mirror. She stopped and\nwent inside, still afraid, but no longer caring. The crone twitched her sewn\neyes at her like a short eclipse of cold stone in a cloudy sea from the world\nbehind the glass. \"What\u0027s wrong, girl?\" the crone asked, bluntly. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Jacob went away, and the dolls\ntook my bedroom, and I don\u0027t know what to do,\" Susie let out a sob that\nshook her small body. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"All that?\" the crone\ntsk\u0027d. \"Stop crying, girl. Crying will get you nowhere at all.\" Susie\ndid her best to stop the flow of tears. \"Good,\" the crone continued,\n\"Now, it\u0027s a shame about Jacob, he was a nice boy, but then he\u0027s not\nreally gone, is he?\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know.\nI guess not. I mean, he said he was always here.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"You see?\" The crone\nsmiled, and it was not an evil smile. \"As for your bedroom, you just have\nto tell the dolls that it\u0027s yours, and you want it back.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie blanched. \"But they\u0027re so\nscary! They\u0027ll take me away, I know they will!\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe crone let out a laugh that sounded\nlike sandpaper rhythmically rubbing against wood, and her brittle frame shook.\n\"If they try to take you away, just tell them Mary has claimed you\nalready.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"But... does that mean you\u0027re\ngoing to take me, instead?\" Susie asked, meekly. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Oh yes, in time.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie hung her head in defeat.\nQuietly, she began to sob.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"But not today.\" The crone\nsaid, slyly, then winked at her, and faded away, leaving Susie staring in awe\nat her own reflection.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSusie stood in the hallway for a\nlong time, deciding what to do. She marched back to her bedroom with more\nconfidence than she felt. The dolls were waiting for her there, impervious to\nthe morning light that shown through her window. As a group, all of them turned\ntheir heads to her, with the cracked-headed doll in front.\n\"Su-u-u-u-sie,\" it called in its sweet voice. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"I\u0027d like my room back, please,\"\nSusie said. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe dolls all giggled in unison.\n\"We like it. We\u0027re going to keep it.\" The cracked doll stood up.\n\"We like you, too, Susie.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"You can\u0027t have me, and you can\u0027t\nhave my room,\" Susie said, indignant. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Why?\" the cracked doll\ngiggled. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Because Mary claimed me\nalready.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe dolls looked around at each\nother, their beaded eyes questioning the matter, weighing what might come of\nit. Then, one by one, they all began to vanish in whiffs of white smoke. After\na few moments, only the cracked doll remained. It looked up at Susie, and said,\nsadly, \"We just wanted to play,\" then fell limp to the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs it hit the floor, Susie\u0027s\nfurniture all appeared back in its rightful place, as if it had never left at\nall. Susie smiled and crawled into bed. As exhaustion took her, she wondered if,\none day, she would be taken by the old crone in the mirror, and what kind of world\nit was that she lived in, but, she decided, that was for another day, and\npeacefully fell asleep. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
