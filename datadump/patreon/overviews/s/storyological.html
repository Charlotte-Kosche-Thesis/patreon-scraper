    "summary": "Hello, readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pkddvbi0D-8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting. It means a lot to us that you\u0027re here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe stories that we tell about ourselves matter. So do the stories we tell about stories. Every part of make believe matters. Making believe is the only way we ever give shape to anything of the everything that is or was or might still be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a little bit of the Storyological story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nE.G. Cosh and Chris Kammerud met in 2012 at the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers\u0027 Workshop in San Diego. It was a magical six weeks in which we lived and breathed stories and got lost once on our way to see some fireworks. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter Clarion, we wanted a way to keep that breath of narrative alive in us, so we created this one podcast we call, Storyological.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStoryological is a podcast about stories. In particular, short stories. In particular, any sort of short story that amazes us. Sometimes we talk about stories in Clarkesworld. Sometimes in Granta. Sometimes we talk about comics. Very occasionally we talk about films.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery episode, we discuss how stories work and why they matter and what it is about these particular stories that we love more than anything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne reviewer described our episodes as a \"winning mix of sharp analysis and disarming silliness.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother described our discussions as \"a great combo of intellectually nourishing and unpretentious.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn our second year, we started doing interviews with short story writers, and we\u0027ve been lucky to have an amazing group of people stop by for a chat. People like Sam J. Miller, Amal El-Mohtar, and Carmen Maria Machado, to name a few.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe call these Pocket Interviews. We call them that because pockets are cool and so are interviews.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you value what we do. If you have ever gotten anything out of Storyological, if it has made you laugh or smile or given you hope. If it has provided you with a deeper, or at the very least, a different way of looking at stories, or the world, then please consider supporting our labor of love.\u00a0It\u0027ll give you access to our Patreon-feed in which we\u0027ll keep you up-to-date with what we\u0027re reading and doing and we\u0027ll share some personalized recommended reading if you are so inclined as to ask. Also. You can feel free to comment as to whether or not labor should be spelled with, or without, the letter \u0027u\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you, readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd happy reading.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
