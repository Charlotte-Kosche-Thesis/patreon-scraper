I\u0027m a big fan of using inexpensive or repurposed materials but there are still some necessary consumables involved. I have filmed over 400 videos using an 8 year old point-and-shoot digital camera with basic video capabilities. I DREAM of filming with an actual video camera some day! The support of my Patrons will help me to cover the cost of replacing consumable supplies as well as save for some much needed equipment upgrades. And then there\u0027s groceries for my family, I guess that\u0027s sort of important too :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
