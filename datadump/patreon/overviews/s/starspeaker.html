     "about": "\u0027The Kid Astrologer\u0027 (often simply \u0027The Kid\u0027 by the profession\u0027s celebrities) Auby got her start at age 9; her godmother, a professional astrologer said her chart indicated an innate ability, which many in the field would later attest. Competently reading charts that crossed her path, she yet lacked the means to construct her own, foraying from hobbyist into astrologer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAge 13, (and a tomboy, inspired by none other than her best guy-friend) she found the answers in one of her mother\u0027s (a successful psychologist and psychic) ageing horoscope books written by none other than Arlene Dahl. It boasted a Moon Table, and promised that she now had access to her friend\u0027s Moon sign. Except it ended at 1950, and his birth was in 1982.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t be daunted. Reverse-engineering was something she\u0027d learnt from her inventor / electrical engineer father. Within a short while, she cracked the ostensible code of the lunar cycle across years, hypothesising and then testing her results. Purchasing her first ephemeris from The Constellation Bookstore at European Crossing in Dallas, Texas, she was elated to find she was right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was around this time that she found Sandra Rozhon\u0027s exclusive mailing list Festival, where the industry giants collected to shoot the breeze and talk shoppe. Intrigued by her youth, they helped Auby feel like less of an anomaly and more akin to the prodigy she truly was. They all became her \u0027aunties and uncles\u0027 and she\u0027d feverishly learn from them, along with the occasional fan-girl moment over having the rare chance to study directly under one\u0027s heroes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFestival would go defunct just as soon as Auby began attending college for forensic psychology, and training for the FBI. It would move to its new home on Yahoo! as Conjunction, and she would make the jump, remaining a member. Her own astrological counselling business, Functional Astrology, would launch as she turned 19, but fall into the background as she encountered and partnered with many sceptics, and opponents over the years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough she herself had been a debunker of paranormal phenomena, astrology never fit into that box. It was, in an ever-changing and uncertain world, a strange constant.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow in Los Angeles practising sex therapy for the alternative community, it wouldn\u0027t be until her latter twenties, kicking off her first Saturn Return, that she\u0027d find Linda Goodman\u0027s legacy website, (the biggest and most populated astrology forum on the Internet) and return home. She now co-moderates the Interpersonal Astrology forum there since 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat year would also see her studying with Tameem Saied, one of, if not the top, karmic astrologer, specialising in the twin flame phenomenon. She singularly launched an initiative in Interpersonal Astrology to test his work and developed her own unique method, now The Meletio Method, and exclusive to her.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the successful re-launch of her professional astrological career in late 2016 following a rebranding, she began selectively teaching. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe was no stranger to lecturing large crowds, though. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso as a young teen, she was a regular chat host on AOL\u0027s AstroNET, while a weekly lecturer for the #ProAstrology channel on IRC, attended by hundreds of professionals for instruction upon and introduction to specialty topics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving published for free distribution pamphlets on areas of interest but largely unexplored -- most namely The Vertices Manual in 1994 -- she fast became a top choice and sought after, in spite of her young years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow she enjoys heading her Skipped Step Recovery Programme, available to those who qualify, and preparing for her NCGR accreditation and Evolutionary Astrology certification, though both are formalities at this point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile her go-to remains her exclusive Method, she pulls from her vast almost three decades of experience, to deliver what\u0027s needed to the client. There\u0027s little she doesn\u0027t know in the field, and is delighted to make new discoveries. Hobnobbing and shoppe-talking with other astrologers remains a joy that\u0027s unlikely to dull anytime soon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re looking for a means to contact her for a complimentary consult, do so here. She\u0027ll get back to you.\u003cbr\u003e",
