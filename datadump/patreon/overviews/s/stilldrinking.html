    "summary": "Signing up for anything to promote my blog is a nightmare, because of the \"What is you stuff about?\" question. Strictly speaking, it\u0027s about me. Or whatever I\u0027m thinking about. Or it\u0027s a play with a bunch of jokes only 30-year-old liberal arts majors get. Or a staggeringly boring joke about Vogon programming that only lifelong developers would get if they had the patience to read it. (I\u0027m sorry about that one. I can\u0027t even get through the whole thing, and I adore reading my own work as long as it\u0027s less than a year old. I was particularly drunk that night.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet, for all the random things I write about, as I try to figure out how to be human before I die, a few people dig it. And I would be remiss not to give them new and improved means to transfer their money to me. Really. It\u0027s a service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I promise never to hit the Make Them Pay button more than four times a month. So if I write nothing, you obviously pay nothing, and if I write 200 pieces a week, the most you would pay is $4.00. And let\u0027s be honest: one a month would be more consistent than usual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what every patron gets, assuming I understand this interface: non-credit-card-charging updates with some of the writing that never gets published for good reasons, and excerpts from upcoming books. You also get to follow my slow ascension to mediocre cartoonist as my girlfriend teaches me to use Illustrator. This will happen."

He shows up now and then when I want to show something and am nervous about copyright violations. He\u0027s mostly blank slate for expressions I learn to draw by studying \u003cem\u003eCalvin and Hobbes\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0comics. I will draw him doing or saying whatever you want and send it to you. Bear in mind my obviously limited talent as an artist, and please don\u0027t ask me to draw him doing something that will keep me up at night. I will also, unless you\u0027d prefer otherwise, include your name in a patron list that will go up somewhere on my site in the near future.",
