    "summary": "Hello. I\u0027m Susan Joy Clark. I\u0027m an independent mystery writer and novelist with the beginnings of a mystery comedy series. The first of my \u003cem\u003eJack Donegal Mystery Series\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eAction Men with Silly Putty\u003c/em\u003e, is available on Amazon in both Kindle and print formats. The second in the series, \u003cem\u003eAction Men and the Great Zarelda\u003c/em\u003e, just came out in Kindle format. I also have a short story mystery ebook, \"The Lit Club Mystery,\" for a separate series, \u003cem\u003eThe Grace Darby Series\u003c/em\u003e, available for Kindle. My first book is a YA novel, And the Violin Cried. It is currently out of print, but I hope to republish through Kindle Direct Publishing and CreateSpace.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a blogger with some fiction serials, in both mystery and time travel genres. I do some other fun and creative things in life. I plan to publish my fiction serials as a whole once the stories are complete. I have experience as a puppeteer and write my own material, I sing and do some public speaking, so I may have some other ideas for content to create in other areas, audio versions of my books, puppetry videos, etc. I\u0027ve created a murder mystery party game, three different versions so far, and would like to make those available for sale on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could use some help as there are expenses involved in creating book covers, developing my website, ebook conversions, book formatting and other services I need. Don\u0027t donate if it\u0027s going to put you in the poorhouse, but if you are able, your support will go towards good things. Thank you in advance for your help and support, even in reading this page. :)"
