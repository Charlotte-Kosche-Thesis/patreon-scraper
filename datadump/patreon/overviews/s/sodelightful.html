I am a writer and an artist, a lightchaser and a holder of blank spaces. I make usually-tender, mostly-autobio comics about complexity, community, family, and loss. You can find many of my comics at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sodelightful.com/comics/\"\u003esodelightful.com/comics\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write letters of empowerment at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sodelightful.com/deardaughter/\"\u003eDear Daughter\u003c/a\u003e and more recently weekly letters sharing wisdom at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sodelightful.com/dearbeloved/\"\u003eDear Beloved\u003c/a\u003e. My writing and art necessarily\u00a0spill over into life: they inspire workshops and other ways of \u0027writing on the world.\u0027 The webcomic that seeded all of these letterwriting projects, entitled\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sodelightful.com/comics/beauty/\"\u003e\"On Beauty\"\u003c/a\u003e, won the 2017 Cartoonist Studio Prize for best webcomic and was nominated for an Eisner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to create stories that pull us forward into a more nuanced and compassionate world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sodelightful.com/misc/scribblescribble.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help me make more art! I believe in the power of art and have faith in community-supported art.\u00a0In return for your patronage, you will get stories in your inbox, behind-the-scenes sneak peeks, and an invitation to journey with me through the process. PLUS, your patronage also supports me as a whole artist \u2014 and all of the tangents, experimentation, moodling, and marination that the practice of art requires.

Maybe we\u0027ll have a writing prompt this month, maybe I wanna lead a meditation circle on YouTube, maybe I\u0027ll invite you to a google hangout with some nuns, maybe you\u0027ll get something in the mail, maybe I\u0027ll ask you to hide a lil book for others to find in your neighborhood... maybe I don\u0027t yet know what form this all will take and that\u0027s okay!\u00a0It\u0027s all going to be an emergent experiment, the same way and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sodelightful.com/deardaughter/\"\u003e\"Dear Daughter\"\u003c/a\u003e eventually found form in letterwriting+artmaking workshops and selling beauty magazines at Kiosk Fest -- something I could never have envisioned at the very beginning of the project!
