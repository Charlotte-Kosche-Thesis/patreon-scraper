    "summary": "Hello.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working on SFM ports for over two years, even though most of that time I stayed out of direct spotlight. Nearly all of this was done in collaboration with Red Menace, with us splitting our parts of porting jobs. It goes without saying he\u0027s one of the best modelers out there and he was the person who got me into porting in the first place. What personally fascinated me the most in this community, both among poster makers and animators on one side, and modeles and texture artists on another was how they managed to elevate objectively extremely outdated Source technology into something that goes way beyond its age and technical limitations, with results truly captivating and standing on their own. Even if they completely mishandled and abandoned their child, Valve deserves the respect for opening up a creative sandbox for people who\u0027d never get into modeling, posing or animation otherwise (including yours truly). I wanted to contribute to that too, and, after long and troubled journey, our collaboration with Red Menace brought some of the most advanced, content- and feature rich Source engine ports. Unfortunately, everything comes at a price. Maintaining quality and feature set significantly increased amount of time and effort needed to produce models to the extent it became comparable to part-time job. General financial situation got tougher too\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt came down to a few available choices for me: dropping quality and quantity bar, massively slowing down or ditching porting altogether. This is where you support would be extremely useful. Not only it would help offset actual costs of porting process, but also provide a great incentive to keep long term projects alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I should stress one thing: this is \u003cstrong\u003eNOT\u003c/strong\u003e a sales pitch. There will be \u003cstrong\u003eNO\u003c/strong\u003e explicit or hidden paywalls when it comes to actual models, no exclusivity windows or intentional downgrades. It\u0027s crowdfunding in its most pure form - supporting the creator whose output you find worth your money. The precise sum doesn\u0027t matter that much compared to the fact that if no one finds the work worth of spending even a few dollars on, there is no real point in continuing given how much time it takes to produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinks to currently released models:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNSFW:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mrsmugbastard.tumblr.com/models\"\u003ehttps://mrsmugbastard.tumblr.com/models\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSFW:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027986401/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1840\u0026amp;p=1\"\u003ehttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027986...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027ll try to address the most obvious questions you might have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you and what\u0027s your story?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy real name is not important, as the moniker is much more catchy anyway. I do not have any professional background in modeling, texturing or animation. In fact I got into SFM thing pretty much by accident, GabeN be praised. It was late 2013, news about Bioshock SFM porn was all the rage. Me and several buddies installed SFM to check what\u0027s it all about. They dropped it quickly but I got hooked. The first year was a bunch of really shameful posters and animations I demonstrated only to friends, as the world was not yet ready. Sadly, it was also a disappointment, as my Max Payne project simply fell apart since neither engine capabilities or moreso my skills were good enough to do it justice it deserved. I started tumblr blog and released several NSFW animations but it never really felt like something I wanted keep doing for a long time. Around summer 2015 Red Menace asked me to assist with extracting stuff from GTAV. Thus our first mutual project - Yellow Submarine - was completed and our porting partnership started which lasts to this day. Over time it branched out into NSFW side of things too as I helped with moving projects to DAZ Genesis 3 body. As time passed my sphere of work expanded massively. In addition to extracting and ripping models from games it now includes building models in DAZ, general texture work, 3D painting, setting up complex materials, implementing more advanced engine gimmicks like fake PBR or subsurface scattering, testing, minor Blender work and, in general, pushing limits of this weird piece of engine technology that somehow combines some of the most advanced and innovative tech available at the time it was being developed with archaic limitations that go back to its Quake roots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my benefits as a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur sincere gratitude. On top of that there is a reward tier for people who believe in this project enough to pledge above minimum amount. We should be honest here, it relies largely on your faith and goodwill, as you\u0027ll not get any exclusive privileges on actual modeling side. Keep that in mind to avoid any confusion.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want early access to models. Do I need to pony up cash if I want to be a tester?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. Testers are selected based on merit and we don\u0027t need that many of them. Of course you can still donate~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it for NSFW or SFW?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth. Even if your interest lies squarely in the former you can\u0027t really film your favorite waifu in vacuum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u0027s getting the money? Both you and Red Menace or just you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo clear any possible ambiguities here: they\u0027ll be used to fuel the common hobby, but I\u0027ll be the direct recipient. It\u0027s being done this way on mutual consent, and for variety of reasons, primary being the fact for the two years we\u0027ve been working on projects together it was I who paid the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily, covering operating costs: purchasing games to extract stuff from, DAZ content, software, if needed, hardware upgrades. Of course it\u0027d be nice if some surplus is left after that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am not a SFM user. What\u0027s my gain?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will not offer any direct benefits to you, but these models are used by both already established artists and those who are only gaining in popularity. In most cases, there aren\u0027t any alternatives of comparable quality, in some - none at all. Keeping this afloat will increase options available to artists, and, ultimately, to viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0027t/don\u0027t want to back this. Will I have to wait more?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope. Model releases will happen the same way they used to: public, free of charge, with all content included. The patrons will have benefit of more in depth updates on current state of projects and more direct line of communication, but as far as actual content goes it will be absolute parity. Of course, if everyone shares the same mentality in the end there will be much fewer or no releases at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this wraps it up, I think. Whatever your decision is, thank you for reading this."
