    "summary": "I\u2019m Imani and I do fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot just any kind either. I pride myself on writing contemporary fiction, that means real people, real life, and real situations all set up in a thought up world and, more often than not, featuring people of color. My intentions are to entertain, educate, perplex, shock, and last but not least, traumatize my readers. Penning strong-minded, misunderstood, sarcastic, sensitive, very flawed and complex characters who are black, brown, and every color in between (my completed serial fiction\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blackheartsfiction.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Hearts\u003c/a\u003e is an excellent example of my style). Finding what I want to read has always been an issue, so I have decided to create it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support of me on Patreon will help me and all of these imaginary people fighting for space in my head. They want to be immortalized. They want to tell your their story and it would help if their creator (that\u2019s me) had the funds to bring them to you because let\u0027s face it, writing is free, but publishing costs. We\u2019re talking editing, formatting, cover art...the list goes on. Your support would assist me in funding that and other writing endeavors. In the future, all of my patron\u0027s will have access to my finished work in full for free. That\u2019s right folks, no matter what amount you pledge per month, you will get anything I complete with my compliments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging at various levels will give you access to the things I write until then. That means what I write, you get as I write it. You can expect chapters of my work, drafts, my thoughts, and anything else I find shareable. As a patron of my Patreon all of this will be exclusive to you, and only you. In addition to that, rewards will be available when goals are met. In addition to all of that Patreon is a way for us to engage. Want to ask me a question? Go for it. Have an idea? Spill it. Need to get something off your chest? I\u0027m here for it. You\u0027re my audience and I want to know you.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo think about it, okay?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your time, consideration, and pledges. Every dollar counts and I appreciate every one of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow me on:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shedoesfiction.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52968889-i-a-sutton\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoodreads\u003c/a\u003e /\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shedoesfiction.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e /\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/shedoesfiction\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e /\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/shedoesfiction/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePintrest\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
