    "summary": "Hi all, my name is Ed Bourelle. I hope you will join me on this journey to delve into \u003cem\u003eThe Vault of Kvasir\u003c/em\u003e, a subterranean RPG micro-setting that takes you from an abandoned dwarven mine-hold into the depths of the earth. Below the surface we will explore the warrens of a savage tribe trying to resurrect their prehistoric animal-god, a kingdom of vile gnomes and their aberrant arcana, a great underground lake ruled by the undead, and so much more. In the end, we will unlock the secret of the vault hidden within. If I had to guess, depending on patronage, it will take me about 18 months to develop this setting and after that who knows; maybe we\u0027ll tackle the surface world as well. Written material will be a combination of descriptive world content and rules which will be compatible with 5th Edition play. Much of the development will be visual, delivered as \u003cem\u003eAdventure Tiles\u003c/em\u003e, maps, scrolls and documents, illustrations, and whatever else I can come up with. I also plan to run a campaign in this setting as I develop it so there will lots of notes from that which will detail the story I am telling. Influences for this setting include Vikings (TV), Norse mythology, The 13th Warrior (film), The Descent (film), Game of Thrones (books and TV), and the book \u003cem\u003eDungeons of Doom\u003c/em\u003e which I created for Green Ronin Publishing in 2006.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR:\u003c/strong\u003e Hi, I\u0027m Ed. Join me as I create my Viking/Underdark campaign setting and get some cool rewards along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0dWQ4wy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me and SkeletonKey Games:\u003c/strong\u003e I formed SkeletonKey Games in 2001 to bring detailed miniatures-scale maps, called \u003cem\u003eAdventure Tiles\u003c/em\u003e, to tabletop RPGs. For more than seven years I produced \u003cem\u003eAdventure Tiles\u003c/em\u003e while working as a freelance cartographer, illustrator, and writer for tabletop game companies of all types. Among my clients at that time were Fantasy Flight Games, White Wolf Publishing, Malhavoc Press, Necromancer Games, and Privateer Press. In 2009 I joined Privateer Press full-time where I proudly served for 8 years as creative director on amazing games like WARMACHINE, HORDES, Iron Kingdoms, Level 7, and Zombies Keep Out. During that time SkeletonKey Games became much less of my focus and while I loved my day job and the awesome team I worked with, the itch to return to my own creations was always there. In February of 2017 I returned to my self-employed roots and am in the process of building up SkeletonKey Games once more. \u003cbr\u003e"
