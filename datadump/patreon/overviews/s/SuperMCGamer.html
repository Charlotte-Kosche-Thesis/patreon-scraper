I\u2019m MC, the co-founder and director of a charity marathon known as Zeldathon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the marathons, a group of gamers worldwide come together to celebrate The Legend of Zelda video game series. While we play, we ask viewers to make a contribution to a great charity. Since its inception, The Zeldathon Team has raised over $1.6 million for amazing causes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the years, I\u2019ve learned a lot about production, both recorded and live. This knowledge has been applied to my content I create outside Zeldathon, eventually helping me secure a contracted position at the non-profit Direct Relief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Patreon, you are able to pledge a monthly payment to creators you enjoy. This allows them to pay their bills, live their lives, and devote more time into making content you want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere in 2017, advertising and corporate sponsorship are not ideal methods of making a living. Patreon makes income predictable, and prevents the need for click fishing and advertising out random brands. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s about making sure that viewers get to ensure the stuff they like to watch is able to be made. No compromises, no back room deals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s the money used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough helping Zeldathon grow through the years, I put forward a lot of my personal funds to buy equipment, secure advertising, venue costs and more. Starting now, any Patreon money is used to help pay off debts, ensure I can pay my rent, and attend events where I can speak to YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, I\u2019m super thankful for every single person who enjoys content I help create. Whether it is Zeldathon, my livestreams or any of my other various projects, I appreciate you being part of my journey! Much love always."
