You probably figured that out, given that you\u0027re reading this on Patreon, but I figured that a little bit of clarity could only help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should introduce myself. I\u0027m Seann, and this is the part where I beg you for money. Pledge to my Patreon and help me fulfill my dreams of being a writer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://seannwritesstuff.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/paperbannerwhoisseann.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe, uh, we just went over this. I\u0027m Seann. This is my Patreon. You want something more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright. I am in my mid-twenties, I work low-level jobs, and I have a Bachelor\u0027s degree in English. I also love writing. For my whole life, I\u0027ve been writing little stories and books. When I was little, before I even knew how to write, I\u0027d staple little booklets together and draw pictures in them and then dictate the story to my parents for them to write in it. That is how the Sci-Fi epic known as \"The Last Dinosaur Fighter\" came to be. One day, perhaps, I shall remake that classic tale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I got older, I branched out and flexed my writing muscles a bit. During my early college years, I helped found a shared horror universe called the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thefearmythos.wikia.com/wiki/The_Fear_Mythos_Wiki\"\u003eFear Mythos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. During that time, I wrote under the username \"LizardBite,\" and if you\u0027re curious about my Fear Mythos work, you can check it out\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://thefearmythos.wikia.com/wiki/Lizard_Bite\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Fair warning: I\u0027ve grown, both as a writer and a person since then, and there are certain details in those stories that I look back on with embarrassment. Also, since that\u0027s a wiki link, you may run into spoilers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I became just another guy with an English degree stuck in a low-paying job. I\u0027ve been working two jobs for some time now, and my main creative outlet has been my YouTube channel. But after some time, I realized that I needed to get back into writing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith me asking for money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://seannwritesstuff.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/paperbannerwhatdoesthissupport.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon supports my creative endeavors.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6Y36VRYw7I83aOdqbQvEw\"\u003eMy YouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is where I post various silly videos and a slightly more serious series of videos called \"GothLit,\" which is about Gothic Literature. I talk about spooky Victorian books and it\u0027s cool and stuff and you should watch it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently, I\u0027ve been writing books and publishing them on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/author/seannbarbour\"\u003eAmazon Kindle\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. These include novellas like my \u003cem\u003eWe Walk the Night\u003c/em\u003e series (an urban fantasy series about vampire hunters and the vampires they hunt) and full-length stuff like \u003cem\u003eJamie Christmas\u003c/em\u003e (a satirical holiday novel about a goth elf who gets kicked out of the North Pole).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then there\u0027s my WordPress blog,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://seannwritesstuff.wordpress.com\"\u003eSeann Writes Stuff\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.

I also plan to post chapters of free web serial novels here, starting with \u003cem\u003eGladia!\u003c/em\u003e, a Light Novel inspired Fantasy story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this, and any other works I decide to start working on, will be supported by contributions on this here Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://seannwritesstuff.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/paperbannerbutwhatdoiget.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get?

You get stuff. All patrons get access to patron-exclusive posts. These include exclusive previews of upcoming books and exclusive polls about upcoming projects.
