I had been inspired by other bloggers writing about gaming one-on-one with their spouses, and so \u003cem\u003eThe Solo GPC\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started out as fairly straightforward records of game-play quickly morphed into more extended narratives, and I was surprised by the positive response this change engendered. Over the course of writing these reports, I\u0027ve heard from several readers who have told me that the Solo GPC posts were the reason they were now playing \u003cstrong\u003ePendragon\u003c/strong\u003e, and that they used my reports as touchstones and guidelines for their own GPC campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs longtime readers of the series know, my rate of posting has dropped off significantly over the past couple years. This has nothing to do with lack of interest, but rather the need to prioritize paying work over vanity projects. But with Patreon, we can now make the Solo GPC pay, and bring it back to the top of the priority list!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also want to give something back: if I manage to raise some money through this crazy venture, I want to use at least some of it to produce a high-quality PDF omnibus of the series, collecting all the posts together in one massive file. The money would go towards hiring someone experienced with layout and design and (if I get enough money) one or more artists commissioned to produce original illustrations. The more money I raise, the more lavishly illustrated the end result will be. Once the PDF is finished, it will be posted online for free in perpetuity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summation, by funding this campaign, you\u0027ll be ensuring that the remaining entries get written a lot faster than they would otherwise, and that the end result will be a lovely gaming artifact that can go on inspiring other gamers for years to come."
