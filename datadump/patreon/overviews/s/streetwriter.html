    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page. My name is Noe, online I\u0027m known as BigMex. You may have seen my work on the old 1UP gaming community or you may have seen my blogs on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.capcom-unity.com/bigmex\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCapcom-Unity\u003c/a\u003e where I have been writing for almost a decade.  I love fighting games, I\u0027m passionate about them. They were a big part of my life growing up. I spent a lot of time in the arcade where I saw the genre rise and fall. I made a lot of friends thanks to fighting games and the fighting game community. I was even the best man at a wedding for a friend that I initially met while playing Street Fighter II! Like many of you there are plenty of reasons why I became a fan. As I got older I began to write down why those games were important to me. After years of blogging my friends convinced me to start a podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.noe-v.com/images/articles/patreon_cameo01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/noe-v-123057468\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Street Writer, the Word Warrior podcast\u003c/a\u003e in 2016. There are plenty of excellent writers and podcasters out there.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gootecks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGootecks\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatMikeRossGuy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMike Ross\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Miles923\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaximilian Dood\u003c/a\u003e and others do a great job breaking down the mechanics of fighting games, explaining the history of the franchises. They highlight the techniques and strategies that make people winners. They make the games more accessible to audiences, especially those that don\u0027t know where to begin. They give insight to veteran players and best of all they make the matches exciting to watch. My videos will be a little bit different. I will do some play-throughs, I will do some live streaming but when I\u0027m taking things apart these podcasts and videos will be a little slower paced. This is where you come in. I am asking you to consider sponsoring me on Patreon. A sponsorship can be as little as $1 a month and it would help me reach my goals. For those that are willing to donate more I have created some Rewards, you can read about them on the full site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.noe-v.com/images/articles/patreon_cameo02.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo how will the Street Writer podcast grow? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. I am going to Edit and Adapt many of my previous blogs into podcasts. I\u0027ll talk about the actual people that some of your favorite fighting game characters are based on. How the martial arts spread around the world and how each culture changed them. We\u0027ll look at how martial arts cinema, comic books and cartoons inspired fighting games. I\u0027ll explore how male, female, disabled and minority characters shaped the genre. How Chinese, Korean and independent developers changed the industry. I\u0027ll even shed some light on lesser-known artists, designers and games that you should know about. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. To help produce these podcasts I need help paying for the equipment. My computer is almost eight years old, my editing software was built-in and my microphone was inexpensive. I\u0027d like to get a better microphone, some decent software and a new computer. This will lead to higher quality recordings and speed up the process a little. My Patrons would help me upgrade my equipment. Your sponsorship can help with any maintenance costs and website support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.noe-v.com/images/articles/representation/soeno_concept.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3. In the future of I would like to create video podcasts. I want to create entirely new video and audio content for my blog. I\u0027d like to do interviews, talk about game releases, cover events and previews. I want to take suggestions from my listeners and turn those into blogs and podcasts as well. I want to cover some tournaments and of course have a guest podcaster if not a permanent co-host for the Street Writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.noe-v.com/images/articles/patreon_cameo03.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI know none of this happens overnight. I will produce as many podcasts as I can with the equipment I have. I will share them with the community for free. No pay walls planned here! I hope to build the trust of my listeners so that they might consider becoming Patrons as well. This is a one-man operation, each blog, each recording, and sometimes the accompanying illustrations are a labor of love. They take time to create and depending on what I\u0027m covering they may take a few weeks or a few months to produce. This is why I don\u0027t want to promise a weekly series and fail to deliver. What I can promise is that they will get done whether or not I have a sponsor (but of course I\u0027d rather have some Patrons). I\u0027d like to thank the people that have been following me all these years and have pushed me to take up this new format. I hope to make you proud. For those that are interested\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/noe-v-123057468\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eplease download and listen to a few of my Street Writer podcasts\u003c/a\u003e. Hopefully they will convince you to become a Patron as well. Thank you for your time.\u003cbr\u003e"

A focus on fighting games, fight culture, art and history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been jumping in and out of game writing since the mid \u002790s where I did most of my writing for PlanetTonyHawk.com. I covered the E3, X Games and wrote lengthy development features for Neversoft Entertainment regarding the Tony Hawk\u0027s Pro Skater game series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2005 I started blogging on the 1UP community site. Over the next 8 years I created 2000 entries in my weekday blog and earned more than 2 millions views. I took a short break and started a new blog dedicated to fighting games. I love gaming as a whole but especially fighting, racing and arcade games. I\u0027m also a Disney fan and toy snob. I spoke once about the Urban Vinyl movement at the Game Developers Conference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had some odd jobs including packing Apple monitors, working on an oil platform and even with Mission Support at JPL.
