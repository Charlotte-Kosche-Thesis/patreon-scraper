    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u2019m Manuel!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m a film graduate from CSU \u2013 \nFullerton, but I\u0027ve always been making comics. Comics have been a huge \npart of my life since I could remember and making them has been even \nmore important. I love making them but with a job, I\u0027m often left tired in my spare time. Having patrons will inspire me to make more art since I\u0027ll know I have an audience who enjoys my stuff. I already set time aside to make art, but having a patron will help me be able to make some extra income as well. Which is a great help to anyone. By becoming a patron you\u2019ll be helping me pay off my \nliving expenses (such as rent, bills or car payments). It will \nalso help me make my monthly student loan payments and hopefully fund my\n art endeavors. I hope that as time goes on, and with a big enough following, I can fully dive into the art world. I do hope on fully self publishing a book one day but I\u0027m definitely gonna need help to get there. So join me on my journey to that goal! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your patronage will allow me to do:\u003c/strong\u003e\n I currently work part-time so most of that money goes to paying my \nexpenses. With extra income coming in from doing art work, I can devote \nmore time to doing said art work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we\u2019re paying, what does this mean for other people? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll\n always be uploading content to my instagram and tumblr, but patrons \nwill gain access to exclusive content - regular folks won\u0027t. Still, I \ntry to share as much as I can with everyone. Mostly, becoming my patron \nwill help drive me to do better knowing people are supporting me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMilestone Goals: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuggestions are always welcome! \u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ve already decided on doing livestreams and exclusive artwork but I\u0027m all ears for anything that can help me make a better patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\n It will be difficult to do individual rewards (perhaps eventually) but I\n hope the rewards I\u2019m dishing out are nice enough for the people who \nsubscribe.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eI cannot thank you enough for supporting me! It means the world to know there are people who like the stuff I make.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
