    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the SnapCasters\u0027 Patreon Page! Kory Fox here: I\u0027m the creator of the popular cardboard Magic: The Gathering stream, The SnapCasters, where it\u0027s our goal to travel the world (well, mostly the east coast of the USA) in search of eternal formats to provide coverage for! We are mostly providing Legacy coverage at this time, as it is my favorite format and criminally underrepresented in comparison to it\u0027s activity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich leads me to why we\u0027re here: Currently, I\u0027m relying on viewer\u0027s donations to support the stream via a donation button on twitch. While many viewers have been very generous in donating for new equipment for the stream, it is getting harder and harder to maintain our operation to the highest of standards for our wonderful audience. This is where Patreon comes in. Your monthly donation will fuel all the future content of this stream and help improve the quality and features as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals I have in sight for what I want the SnapCasters to be capable of are HUGE, and you can play as big of a part of it as you choose. I\u0027ve set up multiple reward tiers to help you decide, each come with access to our private discord server where you can follow my progress step-by-step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as the stream goes, I want to get back to 3 nights a week and streaming weekends when there are events I can travel to and provide coverage. Your donation will help me substantially for keeping to this schedule. I\u0027ve been undergoing lots of schedule changes at work, and it has never been harder for me to keep a regular streaming schedule currently. Knowing you have my back will make me work that much harder on providing the coverage you want! I run this stream as a labor of love, so you can rest assured 100% of your pledges will go to supporting the stream. New hardware, software, features, and formats are all available to us! This is just the beginning of the people\u0027s channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your continued support. I\u0027ll do everything I can in my power to make sure we provide only the best coverage of our favorite card games to every planeswalker of the multiverse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
