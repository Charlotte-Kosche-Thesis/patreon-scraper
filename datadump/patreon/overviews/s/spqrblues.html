     "description": "I look forward to drawing in the art space at Carmine Street Comics every Friday, not just for the great camaraderie, but also because I get to use their drawing table. If I have a month with four comics at this goal, I\u0027ll invest in a drawing table for home and stop drawing in my lap while slouched on the couch. I\u0027ll use this new setup to draw extra art, of course! How about a fourth installment of the story on the weekend? I\u0027ve never had a drawing table of my own, and I think it\u0027ll make a big difference. I\u0027m thinking it\u0027ll also help with eyestrain and the hand/elbow/arm troubles that are creeping back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://spqrblues.com/IV/images/lapdrawing.png\"\u003e",

     "description": "This would be the ultimate pipe dream. If at least 10 comics per month receive this full pledge amount, I would be able to devote myself full-time on art and writing, and not have to put the art aside to take on freelance editing projects with crazy ravenous deadlines. It\u0027s a dream, but it would be crazy cool.\u003cbr\u003e",
