    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHey there, my name is Bri, however most of you know me as Silvixen or Kita. Since the beginning of 2016 I have been working as a full time freelance illustrator within the furry community and have been enjoying it immensely. I absolutely love bringing the characters of others to life before their eyes and I hope to do this for years to come. In addition I would also like to branch out further into wildlife illustration and other animal related artwork for the general community in the coming years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI currently work from my home in country Victoria (Australia) where I live with my boyfriend, two cats and a dog. I particularly enjoy upgrading my studio and expanding my work space so I can rely more on my own resources for things like traditional drawing and digital printing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your support means to me...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe vast majority of my artwork over the last few years have been primarily commissions. Now that I am full time that has become the case to an even greater degree as I need commissions to support every financial aspect of my life. As most people have noticed, this has left very little time, if any, to work on my own projects, personal characters and just general artwork for my own enjoyment. Support for my work here will provide me with additional funds and thus additional time to spend on my own work. I\u0027ll be able to develop craft and modelling skills, traditional media skills, study anatomy and art theories further to improve my work and experiment with different styles more often. This will not only provide myself with a professional breather every now and again but will also improve the work I do for others in the long run.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn addition it will make sure that even if the \u0027starving artist\u0027 stereotype kicks in and I begin to struggle within my career at certain points, I\u0027ll have a guaranteed source of support and motivation to keep going. But we hope it won\u0027t ever come to that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I can give you in return...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHave a sneaky peek at the rewards list to the right. I\u0027m offering perks such as free sketches, early access to time lapse videos, discounts and much much more. Choose the reward that suits you best. I also hope to offer additional rewards at special occasions and when I reach new goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA huge thanks to everyone who thinks my work is worth additional support and thanks to all my clients past and future for carrying me through my career. Here\u0027s to the years ahead!"
