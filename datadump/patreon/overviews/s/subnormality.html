    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, and thank you for visiting Subnormality\u0027s Patreon page! \u003c/strong\u003eFor those of you unfamiliar with Patreon (\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003eFAQ here\u003c/a\u003e), it\u0027s a crowdfunding site in which one is able to donate money to allow an artist to create something, and it\u0027s distinct from other crowdfunding sites in that its purpose is to allow an audience to fund an ongoing and already established project. To be honest, this is the kind of site that internet projects such as webcomics have always needed, reliant as we are on a niche audience, and in fact Patreon is now the main source of income for numerous webcomics,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ZachWeinersmith\"\u003eincluding many of the biggest names of all\u003c/a\u003e. Moreover, I think the appeal of this funding method is that you get to be as personally responsible for the ongoing existence of an artist\u0027s work as it is possible to be. I will be be very enthusiastically supporting a number of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/claycomix\"\u003ePatreon campaigns\u00a0\u003c/a\u003emyself because I myself am of course in a number of audiences, and I will be extraordinarily honored if you would consider being responsible for me being able to make more comics as well-- and more of them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.viruscomix.com/weirdauthor.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis a medium that has always been a tough grind financially\u2014as has been the Arts in general of late, unfortunately\u2014and Subnormality has always been something I\u0027ve enabled myself to do by paying the rent with Other Stuff\u2014at one time a day job, and more recently I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to be able to replace that with freelance artistic work and, best of all, my work for Cracked.com. However, as one gets older and, crucially, as the comix one wants to make get longer, the necessary time commitment has increasingly become something that\u0027s less sustainable under present circumstances. My interests lie in continuing to tell longer stories that damn well take full advantage of what i believe is an art form fully equal to any other in terms of storytelling and its ability to convey what it\u0027s like to be a human being, but doing that of course means doing less of the things that i currently do to cover my expenses (ie: commissions, books, etc). I\u0027m lucky beyond words that there have always been people who send donations after a new comic goes up\u2014you know who you are, and please know that your contributions have been reason #1 why the comix have continued to exist\u2014so i\u0027m now launching this Patreon campaign as attempt to make such donations both easier to give and easier to reward. If you\u0027ve always wanted to donate but didn\u0027t think you could afford a meaningful amount, well please be assured that a pledge of just $1.00 will mean everything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.viruscomix.com/processcrowd.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon makes donating automatic, and it also ensures that you will only be charged AFTER what you\u0027re funding has been created\u2014 that is, the money you pledge to give per comic will only be received by me once a comic is actually finished and posted online, which I think is really important. And you\u0027ll also get some Bonus Stuff in return! For a donation of $5.00 or more per comic you\u0027ll get access to Subnormality\u0027s Patreon content feed, where I\u0027ll be posting various extra material for y\u0027all to see\u2014unpublished things, b-sides, making-of stuff, and more (and I haven\u0027t listed any official reward tiers higher than $5.00, but be assured that the most generous donors WILL be hearing from me...). You\u0027ll also get to read future Subnormality comix before they go up on viruscomix.com, just as another way to say thanks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.viruscomix.com/itscalledgratitude.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd while I have you here, I do want to take the opportunity to say Thanks. I am unbelievably grateful to all of you for your comments and emails and profoundly generous donations over the past eight or so years, so thank you for allowing me to try and make the kind of comics that I hope take advantage of the medium and show what it can do, thank you for sharing my work online and in person, and thank you for an ongoing experience that has literally brought purpose to my life. In putting my words out there I have heard from so many of you and as a result felt a lot less alone. I needed that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, it\u0027s an honor just to talk to you, so thank you for listening and for considering funding Subnormality via Patreon\u2014your support would make an enormous difference. And thanks for plowing through yet another needlessly massive wall of text. It won\u0027t be the last, I promise...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003equite sincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWinston Rowntree\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.viruscomix.com/d-d-d-dreams2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
