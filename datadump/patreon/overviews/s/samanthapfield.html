For the past two and a half years I\u0027ve run a blog called \u003cem\u003eDefeating the Dragons\u003c/em\u003e, based on Neil Gaiman\u0027s paraphrase of a G.K. Chesterton quote: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\"Fairy tales are true, not because they tell us that dragons exist;\u003cbr\u003e\nbut because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that time, I\u0027ve covered a lot of ground; I\u0027ve talked about \u003ca href=\"https://defeatingthedragons.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/pants/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewearing jeans for the first time\u003c/a\u003e since I was nine, \u003ca href=\"https://defeatingthedragons.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/fun-and-learning-to-have-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewatching Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u003c/a\u003e even though I was still half-convinced it would condemn my soul to hellfire-- and I\u0027ve also talked about more serious things, like the abusive relationship \u003ca href=\"https://defeatingthedragons.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/51/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI couldn\u0027t leave\u003c/a\u003e because my religion said his abuse had made me worthless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, I\n write about what it\u0027s like to be an ex-Christian fundamentalist \nhomeschool graduate who figured out she\u0027s bisexual and also turned into \nan intersectional feminist fascinated by liberal theology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most valuable part of blogging, though, has always been the \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity\u003c/strong\u003e surrounding my work. I\u0027ve done my best to create a safe space for survivors, for dialog, for education, and the people who come to read my words and then share their ideas are the best part about my job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. Becoming a patron will allow me to: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ekeep my best ideas and writing on my blog, instead of pitching it to other places\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehelp me keep control of my writing and how it\u0027s presented\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eself-host my blog\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eallow me to take opportunities that don\u0027t pay, like interviews\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etravel to conferences where I can share what I learn with Patrons\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI couldn\u0027t have come this far without you. I hope you will consider becoming an even more significant part of this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
