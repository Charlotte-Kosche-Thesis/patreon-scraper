The above video is a nice recap of who we are and what the series is about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Survival Guy is a comedic, narrative-based educational series set within the zombie apocalypse. \u0027What the hell is that?\u0027 you may be asking. Narrative-based education is a fusing of storytelling and how-to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning of an episode, the host Austin will update viewers on where he\u0027s at in his journey, fight some zombies, or meet new friends. Once the coast is clear, Austin will teach viewers a fun and simple lesson accented with humor and flashy graphics. Austin teaches urban survival, camping, and outdoor techniques that viewers can actually use. Viewers laugh, learn something new, and remain non-zoms!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kMybdOu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDirector Chris R Wilson\u0027s YouTube channel (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ganglebotfilms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGanglebot\u003c/a\u003e) showcases a bunch of high-quality short films, several of which have received mainstream press and millions of views. The content sets itself apart from the plethora of cat and sloth videos with its high-end quality and kickass visual effects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen possible, we use talented industry professionals from shows like Grimm and Portlandia to really elevate the quality up past typical YouTube content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/eeLykG9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFilm production is expensive and we\u0027re not wealthy people. In the past, we\u0027ve scrapped together projects using any extra cash we had, but we\u0027re at a point where it\u0027s hard to be the sole contributors. We want to continue making entertaining and high-quality content, so we\u0027re turning to the viewers for help. We think this series is a lot of fun and has great potential in finding a large audience. We create content for our own enjoyment, not for the money, so donations go the hardworking people we bring on board, not our own pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we have the first season of Survival Guy already on YouTube (check it out below)! We\u0027re looking to continue into Season 2, upping the quality and ballsiness as we trudge along!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oR8D1fv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to create one or two episodes per month. Projects like this take time, especially when there\u0027s visual effects involved, plus \u0027we\u0027 are a one man team, so times may vary... but we want to make sure we\u0027re getting stuff out to viewers as quickly as possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s important to note that we\u0027ll be shooting some of the first episodes out of order, so we won\u0027t launch the new season immediately after shooting. It may take up to three months to launch, but Patrons will be able to get a behind the scenes look at what we\u0027re doing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/t2cnP6Q.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7X6IEXbNZ3M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j4ZOkzRlW20?list=PLFoCt2gGd6xq-jsOudI252vS_X8fiBPgC\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPrtQ9AdoM0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6z2k63niPA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
