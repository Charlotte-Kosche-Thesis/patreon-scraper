As smoking is further pushed beyond the limits of social acceptability, smoking culture is under threat. We believe that there is a gallows humour and joyful hedonism common to smokers that is being lost. We are a platform for smokers like you. We are the magazine equivalent of a palace in which you can smoke. So come on in and light up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first issue, Spring 2017 is online for free for you to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://joom.ag/WxgW\"\u003eread now.\u003c/a\u003e This is just a taster and will remain free for anyone and everyone to access. Our future issues, exclusively for Patrons, will be bigger, better, with more contributors and greater diversity of pieces. We want this magazine fully to reflect the joy of smoking and the issues of smokers today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a platform which will allow anyone to support the Smokers\u0027 Manifesto, and in return, receive a copy of the magazine. You will only be charged when each issue is published - that\u0027s 4 times a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe in fair treatment and payment for writers. Without them we have no magazine. Many publications will exploit emerging writers for free copy. We want to be different. We want our writers to feel as valued as they are which means giving them fair pay for their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you receive as our Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a Patron, you will receive exclusive access to the Smokers\u0027 Manifesto. The first way is by subscribing to the digital magazine. This grants you access to our exciting content to read on your laptop, desktop, mobile or tablet as a PDF. However, you also have the option to go further and patronise our gorgeous print issue.\u00a0There\u0027s nothing like the feel of a well-made hard copy and it will make a beautiful and interesting addition to your coffee table. We also believe in the value of print publishing and, just like smoking, don\u0027t think this is an outdated pleasure but something that enriches the fabric of life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so grateful for your support. Every Patron with a Print subscription will be thanked, by name, in each issue, if they wish. Through your patronage you can help shape the future of the magazine and be an integral part of preserving smoking culture as it lives and breathes; and help a new generation of writers who, in the great tradition of writers: smoke.\u003cbr\u003e"
