    "summary": "Solve for X Productions is an initiative that aims to break down the barrier between academia and the arts using our own special brand of bad puns and dick jokes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFhhoSO_GrM?list=PLAftkaBypEoHKlQ-BXHzsZd3uORyR7OVS\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our science-themed Solve for X live variety show we\u00a0take professional performers and have them do acts inspired by science, and take scientists and have them try their hand at performing. We tie it all together with improv, silliness, and a lot of bad puns. The live variety show tours around the US to science festivals, conferences, and (hopefully, soon) fringe festivals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Sazb1DLAcw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to bring the show to EVERYONE though, so we\u0027re creating a video series, which will contain videos from our live Solve for X shows shows, but also our very exciting filmed-for-the-series project initiative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe filmed-for-the-series episodes of the Solve for X Show video series will include recorded performances from artists and academics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor each video, we will take one professional performer or one academic, give them a prompt (unless they have a particular subject they really, really want to cover), and work with them to create a video that equally values both the facts and the art (and yes, we definitely consider comedy an art. This won\u0027t be ALL hoity-toity, although on occasion, it might be). This means providing sources, helping to fact-check them, and providing specialists in artistic fields to workshop their performance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPdfdacXP08\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s our hope that putting our content online, we will bring in a more diverse audience. But also, by allowing performers who don\u0027t just live in the cities that Solve for X tours to, we hope to diversify our content, as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe video series will always be free and available to anyone (who has an internet connection or other way to access podcasts), but we need your help to be able to afford to do this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us make our dumb, quirky, pun-filled dream a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYAH_GEr_ws?list=PLAftkaBypEoHKlQ-BXHzsZd3uORyR7OVS\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do we need your money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, without accounting for the cost of having a videographer at every show, the Solve for X live show usually breaks even, which is GREAT and we\u0027re very proud of that. However, it leaves no money left over for new projects like The Solve for X video series. Plus, videos are expensive! We anticipate each filmed-for-the-series Solve for X video series episode will cost us around $500, and each Solve for X video episode that contains video from our live show will cost around $300.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOLY HOLMIUM. WHY SO EXPENSIVE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerformers should get paid. Each performer or group will be paid for the video. Our videographers and video editors will be paid for the video.The production team (that is, those who curate as well as those who provide the work-shopping, source finding, and fact checking) will also ALSO get paid for the video. We also have to factor in\u00a0marketing fees, website hosting, and other sundry administrative costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat people are saying about Solve for X:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I laughed so hard I could barely breathe\" - Meredith Brothers, audience member.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The two Solve for X shows I\u0027ve been to are the best live lit/variety shows I\u0027ve been to this year, and I\u0027m not just saying that because I was in them.
