He began by forcing his\nfriends to watch him perform to records of his dad\u2019s band, Four Saints.  Stephen eventually learned to play the\ntrumpet in various school bands, sang in the choir, and performed in musicals\nwhich increased his passion. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nInspired by his brother, Scot Evans, and his regional\nsuccess in the band, Floating Men, Stephen started his own rock band, Mean\nSeason, in the late 80\u2019s where he began honing his songwriting skills on the\nguitar.  After a few years of local\nsuccess and radio play in \u0026lt;st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;st1\u0026gt;Tallahassee,\n \u0026lt;st1\u0026gt;FL, his band moved to \u0026lt;st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;st1\u0026gt;Atlanta, \u0026lt;st1\u0026gt;GA\nto try and develop into something bigger. \nUnfortunately, the band broke up and left Stephen to try his hand at performing\nsolo around Atlanta. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSoon the jammed highways of the big city drove him to the\nbeautiful mountain town of Asheville, NC in 1996, where he quickly began\nsoaking in the creative influence of his amazing surroundings.  After many years of vacillating between being\na professional musician and building a nest in Asheville, Stephen is finally\nfocused on his love for creating and performing music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn June of 2015, Stephen finally released his debut CD \u201cSomething\nto Bleed\u201d with his band, The True Grits. \nThe True Grits, friends he\u2019s known since the early 2000\u2019s, are Brian\nShoemaker (bass/lead guitar/backing vocals), Sam Hess (drums), and Woodstock\n(mandolin).  They are on \u201cSomething to\nBleed\u201d along with special guests Halli Anderson of River Whyless (violin/backing\nvocals), his brother, Scot Evans of Floating Men (bass on \u20181000 Roses), and his\nmother, Barbara Evans (backing vocals on \u2018Sound\u2019).  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter performing around Asheville and parts of the Southeast\nsolo and with the band in support of the 2015 release, Stephen Evans \u0026amp; The\nTrue Grits are releasing the new EP, \u201cUnder A Bridge\u201d in late September.  The record will feature 5 songs of folk rock,\nand will be available online and on CD. \nMeanwhile, look for performances by the band and Stephen all around the\nSoutheast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e",
