In 1992, the video game Mario Paint was released, and I decided that was what I wanted to do with my life. A few years later I learned that computer graphics, animation, and visual effects are all viable career options. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last 15+ years, I\u2019ve put as much of my time as possible into learning everything I could about those fields through education, hands-on work experience, and maybe obsessing about 3D particle systems a little too much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I\u0027ve been working on making video tutorials on Motion Graphics, VFX, and 3D animation, which is where this page comes in. I love making the tutorial videos as a way to give back to the creative community, and with your support I can afford to make more tutorial videos more often, as well as give out access to project files, host Q\u0026amp;A sessions, and become more involved in the creative industry through social aspects of the Patreon page.",
