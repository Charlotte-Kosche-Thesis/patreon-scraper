We appreciate everyone who supports us by watching the show, but our Patrons are the ones who make it possible for us to keep making content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we and what is Stop Skeletons From Fighting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eStop Skeletons From Fighting is professionally produced, heavily researched, highly informative video game documentaries and reviews. The team is made of up Grace Kramer and Derek Alexander who together have a combined 15 years of video production experience. \u003cbr\u003eSSFF strives to set itself apart from the typical video game show by using a positive spin to highlight lesser-known or underrated games, entire series, and stories from the industry. Some of the topics covered include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Hideo Kojima vs. Konami\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Mighty Number 9 Kickstarter Explained\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 3D Gameboy Advance Games\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Resident Evil\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 The Rise of Dark Souls, From Software, and Hidetaka Miyazaki\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Clock Tower\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Faxanadu\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Castlevania Symphony of the Night\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDerek has been producing video reviews of retro (and sometimes modern) video games since 2007 as the Happy Video Game Nerd (HVGN), and was a audio and video contractor from 2008-2012. In late-2014 he dropped the HVGN name, brought on Grace, and established Stop Skeletons From Fighting, as new outlet for video game documentaries and reviews. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Short Version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\tThis is for our pre-produced videos, not streams. $1 gets your name in the credits of all future reviews. $2 gets you access to the Activity Feed. $5 gets you all of the above and access to the private SSFF forum and Discord. $10 (2 payments required) gets you membership in Uncle Derek\u0027s Bad \u0027n Rad Mystery Game Mailing Club. $20 (2 payments required, limit 4) for a monthly Skype call with Derek and Grace to chat about Video Production. $100 and we\u0027ll call up your favorite pizza joint and order you a pizza!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Long Version\u003cbr\u003e\n\t-\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPatreon is a unique crowdfunding platform that is basically an ongoing \"Kickstarter\". For years Youtube ad revenue and DVD sales brought in a decent chunk of change, but it was never enough to buy new gear or pay the bills. It bought many pizzas and beers! But the time came to take it to a level beyond pizza and beer money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tLet me be clear, this is not a pay wall for our content. New videos will still be free on the Youtube channel. If you just want to watch, hell that\u2019s enough! But if you like watching and wish there was more, then you\u0027re in the right place, friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith Patreon, viewers can not only support the show, but they can also obtain VIP access to behind-the-scenes pictures, videos, podcasts, work in progress stuff, and vote for future videos. Plus there\u0027ll be random giveaways like great games Derek finds for cheap while prowling the thrift of Seattle (PS2/GC/Xbox are most common right now). Help support and show, get VIP access to chat with Derek and Grace, and maybe win some cool free stuff! Everybody wins! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about Live Streams?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re asking for support only for video reviews not live stream archives or podcasts. Stuff like that isn\u0027t as time consuming or production demanding, so it won\u2019t count in this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to make Stop Skeletons From Fighting the greatest, highest-quality show on the planet and to connect with the fans to have some dumb fun along the way. Video are the main focus though, and with the support of our Patrons, we\u2019ve been able to increase our production output from one video a month to \u003cstrong\u003eat least two videos a month with the aim of creating three videos a month\u003c/strong\u003e! Even if you\u0027re not interested in crazy shenanigans, stick with SSFF and you\u0027ll at least discover awesome games you didn\u0027t know anything about."
