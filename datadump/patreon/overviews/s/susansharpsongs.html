One of the biggest gifts to me is when people hear my music and respond by slowing down, listening, and focusing on the music. It\u0027s so easy to be distracted these days! and music is so important to being human. I\u2019ve been playing music and singing for just about as long as I can remember and music has always been a huge part of my life. I remember as a young child, I would go outside and dance, and sing to the trees the melodies that would come into my head, and it would seem to me that the trees were singing back to me. Later, I was trained classically in piano and violin, but it wasn\u2019t until I got my harp, and I found that I loved the sounds that I could make together with it so much, that I really wanted to share my music with more people. I hope other people can feel some of the different emotions\u2014sometimes happiness and sometimes other emotions like sadness or love\u2014that I feel when I play this music and see the stories happening in my mind as the songs are played.",
