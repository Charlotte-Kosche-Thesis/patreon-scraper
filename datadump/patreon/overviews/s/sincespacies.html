    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eG\u0027day Invaders. Making videos and running a gaming channel has just become a passion of mine recently. One that I simply wished that I had started earlier. My name is Brian and I was a former staff member of the Sega Hotline here in Australia! That\u0027s right. I got paid to play games. I also wrote articles for Australian games magazines Megazone magazine and later Hyper magazine. I have also worked in the past for Australia\u0027s longest running retro gaming store.\u00a0The Gamesmen. As for gaming itself I have been playing games since SPACE INVADERS hence the name \"...Since Spacies\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027d like to think I know a thing or two about the gaming industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why do I run a gaming channel?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat\u0027s with all the questions? LOL I had left the industry in the mid 90\u0027s. That\u0027s a LONG time ago and I have been working in \"real\" jobs since. Sad fact of life was that the gaming industry was not gonna put food on my table for much longer. But over the years I missed the chatter. The water cooler chat at my current job is about boring stuff to me like reality TV, politics, food... YAWN. I was MISSING living and breathing gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was also missing writing for gaming magazines. The excitement of wondering \"what games will I be reviewing this month?\" and \"why does my editor always give me just the fighting games to review\". Getting that first box delivery of the next issue after slaving away for a month writing up articles and meeting deadlines was a rush.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to 2016. I had been seeing \"YouTubers\" posting content on gaming and was wanting to take on a new challenge but had to convince the \"Minister of War\"... my wife. LOL After she surprised me with not only giving me the green light to clear out the study room to get started but also the support by helping me with getting a new laptop, microphone, studio lighting. It was all starting to take place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell that depends. I could just keep making \"Let\u0027s Play\" videos. Honestly if that is all I made then I\u0027d still be having fun and enjoy the banter of the comments section and getting my subscribers hopping on board. But I kinda want to push this thing further. In less than a year I have started a Twitter account which now has just clipped the 1000 followers mark. At the time of writing this I have hit 300 subscribers with one of my videos gaining 3500 views. But I know that it can reach higher goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make exciting content. I want to get better and more confident with being in front of the camera and commentating on the action. Part of my action plan is to hopefully team up with other similar minded YouTubers and do loads of cross referencing videos. Create a new wave of YouTube personalities that act as mini celebrities in their own right. Kinda like what the WWE do with their wrestlers... without the smashed chairs... or maybe with the smashed chairs! LOL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy help out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m not gonna lie. This stuff is costly to run. You can run a YouTube channel on the cheapest of gadgets. But you can also be looking like you shot the videos with a potato. I have a series of items that I would love to add to the channel as I feel that they would add to the enjoyment of the content by the viewers. I have come so far in such a short period of time. Just watch my 1st video and you\u0027ll see that I\u0027m a nervous wreck:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYCcRTfaVlQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen watch my current most watched video to spot the difference:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hsp18EOeyfI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig difference yeah? I haven\u0027t set up goals for Patreons as yet. I am going to work on that soon. A big project that I have coming up that I\u0027ll be saving for is an arcade machine especially for the channel. That is something that I think would look awesome to have sitting in the backdrop and also to use to create more content. I also have other wishes for the channel. I\u0027d like to get a new camera to improve the look of the shots and also be able to do outdoor shoots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the start. The start of \"...Since Spacies\". Hop on board and become an INVADER by subscribing to the channel. Go one step further and become an COMMANDER by throwing some coin to the channel and I\u0027ll do my best to make sure that it\u0027s put to good use! BIG THINGS TO COME! Hope that you can be a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My screen name is \"...Since Spacies\" but my name is Brian Costelloe. I\u0027m an older gamer and consider gaming as more than just a past time. It\u0027s a culture! I can remember thinking Space Invaders was so cool when released in the early 80\u0027s. The sight of a spacies machine in the original cabinet at the local milkbar is something I\u0027ll remember for the rest of my life. Playing the cocktails tabled version for the first time was damn \"skillfull\"! Game \u0026amp; Watches were another thing I remember when casting my memories back that far. Basically I\u0027ve had a fixation for games since then. I didn\u0027t actually own a console till 1986 though. It was a Sega SC-3000 PC. Getting a new game for that thing meant mail order. I\u0027d check the letterbox like a crackhead trying to find a hit! LOL Gaming was one thing. The collectable game related merchandise was another! I love hunting down anything that is related to video games. I\u0027ve got mostly Sonic the Hedgehog stuff like Sonic basketball, Sonic Curtain holder, Sonic Money box. You get the drift. When I was in highschool getting EGM (Electronic Gaming Monthly) was such a buzz. Seeing what new titles were being announced was all I would be focused on. I collected mostly UK magazines as I found them more entertaining and less commercialised. I was so interested in gaming mags I just had to do something about it. So \"The Sega Times\" was born. The Sega Times was a fanzine that I put together all by myself with nothing more than a dot matrix printer, SC-3000 PC and a friend who owned a Photocopier. I\u0027d print the articles out on paper and \"blu-tack\" them onto a \"bromite\" master page along with cut outs of gaming images I\u0027d find in magazines relating to articles I had written. I\u0027d draw (rather crudely) the covers to the magazines and I\u0027d print up about 50 of these and sell them at $3 a pop. I\u0027d send Sega (known locally as Ozisoft at the time) a complimentary copy in the hope of getting games sent to me for review. It worked. Not only did I get games sent but also get news of new titles, release dates and general gaming gossip. I did this fanzine for about 6 months before it landed me a job in the Big Blue, Sega. Worked in Sega from 1991 to 1993 mostly in the Sega Hotline answering kids queries on gaming related problems. Most of the callers were from kids but alot of parents use to call up as well with problems on games like Alex Kidd in Miracle World or Phantasy Star. You\u0027d get some nutcases phoning up trying to play pranks on us but we thrived on that sort of stuff so much they usually would get scared and stopped calling! During my time in Sega I also did reviews for Megazone magazine. Megazone was an all format mag distributed in Australia and New Zealand. Bias as hell though as it was owned by distributor of Sega games. But my personal reviews mostly remained unchanged. After a few years of reviewing games, answering frustrated gamers calls and doing roadshows of games in local shopping centres I moved onto to work in a local gaming shop called The Gamesmen. But while working there I was continuing reviews for a new magazine called Hyper. But I was now an outsider. Contributer only and not an in house writer. As a result my association with the magazine dwindled and eventually the reviews stopped. I\u0027ve been out of the gaming scene since. I was glad to have been in the industry during one of the most innovative and exciting periods. The early 90\u0027s have often been described as the Golden Age of games. I agree 100%. Now I own a Nintendo 3DS, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS Vita and a Wii U. My collection of games are mostly 90\u0027s titles but at 400 games all up, I don\u0027t get bored much!",
