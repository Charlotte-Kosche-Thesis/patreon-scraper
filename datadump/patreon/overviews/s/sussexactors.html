    "summary": "Hey there folks! Thanks for checking out the SussexActors.co.uk Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, you\u0027re probably already aware that I run the website BrightonActors.co.uk - the one-stop shop for actors and producers in Brighton. And that means that there is definitely something of interest for you here. Make sure you read to the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve pretty much reached the limit of what I can do with the site on a voluntary basis, so I thought I\u0027d set out some plans for the future that are only achievable with a little bit of cashflow to spend on the site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRebranding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site will soon be re-branded as SussexActors.co.uk. The site was originally set up to cover all of Sussex, but I\u0027ve become aware that the original name is turning away people from outside Brighton. With more and more actors and fellow creatives moving to the more affordable towns around Brighton, exciting collaborations are already taking place across the county and there is an opportunity to make the most of that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelping you find paid work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to add more content to the site that will help actors to find paid work locally - both within the acting world or outside of it. Specifically, I\u0027m going to record some podcasts with a range of people - from employers looking for actors for specific roles, to actors already working successfully within the industry in fields that you may not have considered. There are three podcasts available for free on this page, discussing a range of topics. More such podcasts will be recorded and provided exclusively to Patreon subscribers, who will also be able to suggest future guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdating the site\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther research is necessary to fill out and update the site. The original site was filled with content that I had harboured from my experiences as an actor and theatre producer, as well as a few quick google searches. I\u0027d like to reach a little deeper into the likes of Worthing, Hastings, Eastbourne, Burgess Hill, Horsham, Haywards Heath and the surrounding areas, and create some more comprehensive listings. The hope is this will enable local companies and performers to take shows and workshops across the county with ease. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there\u0027s the design of the site. It\u0027s pretty basic, and although I intend to keep it that way, it could do with a new lick of paint. My graphic design skills are pretty rudimentary, so I\u0027d like to spend some money on a more professional looking logo (update: done) and some plug-ins to add some functionality to the site, including a simple actor directory that will allow users to post links to their Mandy.com and Spotlight profiles if they wish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCastings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe castings section - which attracted thousands of hits per month before the technical problems in November 2017 - needs re-building, and I would like to purchase a plug-in that makes it easier for both casting professionals and actors to use, including the facility to apply directly through the site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon content\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just the initial proposals. By committing to this Patreon, you will be able to suggest and discuss further changes to the site, and you\u0027ll get an insight into the processes behind running the site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my passions is making services accessible to all, regardless of income or social background, so the site will always remain free to use. There are different payment tiers here solely to allow people to commit at a level that they can afford. All subscribers will receive the same benefits with the exception of the advertising tiers, which are designed for people with a service to sell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also ensure that I pay it forward. For example, by donating to the freeware provider of the podcasting software I use, and by creating paid work opportunities for local creatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron NOW!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTiers start at just over \u00a31 per month - anything you can afford will be truly appreciated, and will benefit the local community as a whole. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQ: What will the money be spent on?\u003cbr\u003eA: Primarily developing the SussexActors.co.uk website. Either through buying new plugins, covering admin costs or bringing in developers to improve the site. Once the site is up and running as it should be, I\u0027ll look to invest in better podcasting equipment and software. After that, it\u0027ll cover things like travel costs for meeting podcast guests. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003eA: It\u0027s really simple. You set up a profile with them, make your pledge, and your card is debited on the 1st of every month. You can cancel or change your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Why do the pledges say \"$1.50+ per month\"\u003cbr\u003eA: The amount in each tier is purely a suggestion. You can pledge any amount you like - in dollars. I\u0027m afraid Patreon is an American site, so I can\u0027t change the dollars to pounds sterling, but I have provided an exchange rate in the text of each pledge tier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
