And even more so, I am excited about the possibility of you and I working together as co-creators of some amazing things that will create health and happiness, and that will make the world a better place in general!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"The cure for anything is saltwater - sweat, tears, the ocean.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps you\u0027ve heard that line somewhere. Here in Hawaii, I strive to live that sentiment every day and my aim with SaltyCures is to bring as much of that \"cure\" to the world as possible through the way in which I deliver fitness and photography services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether that is cure is in the form of down-to-earth, sensible and actionable fitness resources that help people achieve and maintain health and wellness...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...Or through capturing and delivering stunning ocean and scenic visual imagery that heals the soul and puts smiles on faces...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...Helping create better lives is what the work happening here in Hawaii at SaltyCures is all about, and I would love for you to become a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you may be wondering, \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027how can I help?\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor one thing, the fact that you\u0027re here reading this, that you watch my YouTube and other videos, that you watch my live broadcasts on Periscope, or follow my work on social media means the world to me and that feeling of supportiveness is hugely helpful in pushing me to create and deliver on these objectives. So, THANK YOU! If you\u0027d like to get involved beyond that, though, please read on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT SALTYCURES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii is an amazing canvas and laboratory for creating beautiful things that can help many people. Here are the two big things I\u0027m working on right now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eVisions For The Soul\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a photographer can be a very solitary profession, which I\u0027ve observed can sometimes lead to it being a selfish one as well. I love being a photographer but I don\u0027t like the thought of that and so I\u0027ve racked and racked my brain over the ways I might be able to use my passion for capturing stunning imagery of the beautiful scenery here in Hawaii to do more than just wow the visual sense, but also actually help people in need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Visions for the Soul\u0027 was created to fill that need! Originally conceived as a way to periodically donate printed imagery to people suffering from ongoing debilitating physical, emotional, and mental trauma and disorders, the project has recently taken on a new identity. Now, whenever someone buys a print from the SaltyCures website, an additional print will be donated to someone in need to help relieve the kind of suffering mentioned above by aiding in the healing process. You might call it \"visual art therapy\", and it really works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon assists in offsetting some of the costs associated with creating and delivering these additional printed pieces of art, with spreading the message of this initiative, and also helps with acquiring additional equipment, ensuring we continue to capture the highest quality imagery possible at SaltyCures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDonation-Based Fitness Coaching\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s face it, virtually all of us need to get in better shape, right?! But among the many reasons stopping people from achieving the health and fitness they want are two really big reasons - cost and trust. Fitness training is expensive! Not to mention, with the volume of information out there today, much of it conflicting, how do you know you can trust the knowledge and expertise of your trainer??\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I have decided to do is to provide a powerful online fitness coaching resource (via private Facebook group and website) that is free to join and make use of. Within these platforms, I am pumping my fitness and self-improvement heart and soul into providing powerful coaching videos, workouts, articles and more that guide people through the process of taking the action necessary and forming new habits that will ensure success on their fitness journey. If they find what I provide is benefiting them, they are welcome to make a donation. If not, no worries, I\u0027ll keep on helping anyway! (This model of fitness coaching is a win-win - it pushes me to put out as much quality fitness content as possible, and you get to benefit from that!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon of SaltyCures donation-based fitness coaching helps make this type of service model sustainable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMORE GOOD STUFF TO COME!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople love to talk about changing the world for the better, but I believe that you can\u0027t change the world without endeavoring to serve being priority #1. Lots more do-good projects are coming in the near future so stay tuned and thank you for your support of SaltyCures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(P.S. - And if you\u0027d like to get involved in any other way to help further the objectives of SaltyCures, please let me know - \"many hands make light work!\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(P.P.S. - thanks for reading this far, video description coming soon!)\u003cbr\u003e"
