My name is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFaye Villanueva\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I am the author and illustrator of the graphic series \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncognito\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I also am drawing for the series \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMA-I\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I have been a contributor in the Philippine publishing industry as an illustrator, book editor, and marketer. But my heart\u2019s desire is to pursue creating engaging stories and visuals that impact and engage the world (on the side, well, also make fan arts). That is why three years ago I ventured into comics and visual arts and right now they\u2019re already fulfilling that impact in some way here in the Philippines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1zSlj6xamY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to bring these materials to the world and thought that it can only be done via this channel and through your support.

By the way, \u003cem\u003eSpatial child\u003c/em\u003e is a term I coined because I usually create my visuals out of nothing\u00a0(more of this \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_intelligence_(psychology)\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).
