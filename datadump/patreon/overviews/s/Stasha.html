    "summary": "The taboo of menstruation affects everyone, and separating women from their energy source hurts not just us as women, but our families and communities as well. How? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis one of the topics I\u0027ll be illuminating with your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to really create Change for women around the world we need powerful voices and I can\u0027t do that by talking one on one with local women. I need your support to research, create, share and amplify! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals are to:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. Publish books for women of every age and stage to embrace their cycles from menses to menopause. To end the shame, humiliation, even the painful periods and raging PMS women think of as normal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2. Create videos from short and sweet, to PSA\u0027s, to full length documentaries.\u003cbr\u003e3. To create classes and courses for women of all ages to connect in and learn together. Not just online but also to travel and help women set up their versions of community Red Tents or Moon Lodges.\u003cbr\u003e4. To learn wisdom from cultures around the world. To collect this knowledge and create this place as information hub for all women to learn and teach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou, as a supporter, will be behind the scenes every step of the way and you will be the pool that I draw from when I need help. Getting first view on videos, blogs, art, information -that could be the difference between a life on drugs or a vibrant rich life...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating this content already and giving it away for free, but now I\u0027m living in my best friends living room, crashing on couches and I STILL want nothing more than to share with all this with the world. You can rest assured that if you support me I\u0027ll pour it all right back into creating eye opening, world changing programming and art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI expect to put out 1-2 \u0027Changes\u0027 (adapting an idea of Amanda Palmer\u0027s) a month. A Change is something to help end the taboo, from infographics to movies I\u0027ll be supplying content you can use. You can put a cap on how many times you\u0027ll be charged per month, and still get all the \u0027Changes\u0027."
