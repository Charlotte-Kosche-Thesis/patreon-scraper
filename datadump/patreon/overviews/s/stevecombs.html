    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Steve Combs, and I\u0027ve been making free-use instrumentals since 2014. Collectively, the 300+ songs I\u0027ve composed since then have been downloaded roughly half a million times from my pages on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stevecombsmusic.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Steve_Combs/\"\u003eFree Music Archive\u003c/a\u003e, garnered over a million streams, and have been used in hundreds of YouTube videos and dozens of podcasts. I also co-founded the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://freemusicarchive.org/music/The_Freeharmonic_Orchestra/\"\u003eFreeharmonic Orchestra\u003c/a\u003e, a globe-spanning collaborative free-use music project featured in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stateof.creativecommons.org/\"\u003e2016 State of the Commons report\u003c/a\u003e. Free and free-use music has been at the heart of everything I\u0027ve done for the past few years, and I\u0027m both proud of the work I\u0027ve done and extremely grateful to everyone who\u0027s been receptive to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m launching this Patreon because I wanted to give all those people who\u0027ve supported my music a chance to get more involved, and a chance to support my work directly. I get emails from people all the time asking if they can pay me to use my music, and I always tell them it\u0027s not necessary, thanks to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"\u003eCreative Commons\u003c/a\u003e licensing. So I\u0027ve never made a dime from my music, and while that means it\u0027s more accessible, it also means that I can\u0027t work on it as much as I\u0027d like to. With your support, I\u0027ll be able to create much more music much more efficiently than I otherwise could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m launching \u003cstrong\u003eSteve Combs Premium\u003c/strong\u003e, a song-a-week series, as a reward and an incentive for your patronage. Every week, supporters will get a brand-new song to download (and use in their projects) before its available anywhere else. Your $3 per month gives you exclusive access to \u003cstrong\u003e52 songs a year\u003c/strong\u003e, plus occasional bonus tracks, as well as an \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive podcast\u003c/strong\u003e rounding up my favorite free-use tracks from around the internet. I\u0027m really excited to launch this project, and I hope that you are too.\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you again to everyone who\u0027s supported me and my music! Let\u0027s go make some more!"
