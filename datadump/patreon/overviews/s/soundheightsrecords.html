If you would like, we will also consider using your song \u0026amp; lyric ideas in upcoming recording sessions and releases (you will then get songwriting credit); and...\u00a0a 20 min Skype or phone convo with me for personal feedback or just a schmooze about  music.  If you agree, our conversation can be on the Podcast!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou choose your reward tier and pledge amount (you can always give more if you like within a tier), and (important!) set the maximum amount you are willing to give each month. \u00a0You will\u00a0then be billed per \"paid for by patrons\" creation, up to your limit. \u00a0At this point, I hope to release around 4 paid for creations per month; whether videos, songs, or podcasts. \u00a0There will also be many patrons-only posts along the way that you will not be billed for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, I aim to help more people make more music from the heart that enters the heart, ushering in an Era of Song in gratitude for the miracles\u00a0in our lives and for the unfolding miracle of Global Redemption and Harmony!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
