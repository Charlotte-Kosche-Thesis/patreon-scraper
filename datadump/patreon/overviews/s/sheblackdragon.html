Jones (SheBlackDragon) and I\u0027ve been doing art professionally since 2008 and have worked for various companies, including popular t-shirt designs for Spiral Direct and the Mountain, as well as illustrations for role-playing games including Call of Cthulhu, The Laundry, Victoriana, Babylon 5, Conan and RuneQuest, amongst many more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn recent years, I have focussed more on licensing - though I have still taken commissions - and have seen my work released on t-shirts (Darkside \u0026amp; the Mountain (\u003ca href=\"http://www.themountain.com/search.php?search_query=linda+jones\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLink 1\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://www.themountain.com/electric-dragon-t-shirt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLink 2\u003c/a\u003e), giftware (\u003ca href=\"http://www.nemesisnow.com/nemesis-now-artist-ranges/linda-m-jones/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNemesis Now\u003c/a\u003e), bedding (\u003ca href=\"http://trade.wildstarhearts.co.uk/index.php?route=product/search\u0026amp;search=linda%20jones\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWild Star Hearts\u003c/a\u003e), cross-stitch kits (\u003ca href=\"http://www.geckorouge.co.uk/sheblackdragon-41-c.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeckoRouge\u003c/a\u003e), and even dice bags \u0026amp; CCG playmats (\u003ca href=\"http://www.inkedgaming.com/collections/artists/linda-jones\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInked Playmats\u003c/a\u003e), amongst others. However, last year my career took a hit when my health took a turn.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSince April 2015, doctors have been running tests and have still failed to find a diagnosis for my worsening health issues that are debilitating not just my everyday life, but also my ability to work. As such, I\u0027m unable to take on lots of commissions with solid, short deadlines as I often cannot guarantee that my health will not get in the way. The pace of my work ground to a near standstill when all of this first hit and while new symptoms continued to present, which has had a dramatic impact on my ability to provide for my family.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I\u0027m adapting my work habits to my unpredictable health and medications, I want to take the opportunity this year to focus on getting back to creating work for licensing with some designs that I\u0027ve been particularly wanting to do. Until I have a diagnosis, I have no idea how my condition will effect my ability to work, so I want to create a lasting body of work I can feel proud of to provide for my family; a body of work that is close to my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sheblackdragon.com/wp-content/gallery/fantasy/blue-moon-dragon-da.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 353px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor my first collection, I want to get back to my roots with my first love by painting dragons. For this first collection of dragons, I want to create a series (probably of 12 images) based around the concept of flower dragons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created a lot of dragons through my career and they remain popular amongst fans, often being the most requested subject for future projects, but one that I seem to rarely get the opportunity to create when I need to focus on commissions and sales trends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis collection is a series of pictures that I really want to do, regardless of whether or not a particular company decides they want to use all of them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrequency of Design\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs much as I would love to run a monthly campaign, since I cannot guarantee my health (or other commitments, such as to my family) won\u0027t get in the way, I\u0027ve opted for a \"per creation\" campaign. I will still aim to for about one design a month, but some designs may be quicker to complete, others may take longer either due to complexity of time/health constraints. I doubt I will create more than two a month, so you can be assured I won\u0027t be bleeding your bank dry by cranking out the designs once a week - that\u0027s just not possible for me any more. If in doubt, you can put a cap on your monthly spending in your Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sheblackdragon.com/wp-content/gallery/fantasy/dragons-rock-da.jpg\" style=\"float: right; width: 341px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eWhat Your Support Means\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, I can continue to create the art I\u0027m most passionate about that I can then make available for licensing, so that these images may continue to support my family. Licensing takes a lot of time, not just in the creation of the art, and it can sometimes be several months before I am likely to see any return for my work. This is where I would often take quick commissions to fill the gap, but as I am unable to always make ironclad promises with commissions at present, this is much trickier. Your donations will help in relieving some of the stress from the absence of commissions I am forced to refuse, allowing me to concentrate on my own projects and finally giving me the chance to focus on what I\u0027m passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow It Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re new to Patreon, you might not know how it all works.

Each time I complete a design, you will be charged the amount you pledged.

Obviously, there may be some cropping involved if the design is portrait, but I\u0027ll ensure it looks pretty! Also,\u00a0you get a discount (varies by how much you pledge) on a signed A4 print of my final design. Purchase is optional, but you get the discount code all the same to redeem at my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $50 or more, you get the same as the $25 tier, but you also get an original dragon-head mini-sketch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $120, you get the same as the $50 tier, but you also get a 40cm x 30cm canvas print of the final design that I\u0027ll personally sign to make your wall look amazing. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Goals are reached, I\u0027ll add more reward tiers that you can upgrade and switch to so you can access more fun perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$50 - Sketches, Preview and Process!\u003c/strong\u003e - If we hit $50, my patron-only posts will include added insight into the design process.

If so, I\u0027ll let you know what products the designs are available on and keep you up to date with releases, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce the collection is complete, I like the idea of doing something with all of them. I\u0027m not expecting every company to pick up the entire collection, so it will be nice to do something (a book, calendar, or whatever) that puts them all together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I\u0027ll move on to the next collection! :-)\u003cbr\u003e"
