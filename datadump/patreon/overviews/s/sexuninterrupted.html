We invite you to read more about \u201cSex Uninterrupted\u201d, and learn about who we are.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nJames and I have been in the Swinger Lifestyle together since we started dating in 2013. Meeting each other shattered everything we thought about a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship. Maneuvering our way through an open relationship transformed our view on sexuality, relationships and sex. We both have dedicated a large portion of our lives towards expanding our sexual horizons and studying more. We are not psychologists, certified therapist or doctors \u2013 simply put we are a couple building a life in the Swinger Lifestyle and want to help others doing the same.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nContributing to the Swinger Lifestyle (LS) community brings us so much joy and we are in awe with how much it has grown these last few years. We decided to share our experiences when we booked a trip to Hedonism II in May 2015. I was seeking information about the resort and disappointingly didn\u2019t find much. There were a few forums and some reviews \u2026but nothing REAL. We decided to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI journaled every day of the trip and transformed our memories into the blog \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSex Uninterrupted\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. The response we received was tremendous. People loved the real reviews, opinions and FEARS that we talked about. Readers reached out to us worldwide. It feels amazing to know we are helping people in the LS community by sharing our experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThe site has grown significantly over the years, and we are so grateful to have a creative outlet for our thoughts, opinions, strengths and energy to pour into. We work hard and pour our hearts into everything you receive - you are truly experiencing the essence of us through Sex Uninterrupted. Our dream is to have SU grow, while maintaining its independence. We want to ensure people have access to quality information in order to pursue their desires and fantasies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your Patreon pledges, we will have the opportunity not just to keep Sex Uninterrupted independent, but to do more. We are excited to have the ability to give back to you through this setup. We can\u2019t wait to share even MORE about ourselves through exclusive content! \u003cstrong\u003eThe bonus is that we get to reinvest your pledges into building and expanding SU.\u003c/strong\u003e We want to keep our content real, raw and unfiltered. We want to build a brand that is useful and genuine for all those navigating the Swinger Lifestyle - and we want it all in one place!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nWithout your love, support, and encouragement, we wouldn\u2019t even be here, so thank you, from the bottom of our hearts. We understand if you don\u2019t have money to pledge, which is why we offer free content too! Make sure to subscribe to SU on the Air on Soundcloud or iTunes, and follow us on our Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. We love it when you give us feedback, so make sure to send us ratings, reviews, comments and tweets!!!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo Taara\u003c/div\u003e"
