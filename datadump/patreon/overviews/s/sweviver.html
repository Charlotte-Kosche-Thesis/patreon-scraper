I truly love the way Virtual Reality and it\u00b4s community is developing and growing, and I\u00b4m so happy being able to be a small part of the \"early VR days\". At this moment, SweViver is mainly about VR gaming, Mixed Reality gaming, and also reviews of new VR tech and accessories. I do my best to provide you giveaways with Steam keys for VR games at least once every week, as it means a lot to me being able to share the fun with my audience. Mostly I get the giveaway keys from game developers, but sometimes I prefer to fund them by myself from my own pocket - as I think you deserve to get something back for me, for all your lovely support :) I\u00b4m also doing my best to respond to all your video comments, as I find it very entertaining and encouraging to have a social connection with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00b4m working full-time as a security guard in my \"real life\", so my time is quite limited being a YouTuber, but I can assure you that at least 90% of my free time from work right now I\u00b4m dedicating to create new videos on SweViver, and I\u00b4m doing my best to improve the channel constantly. My dream would be to do this on full time, but I\u00b4m sure that I have a looong way to go before it eventually happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for everything guys. I promise to bring you the best possible VR content I can manage to create - and as often as I can! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreetings from Sweden\u003cbr\u003eMartin, SweViver\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
