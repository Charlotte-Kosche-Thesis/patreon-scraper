Whether it\u0027s crafting them for others or performing in them at conventions, I never get tired of bringing these crazy creatures to life. Patreon gives me a whole new way to interact with people who are interested in my work and process. I love chatting with people who are just as passionate about costumes as I am, and it\u0027s a lot of fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy normal content has never been gated behind Patreon. I still post just as many WIP photos, finished videos, and brief explanations of my process as I always have to social media. Answering questions and interacting with others is something I love to do whether they are a patron of mine or not. However, this platform allows me to create extra content that I wouldn\u0027t be able to justify without the funding. Depending on the tier you select you\u0027ll see anything from early WIP photos, work videos, access to our Patreon campfire telegram chat, vlogs, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003eBy joining our little treehouse you\u0027ll get instant access to \u003c/span\u003ehundreds of posts from the past three years.

As a freelance artist it\u0027s difficult to justify buying experimental materials when it is not going to be used to turn a profit in the near future. Any new materials or methods I learn are shared here and on social media so everyone benefits! Because of the support I\u0027ve gotten through Patreon the past three years, I have the confidence and knowledge to tackle a project that\u0027s been a dream of mine for ten years.
