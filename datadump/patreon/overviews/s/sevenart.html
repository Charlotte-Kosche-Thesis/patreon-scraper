I\u0027ve been painting professionally since 2008 and exhibiting my \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://marlenesevenbremner.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esurrealist oil paintings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e in Olympia, Seattle, and along the West Coast. I am inspired and informed by my lifelong pursuit of truth and healing, and the many profound experiences this has brought me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you will have exclusive access to my creator blog, and your contribution is directly fueling the creation of new paintings, poems, music, and writing that I will be sharing with you. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to continue my life\u0027s work, knowing that I am held by an art-loving community that understands what it takes for artists to keep creating.

They are creations of love, testaments to the resilience of\nthe spirit in the face of great difficulty. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe progression of my work is symbolic of my own process of alchemical\ntransmutation, which is a psycho-spiritual quest to dig into the belly of my accumulated life experiences, extricate the dragons, and liberate the gold. It is an awakening that is ever unfolding, and each painting is a\nmulti-faceted visual diagram reflecting different stages of this process. I\u0027ve learned so much from engaging with this process for so many years, and it just keeps going deeper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003ePoetry \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to painting, since 2015 I have been supporting myself by working as a poet, writing spontaneous poetry on a manual vintage typewriter. I was introduced to it by a friend, and we are a small collective of poets under the name of \u003ca href=\"http://www.yourtopicyourprice.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Poem Store\u003c/a\u003e. I set up at farmer\u0027s markets and invite people to contribute a topic of their choice for a poem, which I type up and give them for donations. Sometimes I am invited to write poems at parties, events, and weddings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love connecting with people in this creative way, and seek to empower, inspire, and uplift through the power of words. My first publicly published poem will be with the City of Olympia Intercity Transit System, and will be featured on five city buses in the near future. I also aim to publish a book of poetry.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Writing \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe symbols and concepts that appear in my art and poetry help me to understand greater patterns and relationships in myself and in the world. These ideas I am compiling and slowly building into several books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the books is all about the ancient Egyptian deity, Thoth, who brought writing, wisdom, alchemy, and magic to human kind. This is the subject of my latest painting, titled \u003cem\u003eThe Transfiguration of Thoth\u003c/em\u003e, which has been six months in the making and represents a path forward for humanity, beyond the identification with thought. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am working on another book about the Black Toad as a symbol in alchemy. The things that I post on my patreon blog will reflect aspects of this process and I will keep you posted on the progress of my books as they develop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Patronage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a patron, you will be making a big difference in reducing the \nfinancial stress that impedes me in my creative work. You\u0027ll be \nproviding the capital that is so vital to turning my work into a viable \nbusiness that supports me in a healthy way. The future will get to see more of these paintings, which are getting more epic as time goes on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron you will make this easier to manage all of the costs involved with being an independent creator, including work space rental, website\ncosts, marketing, advertising,\u00a0 typewriter repairs, travel expenses, oil\npainting supplies, photography/scanning to digitize/archive work, making and packaging prints and other art products, distribution, and promotion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read this and for your interest in my work! I truly could not survive as an artist without my fans, so I am eternally grateful and love you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
