    "summary": "After surviving two bouts of cancer, and having too many friends living with or having lost their battle with cancer, I have decided to turn my February 2018 thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail into a tribute to Dr. Edward P. Gelmann, Deputy Director for Clinical Research at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, and as a charity hike for the Cancer Research Institute (CRI).\u003cbr\u003eThe journey we will take together will be an exceptional challenge while we walk through the history of America, and it will be an escape to the flora and fauna of America\u2019s Footpath. Through our time together, you will come to learn about my 32 year career with the Central Intelligence Agency and how that experience led to this hike.\u003cbr\u003eI will be donating all proceeds from this account to CRI because, as a highly respected charity CRI caught my attention, and as an award-winning institute advancing cancer research CRI earned my support. I will also be encouraging viewers to pledge mileage, milestones or monthly donations directly to CRI, through my donation page with the same name.\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for your consideration of taking this walk with me, and paying-it-forward for all of us."
