    "summary": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, you may be asking yourself, who\u0027s this dude?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell wonder no longer! My name is Michael \"Shaostoul\" Boisson and I\u0027m a gamer, modder, educator, mentor, entertainer, content creator, and friend to anyone wanting to do the same. I starting modding video games many years ago when I was very young and saw my father modding video games which all started with BattleTech: Crescent Hawk\u0027s Inception and Elite: Frontier II. Over the years I\u0027ve modded many games such as Warcraft 3, Freelancer, Borderlands, Dwarf Fortress, and Morrowind, and lately I\u0027ve been modding Space Engineers and Fallout 4. Since I started modding Space Engineers in 2014, it had been requested to setup a method to receive donations and now with Patreon, from a fan suggestion, it\u0027s easier than ever to support my endeavors to create content for video games and teach people to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s grown so much since then and has been such an enlightening and rewarding experience that I truly hope that it can continue to grow further to help even more people. I\u0027ve received lovely thank you letters from individual about how my help actually helped them get into the field as professionals. An experience that is absolutely amazing to have affected someones life so much that it steered them to something they\u0027d be doing for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately or fortunately, I\u0027m still not sure, in July of 2016 I started dealing with an illness called Chron\u0027s Disease. It has changed my life forever but, I\u0027m doing what I can do to make the most of it. I can no longer work a normal job and after horrible year that 2017 was that more or less made me incapable of doing anything the whole year, things are finally getting back on track!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to go ahead and try to answer some simple questions right off the bat and if you have any further questions feel free to shoot me a message! I\u0027m totally open to talking to anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitch Live-Stream\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m presently unable to live-stream due to horrible bandwidth but, I\u0027m trying to figure out a way I can afford to gain access to fast enough internet to do so. When I\u0027m able to live-stream again, I\u0027ll likely be streaming video game-play, game modding, and other similar things. When I\u0027m actually streaming, I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll all get sorted out. \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/shaostoul\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can get to my Twitch account here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube Videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile not as an interactive environment as Twitch, I will try to post videos on a what\u0027s-demanded basis. This will include similar content to that of Twitch but, ideally it\u0027ll be well constructed as to quickly and efficiently portray the idea of the video, especially when in regards to educational content. \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Shaostoul\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can get to my YouTube account here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubscribers (Patreon, YouTube, and Twitch)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProviding benefits special for subscribers presently isn\u0027t very viable as the community surrounding what I do is still very small. All of my content presently is public and will remain so as to try to draw traffic and more support for doing more of this stuff. I\u0027m actively modding Space Engineers and creating educational content for it. The content I create is heavily influenced by requests from my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscord and Live-Chat\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs some of you may be aware, a lot of the support I provide is done via live-chat one way or another, most commonly on Discord. There is a \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/sVatBQ8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscord server\u003c/a\u003e that allows for a much more structured environment as the community grows, which is very important. As time and money permits, I\u0027ll be adding more benefits for subscribers to Discord as to reward them for their support. For now it\u0027s mostly just public but, there is a private chat area just for supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSponsors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I\u0027d prefer to not be a sell out, sponsorship opportunities may arise. As this may be mild inconvenience for some people, consider the following; it can provide a much more stable and reliable system for providing content, it could allow me to move to a new location, get faster internet, and reliably live-stream full-time. I already have many people demand I live-stream but, due to lack of funding and insufficient bandwidth available at my present location, live-streaming isn\u0027t happening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eModding and education for Space Engineers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m actively modding the game and I have a \u003ca href=\"https://forums.keenswh.com/threads/guide-shaostouls-modding-guide-more.7395625/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethread of education material on the official KeenSWH forums\u003c/a\u003e, a \u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shaostoul/myworkshopfiles/?appid=244850\u0026amp;p=1\u0026amp;numperpage=30\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSteam Workshop page\u003c/a\u003e of all of my mods for the game, as well as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Shaostoul\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel containing my educational tutorial videos\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eModding for Fallout 4\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not presently modding the game but, I do have content on \u003ca href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16359/?\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNexus for PCs\u003c/a\u003e, a Bethesda.net page \u003ca href=\"https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/fallout4/mod-detail/2242214\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efor the mod on PC\u003c/a\u003e and one \u003ca href=\"https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/fallout4/mod-detail/2242455\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efor the mod on Xbox\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m not presently doing any educational content for modding Fallout 4, as it has yet to be requested. This was put on the back burner as Chron\u0027s has severely limited what I can do and I have to focus on things that seem to be the most important. Lately it\u0027s been focusing on content suggested by supporters and by people on my Discord server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaying video games\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not presently playing any games on a regular basis due to recovering from a bad infection as a result of my compromised immune system from the Chron\u0027s medication. I do somewhat play Diablo 3 and Warhammer: Vermintide 2. I play seasonal characters on Diablo 3 and I do not play hardcore due to the poor bandwidth and not wanting to lose a character due to lag. I\u0027m open to suggestions to new video games but, money is incredibly tight presently so, my options are limited.\u003cbr\u003e"
