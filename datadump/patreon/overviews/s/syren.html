    "summary": "I\u2019m Syren and I\u2019m a community activist and writer. The work that I do is intimately connected, bound by my spiritual life and devotion, in service to that which is within and beyond myself. Thanks to my patrons, I am able to continue my work in the world. On this page, you will receive behind-the-scenes looks at what spiritual service is like, tips and resources, and stories that weave together threads of meaning to create a tapestry that reflects the complexity and nuance of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity building\u003c/strong\u003e has been a part of my work for over 15 years. I\u2019ve been priestessing and teaching since the age of 22.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am the founder of\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://disabledhikers.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDisabled Hikers\u003c/a\u003e, a new resource by disabled hikers for disabled hikers. I provide detailed hiking guides that include information disabled hikers are more likely to need, but less likely to find in the guides written for fully able-bodied people. I am disabled and got so fed up with having to scour hiking guides only to start out on a trail and find out that it was not what I expected. This project brings together my love of writing, the outdoors, and activism into a much needed resource.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a writer I\u2019ve been published\u003c/strong\u003e in many print anthologies, community zines, and online publications, including the \u003ca href=\"https://syrenofminds.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/pagan-leadership-anthology/\"\u003ePagan Leadership Anthology\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0the upcoming\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.houseofhands.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNumen Naturae\u003c/a\u003e. I also write\u00a0on my \u003ca href=\"https://syrenofminds.wordpress.com/\"\u003epersonal blog\u003c/a\u003e and I perform at readings. There is much more writing I plan to do, particularly around community, grief, the natural world, and critical issues. There are also two books and a couple of chapbooks in the wings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI generally provide \u003cstrong\u003e30-60 hours per week of uncompensated community work\u003c/strong\u003e. My other current projects include: creating community co-ops, rural community organizing efforts, a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://awakenedsolutions.wordpress.com/writing-services/free-writing-project/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efree writing project\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0free classes on herbalism and meditation, and grief circles and other ceremonies. I frequently offer free advice to struggling organizations. I moderate a number of online forums, and offer spiritual support to individuals on a regular basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll off this work is aligned with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://syrenofminds.wordpress.com/2018/03/06/modern-monasticism-a-revolutionary-vision/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy vision of monastic service\u003c/a\u003e. I am interested in living a community-oriented\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1268425306543654/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epolytheist monastic lifestyle\u003c/a\u003e, and creating more acceptance and support for it within the larger spiritual community. But as of right now, I live alone in a rural area, and that means I have to support my daily, if simple, needs myself. \u003cstrong\u003eYour support will help me to continue this work, to bring more of my writing to those that need to read it, and to be a voice for practical, embodied spiritual service in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOther interlocking identities that I inhabit include white, queer, femme, disabled, domestic violence survivor, out of order death griever, with an anti-capitalist radical political lens. Identity does not define me, but it is the context from which I move in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther past projects include: a founding board member of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://godsandradicals.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGods\u0026amp;Radicals\u003c/a\u003e, organizer of the conference \u003ca href=\"http://www.manygodswest.com/\"\u003eMany Gods Wes\u003c/a\u003et,\u00a0founder of the Shekhinah Mountainwater Memorial Fund,\u00a0co-founder of the \u003ca href=\"https://mothergrove.org/\"\u003eMother Grove Goddess Temple\u003c/a\u003e.
