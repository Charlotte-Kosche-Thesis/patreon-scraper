The past couple of months you know from the vlogs on my channel that I have been taken out of work. Youtube is not something I ever started to make money on. But I do need to be able to support myself. I am very fortunate to be where I am on Youtube and have such an amazing community. Just you being here reading this is more than enough. If you cant support me then please do not feel the need to, but for those of you that do THANK YOU SO MUCH. It means more than a post online can explain",
