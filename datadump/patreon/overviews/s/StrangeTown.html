While\ndocumenting their adventures,\nthey approach each investigation as skeptics and try to find rational\nexplanations on the strange occurrences they encounter. Even though\nthey have stumbled upon situations that are unexplainable, they are\nnot here to convince you that \u201cghosts\u201d exist, but rather take you\non a voyage through the history and unsettled stories that are left\nbehind... What started as a hobby in 2013 of filming 5-minute long webisodes\nhas evolved over the past three years into a full fledged TV show. In\n2014, Strange Town was picked up by\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.klru.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKLRU-TV\u003c/a\u003e (the Austin, TX PBS\naffiliate) and their episodes are broadcast in Central Texas and\nnationally available thru the\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.pbs.org/show/strange-town/episodes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePBS website\u003c/a\u003e and PBS app. Strange Town\nhas also been featured on\u00a0Travel Channels\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/ghost-adventures/video/history-of-the-magnolia-hotel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u201cGhost Adventures\u201d\u003c/a\u003e and Destination America\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.destinationamerica.com/tv-shows/ghost-brothers/videos/mysterious-presence-in-attic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u201cGhost Brothers\u201d\u003c/a\u003e. Strange Town has also been interviewed on podcasts and featured in many local publications, such as the Austin American-Statesman and Austin Monthly magazine to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://strange-town.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Patreon_Costs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\nmay be thinking - \u201cWhy do we need your help??\u201d  Strange\nTown is not a big budget show and it does not have major sponsors, underwriters or a large production company backing it. All 13 of our episodes have been self-funded and we have exhausted our local resources. In order to bring Strange Town to the small screen, we have fees and costs that are very standard. We have location fees, travel expenses, insurance costs, post production costs, gear rental, etc. Luckily, we have been fortunate enough to film locally which has cut down on certain costs, but we\u0027ve also had opportunities to take the show nationwide. From this point on more\ntravel is required, and with more traveling comes more expenses that\nwe just cannot afford on our own.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://strange-town.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Patreon_Goal.jpg\"\u003eThis two man team has investigated and produced two\nseasons worth of material and are currently striving to make Season 3. Billy and Mark love what they do and are excited to bring their unique form of ghost investigating and history telling to their viewing audience. The money that you pledge will help\ncover all of the reoccurring fees associated with\nproducing a paranormal series. Your involvement will\nincrease our production value and all necessary upgrades to paranormal gear by allowing us to stay up to date with the most modern tools. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\nappreciate your support and Happy Haunting,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBilly\nDriver \u0026amp; Mark Morrow\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.strange-town.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.strange-town.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://strange-town.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Patreon_Mark-Billy-Poster.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
