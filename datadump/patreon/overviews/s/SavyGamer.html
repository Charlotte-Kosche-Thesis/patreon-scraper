I like to take a subject where some entity in the games industry is treating consumers\u00a0in a manner which I believe to be unfair, unjust or unreasonable, and present a researched argument explaining my position. This is something I would love to commit more time to doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years I\u0027ve written for publications such as Rock Paper Shotgun, Kotaku UK, Eurogamer \u0026amp; VG247. In theory I could pitch articles to some of these publications to do more of the same, but much of the appeal of writing to me is to be able to do so on my own terms. It\u0027s extremely difficult to make a reliable income from freelance writing about video games without making compromises in some areas I am disinclined to. I\u0027m not particularly interested in regurgitating press releases or retyping stories reported elsewhere without adding anything of substance, and I don\u0027t enjoy playing games with the explicit purpose of\u00a0reviewing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy funding articles through Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to set aside far more time to them, whilst still hopefully being able to achieve and maintain that dream of financial security.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some examples, just a few samples, of the kind of articles I\u0027m looking to write more of:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/2015/01/26/heres-why-ubisoft-are-dummies-and-hypocrites-for-revoking-uplay-keys-bought-from-unauthorised-distributors/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u2019s Why Ubisoft Are Dummies And Hypocrites For Revoking uPlay Keys Bought From Unauthorised Distributors\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/2014/07/18/lying-with-data-a-lesson-in-microsoft-spin/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLying with Data: A lesson in Microsoft spin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/2014/04/30/paying-for-coverage-the-comodification-of-exposure/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePaying For Coverage: The Comodification Of Exposure\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/2014/02/25/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfares-post-release-microtransactions-are-asking-for-customer-disapointment/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePlants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare\u2019s Post Release Microtransactions Are Asking For Customer Disappointment\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/2014/03/24/steam-tags-how-valve-are-controlling-the-discussion-of-games-on-their-storefront/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSteam Tags: How Valve Are Controlling The Discussion Of Games On Their Storefront\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/2014/02/20/when-free-to-play-isnt-free-to-play-a-steam-early-access-conundrum/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhen Free To Play Isn\u2019t Free To Play: A Steam Early Access Conundrum\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/2014/01/05/konamis-consumer-hostile-region-locking-is-a-bad-thing/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKonami\u2019s Consumer Hostile Region Locking Is A Bad Thing\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set this Patreon to charge once per \"Article\", rather than on a monthly basis. My aim is to write roughly one article a month, but I will only be writing an article if there is something interesting for me to write about. In my mind, one of the great benefits to Patreon as a model is that I\u0027ll never be in the situation of having to write an article on a subject that\u0027s not all that interesting to me, or where I\u0027ve not got anything particularly worthwhile to contribute.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll never charge more than once a month. In the event that I decide to write two things in a given month, I\u0027ll only charge once. So if you are considering becoming a SavyGamer Patron, I\u0027d recommend budgeting your contribution on the basis of it being a monthly charge, but in reality it could be less frequent than that (but never more frequent). Where applicable, I\u0027ll publish short updates discussing any subsequent developments without charging again.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is exclusively for funding me writing articles in addition to the work I do posting deals on SavyGamer. That work will be in no way limited or interrupted, and under no circumstances will there be any tiered service for SavyGamer. SavyGamer is and will remain entirely free of adverts.\u003cbr\u003e"
