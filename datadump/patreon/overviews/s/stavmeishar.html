Half circus and theater performer, half Jewish educator, I\u0027m working on an amazing project that needs YOUR help. It combines historical research, theater, circus, puppets, and education all rolled into one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Escape Act \u003c/em\u003e(formerly \u003cem\u003eRun Away, Join the Circus\u003c/em\u003e) is based on true events in the life of Irene, a young Jewish acrobat who survived the holocaust hiding and working at the German Althoff Circus. Irene and her family were embraced by the circus owner Adolf Althoff and his wife Maria, and passed the years of World War II performing on its stage, running to hide whenever the Nazis came for inspections. This is a 60-minute one-woman theater play, incorporating elements of circus and puppetry.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of the show happens on a static trapeze, the mental place in which Irene remembers her time at the Althoff Circus. The puppets, mostly found objects and shadow puppets, are the other characters inhabiting her world as told through her eyes. She juggles, clowns, and brings her experiences and the people who shared them to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe play examines Irene\u0027s life between 1933 and 1945: from a young teen experiencing the rise of the Third Reich, through joining the circus undercover, to falling in love and starting her own family - all under the protection of the Althoff Circus from the threat of the Nazis. Their story is full of hope, love and compassion, depicting the brave deeds of good people who made the choice not to stand idly by. In one of history\u0027s darkest hours, their story shines as a beacon of courage and humanity in the face of fascism\u0027s cowardice and hatred.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe performance will be offered in conjunction with an exhibition and a workshop\u003c/u\u003e: Before the show, the audience will enter the venue through a photographic exhibition of the people whose lives the show was based on, photographs that will bring to life the time, the place, and its inhabitants. The exhibition is made in conjunction with \u003ca href=\"http://www.divergingfates.eu/index.php/2017/02/22/project-description/\"\u003eDiverging Fates\u003c/a\u003e, an international academic team researching circus people in Europe under National Socialism."

     "about": "a performer artist who bends and blends the limits of theater, music and circus; a true renaissance woman, Stav is determined to leave no performance skill unexplored.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBorn and raised in Israel, Stav had her professional stage debut at the age of 10 on the Israeli National Tour of \u201cOliver!\u201d, and hasn\u0027t left the stage since.\u003cbr\u003e\nStav is a graduate of Israel\u2019s prestigious performing arts high school \u201cThelma-Yellin\u201d, where she graduated cum laude as a theater major, with leading roles in all productions. During her high school years she won the International French Chansons Competition \u2013 twice! \u2013 which sent her to study for two summers in the French countryside; and participated in the run of \u201cThe Rocky Horror Show\u201d as both Janet and Magenta.\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\tAfter playing Elphaba in the Israeli premiere of the musical \u201cWicked\u201d Stav moved to NYC to pursue her Musical Theatre education. Her first job upon graduation was with the Yiddish Theater Folksbiene and she hasn\u0027t stopped performing since - all over American and oversees.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\tThough Stav\u0027s a traditional Thespian by training, she\u0027s been experimenting with different performance skills including ukulele playing, circus arts and poi spinning. She has created a one woman act - the dUKEss of Rock - that combines the beautiful language of Shakespeare with popular songs on the ukulele and performs with it at various events.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\tIn 2012 Stav founded \u003ca href=\"http://www.petitemortproductions.org/\"\u003ePetite Mort Productions\u003c/a\u003e, an alternative performance company with a priority commitment to help develop original works of theater, music, dance, circus, poetry, puppetry, film and more. A home for the outsiders and the misfits, the company was created to provide an outlet for artists of every discipline whose works are innovative, unique and perhaps a bit strange.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\tWhen Stav isn\u0027t performing she teaches and educates children of all ages all around the Tri-State area under the umbrella of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dreamcoatexperience.com/\"\u003eDreamcoat Experience\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\tHer mission in life: Spread love and glitter everywhere.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\n\t\u003c/div\u003e",
