I\u0027ve been privileged to be  followed by some amazing people and its\u0027 only fueled me to create even better poetry. You give me an outlet to create what I love and in that, I couldn\u0027t be any more grateful.\u003cbr\u003eNow begins the move to the next level. Countless people have asked me why I don\u0027t monetize my writing and poetry. At first, I looked at this as selfish. While having a conversation with a young follower asking advice from me (I get that alot for some reason), I told her my opinion on monetization. She was a little taken aback and told me, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"People are paid to do their dreams and what they love all the time. Why can\u0027t you?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e So she had me taken aback in that moment. And then I truly thought to myself,\u003cem\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\"She\u0027s right. Why not me?\" \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026lt;deep breath\u0026gt;\u003c/em\u003e so I\u0027ve decided to jump onto Patreon. There I will be posting most of what I have here. And there will be Patreon-only postings which will go exclusive. I hope you will support me in this.  some of my short and long-term goals for doing this will be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-the publication of my first book in both print and digital, comprising of 500 works not featured anywhere else. This will be aimed for a Summer 2018 release with a self-funded East Coast Book Tour as I have followers in every state. We\u0027ll go bigger to country-wide depending on the response. And if my expectations are totally blown away? Well, I\u0027ll be coming to your part of the world soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The creation of a monthly webzine featuring new and upcoming writers and creators\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The creation of a non-profit to offer advice, direction and self-publishing help to struggling and upcoming writers.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me on these endeavors.\u003cbr\u003eLove and light.\u003cbr\u003eNamaste\u0027, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eStephen\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
