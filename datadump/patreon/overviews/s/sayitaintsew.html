    "summary": "My name is Iona and I set up Say It Ain\u0027t Sew 6 whole years ago when I found out that the beloved art of sewing was being phased out of the Scottish education system.\u003cbr\u003eWTF?\u003cbr\u003eSewing in the UK was formerly known as that thing your mum or gran did when you were little, you know, like making you and forcing you to wear embarrassing brightly-coloured outfits. Or the thing that you got made to do in school where you were taught how to make a frog filled with dried split peas by a disgruntled and terrifying home economics teacher. Latterly, sewing has been brought to our TV screens by the twee and repetitive Great British Sewing Bee or Kirstie\u0027s Homemade Home. These are all great at giving our historic skill of sewing a boost with the latest traditional crafts, but like everything else, it just gets forgotten about. Or found in the Woolworths bargain bin (if Woolworths still existed).\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is to shake up and re-ignite the world recognised art of sewing and to secure its rightful place in the home of the 21st century.\u003cbr\u003eWhy Iona, WHY?\u003cbr\u003eI have been sewing for a long time. Like many other creatives, I suffer from stress, anxiety and depression. Spending a short amount of time every week has been proven to increase the reward factor chemicals that tell the anxiety and stress parts of our brain \"BACK OFF, I\u0027M HAVING FUN RIGHT NOW\". Also, sewing was traditionally a group activity that brought people together through one universal language.\u003cbr\u003eSay It Ain\u0027t Sew runs FREE sewing classes in and around Scotland. Yes, I said FREE. They are FREE because we feel that sewing should be accessible by all, no matter their skill level, background, gender, age, race, orientation, location and financial situation. Literally everyone and anyone should be able to sew.\u003cbr\u003eThrough keeping it free and giving people a taster for the art, we can support and introduce new customers to more advanced sewing clubs and classes that may be available in towns and cities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re all pals here.\u003cbr\u003eBy giving people a bit of encouragement and some few basic skills of how to thread a needle and how to do a running stitch, a whole world is opened up in front of their eyes: \"Hey! I can sew this patch on to my ripped jeans\", or \"Woah, I can build a tent to sleep in on my next trip to the Andes\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSewing is an integral part of our heritage on this big rock we call home, and I intend to shake it up, blow the dust off it (and your gran\u0027s old sewing machine) and shoot it into the 21st century like a laser beam PEW PEW!"

     "about": "I grew up in the gorgeous countryside of Dumfries and Galloway, south west Scotland. After completing my degree in fashion design in Glasgow, I set up my own costume design business. I got the chance to work with world renowned artists and performers when they came into the country and quickly became the go-to costume designer in Scotland. After a stint working in the fashion industry in London, England, I returned to Glasgow feeling deflated and down. My biggest motivation was to inspire others to create and so in May 2010 I began a small sewing class in a bar in Glasgow. Six years later and Say It Ain\u0027t Sew is quickly becoming a recognised name in crafts and creativity. \u00a0",
