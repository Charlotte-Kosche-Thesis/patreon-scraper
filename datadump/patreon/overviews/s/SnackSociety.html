    "summary": "I\u0027m Brandon Edwards (Brandonryche), Creator and for all intents and purposes, the CEO of the SnackFood Appreciation Society. Since 2012, the #SnackSociety has been providing entertaining and informative fast food, junk food, and snack reviews on YouTube, all the while hosting a friendly and welcoming community on Facebook. As the channel grows, so does production cost and well, honestly the cost of life. Due to a recent loss of employment, funds for the #SnackSociety\u0027s programs are at an all-time low. I am experiencing difficult time in finding suitable replacement employment in part due to an extremely bad back which limits the jobs I can take at my skill level. The ACA (Obamacare) dropped my health insurance coverage at a time when I can not afford to sustain treatment for my back as well as crushing nightly headaches that can only be relieved by expensive specialized medicine ($50/dose) or medical oxygen. Medicaid is not an option.\u00a0 The vehicle used to film many of our shows is in need of repair, threatening the on-going production of these titles. As we approach many milestones, it would be ideal for us to upgrade our production equipment and produce more involved and interesting videos for our SnackerStars worldwide. If you consider yourself one of us and would like to help keep the #SnackSociety strong and viable, as well as make my life a little easier while looking for a new job,\u00a0 please also consider assisting us in continuing to bring you only the best in Snack food entertainment. Thank you for being the best friends and family we could have on Youtube, in our Facebook Group, and across all of social media.\u003cbr\u003e"
