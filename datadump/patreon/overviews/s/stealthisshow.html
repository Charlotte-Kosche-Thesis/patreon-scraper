They dominate how we interact with each\nother and see the world. Facebook\ncontrols social media, Google owns search and email, Amazon runs cloud hosting, Apple and\nGoogle control our phones. And the internet we all rely on functions by monetizing the surveillance of billions of people - monetizing the stuff our lives are made of. The tools that promised to increase our potential to create, share and distribute, that offered us\u00a0unimaginable freedom online, are now also powerful mechanisms for\nauthoritarianism and control. And the agendas of these huge tech companies - Big Social, Big Content, Big Data - have actually started to drive us apart, quantifying and filtering us into bubbles that are hard to get out of. We\u0027re in a precarious situation, to put it mildly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this isn\u0027t the whole story. We have\u003cstrong\u003e our own\u003c/strong\u003e agendas.The original spirit of the net is still here, and even the hugest, most Behemothic platforms are having unexpected effects that can open up new opportunities and places to act. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom P2P technologies like\nBitTorrent and Bitcoin, to people who see and use technology in a different way, who work towards different outcomes, STEAL THIS SHOW brings you stories of an information revolution that still has the potential create the world we want - from pirates, technologists, renegade thinkers, idealists and media radicals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSounds ambitious?
