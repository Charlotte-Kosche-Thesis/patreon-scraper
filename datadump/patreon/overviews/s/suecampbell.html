    "summary": "My children turned me into the writer I always wanted to be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I was childless, I was pretty damn lazy. That first kid, a daughter, lit a fire under me. I had to show my girl how to live your dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I started a mommy blog. Eight years later, I have a second daughter (still an infant), my own\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.suecampbellpdx.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efreelance writing business\u003c/a\u003e with a small stable of clients, a completed kids\u0027 novel, a literary agent and a second book underway. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHot damn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut it turns out, I have very little energy leftover after the paying the bills with words to stay in touch with my mommy blogging roots. Which sucks, because I think my blog has been the place I\u0027ve done some of my best work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve sold parenting pieces to big sites (Scary Mommy, Mamalode, etc) but I have a few problems with doing that. Most of them want your copyrights. And most of them want pieces that have a very specific tone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I have a specific tone of my own. I\u0027m not loving selling pieces of my innermost mind told in a tone that\u0027s not entirely mine. And for a pittance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I\u0027m trying an experiment based on the principle that money creates a deeper engagement. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a professional writer, I bust my ass to please my clients. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a reader, I engage more deeply with content I\u0027ve paid to read. I\u0027m not saying that\u2019s right or wrong, it just is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings with dollars attached tend to get more care and attention from makers and consumers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I\u0027m putting aside my midwestern humility and asking you this question:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf something I\u0027ve written at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mommyspen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMommy\u0027s Pen\u003c/a\u003e has spoken to you, would you be willing to pay a buck or two to read another thing like it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most I\u0027ll blog is twice per month. And that\u0027s my stretch goal. Once every month or two is far more likely. Either way, I promise not to run you into the poor house by suddenly becoming a hugely prolific blogger (and you can set a monthly limit when you pledge). And I promise not to just spit out some trash so I can hear a cash register sound in my head. I\u0027ll work hard to post something worth reading. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m itching to write about Nora\u0027s developmental phase: the nine-year-change. This is a Waldorf concept that I wish more parents knew about. It\u0027s a big deal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll throw in a buck. But even if you don\u0027t support me, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll look through \u003ca href=\"http://Patreon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://Patreon.com\u003c/a\u003e and find an artist whose work makes you shout, \u201cYes!\u201d and support them instead. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a fantastic tool helping artists make the art we so desperately need. And you get to play the role of patron of the arts! Go ahead, dress up like Lorenzo de\u0027 Medici if you want. I won\u0027t tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy humble thanks for your consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSue\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
