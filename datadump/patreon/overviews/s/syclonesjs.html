It has surpassed over 2 million downloads since release and has had well over 2000 hours of work put into it by myself from the very start with around 5-8 hours work put into it per day over the course of two years. Its also the only official pack tied in with the Minecraft shaders mod known as SEUS and I am good friends and work closely with the creator Sonic Ether.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI\u0027m the creator of this project am an experienced graphics artist who in my younger years spent 10 years in the games industry. I took to making Chroma Hills back in 2012 as a stress release when a business I ran had to close I learned how much fun it was to put your own vision in the blocky world of Minecraft and it gave me great satisfaction to be making game content again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 179, 215);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWhy Support Me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFirstly, I was unaware of Patreon until some fans of my work asked me if I was on it \u00a0so I looked into it further. It could really be the answer for everyone for development of Chroma Hills RP! I am based in the UK so the goals i\u0027m looking at reflect converting dollars to pounds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://puu.sh/b4FDt/fe4b63b3aa.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 137px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eAs much as I love to put in 1000\u0027s of hours of work into this project for the enjoyment of\u00a0hundreds of thousands of fans for free, it is extremely difficult to continue at the rate it currently needs to keep up with the ever updating game. As well as expand it into the huge mod scene as I am asked to do on a daily basis. Some of the mods people want supported are twice as big as the actual pack and I\u0027m still not up to date with that. I\u0027m a 39 yr old designer/artist and have a family \u0026amp; commitments to support. The pack takes a tremendous amount of my time and with your support I could actually get some financial benefit that would allow me to continue to commit to its ongoing development and expansion as well as stop having to justify to my family that I\u0027m not stark raving bonkers doing all this hours a day! :)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a nut shell your support and motivation would allow me to continue producing the resource pack at a faster rate. With your support I plan on producing lots more content that everyone will enjoy and to provide regular updating without waiting so long and I think most importantly support for the most popular mod packs out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://puu.sh/b4G4E/8879f8779c.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 122px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis is where you come in. By supporting me on Patreon you can help make\u00a0this\u00a0happen. By reaching the goals I have set it enables me to stop worrying about looking for other work that slows down the development of the resource pack and other related endeavors but allows me to branch out with you and the community to help make this one of the most god damn awesome resource packs in the world (maybe) :D and finally add full support for the requested 32x version I am asked for daily!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are able to support me in this way or not please continue to use the resource pack and tell your friends as every little step helps make this community-backed project a reality for me and provides some awesome rewards for \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e supporting me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo sum up I IMMENSELY enjoy working on Chroma Hills but as just one artist the level of commitment to continue for years to come is a tall order so i\u0027m reaching out to the community to see who can help keep this candle burning bright. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening and I\u0027m over overwhelmed at how many enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
