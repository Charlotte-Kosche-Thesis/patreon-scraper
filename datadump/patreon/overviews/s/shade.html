    "summary": "Hi! On the Internets I go by Shade. Since 2002 I\u0027ve been a freelance comic artist, using commission work as my primary means of income. For years it was my dream to create my own comic and work on it full-time. Wanting to do a comic in parallel to commission work isn\u0027t easy, though, since they both require a lot of time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to some very generous backers via another site, I was able to produce the first two issues of my superheroine comic, Sinsationals: issues #0 and #1. However, I\u0027m a one-man publishing house and handle all of the creative and business duties; from plotting to writing to the art, coloring, lettering, editing, promotion and sales, I\u0027m doing everything to produce my comic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial crowd-funding campaigns helped immensely, but\u00a0I wanted to go beyond what current crowd-funding methods I was utilizing. I wanted to allow people to be able to access content for a cheaper overall entry price. There were other issues, as well...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2013/286/c/a/sinsationals__0_now_available__by_theartofshade-d6qamtf.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://th06.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2014/103/b/5/get_sinsationals_comics_here__by_theartofshade-d739tq6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe issue with crowd-funding I wanted to address was that I didn\u0027t want backers to have to wait several months to receive my comics after their initial pledge. I wanted to be able to give consistent, high-quality content to backers quickly and directly, as pages are completed, rather than having to wait until the entire comics are done. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. Backers can support my comic and get access to pages immediately after they\u0027re done in more of a webcomic format. To note, I will still be collecting the pages into proper issues and then providing the PDFs/CBRs to subscribers for them to download.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe message you should take away, though, is this: \u003cstrong\u003eYou don\u0027t pay until I deliver content.\u003c/strong\u003e If you don\u0027t like the content you\u0027re free to cancel your subscription at any time. This motivates me to create the best possible artwork and story and puts backers in the position where they\u0027re risking very little.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this end I\u0027m asking for your help. If you like my work and want to see more of Sinsationals-- including, but not limited to, pinups, sketches, webcomics, other merch--please feel free to subscribe and claim the reward(s) that appeal to you the most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/104/f/9/girls_robot_fight_new_sm_by_theartofshade-d7eg8ve.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want fans and backers to have a direct line to me to be able to give me feedback on what they want to see in regards to the comic so I can produce the best work you want to see! I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting Sinsationals!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE for NEW PATRONS: Just to be clear: all archived content, SFW and NSFW, is made available to new patrons via email after their first month\u0027s pledge cycle clears! Thanks so much, guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
