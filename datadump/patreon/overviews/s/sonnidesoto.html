And that\u0027s something I want to continue. I like sharing with you all. I enjoy the process of doing what I love and the results that allow a person in Indonesia or England or Seattle or down the street from me to see what I have to offer in a way they otherwise never would have. And I don\u0027t want to deny someone accessibility to it based on something as base as money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is not about charging people for my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blog posts and stories and photos that I normally post, I will continue to post and put out there for free for anyone who cares to enjoy them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than anything, this Patreon account is an attempt to make the creative process a bit more collaborative. Instead of just posting about topics and stories that I feel are interesting when and how I want to, I want to hear from you. Want me to post more often? Want me to post more about a specific topic? Want me to answer a question? Want a story featuring your favorite characters? Want to be featured as a character in one of my stories? Want to see my next novel hit digital shelves a little faster? Pledge a little something and let me know. I want to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause, as I\u0027ve said before, if you\u0027re willing to reach out to me, I am more than thrilled to do what I can to reach back.\u003cbr\u003e"
