Trained in literature and drama at the University of Alberta, I have since worked in theatre, film, new media, performance art, and the visual arts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the founder and artistic director of \u003cem\u003ePretentious Productions\u003c/em\u003e, presenting experimental performance outside of the academic institution. I practice art as research, investigating the performance medium and challenging industry and social paradigms through the creation and presentation of creative works. My projects advocate critical engagement and the decentralisation and degentrification of knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis past summer, I completed a cross-Canada tour of my show, \u003cem\u003eShadowlands\u003c/em\u003e, which was performed in the dark. It was nominated for the Calgary Fringe Emerging Artist Award as well as the Vancouver Fringe Artistic Risk Award. The tour gratefully received travel support from the Edmonton Arts Council. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrevious work includes \u003cem\u003eThe Annotated Autobiography of Leone McGregor\u003c/em\u003e, where the script was projected in real-time and was as present and active as the actors onstage. It experimented\u00a0 with the idea of a performative text. For \u003cem\u003eARTifacts of Protest\u003c/em\u003e, I marched in one of the largest political protests in history and then archived and recreated that experience with a gallery of mannequins. \u003cem\u003ePlay\u003c/em\u003e was a performance installation piece that, among other things, involved dancing blindfolded in the streets with strangers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a past Dramaturgy and Literary Management Intern with Workshop West Playwrights\u2019 Theatre and a current Artistic Intern with Ghost River Theatre. I am currently in the Alberta Playwrights\u2019 Network Mentorship Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExamples of my work can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.savannaharvey.ca\"\u003ewww.savannaharvey.ca\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance to everyone for their support!
