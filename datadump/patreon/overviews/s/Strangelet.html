    "summary": "Being a talented writer is tough. Making a living at this\ncraft that we love takes more than hard work and a college degree \u2013 it takes\ngrit, risk, and a dose of good luck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile most of us can\u2019t count on landing a book deal with a\nbig publisher in the foreseeable future, one way writers and artists can\nparticipate in the art community you love is publishing with small presses and\nliterary magazines.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eStrangelet is part of that indie community, and like many\nother small publishers, we don\u2019t make much money doing what we love. What we\nvalue is publishing great speculative fiction and other works by new authors\nand paying them for the writing that they do. It\u2019s important to us to have\nno-fee submissions as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eStrangelet\u2019s staff members, alumni of Emerson College in\nBoston, Massachusetts, volunteer our time and talents to curate a collection of\nspeculative fiction, poetry, and art six times a year. We are proud to publish\nan international group of contributors and artists.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eUnlike some literary journals, Strangelet\u2019s\npublishing team has no outside funding other than the cash in our own pockets \u2013\nand since most of us spend our days in modestly-paid publishing jobs, we would\nlike to ask your help to support the work that we do to support authors and\nindies in the science-fiction-fantasy community. Do you have a dollar? Do you have\nten dollars? You can contribute to the Strangelet cause through Patreon, this crowdfunding\nplatform for supporting the arts. Every little bit helps us pay our writers on\na per-word rate and promote their work to the widest audience we can.\u003ca href=\"http://www.strangeletjournal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
