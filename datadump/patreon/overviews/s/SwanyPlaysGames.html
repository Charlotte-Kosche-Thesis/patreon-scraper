What originally started out as just uploading a few Battlefront killstreaks has turned into something more. A lot of you guys really enjoy watching me play, and that\u0027s awesome! I try my best to upload daily but it\u0027s hard to do with a job. The reason I created this Patreon was so that hopefully I can make enough money with this and Youtube to release better quality content for you guys. I already have plans on adding commentary with myself along with some of my friends but getting all the right equipment is expensive. I also currently live in a very rural area (out in the country) so my internet isn\u0027t the greatest, preventing me from live streaming. Hopefully with the help of you guys and Patreon I can save up the money to speed up the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for all your support!\u00a0"
