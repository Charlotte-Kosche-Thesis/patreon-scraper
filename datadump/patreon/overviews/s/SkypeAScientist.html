We also need to pay for web hosting for our matching confirmation program, among other small things. One of our goals is to increase advertising to places that we think our program will do the most good- in rural and underserved areas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis initiative has gone farther than we ever thought possible in January 2017, and we want to keep the momentum going!
