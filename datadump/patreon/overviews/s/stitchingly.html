    "summary": "Almost a year ago I had an idea for a cross stitch version of Ravelry and I posted in several Facebook groups to see if anyone was interested. After being overwhelmed with positive feedback and fellow stitchers offering ideas and suggestions I started creating the site. It has been a labour of love to get to this point and since it currently does not make any money I struggle to fit it in around my full time job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this page so stitchers who would like to see the site progress faster and all of the amazing features we are currently dreaming of can implimented can donate to make this dream a reality. We now have nearly 1000 members on the site which I never dreamed was possible when I made the first posts about it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the minute we are doing everything on a tiny budget that isn\u0027t going to last much longer. I currently have two amazing assistants working a few hours a week to help make the site a successs and all the development and programming is completely down to me. We have so many things we want to add to the site to make it something that fellow stitchers really find useful. Any donations will go towards making sure the site can keep growing and developing.\u00a0"
