    "summary": "Hello, hello, hello! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, I want to take a moment to thank you. Yes, you. You reading this. You who are taking time out of your day to read about my goals, my dreams, and my creations. It has taken me a long time to shape what Flume aims to be and what impact I hope to have by creating art and putting it into the world. I\u0027m a big believer that a community is what makes a project successful, and I would not be here, writing to you, if not for you. You have supported me, inspired me, encouraged me, challenged me, and guided me intentionally and unintentionally every step of the way. Thank you, so much, sincerely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, the question is - what am I doing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very beginning, my rough shape for Flume was a collective of artists coming together to share resources, materials, teachings and group critique/discussions with. I am but one person, one part of a machine that does not function without a whole. My hope is that someday, Flume will be one studio which is part of a greater collective of artists willing to donate their time to share their craft with the world. The collective will provide art supplies needed for 10-12 classes depending on size (essentially enough supplies to host classes of 5-8 people once a month for 10-12 months, or the duration of one whole year). There are countless studies that prove the benefits of an active source of creation for a community, and there is an empty space where easy access to these resources are readily available to any creator willing to share their gift. I hear from my friends, both creators and people who would be creators, that they wish they had an affordable and accessible place to create with other individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe through art we can all achieve a more mindful and content sense of being, and through art we can begin to understand the many intricacies and differences in humanity as spectacular and spontaneous and surprising and all-together amazing. The innate ability human beings have to create is a gift, and our job in return is to create: each action, but art especially, is simply the Universe trying to understand itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we approach the question which has daunted me so long: where do we start? How do we begin? The search for the answer to this question has led me here. This is where you, my dear friend, come in: by subscribing to my monthly Patreon, you will receive fun goodies from monthly postcards, custom digital illustrations, access to exclusive content and tutorials, and even trinkets such as t-shirts and tote-bags as we move into accumulated donations. You will have exclusive access to live-chats and web broadcasts of first events, and then eventually class sessions, during which time they can contribute to discussion through a chat room and receive real-time feedback from artists also creating, and much more as Flume continues to grow. By subscribing to my Patreon, you are helping finance me forward so I can focus on making this dream my reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is possible, thanks to you. You are the charming gardeners of this world. All proceeds from this Patreon will go to funding these classes and eventually acquiring a small business license in order to continue expanding nationally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all starts here, with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find yourself unable to commit to a monthly subscription you can also support Flume by following my instagram @studio.flume,\u003cbr\u003eliking and subscribing Flume Holistic Art and Teachings on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/studio.flume/?ref=bookmarks\"\u003eFacebook \u003c/a\u003e, checking out Flume Holistic Art and Teachings on \u003ca href=\"https://flumestudio.wixsite.com/flume\"\u003eWix\u003c/a\u003e, or coming out to events where I am participating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour interest, participation and audience have brought me here and I want to take one last moment to thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Together, we can create something beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e"
