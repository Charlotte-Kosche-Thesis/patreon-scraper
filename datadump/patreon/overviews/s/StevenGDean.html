Simple: to\u00a0become a wizard. How? I may be a writer, but my power starts and ends at my keyboard, so let me explain. Until my mid-20s, writing was an impossible dream. With the love of a beautiful woman, it became a possible dream. With your support, dreams can become reality - and that, my new friend, makes you a wizard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit of history\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI managed to plough through enough of the 9-5 to write\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Night-Woke-Up-Anastasia-Knight-ebook/dp/B01MECBNCA/ref=pd_sbs_351_1?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;psc=1\u0026amp;refRID=JR1XNN57RW9HTXCW16KZ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea short story\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Godless-Times-Steven-G-Dean-ebook/dp/B01MA0ZKDM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1489608094\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=in+godless+times\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy first novel\u003c/a\u003e, and self-publish them, but it was a struggle that took over two years. I\u0027m glad I did it, slog though it was. I proved to myself, as much as anyone else, what I could achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did everything except the cover art myself - drafting, editing, proofreading, formatting, publicising, everything. I suspect it shows in the finished work, but after writing and re-writing every day for two years, there came a point when I wanted the project finished so I could move on to the next one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The next one\" is where I am now. Having had proof of concept with \u003cem\u003eIn Godless Times,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I am writing a series of fantasy novels and I want to give them the time and attention to make them as good as they can be. I\u0027d also like to explore the worlds of Ana Knight and a few other short-story characters scattered in notebooks around my home, but I barely have time to work on main projects, never mind indulge side ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you would come in. With your support, I\u0027d be able to devote more time to writing and share more of \u003cdel\u003emy fianc\u00e9e\u0027s\u003c/del\u003e my \u003cem\u003ecompletely original\u003c/em\u003e ideas with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do I publish?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a full-time job and I write for fun. I\u0027m not shackled to my computer hammering out words at a supersonic pace, and I wouldn\u0027t charge patrons for any project below novel length (let\u0027s say a minimum of 100,000 words). It\u0027s unlikely my current project, \u003cem\u003eShadow of a Second\u003c/em\u003e, will be ready for release before 2020 - of course, if all goes well here I might be able to bring that timescale forwards, but you\u0027d be in the loop via the blog if that happened!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m not going to chip away at your savings with monthly releases, but I can guarantee your investment will be appreciated and will keep me on track to deliver. It will also probably lead to more short stories, which you may or may not get access to for free depending on your level of support, because I tend to work on those when I have writer\u0027s block. It\u0027s the standard equation: more investment means more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso you\u0027ll be a wizard.\u003cbr\u003e"
