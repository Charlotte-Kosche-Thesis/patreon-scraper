    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSteampunk Farms\u003c/strong\u003e started with the simple goal of adopting rather than shopping when developing our homestead. What we learned from the moment we opened our barn to rescued livestock was life-changing. We\u0027ve since committed ourselves to \u003cstrong\u003eproviding sanctuary to over 150 chickens, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys, and more\u003c/strong\u003e. These animals come from previous situations of abuse, neglect, abandonment, and worse, and we are honored to be their caretakers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it isn\u0027t enough to love and care for the animals lucky enough to find us. Without public education and outreach, rescue is only a band-aid over the bullet hole that is animal abuse and exploitation. In contrast to our rivals - primarily the commercial beef, pork, poultry, dairy, and egg industries - we know that farmed animals are emotional, intellectual beings deserving of our respect.\u00a0Thus, we also aim to provide opportunities for people to \u003cstrong\u003emeet\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eour animals and learn their stories. To create meaningful bonds that change hearts and minds\u003c/strong\u003e. For those unable to visit the farm, we also\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ecreate engaging educational materials that teach fact-based compassion\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are grateful for your sponsorship and support in helping us grow. \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e"
