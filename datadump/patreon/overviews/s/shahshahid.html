    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eShah\u003c/strong\u003e, shortened from a name that requires 5 minutes of linguistic training and phonetic diagrams to properly pronounce. This... is my journey. Or something more eloquent. \u003cem\u003e(It\u0027s better if you imagine that as a William Shatner voice-over.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy love for movies has been an influence of my father\u0027s since childhood, starting with \u003cstrong\u003eBollywood films\u003c/strong\u003e. And it\u0027s something I now pass on to my kids, teaching them about plot holes, spoiler warning etiquette, the three-act structure and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut being raised by a single mother with financial woes, pursuit of the creative arts was never considered viable. I wielded the written word with ease, and had a passion for movies and storytelling in general. So given that, a career in journalism \u003cem\u003e(somewhat legitimate career in the South Asian community)\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0seemed like the logical educational pursuit, with the least amount of judgemental side-eye. But, after too many viewings of \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Dead Poet\u0027s Society\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e, I finally had the courage to put myself through film school.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile life took over, \u003cem\u003e(debt, parental drama, responsibilities, a family and kids at 23!)\u003c/em\u003e I was never able to leverage my technical education into the career I always wanted; enter the internet! Beginning to \u0027blog\u0027 about movies in 2010, I was eventually able to turn that into a freelance writing career where I rant and rave about movies to anyone willing to read about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this isn\u0027t a sob-story of my failures to exploit money from you, \u003cem\u003e(unless it works)\u003c/em\u003e but rather sharing the intentions with which I started writing about films, and why I will continue to do so with or without any support. While giving up on one\u0027s dreams and ambitions for family is a noble sacrifice, I believe in the opposite. I cannot empower my kids to pursue their own dreams and ambitions if I give up on mine.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eCut to today: I am a \u003cstrong\u003eFreelance\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eEntertainment Writer\u003c/strong\u003e, with my own website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blankpagebeatdown.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(www.blankpagebeatdown.com)\u003c/a\u003e and Editor of a Bollywood website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://indianscreen.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(www.indianscreen.com)\u003c/a\u003e where I review the latest movies, breakdown trailers of upcoming films, report on news, create think pieces about \u00a0the respective industry\u0027s events, as well as a film \u003cstrong\u003ePodcast\u003c/strong\u003e comparing remakes to their original source material.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrying to always watch the latest movies in theatres every week is not cheap. \u003cem\u003e(Neither are the two tiny cinephiles I am raising, but you can\u0027t help much with that. They pay their own way with cute-ness!)\u003c/em\u003e So this page is an attempt to be able to at least break even while pursuing my passion of reviewing films, \u003cem\u003e(for you!)\u003c/em\u003e while also being able to engage with, and give my readers a chance to be involved in kind of content they want to experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo support me as I Carpe Diem the hell out of my life!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
