I go by the name of London on the Greydog Software forums and have been creating character renders for their published games such as the World of Mixed Martial Arts series, Comic Book Hero: The Greatest Cape and the Total Extreme Wrestling series. Some of you may know me as ScottBGaming on Youtube or Twitch (I really must get back to that soon) or maybe simply as Scott. Either way I just wanted to say a big thank you for anybody who is kind enough to send a donation for the work I produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy only rule: Any work I create (even for the second tier) must be made available for everybody to use. A few people had mentioned to me that they would like to offer a donation/s for the character renders I have been producing and I thought why not create a method for people to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong term I hope to be able to increase my output of renders in general and any donations will no doubt go toward buying more materials to use for future character creating (it can be a vicious cycle).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that in no way are donations obligatory, expected, nor am I putting any of my work behind a paywall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor anybody that does donate, please let me know your username on the GDS forums so I can duly thank you."
