Do you enjoy hearing a soft, silky voice read to you on dark nights? Then you\u0027ve come to the right place!\u003cbr\u003eAllow me to introduce myself: I\u0027m a fantasy/horror writer, voice actress, YouTube narrator and Twitch Affiliate. I\u0027m better known by my pseudonym \u0027Stephanie Swan Quills\u0027 in the narration and creepypasta communities.\u003cbr\u003eOn my channel, I read tales new and old, recite poetry (including Shakespeare) and collaborate with others to make works of art. Such as \u0027Katabasis\u0027 by Evan Royalty, \u0027Crisis of Faith\u0027 by 40K Theories. As well as write and perform ASMR roleplays, often with a supernatural theme.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the content of my channel shall continue to be free access to everyone, but I want to be able to follow my passions and focus my full attention on creating wonderful pieces for your entertainment. Enter Patreon!\u003cbr\u003eImagine a storyteller or singer on a stage, they pour their hearts out into their performance and make their fans happy. After the show\u0027s ended, you perhaps buy the performer a drink if you enjoyed their work, as a thanks for entertaining them. This is what I hope to achieve with my Patreon page. This is 100% voluntary, but it\u0027s a way for you to help me continue making content, by buying me a drink of appreciation once a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here\u0027s to macabre tales, fine alcohol, and the boundless support of passionate fans! Cheers!\u003cbr\u003e- The Seraph of Stories\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
