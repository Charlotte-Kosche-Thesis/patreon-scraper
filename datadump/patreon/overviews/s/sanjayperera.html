This page will host short stories, excerpts of writing projects, poems and non-fiction essays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditional info, short version: I am the founding editor of\u003cem\u003e Philosophers for Change\u003c/em\u003e, and the author of\u003cem\u003e A Leap in the Dark\u003c/em\u003e;\u003cem\u003e Trauma Inc. and Other Works: or, How to Read the World and End It\u003c/em\u003e; and the novel\u003cem\u003e Golem \u0026amp; Traum.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong version: I began writing when I was about nine, I began telling stories to friends two years earlier. The old exercise book I scribbled in is still around. It abounds with stories that are primarily speculative. Quite a bit of it is fan-fiction focusing on \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ePlanet of the Apes\u003c/em\u003e. There is also homage to monsters like Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe years went by as I developed my non-fiction: I became a journalist in print and television, and taught at colleges. I have returned to fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last couple of years I worked on a few projects. Some of the ideas were seeded years ago but have only now come into fruition. Recently, I began a novel but it started to disintegrate like bubbles of quicksilver and coalesced into plays, and short stories\u00a0 (some morphed into poems). The result of that process is \u003cem\u003e Trauma Inc. and Other Works: or, How to Read the World and End It.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, a novel did arise from all this falling apart as more ideas regrouped and transformed into a larger project. It shaped into a series called \u003cem\u003eThe Dark and The Light\u003c/em\u003e. The result of that transformation is \u003cem\u003eGolem \u0026amp; Traum\u003c/em\u003e. Currently, I am working on the second book in the series but various other ideas have arisen as a result, and I have expressed them in the new pieces here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese pieces are available to patrons. A lot of the pieces could be termed speculative. Much of the fiction is an exploration of the universe my current writing operates within. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a universe that is dystopian-utopian with a touch of the apocalyptic: that which is revelatory, an uncovering, a bringing to light, moving into disclosure, a slouching towards Bethlehem. This is not so much a preference but a reflection of the times, and where we are in our evolution as a species.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThe essays are an extension of what I have written previously in terms of socio-political commentary, but there is more reflection on the speculative nature of things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA note on contributions: the pledges are per creation but a limit can be set as in a monthly max. That means you will not be charged more than you are comfortable with in the event there are more posts in a given month than usual.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThank you indeed for taking time to read this.
