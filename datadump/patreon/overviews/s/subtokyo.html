    "summary": "Hey guys, Alex here. I\u0027ve been living in Japan for about 6 years now and I\u0027ve been making Subtokyo Youtube Video Blogs on all sorts of awesome things in Japan for almost 4 years now. I love covering Japanese Subculture including anime/manga events, videogames, live action tokusatsu, and more. \u00a0I go to special events, interesting stores and restaurants, and many themed cafes that open up regularly. I made this channel so that I can show many people who like Japan and want to come to Japan the different scenes of awesome things happening around Tokyo. I know many people want to but can\u0027t visit Japan yet so I wanted to be the viewfinder for those people wanting to know what popular things are happening in Japan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last several years, for my enjoyment I\u0027ve been paying out of my pocket to attend all these wonderful events and for all the costs of visiting new and awesome areas. While I enjoy doing so, it does add up and rack up costs- sometimes to the point where if there are multiple events in a month I have to sacrifice one for another. I\u0027ve still got the energy and I\u0027ve still got the hype to explore more of Tokyo, so with your support I can easily cover MORE events and attractions, and possibly even explore more outside of Tokyo as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for watching Subtokyo, and if you can please support this channels patreon, I would love you so much for it. I want to continue bring you awesome peeps awesome content from Japan for much much longer and I will do my best!"
