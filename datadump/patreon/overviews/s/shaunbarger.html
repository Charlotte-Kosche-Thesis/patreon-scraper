    "summary": "Hi everyone. I need help.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt this moment, I\u2019m feeling pretty hopeless. It\u2019s kind of a\nfight through a numbing sort of apathy for me to even write this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLast year, my antidepressant stopped working. Started making\nme physically sick. Had to kick it, and the rest of this year has been a slow\nspiral. Unemployment has been perpetual. Driving Lyft destroyed my car, which I\ncouldn\u2019t afford to fix, and was eventually taken by the city when I became too\ndepressed to keep asking for help moving it across the street on street\ncleaning day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen severe, my depression manifests as an inability to get\nup, move, do anything, enjoy anything. A few months ago, things had gotten so\nbad that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of bed most mornings until 1pm, when I\nwould finally become so hungry that my stomach hurt. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAny given day, I\u2019ve only got a few hours of functionality.\nThings were on the up and up, but recently I\u2019ve begun to backslide and I just\nfeel so fucking hopeless, because I just don\u2019t have it in me to fix this. I\nwish I could just close my eyes and fade out of existence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, finally, here I am. Asking for help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI know if I had my full normal spectrum of feelings and all\nthat right now, I\u2019d be shaking as I write this, from the humiliation of having\nto beg for support and share my very personal business with everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd, whether or not you\u2019re able to donate me, please, \u003cem\u003eplease\u003c/em\u003e don\u2019t do that thing people do\nwhere they get all sad faced and concerned when they hear about mental illness\nand being treating me like I\u2019m dying and just get really serious and somber\nevery time I\u2019m around. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI just want to get back to the point that I can laugh about\nthis stuff with people. I just want my friends and family to joke around and be\ngoofy and talk about shit besides my stupid broken brain, or look at me like I\u2019m\ncrazy when I talk about AI and Physics and all the other nerd shit I\u2019ve always\nloved but suddenly elicits concern when spoken by one deeply depressed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve set up a Patreon page instead of a GoFundme. I don\u2019t\nwant a handout, I just want to continue writing, continue learning how to\nprogram, engage with people, share my work, and not have to worry about\nstarving because I\u2019m too tired and sick to feed myself or work a job to pay my\nbills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt would make me so profoundly happy to send people whatever\nI\u2019ve been working on every couple of weeks. To workshop other people\u2019s writing while\ngetting feedback on my own, and to feel like an actual human being who has\nsomething to offer even though I\u2019m sick, which I didn\u2019t choose to be and CAN\u2019T\njust will-power my way through. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m sorry to ask for help. Sorry if I\u2019m letting anyone down\nby not being able to carry my own weight in life right now. Anything you can\nthrow my way would mean so much. I\u2019m just really tired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks, everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n-Shaun\u003cbr\u003e"
