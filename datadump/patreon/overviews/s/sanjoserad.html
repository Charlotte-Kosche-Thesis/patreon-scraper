     "about": "We are Regeneration Against Destruction (R.A.D), we believe that we exist in a world that is constantly being destroyed, we are here to take a stand and regenerate it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have come together to challenge the destruction we see daily in our lives, our community, and our world. The destruction we see includes injustice, oppression, inequality, violence, and corruption. Injustice in our lives looks like people in all positions of power who overlook or silence others. Oppression in our lives takes the form of the many daily abuses we face as women, youth, migrants, people of color, queer, and poor people. Inequality in our lives is embedded in the institutions we have to navigate, like schools, prisons, hospitals, and other public spaces where we see some get a lot and many get little to nothing. Violence in our lives is systemic, interpersonal, and internal, it happens all the time in families, in communities, and in individuals who want to commit acts of self- destruction. Corruption in our lives can be seen with the interactions between people who would rather screw each other over than support them, who would rather see people fail, than help them succeed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn response to all of this destruction, we have identified the ways in which people, communities, and the world is regenerating against its own destruction. Everyday individuals struggle against this destruction alone or in silence. We as R.A.D. have begun to build a movement to unify our struggles to make them more powerful. We plan to disrupt this destruction with forms of regeneration that include, but are not limited to the following: \u003cbr\u003eFree Markets for the houseless community\u003cbr\u003eCommunity Skill Shares\u003cbr\u003eYouth Knowledge Circles\u003cbr\u003ePeoples Media Productions\u003cbr\u003eGrow your own feed your own garden boxes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that people around us are always regenerating against this destruction in their own ways. By committing to more united actions we believe we can make the world free of violence, corruption, oppression, inequality, and injustice. Where our collective liberation is acknowledged and we can overcome any and all obstacles that are in our way.",
