    "summary": "Writing Tiki history books is a labor of love. Every trip to dig through a photo album or scrap book can cost thousands of dollars. Buying images on eBay, etc. is money spent for something that may never be used, but you have to get it or it\u0027s lost. I\u0027m doing it when and how I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe history is slipping away. Those who lived it are passing from this earth and taking the incredible stories with them. Their photo albums are tossed. \u003cstrong\u003eThe time is now.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany friends have asked to donate to the cause. I don\u0027t like taking money from friends, but this isn\u0027t cheap or easy and every delay makes it harder and sometimes impossible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSupporting this work helps make it happen. It helps keep me going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I doing and where will it lead? I want to believe this ends with a new biography of Don Beach, but nothing is certain. What I am certainly doing is putting together a lot of information that is invaluable for a biography. If I don\u0027t do it, I\u0027ll use it to help someone who has the resources to make it happen. My Mai-Kai research opened some doors. Your help will get me through those doors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a long term project. If you\u0027d prefer a one time donation, edit the amount in one of the tiers and then suspend your giving on the next month. Drop me a note to let me know and I\u0027ll try to remind you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have my Mai-Kai book, you need it. It is part one of my Don Beach biography really.
