    "summary": "Thanks for making it to \u003ca href=\"http://secondavenuesagas.com/\"\u003eSecond Ave. Sagas\u0027\u003c/a\u003e Patreon page! Here you can help support me maintain the conversation on improving public transit in New York City. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2006, as a labor of love, I have been writing and editing \u003ca href=\"http://secondavenuesagas.com/\"\u003eSecond Ave. Sagas\u003c/a\u003e, a leading independent news site on transit and transportation policy with a focus on the New York City subway. The site has served as a voice on key transportation issues at a time when our transit network is suffering from the strain of poor management, a lack of investment and decaying infrastructure. Through this work, I have appeared on panels transit issues and am a frequent commentator on local news broadcasts. Through my site and my \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/2avsagas\"\u003eTwitter feed\u003c/a\u003e, I try to be a voice for more transparency and more action on mobility issues that affect millions of New Yorkers every day.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first decade of the site\u0027s life, I covered the costs with some advertising but never had the financial backing to grow out additional features and content. As online advertising has become plagued with malware ads that hijack browsers, I recently made the decision to move to a reader-supported model. I would like your help to maintain and grow the site, first by bringing back a regular podcast and then by producing more quality content. The\nstory about New York\u0027s decaying infrastructure is vital to the future of New York City; more reporting and analysis can help drive the change and\ninvestment that is needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep doing this, I need your help. If enough readers and transit lovers become Patreons of Second Ave. Sagas, I can continue to offer regular updates on an ad-free site while hosting a podcast, and with your support, I may be able to bring on contributors who can add new voices and new perspectives to the site. I\u0027ve set up six tiers for Patreons, each keyed to an amount it may cost to ride the subway in NYC, starting with a $2.75 swipe and moving through a $6.50 express bus ride, a $16 reduced-fare 7-day card, a $32 weekly unlimited, a $60.50 reduced-fare 30-day card, and a $121 monthly unlimited.\u00a0As a Patreon, you will help support the site and can enjoy the rewards, including podcast shout-outs, opportunities to participate in exclusive live-chats or other events and a chance to request post topics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading to the end, and thank you for your years of support. I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a Patreon so I can keep the site running for years to come! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmly,\n\u003cbr\u003eBenjamin Kabak"
