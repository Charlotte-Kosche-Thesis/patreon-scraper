    "summary": "Thank you so much for stopping by. Let me introduce myself. \u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m Shoshanah and I love to create. I am blessed with being multi-talented and\nlove to use all of these skills and talents to create beauty and quality gifts\nor products that inspire; educate; and create health, wellness, meaning,\npurpose, kindness and blessing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I was considering a career, all I could think of was that I love to\ncreate. I love a variety of creative forms including: drawing and painting, ceramics,\nphotography, writing, singing, dancing, music. I love nature and the calm and\ninner peace that comes from spending time in nature or interacting with it in a\nvariety of ways. I am also fascinated by light and how it impacts our world in\nmyriad ways. It was recommended that I become an occupational therapist. The\nidea being that occupational therapy combines all my interests. It does, but I\nstill love to do the creating, not just directing. Besides, I really need many\nproducts in order to serve my clients most effectively.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first job working as a qualified, registered occupational therapist was in\nphysical rehabilitation in a major teaching hospital. I was passionate about\nall that we did and could achieve. But something kept bothering me. As much as\nrehabilitation has improved and we can help clients to gain and re-gain\nfunction in incredible ways, I really did not enjoy seeing the results of man\u0027s\ninhumanity to man. There had to be another way to use my profession and all of\nmy skills to prevent such atrocities from happening. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile searching for the answer, I also had the challenge of healing from a\nchronic illness. This challenge has been a constant drain on my income, making progress difficult. Some years after qualifying, I began working privately and so\nbegan part-time occupational therapy and part-time art and creativity. I held\ntwo private art exhibitions and loved it. I had a few commissions and wanted to\npaint more. I\u0027d love to have a fully equipped art studio.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStarting a private practice has been an ongoing challenge as it takes much\nfunding to purchase equipment, cover insurance, marketing etc. Many a time I have\ntaken on part-time jobs to try to cover bills. But all I want to do is to\ncreate. In addition, most of the jobs have had demands on my personal time that negatively impacted on my health. I have so many ideas that I want to just focus on creating them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have treated privately for a number of years now, I am not yet getting enough clients for this to be sustainable. In an effort to increase awareness of occupational therapy so as to increase clients, I took the time to write a book to educate the non-OT about this incredible profession. I am very excited that the book is now out, however, the time taken both for writing and editing has set me back financially, making marketing impossible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProducts created thus far: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- A set of 4 fridge magnets with beautiful scenes of Israel and inspiring message in Hebrew.\u003cbr\u003e\n- \"Tuvia Finds His Freedom\" - a kids book that I co-authored together\nwith my husband. The book is a nature story for children illustrated with our\nown photographs. We took care of every aspect of producing the book from idea\nthrough to edited and formatted final product self-published and ready for\nsale. \u003cbr\u003e\n- \"Healing Your Life Through Activity - An Occupational Therapist\u0027s\nStory\" - a 272 page book written to educate the non-OT about the\nincredible profession of Occupational Therapy\u003cbr\u003e\n- I have a number of paintings that I need to figure out how to sell online. These paintings mostly have a deeper meaning to them that is motivational and uplifting. The message is made available to the one who purchases the painting.\u003cbr\u003e\n- I have begun making hand beaded jewelry together with my mother\u003cbr\u003e\n- I have two worksheets available for download and a list of at least 20 more\nto put together\u003cbr\u003e\n- I have ideas for 10 books on topics based on my profession that I need to complete\nwriting\u003cbr\u003e\n- I have further paintings, drawings and photographs to create and to make available for sale. Some of them are gift sets. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can take a look at my creative items on my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.creationsfromjerusalem.com\"\u003ewww.creationsfromjerusalem.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have also set up a YouTube channel and would love to produce quality videos\nthat inspire and educate from my occupational therapy training and 26 years of\nexperience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d love to upload a great video for this page. For that I need your help to be\nable to obtain a video camera. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Projects Being Worked On:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- I was invited to research and write an article for a new\njournal in my profession, but require the financial means to be able to\ncomplete this. This is unpaid work but will be of benefit to others\u003cbr\u003e\n- I would love to complete a workbook to accompany \"Tuvia Finds His\nFreedom\" the nature story we wrote for children. This requires time and\nfunding in order to meet this goal\u003cbr\u003e\n- I have at least 20 downloadable documents to create. Each document takes many\nhours to prepare and format before being able to share them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- I have another children\u0027s book ready along the theme of\nkindness to animals. I need to pay an illustrator to illustrate my next\nchildren\u0027s book. I began trying to illustrate it myself but I am not so good at\nrepeating images and need to outsource to another artist.\u003cbr\u003e\n- I have a relaxation DVD I\u0027d love to record.\u003cbr\u003e\n- I also have more items to add to my website and to figure out how to market\nmy artwork in the most appropriate way. \u003cbr\u003e\n- I have written a book about my personal and professional journey with my\nhealth and need the financial means to devote to editing this book and having\nit available for sale too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are my immediate goals. I will add more as these ones are completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your Patronage assist?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving your support will enable me to cover my basic expenses in order to complete both producing and marketing of the above products. It will give me the ability to share of my knowledge, talents and skills in a way that is of benefit to many. The goal over time is to become self-sufficient so that I can continue to provide quality products. There is the potential for me to give talks and workshops based on the topics of the books. The workbooks, worksheets and other materials will enable me to give quality talks and workshops and to have the products available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf occupational therapy and increasing creativity, health and wellness is not of interest to you, I do understand and thank you for reading this far. For those able to assist, I thank you in advance for every dollar donated and look forward to connecting in various ways via this forum. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
