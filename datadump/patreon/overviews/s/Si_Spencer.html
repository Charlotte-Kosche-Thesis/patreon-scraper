    "summary": "I write stuff. I\u0027ve written stuff for cash-money for nearly thirty years.\nI\u0027ve written lots of stuff for pictures that move like Eastenders, The Bill and\nGrange Hill, but mainly I like to write stuff for pictures that just \u003cem\u003elook\u003c/em\u003e like\nthey\u2019re moving \u2013 comic books. I\u0027ve done lots of these, like The Vinyl\nUnderground, Hellblazer: City of Demons, Bodies, Slash \u0026amp; Burn and Klaxon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve got a nice balance in my life between commercial projects that pay well and the less lucrative independent stuff like comics, short films, theatre and poetry, but what I\u0027m really \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e itching to do is finish my first novel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing though - writing a novel is really hard. It takes a long time. A\nlong long time. And unless you hit incredibly lucky in a million different\nways at once, it pays like crap considering the hours you put in... because only smart cookies with great taste buy good books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFortunately you\u003cem\u003e\u00a0are\u003c/em\u003e a smart cookie with great taste and you\u0027re really \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0going to like my novel - It\u0027s a\nlove story, so it\u0027s about you and everyone you know who\u0027s ever been in love. It\u0027s funny and sexy and warm and lovely but it\u0027s also a horror story because love is a sort of monster and being in love is\nlike being possessed by demons.\u00a0Your friends\nwill really love my novel too because like you, they\u0027re all smart but a\nlittle strange and they also like sad and funny and horny and sweet and terrifying and they\u0027ll be really impressed that you helped fund it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to make life easier for myself I\u2019ve\nwritten it to be non-specific to age, gender or sexual orientation. And it has not\none but two really difficult and wondrous narrative writing magic tricks. And\ninstead of prose, it\u2019s kind of a very long poem with crunchy complex writing\nlike thick gobbets of sweet caramel filled with sewing pins and shards of\nglass - just like love. I know for a fact there isn\u0027t another book out there anywhere like this but if I had to give reference points I\u0027d say it was a bit like James Joyce, Richard Brautigan, Lewis Carroll, Dylan Thomas, Lemony Snicket, Rene Magritte and Tim Vine all jamming on a riff by Raymond Carver and Chet Baker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e At the moment it starts like this\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2018Ever after\nonce upon a time we lived happy in a beginning no-one can remember but which\nled us to this starlit midnight beach. Sudden silent but unsurprising we are\nhere as if from nowhere, blinked into existence in the wink of a lighthouse\neye. The sea gossips in whispers tar-black behind us, your hand so snug in glove in mine I\ncannot remember any other fit or feel; my voice in your ear an echo of your\nown, the scent of you colliding with the salt and vinegar sky\u2019\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026but that\u2019s about the fiftieth draft\nalready \u2013 you can bet it\u2019s going to change again. Ninety-nine\npercent of this book is editing and that takes prolonged stints of focus and\nconcentration. What I\u2019m hoping to do is finish it and start punting it round to\npublishers around this time next year (July/August 2017). And I want it to have a few pictures for chapter headings - eerie, pretty but disturbing pictures that give mystery clues to the narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the meantime of course I\u2019ll still be writing commercially and on\nother indie projects \u2013 I\u2019m aiming to finish a readable collection of poetry, a\nsequel to Klaxon, the final part of my \u2018Ibsen\u2019 comedy horror short play trilogy\nand get round to uploading all the female-friendly erotic short stories I wrote\nwhen I was first starting out (when disks were still genuinely floppy and five\ninches) and put them into a kindle collection.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMainly though I\u2019m aiming to spend the equivalent of half the year on the novel and still\nkeep doing those wildly extravagant things like eating, paying rent and\npropping up the fossil fuel industry so I don\u2019t freeze in winter. And I want to\npay my artist because it turns out that they eat and live in a house and stuff\ntoo.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t justify taking that much time off from paid gigs\nwithout your help and I really\u003cem\u003e really\u003c/em\u003e want to make you scared and cry\nand laugh because I know that\u0027s exactly the kind of thing you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf (When!) the novel gets published, anyone pledging\nover $30 a month will receive a free personalised signed copy while anyone pledging\nover $50 a month will get their signed copy \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\na mention in the back-page acknowledgements but in the meantime there\u2019s lots of\nother goodies on offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look and\nsign up please. Remember it\u0027s NOT Kickstarter. You\u0027re not signing up for a one-off payment to a specific goal, you\u0027re signing up every month for a year (unless you decide to cancel of course) but that\u0027s the only real difference. I haven\u0027t made a video explaining how to do it because you\u0027re smart and it\u0027s easy - just click on something yummy on the right there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make you happy and sad and scared and hurt and make you laugh while I do it. Because you\u0027re smart and strange. You like feeling that way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
