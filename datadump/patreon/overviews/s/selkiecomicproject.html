The story is inspired by a creature from Celtic/Icelandic folklore, the selkie. Most of the time selkies live as seals, but they can shed their skin and pass unremarked among humankind. According to legend, if a man steals the skin of a selkie woman, she will be the perfect, most obedient wife, although she will long to return to the sea and do everything within her power to regain her lost pelt. \u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Selkie\u003c/em\u003e uses that folklore as a starting point to explore the ambiguity of relationships: what happens when lovers aren\u0027t honest about who they really are? The comic explores the murky waters of relationships by shifting the premise of the legend: what if the pelt isn\u0027t taken by force, but is instead given up by the inexperienced woman pursuing love who throws off her selfhood for a lover who never asked for or understood her sacrifice?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlot\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen Selkie rescues a drowning sailor, she is compelled to disguise herself as a human to check up on him. She\u0027s enchanted by the small fishing village she discovers, and even more taken by the handsome young man. They fall in love, and caught up in a whirlwind romance, move in together. But the sailor can\u0027t seem to shake his memory of being rescued by an alluring mermaid, and Selkie doesn\u0027t know how to tell him that his mermaid was, in fact, a seal, and she hides her transformational power. As time goes on, these two very different interpretations of events grow into an insurmountable silence, and troubled waters quickly become stormy seas...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eClaire Lacey is an award-winning Canadian writer who has spent the last two years living in Northern England.
