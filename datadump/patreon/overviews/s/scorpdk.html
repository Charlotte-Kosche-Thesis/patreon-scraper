You probably (don\u0027t) know me from over \nFurAffinity, DeviantArt, Tumblr or Twitter, but I have been around the \ninternet, drawing anime/manga and anthro art since 2006. In 2014 I have \nditched working in tourism-related businesses (starting in All-Inclusive\n Hotels as waiter in restaurants, as front-desks clerks, Customer \nService Executive and in a Travel Agency as graphic designer), but due \nto unusually high stress levels caused by 3rd world country quality \nstandards and cooperation among the different departments, I eventually \nrefused to continue working for minimum wage, considering the strain on \nboth mental and physical health and sometimes subhuman treatment, and \ndecided going the route of professional artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is where Patreon, or rather, YOU, comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me via Patreon, you make sure that I can continue doing the things I like by helping me pay my bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Nnlkaqn.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do YOU get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBy supporting me and becoming my patron, you aid me in continuing to produce fun and sexy art. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt\n the $5 tier, you will gain access to all art produced for my \nPatreon, in full working resolution (up to 10K by 7.5K), sent during the\n first 6 days of the following month (when Patreon processes all \npledges).\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eYou get instant access to all Year 1 content, as well.
