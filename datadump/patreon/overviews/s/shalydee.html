Nestled into a rather cosy corner of the south west of England, I dream and live all things fantasy, folklore and magical...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally I set up this page with extremely tall hopes and ridiculously outdated sentiment - but now I just have way more fun with them. I have been teaching myself to paint and draw since the year dot, and where many say I could make a living out of it - as a general rule, I just like to enjoy the process and need I have to paint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy time is somewhat unequally split between writing, painting, parrot-sitting and Dungeons and Dragons. Real life tends to peak in at the door now and then but is usually met with a thrown dice or discarded painting and... well, shown the door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will allow my work to speak for itself, and will be sharing as much of my gaming and personal life with Patrons as the \u0027works in progress\u0027 and paintings !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently went through a quiet stage of feeling unable to post to social media or online at all... \u003cstrong\u003eIt is my Patrons that changed this, I do this for you guys here - and most definitely would not be here at all if not for you.

But perhaps writing comics about them for now will do...\u003cbr\u003eIf I achieve this goal I will begin my very own illustrative comic series - something I\u0027ve always wanted to do and have written many stories about, but never had the time to create the art work for - as it involves lots of consistent character design and layout planning.\u003cbr\u003eIt will highly likely be D\u0026amp;D based, but I would love to hear your opinions on this - particularly since if you are a Patron at this stage, I will want your input on my comics.\u003cbr\u003eThere will also be the chance to have a cameo/role as a character in my comic for YOU! Whether that\u0027s actually you or a character you\u0027ve designed or play as... We can totally decide this if we near this goal!\u003cbr\u003e",

I know I need a good size scanner so you can experience better quality images of my paintings as near to real life as visiting them at a gallery!\u003cbr\u003eIt also means I can make merchandise such as cards, t-shirts or various print works from home.\u003cbr\u003eThis one would call for a celebration.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll do a giveaway of whatever it is I first attempt to make, be that art prints, greeting cards - maybe even the original painting or illustration of whatever I scan first!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a long way off, if ever, so if I do achieve this goal we can decide as we approach it :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

If I get to this stage\u00a0 I can then devote all of my time to painting and writing.\u003cbr\u003eNo more random jobs or selling stuff I own to get by - My main goal in this is to make a living out of creating, and if I can be sure of this income, all of my time will go into painting for YOU :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course if I am ever lucky enough to reach this goal, which is a brave move considering I am sharing this deepest wish from the soul - It will be thanks to my Patrons. Which means there will be a giveaway.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEvery single Patron here when I reach this stage will receive a print or card of my art work, and there will be an original painting give away for one lucky Patron also! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
