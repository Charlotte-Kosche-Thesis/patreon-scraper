They are available on Comixology or you can purchase them directly from me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://samuraiox.bigcartel.com/\"\u003ehttp://samuraiox.bigcartel.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u0027Trust Arc\u0027 of my comic is of the first four issues and then the second arc (Love) begins. A drifter (Zeke) is trying to finish one last thing before he can leave this \nworld with a clear conscience. In a post-apocalyptic world riddled with \nzombies and other perils, what will it actually take for him to obtain \nthis one last goal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo tiers stand before you - one you will get my thanks and a look at the process as I continue making videos. This will come in the form of 2 videos each month. The first will be a sketchbook each month showing what I\u0027ve been drawing and the 2nd video will really show what\u0027s going on with the comic. The second tier will be for some original art. For every three months you donate, I\u0027ll ship you an actual sketch of your liking and mail it to you. Thanks for stopping and even taking a look as I work towards making a name for myself!\u003cbr\u003e"

This Patreon account is so I can make a little while I create and those funds will go to art supplies directly helping the book. There will also be some exclusive things I will offer that you will have the first opportunity to get!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In 2015 I was able to make the first four issues and and the \u0027Trust Arc\u0027 a reality and have taken the first steps of bringing this incredible story to life! As I am gearing up and working on the fifth issue, I figured it\u0027d be great to show off the process of making my comic. This will be a way for people following along with the series to see what happens next without having to wait until the next Kickstarter to fund the printing of the issues AND them being printed! Everyone that helps support during an issue cycle will also be included in thanks in the digital versions. You will also be thanked in the once-a-month special video first uploaded here and later for my public Youtube account. Not sure about actual print versions and I suppose I can make that a goal. \u003cbr\u003e",
