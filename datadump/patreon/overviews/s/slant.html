    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eSlant Magazine\u003c/em\u003e was founded in 2001 by Ed Gonzalez and Sal Cinquemani. Since then, we\u0027ve been bringing you candid takes on film, music, TV, games, home video, and more. You may not always agree with us, but we hope we\u0027ve been able to spark a conversation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThroughout its 16 years, \u003cem\u003eSlant\u003c/em\u003e has been known as a launching pad for great writers and big ideas. Many of our contributors have gone on to work for major publications across the world based on their writing for our publication: \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Los Angeles Times\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Village Voice\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eTime Out\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eOut Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, among others. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eSlant\u003c/em\u003e began covering only film and music, and by the time it absorbed the blog \u003cem\u003eThe House Next Door\u003c/em\u003e, which was founded by \u003cem\u003eNew York\u003c/em\u003e magazine TV critic and former \u003cem\u003eNew York Press\u003c/em\u003e film critic Matt Zoller Seitz, we were covering TV, theater, books, and home-video releases. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years, we\u0027ve covered festivals, big and small, across the globe: Cannes, Venice, Toronto, Sundance, True/False, Berlinale, Locarno, and so on. Our writers have even sat on festival juries. And the giants of the film, music, theater, and literary world have given us their time to talk about their work: Francis Ford Coppola, Guillermo del Toro, Tilda Swinton, Laurie Anderson, Larry Kramer, Walter Hill, Kathryn Bigelow, James Gray, Isabelle Huppert, Paul Verhoeven, Olivier Assayas, Michel Gondry, D.A. Pennebaker, Marion Cotillard, Sam Gold, Liv Ullmann, and more. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2010, when \u003cem\u003eFilm Comment\u003c/em\u003e singled out the \u003cem\u003eHouse Next Door\u003c/em\u003e as one of the top film criticism sites, Evan Davis wrote: \"One would be hard-pressed to find an online film magazine as inclusive or expansive as this one.\" Indeed, inclusivity has always been our mission. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eSlant\u003c/em\u003e is reaching more readers than ever before, but advertising revenue across the Internet is falling fast, hitting independently owned and operated publications like ours the hardest. We\u0027ve watched many of our fellow media sites, from \u003cem\u003eThe Dissolve\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003eMovie Mezzanine\u003c/em\u003e, fall by the way side in recent years, but we\u0027re determined to stick around. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich is why \n\u003cem\u003eSlant\u003c/em\u003e needs your help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve never asked our readers for financial support before, and we\u0027re committed to keeping our content free and accessible\u2014which means no paywalls or subscription fees. If you like what we do, however, please consider making a contribution. One-hundred percent of the funds we collect will go toward maintaining and improving the magazine, as well as paying our contributors so that we can keep bringing you reviews of the latest releases, TV recaps, exclusive interviews, festival dispatches, lists, news, and more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
