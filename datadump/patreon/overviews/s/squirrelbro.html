One half is a slice of life, coming of age story about the main characters dealing with the challenges of growing up. The other half skips ahead several years, blending a modern-stylized setting full of adventure and mystery, with several supernatural/paranormal elements as these same characters, now grown up, begin to delve deeper and explore further into the world.\u003cbr\u003eBetween The Lines updates with a new page every Sunday and Wednesday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween The Lines the webcomic can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.betweenthelinescomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.betweenthelinescomic.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Other Projects:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently streaming on Twitch three days a week!
