I love creating videos on you-tube however I desire to have more one on one interaction with my viewers/friends . I want to share in depth content with you and to be  a more significant  part of your creative journey. Patreon allows me to do  that. We will be working step by step on canvas, art journal pages, creating mixed media projects and simple craft projects  that are exclusive to you,as  my  wonderful  patreons. \u003cbr\u003eAs a YouTube content creator, all the videos I produce are free and will always be. By becoming one of my patrons however, you\u0027ll be supporting my art and videos AND getting great rewards for it. Your support means I can put more time into my art and videos. The funds will be used towards getting better video equipment, a new computer, new editing software, and art supplies.  You support means I can continue to improve my artistic skills and the quality of my videos. I\u0027m excited to share this journey with you and thank you so very much for making this possible!\u003cbr\u003eYour support inspires me to succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eJust a small pledge on your part can collectively change my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReward Distribution! Please be aware that any physical shipments will not be processed until the payment has gone through. Each monthly reward to be sent will be done so after the 10th of the month. If you sign up on the 2nd of this month, your payment will be processed the 5th of the following month. All rewards listed below are valid for the month as you are a Patron.\u003cbr\u003eYou can cancel at any time; there is no obligation to pledge for a certain period! However, if for some reason you decide to opt out of your pledge during a current month, your monthly pledge will not be reimbursed. \u003cbr\u003eOne of the great things about being a Patron is that you get to decide on your pledge level every single month.  There is a large \"edit your patronage\" button right at the top left of the screen once you\u0027re one of my Patrons and you can change your level every single month if you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note, the large ticket items are intended as a one time payment, but it is  YOU have to cancel after the initial payment if you do NOT want it recur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW WILL REWARDS BE DISTRIBUTED?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*\u00a0I will post\u00a0the reward links in my\u00a0Patron Feed \u00a0containing links to all the rewards for your level each month.. Non-digital (physical) rewards will be mailed by mail\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
