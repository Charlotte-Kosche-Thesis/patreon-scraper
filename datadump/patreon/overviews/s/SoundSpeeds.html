I began this channel to help people improve the quality of sound in everything from production audio to audio books. I offer professional sound advice to those willing to listen all over the globe. That\u0027s one of my greatest passions - helping others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my years as a professional in the motion picture and television industry, I\u0027ve learned many things and most of those things are kept secrets within the industry. For some reason, most sound pros at the top level don\u0027t offer a helping hand to those working on Indies or even public access. I\u0027m different and at Sound Speeds you\u0027ll find all kinds of useful information that you can use regardless of what you\u0027re trying to make sound better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may notice that I don\u0027t beg for likes, shares or subscribes like many others on YouTuber. I want my channel to be a resource for you without asking anything from you in return. What about Patreon then? Simply put... it\u0027s here should you decide that you\u0027d like to support me for the hours I put into producing content every week. I\u0027m not doing it for the money but I did spend a lot of money when I started the channel and continue to spend a lot of money to make sure my quality standards remain high and my content worthwhile. If you\u0027d like to help me with some of those costs, that\u0027s what this Patreon page is here for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you decide to become a patron or not, I appreciate your even coming here. More importantly, thank you for your interest in my channel. I hope you find it useful."
