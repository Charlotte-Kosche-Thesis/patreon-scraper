    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMy name is Thomas of Skull Gent Gaming\u00a0and I first started streaming on Twitch in 2016 after being inspired by my friends on Discord. I try to stream everyday ay 8pm EST, ranging from retro games, indie games, to random stuff that gets my attention. I\u0027ve really enjoyed the process of creating videos for people to enjoy, and I genuinely enjoy the community that watches. I want to continue to keep doing what I have been, except I want to get better and do more. To do this, I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe goal of my channel is to be self-sufficient and allow me to pursue my dream of content creation. I currently earn revenue through part time work and stream doantions. I would like to be as independent as possible and rely solely on my own creations than slave away for some faceless boss. With Patreon, I can have a consistent stream of support to help fuel my channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my money go towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support goes directly into what is needed to run my channel, both in terms of what you see, and what you do not. I have taken on a few financial responsibilities since pursuing content creation fulltime. Small things such as the internet bill, renting the office I use for recording, and the electricity bill. All small things individually, but they add up. On top of this, I still need to be on the look out for the latest games releasing on the internet. You support goes directly into keeping things behind the scenes working, as well as what you see online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a catch? And What is in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs there a catch? Nope! Once you become a Patron, you\u0027re done. Patreon will charge you between the 1st and 5th of every month. If you ever want to stop supporting my channel, you can simply stop. By becoming a Patron, however, you can unlock different rewards, ranging from access to my Discord server, to having your name in my supporter\u0027s credits, to free merch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you MrKravin @ youtube.com/kravination for your inspiration\u003cbr\u003e"
