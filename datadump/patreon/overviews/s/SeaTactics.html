I am an Anime/Manga Youtuber that has been covering it since 2014 and before that since 2011. I also sometimes upload fun gaming content (but that is not the focus). I am primarily focused on bringing Anime Reviews, Manga Reviews, and other contend based around it like podcast and discussion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIf you do like what I do, then you can support me here with \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eas little as a $1\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. In return I hope to bring you even better quality content where I will be able to afford even more anime/manga to review. You will also be supporting my ability to buy newer hardware to help make not only my videos look better, but come out faster. Also new software to edit the videos better as well. But not only that you will get to vote on a curated list of anime for me to watch and review once a month. And of course you will also be shouted out in those videos and my regular videos as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut of course all of my content will be free as regular on my Youtube channel. So if you don\u0027t have the money (or don\u0027t feel like it) then you can support me as always through just watching and supporting me on Youtube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThanks everyone for your support, and have a terrific day!\u003c/div\u003e"
