    "summary": "Hey, everyone! I\u0027m Sara Century and I\u0027ve been a working / volunteering artist / activist for most of my life with a focus on teaching art and music to LGBTQIA teens but branching out to things like running DIY venues for under represented artists and assisting in several music festivals that have a feminist / LGBTQIA focus. Besides that, I\u0027ve done a ton of my own projects, including a few series of paintings and portraits, too many zines to name but including the comic New Girlfriend and the... essay?... How to Become a Lesbian Vampire Movie, writing and performing 2 musicals in DIY spaces across the West Coast, made some experimental short films, done some comic strips and articles here and there, and released some strange music. Most people know of me via hosting or guesting on podcasts or from the zines and articles I\u0027ve written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m doing a movie review series on tumblr beginning with Liz Taylor\u0027s full filmography up to and including the episode of Captain Planet she was on, and I\u0027m in upper Michigan to film a movie myself right now. I\u0027m running a DIY space in New Mexico, and participating in the organization of the 2017 edition of the Gatas y Vatas music festival, which centers on solo female \u0026amp; LGBTQIA performers. I\u0027m starting a Patreon page to give people an easier way to follow and support my work - because I\u0027m an independent artist, I\u0027m constantly releasing things in small runs, and it\u0027s incredibly easy to miss my work as it comes out. Subscribers to my Patreon will have access to my artistic output in a heretofore unprecedented way, including special previews of upcoming releases, newsletters, postcards, and other options available for a few bucks a month. I consistently fund and distribute my own projects and have been for years, so your support provides additional padding for my ventures and might go to things like buying toner to refill my printer, building a better website, helping to cover costs on any number of artistic projects, buying toilet paper for the DIY space I run, buying much needed equipment, replacing things that have broken, or about a billion other art-related things. In return, I\u0027ll send you the art I make!\u003cbr\u003e"
