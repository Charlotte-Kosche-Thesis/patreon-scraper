This has been highly requested for some time! It\u0027ll let you get closer to me. That\u0027s weird. Don\u0027t touch me. But you\u0027ll be able to talk and play with like-minded fans of Dark Souls / games, including myself, naturally. I\u0027ll also share \"early looks\" at videos before they go out to the public in there, occasionally. There are other rewards too, such as access to the high-res art used on my channel and in my videos. You\u0027ll also get a copy of a rubbish fantasy novel I wrote when I was a teenager. And if you\u0027d like something a bit more, a $50 donation gets you a video on a topic of your choice! This is more of a one time thing, as I don\u0027t expect anyone to shell out that much a month. This would be done via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/SilverMont\"\u003ePaypal\u003c/a\u003e. Which can also be used if you\u0027d just like to support me as a one off.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I give you my hard-earned cash, Alex?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eBecause you like me. Or you like my content, or both. When it comes to revenue, YouTube is notoriously inconsistent: With a regular job, you know how much money you\u0027ll be making each month, from the hours you put in. I could work on a video for 50+ hours and it makes $10. Simply put, despite being a full time occupation, YouTube makes me less than minimum wage. I also have to self-fund anything I should require, and this is what Patreon money would go towards; not limited to, but including the following:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHardware (\u003cem\u003eMicrophones, cameras, storage\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSoftware (\u003cem\u003eA/V editing, capture software etc\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInternet\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSustaining my Art Slave\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSustaining my own life\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTell me more, I got time to kill.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHardware. Good cameras, stands, tripods and microphones can be very expensive! Setting up the ideal recording space (In other words, not my bedroom) also requires sound-padding and sound-insulation etc. There\u0027s also the cost of storage (raw video recordings take up a \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003elot \u003c/em\u003eof room!) and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSoftware licenses (Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas, Final Cut Pro etc) are needed to put all that raw footage together, and these are professional level softwares that charge professional level rates! There\u0027s also audio editing software and streaming software that starts to add up.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInternet. Here in the UK, good internet is hard to come by, and absurdly overpriced. Download speeds aren\u0027t that important to me, but upload speeds allow me to get my content out sooner, increase my work-load and also allow me to stream live gameplay! This would also include costs such as new telephone lines and the like.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew games, simple enough! Money that will go towards picking up new games to review/preview or even make a full play-through of! I\u0027m always open to taking suggestions for what to play from viewers, and sometimes you guys help me discover a great new game! And if nothing else, it\u0027s a good way to cover a game so I can help others decide whether or not they want to take the plunge and pick it up themselves.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Art Slave AKA the talented Janita, the artist behind all the beautiful art you\u0027ll see on my channel; from the thumbnails to the banner! Drawing is her livelihood (as YouTube is mine) and support from you guys will also go towards paying her.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, YT + Patreon money goes towards my bills, groceries, general things that keep me alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to check out this page. \u00a0And if you decide to support me, thanks again! Either way, I\u0027m going to continue making the best content I can!"
