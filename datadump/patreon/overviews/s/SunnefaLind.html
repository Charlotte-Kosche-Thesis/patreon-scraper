I create acapella covers on\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/SunnefaLindMusic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003emy YouTube channel\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and this Patreon page right here is where you can become a part of my process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/fo0uur.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat is acapella?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nAcapella, acappella or a cappella (no matter how you spell it) simply means \"without accompaniment\". That means music without instruments, using only the human mouth. And actually sometimes snaps, claps and stomps \ud83d\ude09 Contemporary acapella is a form of music in which popular songs (recent pop songs, rock, Disney, show tunes) are arranged to be sung by human voices. Quite often, contemporary acapella also involves what is know as vocal percussion, where the human mouth is used to imitate a drum kit.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/2qmgpix.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy do a campaign like this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nEven if I wouldn\u0027t get paid, I would still sing. But producing an acapella song costs money. I have to pay for arrangements, equipment, mastering, licences, etc. And I want to make the best songs and videos I possibly can. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a way for me to get paid per creation, so for every song and video I create. With your support I can make sure that each video I create is the very best I can make it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/xlmah2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have loads of fun rewards! You can read all about them to the right \ud83d\udc49 but here\u0027s an overview:\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll my Patrons get a behind the scenes video once a month. Higher tiered Patrons can get free downloads, karaoke tracks, stem tracks, shout outs and so much more. You also become a part of my Patreon family. I will ask you guys first about song choices, give you exclusive updates and sneak peeks and try to include you in my process as much as possible.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/fxwcvp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThank you\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI truly believe music is for everyone and that it has the power to change the world. Together we can make that happen.
