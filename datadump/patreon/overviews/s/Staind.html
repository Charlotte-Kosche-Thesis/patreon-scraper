The mission of Stain\u2019d is to create a platform for visual and literary artists; and to enhance exposure to, and appreciation of, the arts externally and introspectively in addressing difficult and often subversive subject matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to those among us who have long supported our work, who recognize the need for subversive arts spaces, who blow the wind in our sails to keep this whole thing going. You are everything to us. Want a little story?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Story:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe founders of Stain\u0027d, Noah and myself, Delia (hey there!), came together in an alleyway in 2015 with a shared vision of a literary and arts publication committed to uncovering the washed out wonders of the world. It has grown exponentially since then. We\u0027ve run an online space for visual and literary artists to present their work since 2015. This past fall we came out with our first printed volume of Stain\u0027d Magazine. We offer space for guest artists to facilitate workshops, to be featured at open-mics and through our reading series. We seek out artists who are engaged in subversive art. We believe by bringing this type of art into people\u0027s consciousness, into their Friday nights, onto their coffee tables and the backs of their toilets, we can create a more connected, honest and vibrant world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the often unheard and the unseen we are exploring unusual representations of beauty and the humanity within. We seek work that examines the ambiguous spaces, the nuanced realms that exist outside of dualism. Artists are the world\u0027s story-tellers. We want to see the story which is pocked with scars and smudged with stains. We want to see the bruises of heartache, the blood of blundering. We want the stories that stop everything, the ones that shake us out of our routines and challenge every little thing we thought we knew.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth being artists, neither of us exactly have a mind for business. In fact, one, if not both of us, are staunch anti-capitalists. This puts us in a tough place given that neither of us is very interested in analyzing business strategies for a living.\u00a0Because we are such a small company and we both work outside jobs (full time high school teacher, and barista respectively), we\u0027ve been able to make it work for the last two and a half years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever- we\u0027re growing. Fast. We are taking on a larger role in our community, working harder to create accessible avenues into the arts, and supporting more artists in more significant ways. We have a huge vision and with a highly engaged readership and 60+ contributing artists we\u0027ve got lots of momentum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am putting in around 30 hours a week on this project and still see so much more I would like to do. We\u0027re trying to avoid shoving ads down your throat as you read our publication. Ads interfere with the process of reflection our publications incite in readers (so far we\u0027ve managed to remain 100% ad-free). We\u0027re also trying to ensure that this project isn\u0027t being run on exhaust fumes. And in order to do that, we need financial support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love this work. I get lost doing this work. It\u0027s an incredible amount of fun for me. I get to bring art into the world. I get to engage with difficult topics. I get to highlight the incredible work of emerging artists and find ways to support the making of art. I feel like the resistance. I feel like the work I\u0027m doing is exactly what the world is asking for. And mostly, I feel incredibly grateful to the community who has supported it, and us, so far. To the artists who have shared the deep recesses of their souls with me via interviews (you sustain me), to those who have reminded me time and again that we have to fight for what we believe in (I\u0027m stronger for it), to those who come out for every event and are thrilled by what we\u0027re doing. I want to continue this work for a long time. And I\u0027m very excited to see how it evolves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStain\u0027d needs to become sustainable. I can\u0027t dump my paychecks into funding this project too much longer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are, therefore relying on individual donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows readers and community members to donate whatever they want per month; the donation is recurring each month. So anything, from $1 a month and up, is hugely helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to know that your money will be put to good use?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is $2,000 a month. That money plus the income from magazine sales (which essentially goes right back into printing at this point) will be enough to keep Stain\u0027d going with all of our current projects in place (and there are so many that have \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0gotten started!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStain\u0027d Budget:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying our artists. This is one of our highest priorities as an arts organization. We pay a fairly small honorarium to artists for contributions. We also like to pay featured artists at our open mics, at fundraisers and other events we run. This is super important to us. We also have various guest artists facilitate workshops. These are sadly unpaid individuals. They should be given stipends for their important work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite fees. It\u0027s not that much money, but a few hundred dollars a year for domain, square space, email, etc etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinting costs. These are not insignificant. Not at all. Every year these amount to around 12,000. Yes, magazine sales cover nearly all of this, but there are lots of little things we\u0027d like to do differently regarding printing. We\u0027ve had issues with censorship in the past with various print houses, and have had to be selective in where we print our publications. Which means we are having to pay a less-competitive company and the cost to produce each issue is more than we\u0027d hoped it would be.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew projects. We\u0027ve got so many project ideas. Specifically- there\u0027s a photographer with whom we would \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e to create a book. He is a young man doing very important work highlighting the former refugee experience. Also, a children\u0027s book we\u0027ve been working on. And so many other such projects!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eSocial media marketing. We don\u0027t do a lot of it. But Facebook post \"boosts\" and sponsored Instagram ads help us cast our call for submissions out to wider waters. Is that the saying? As far as outreach to artists go, these are pretty effective tools.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMe. I\u0027ve gotten to be pretty damn frugal. I quite pride myself on it. But I\u0027ve learned that it is important to continue to be able to cook meals, buy toilet paper, etc.\u00a0If I were able to quit my job and say farewell to bleach once and for all, Stain\u0027d could become \u003cstrong\u003eso\u003c/strong\u003e much more. Currently, I have a team of very committed family members and friends who take on the things that I absolutely cannot. While they never once complain, free labor simply isn\u0027t any fun unless it\u0027s your own project. And even then, it grows old.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth Noah and I are abundantly grateful for any support you can offer. You would be helping to create art spaces, and enhance the arts not just in Denver but also through support of artists throughout the nation. We are indebted to your vision for a better world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 Delia\u003cbr\u003e"
