I\u2019m currently trying to get\npublished, but until then, that\u2019s not really possible. To support myself in the\nmeantime, I have a 9-5 job that doesn\u2019t really allow much time to hone my\ncraft. My goal with Patreon is to supplement that income and perhaps cut back\non my hours some, so I can focus more on what\u2019s truly important to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also want to see people\u2019s response to my stories. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a\ngood writer. I\u2019ve been writing for more than a decade, but I know I have room\nfor improvement. Hopefully, you lovely readers can help with that by sharing\nyour honest opinions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI got my BA in English from West Virginia University, where I graduated magna\ncum laude. My focuses were in both creative writing and professional writing\nand editing. This seemed like the obvious choice. Early on, I knew I wanted to\nbe a writer. I also knew I wouldn\u0027t be happy doing anything else because\nwriting these stories gives me something nothing else can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love that fiction, while untrue, strives to capture the rawness of reality.\nLove. Heartbreak. Hope. Romance as a genre has always held a special place in\nmy heart. From the sweet fairy tales as a child to the darker, gritter romances\nas an adult. Who doesn\u2019t like happily-ever-afters? My characters might have to\nfight for their happy endings\u2014because let\u2019s face it, life is hard\u2014but I try to\nmake the journey along the way worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Write \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy sub-genre of choice has always been paranormal romance. The darker elements\nappeal to me, the questions of morality and what\u2019s right and wrong. My stories\noften contain swearing and adult themes, such as sex and violence. I try not to\nshy away from the scenes and topics that can be uncomfortable. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I prefer to create original works, I have been known to write fanfic from\ntime to time, particularly ones from the Zelda and Final Fantasy universes. I\nenjoy playing those series, and as a writer, I\u0027m often tempted to write my own\ninterpretation. I may post a near-finished Zelda one if anyone would be\ninterested. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019d love to hear from people. Please feel free to send me a message if you have\nquestions or comments! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/span\u003e"
