While the website was successful in helping the public choose the \u003cem\u003eadoption option\u003c/em\u003e, I was frustrated by the lack of pound reform taking place nationally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007 I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archive.savingpets.com.au/\"\u003ethe Saving Pets blog\u003c/a\u003e, an advocacy and news blog about pound and shelter reform in Australia. Then, in 2015 I left PetRescue to work to make\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.savingpets.com.au\"\u003e Saving Pets\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0its own stand-alone resource on pound reform which now includes the pound reform tools;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://savingpets.com.au/shelterreform/guidebooks\"\u003eThe Safe Pounds Guidebooks\u003c/a\u003e and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxp2ZyH2uKo\"\u003eshort video\u003c/a\u003e detailing the abuses and unnecessary killing currently taking place in Australia\u2019s pounds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d like to continue this work throughout 2018, and expand it to include a regular podcast, more video content and even more resources for rescue groups on the front line saving lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing this content will allow me to speak to rescue groups, shelter animal advocates, pound reformers and other knowledgeable people on a regular basis. And the beauty of a blogging and podcasting is that you will be able to access these conversations whenever and wherever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to devote the necessary time to this work - and to expand the range of what I can do in this medium - I\u2019m asking you to contribute to Saving Pets continued success. Now, you can support the resource directly through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon platform allows you to give a specified amount monthly (please note, these amounts are in US dollars) and edit your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m extremely honoured to work with a community of people who want to see the issue of pound reform put on the national agenda.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/5808126f6573793f32d7ee75/5a0b9cd2282c6100013d3b6b_Me_sig.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Our organisation has been regularly featured in the major media including; The Project (Channel 10), Insight (SBS), 7:30 Report (ABC) and in a number of magazines, newspapers, websites, and technology and animal industry publications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with contributing research, content and copy for hundreds of PetRescue articles as part of our content-driven communications/fundraising strategy, I wrote a popular animal welfare blog from 2008 - 2015 which became a regular source of information for journalists, and contributed to the significant positive change in animal sheltering practices in this country. I have been invited to lecture many times on the topic of shelter pet care, animal welfare, social media and marketing, and regularly advise individuals on advocating to their local government for better outcomes for shelter animals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have extensive practical experience in the day to day running and funding of a national nonprofit, marketing and developing brand recognition and general team management. Over the last decade PetRescue has overcome the myriad of small business startup, nonprofit and administrative and management hurdles to emerge as one of Australia\u2019s most popular charities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpecialties: nonprofit general management, content driven communications and social media strategy, relationship building and strategic team development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shel-williamson-45587753\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShel on Linkedin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
