    "summary": "From Jason...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoccer in Atlanta is a passion of mine and has been since I fell in love with the sport when I was nine years old. My career has taken me through the professional and semi-pro club side, working with youth, and working with the grassroots side of the game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to be\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@Longshoe/a-life-thats-good-3cdcb5abdb3c?source=user_profile---------2----------\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebetter able\u003c/a\u003e to take care of family, I started freelancing. It\u0027s been incredibly rewarding to be able to cover the sport in a new way and to be able to try new things on a regular basis. As the momentum has continued to grow, I want to find ways to take it to the next level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, thanks to Jon and Jarrett and our listeners, we are in a position to add more coverage going forward of soccer in the South. We thought that there were stories to tell, and they have resonated with our listeners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe media world is changing and there are opportunities to interact directly with fans and supporters of the sport. Barriers are breaking down and I am now in a position to be able to do online radio shows, record podcasts, host video chats, and write about the sport and get the information out there to the public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been able to do things so far with the few things I have at my disposal, but to add more content and to take it to the next level, I have to make some upgrades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, there\u0027s plenty to talk about regarding Soccer in the South. MLS and Atlanta United have come to town and are changing the way an American soccer club is put together. You have lower division clubs in the region that are providing opportunities to players to develop. The youth scene is truly blossoming with young, local talent starting to earn recognition on a national stage. Below the surface, the grassroots scene is thriving and more kids than ever before are getting the opportunity to play. And now, Nashville will be joining MLS in a few years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese stories need to be told. I think that I am in a unique position to tell them. I want to be able to do more for the Southern soccer scene. I need your help in order to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u0027s anything I can do for any of you who support me, please ask. Don\u0027t worry about the specifics on the rewards section, just let me know if there\u0027s something I can do to repay you for helping me create more Atlanta soccer content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping us get off the ground and get Soccer Down Here started. We\u0027re working hard to make you proud of us!"
