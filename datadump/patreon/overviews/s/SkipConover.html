    "summary": "Dr. Carl G. Jung\u0027s work opened a whole new field of study, which combines elements of religion, politics, anthropology, history, biology, psychology, ethics, law, international relations, and many other fields of study under one roof.  Unfortunately, his work is little covered in the colleges and universities of the world, because he challenged the conventional wisdom in many of those fields of study. In religion, for example, he chronicled the development of the human psyche to explain the ineffable in most of the world\u2019s major religions, showing at the same time their similarities and how they can learn from one another to build common bonds. \u00a0In the end he could say in answer to the inevitable question about whether he believed in God, \"I have no need to believe, I know.\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn world affairs, he chronicled the rise of authoritarian regimes throughout the world from a psychological perspective, provided important grounding for the rights of women on a global basis, and plumbed the depths of the human psyche to point the way to how we humans can learn to live together on a crowded and cacophonous planet. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSince June 1, 2016, I have created over 145 videos to help laymen find access to Dr. Jung\u0027s six decades of prodigious scholarship. As Dr. Edward Edinger said, \u201cJung\u2019s [work] laid the foundation for a whole new department of human knowledge\u2026. It is based on the application of the insights of depth psychology to the data of cultural history.\u201d  Sadly, few colleges and universities teach Dr. Jung\u2019s work, because it swamps the conventional wisdom of many individual departments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe objective of this series is to provide a comprehensive master class for the growing spontaneous interest in Dr. Jung\u2019s oeuvre, with a view to bringing Dr. Jung\u2019s work to new generations of leaders.  It is absolutely not necessary to start from the point of view of an aspiring Jungian Analyst, because Dr. Jung\u2019s contributions to so many fields was so immense. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Skip Conover has made a 30-year study of the Collected Works of Dr. Carl G. Jung. His academic background is in history, law and business, and he has taught business, finance, and economics at graduate and undergraduate levels. Like so many others, he has been drawn to the magnet of Dr. Jung\u2019s wisdom since 1987.  His 2014 book, _Political Psychology: New Ideas for Activists_, was a first summary of American politics through the lens of Dr. Jung\u0027s oeuvre. Skip\u0027s \"Carl Jung Depth Psychology Reading Group\" channel on YouTube now has over 620 videos describing Dr. Jung\u0027s work, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqv_8eLqnb4bxTV44QwvrQ His website, Archetype in Action http://archetypeinaction.com is another rich source of information for the curious.  He has always recognized its value across many aspects of his life, both personal and professional, and he uses it daily in the development of his career. \u003cbr\u003e",
