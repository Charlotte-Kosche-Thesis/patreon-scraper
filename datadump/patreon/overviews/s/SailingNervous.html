We aim to inspire all of our viewers to go after their dreams, face their fears and obstacles, and allow life to bring out the best in them. We truly feel that \u0027if we can do it, anyone can!\u0027 So, we hope these videos inspire you and encourage you to \u0027Go for it\u0027!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u0027Fish-Out-Of-Water\u0027 theme is also utilized for comic relief. You know the theme, an \u0027everyperson\u0027 unfamiliar with their new surroundings, or lacking in the skills to succeed, has difficulty. This makes us laugh as we wonder if they are going to make it! It also makes us less afraid to make mistakes and to allow ourselves to never stop learning. \u00a0We try to make every episode have something in it to inspire laughter, and we don\u0027t mind if you laugh at us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur videos also aim to be educative. From weather issues, to learning how to sail, to reading a nautical chart, anyone who has ever dreamed of owning their own sailboat, living aboard, and cruising to exotic places will find our channel instructive, on some level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to become part of Patreon so we could bring our viewers along with us, hear from them direct as to what they would like to see, develop our community of Patreon supporters, and thus enable us to continue bringing these videos to you every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe invite you to become part of our Patreon Family.
