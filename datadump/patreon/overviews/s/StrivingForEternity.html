We seek to help every Christian to live focused on eternity when we will sit at the feet of Jesus Christ our Lord and worship Him forever. We seek to produce great podcasts like the Rapp Report, Grappling with Theology, Creation Revival, and others. We provide free classes on our Striving for Eternity Academy, where you can receive 20 classes on how to interpret the Bible, 80 classes on systematic theology, 20+ classes on an introduction to world religions and a defense of the Christian faith, training on how to disciple others and more courses on the way. We also provide seminars on Bible interpretation made easy, evangelism, presupposition apologetics, creation science, sexual abuse and more. We can afford to provide these seminars to smaller churches due to our monthly donors. You could make an impact on a church that many would write off but we do not. Are you ready to make a commitment with us today?"
