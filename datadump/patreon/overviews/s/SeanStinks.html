    "summary": "I started learning to make musical instruments as an exchange student at a traditional arts university\u00a0in Java, Indonesia. \u00a0With the guidance of Ethnomusicologist Asep Nata, I was lucky enough to become one of the few non-Indonesians who learn the techniques in crafting the modern and traditional bamboo mouth harps of the region.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost recently my instruments have been used by participants in Heartbeat and Musicians Without Borders organizations in Israel and the West Bank. These are music education programs for children and adults, offering skills, performance and collaboration opportunities in areas plagued by conflict.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I can spend more time making instruments, contact more organizations about their use in music programs, and create more opportunities for everyone to learn about and play music in a fun, approachable way.\u003cbr\u003e"
