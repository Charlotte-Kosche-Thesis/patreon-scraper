    "summary": "Heyooo friends. Its me Strictly Average, also known as Jeremy to my non-MTG friends and family. \u00a0I recently launched a blog revolving around the game of Magic the Gathering. \u00a0The blog was inspired by my success at trading paper cards for virtual currency on Pucatrade.com, and working to be a positive force in the Pucatrade Discord community. \u00a0I began simply by answering questions in the Discord chat and helping new traders. \u00a0After answering the same questions day in and day out, I decided it was a good time to start creating content I could direct people to. \u00a0The feedback and popularity of the blog has been amazing. Due to the support my blog has been receiving I have been inspired to do more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. I have invited you to join me on this journey and assist me to create more content that you love. \u00a0Help me, help you as the saying goes. The concept of the Patreon is so that I can expand the content I can offer. \u00a0Currently the blog is hosted on a free server because Magic and creating content for the game is a hobbie, and I have a family to feed. \u00a0There is much more I want to offer, more frequent posts, MTGO streams, YouTube Videos, and a podcast. Every donation, even a $1 a month will get me closer to our goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Blog can be found here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://strictlyaveragemtg.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://strictlyaveragemtg.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
