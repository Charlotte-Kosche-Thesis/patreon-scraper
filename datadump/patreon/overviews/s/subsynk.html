The community is there to bring together people with a common love of gaming. We host our own voice and forum servers and have several volunteers supporting the running and support of it all. We support many games, with some more popular than others and have a common ethos throughout of positive gaming values, respect and diversity! Given that the community has grown substantially with hundreds of members to date, the responsibility to maintain and steer things in the right way is now more important than ever! Come and take a look here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.timeofchaos.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.timeofchaos.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive Streaming\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I host two shows per day for five days a week. Doing thirty hours of live streaming a week is great fun and is a good way to spread the word. Just watch my streams to see what I am about:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/time_of_chaos\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/time_of_chaos\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic Production\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a very broad musical taste but prefer to produce bass heavy productions that push the boundaries, bringing together both old and new genres to form new sounds. I am also a professional DJ with many years of vinyl mixing experience in the club scenes throughout Europe. Where time permits I produce new sounds and offer these for free to the public, a small sample of these can be found on soundcloud/ mixcloud here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/subsynk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/subsynk\u003c/a\u003e /\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/subsynk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.mixcloud.com/subsynk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future \u0026amp; How You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future I plan to expand the ToC gaming community giving it more diversity both in terms of people and gaming, whilst keeping our ethos intact and our vision clear. In line with this I will be streaming even more regularly with the goal of publicising what ToC is and stands for and hopefully getting more people involved as a result. All these efforts however leave me little time to actually earn money to support myself and the community financially and this is where you can help! Join our community, watch my streams and listen to my music, it\u0027s costs you nothing to get involved but the rewards are high\u2026.then you may feel that pledging is the right thing to benefit all.\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/subsynk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
