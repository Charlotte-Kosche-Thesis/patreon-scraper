    "summary": "My name is Shoshana Kessock and I want to tell you a story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what I do: I\u0027m a storyteller. I like to tell stories in all kinds of mediums, like games, short stories, comic books, and screenplays. I\u0027ve had my fiction included in anthologies like \u003cem\u003eThe Lost Anthology\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0from Galileo Games\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand the \u003cem\u003eDoll\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0anthology from Ginger Goat. Mostly I\u0027m known for working on live action roleplaying games like \u003cem\u003eSERVICE \u003c/em\u003eand the upcoming \u003cem\u003eDresden Lives\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0project for Evil Hat Productions. It\u0027s been my privilege to work in games and to create fiction that I can share with the world. But to continue doing that, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince getting out of grad school, I\u0027ve suffered health setbacks and have been unable to find full-time employment. Moreover, I\u0027ve been trying to find a job while still producing producing the fiction and games that I love. And with my health being what it is, that\u0027s not always possible. So I want to try something new.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write a novel and I want your help to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it will work: every month, I will write another chapter of this novel I\u0027ve had stewing in my head. It\u0027s called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Black Stairs\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and its a dystopian-futuristic novel inspired by \u003cem\u003e1984, The Hunger Games, Divergent\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eThe Prophecy. (\u003c/em\u003eOne of those things doesn\u0027t sound like the other, huh? Yeah, I know. That\u0027s the fun party). It\u0027s about the survival of the spirit versus oppression, some scary bad guys, and a killer woman protagonist named Diana Scurros that I think will kick some serious butt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe novel will have some serious themes in it, like violence, loss of personal freedom, sexuality, and mental illness. Consider it at least a rated PG-13. There will be cursing. You know, just so you\u0027re warned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you support this Patreon,\u00a0you will receive a single chapter a month as the novel is being written. Should you sign up to support me after the novel writing has already begun, you will receive all back chapters as well so you can catch up on the story. At the very end, I will work with an editor to get the book published, either in traditional publication or by self-publishing, with my thanks to you printed in the novel for all to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs thanks for your patronage, I\u0027ve set up some rewards for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt $1 you receive my thanks on Twitter as well as in the thanks in the finished novel and on my website.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt $5 you will receive the chapters of \u003cem\u003eThe Black Stairs \u003c/em\u003eas they are written, plus all back chapters that were created.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt $10 you will receive the chapters of the book, plus the completed and edited book in PDF form upon its completion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt $25 you\u0027ll receive the chapters of the book, the finished PDF, plus have your name written into the game somewhere.
