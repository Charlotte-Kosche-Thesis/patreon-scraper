Other times, when I\u0027m lucky, and have no philosophical problem being a Taco Bell ringtone, they\u0027re worth a check that resembles a salary. Still, most often, they\u0027re worth nothing (thanks Spotify, which I use and love and hate all at once). But, dear reader, I know my songs (or at least some of them) are priceless to you, and I count myself lucky (and a bunch of other annoying, feely, hashtaggable new-age words) for this.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Often, I find, the less a project is a possible Taco Bell ringtone (i.e. a salary for me) the more it is worth to you (i.e. the TAKE/LEAVE mixtape) and so I\u0027ve figuratively knocked down the 4th wall of my studio for you to peer into, (i.e. a\u00a0daily podcast (Monday - Friday) \"YOU [DON\u0027T] KNOW ME\")\u00a0and listen along as I write, record, and produce music. And for the price of a coffee, or a coffee and a microwaved croissant-wich with weird plasticky cheez\u2122, your pledge affords me a reliable monthly wage, and the freedom to create the kind of music that is not necessarily payday music, which often, is better, more inspired, priceless music for people like you\u2122 and me\u2122.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
