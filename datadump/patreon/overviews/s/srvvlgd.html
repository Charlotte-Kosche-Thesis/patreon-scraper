    "summary": "Hey friends, thanks for stopping by my Patreon page! If you\u0027ve happened upon this page and you don\u0027t know me already, I\u0027m Emily Whitehurst and my musical project is Survival Guide. You can call me Em. I sing, I play keyboards, I sing into a telephone sometimes and other times I play a little plastic glockenspiel.

I want to have a place to do fun and creative things, and a group of interested people to share those things with. To me, that\u0027s basically the definition of an artist\u0027s dream. I love the feeling of giving something enjoyable back to the people who support me -- if you know me, you know I love treating my fans well. (Technically, you\u0027d be supporting me even more by signing up, but that\u0027s why you\u0027d get even more awesome stuff in return! It\u0027s a cycle.) And yes, there\u0027s money involved, but this Patreon is EXTREMELY casual. I understand that not everyone who is a fan will want to be part of this, and that\u0027s completely fine. I\u0027m not looking to swim through vaults of gold like Scrooge McDuck. Here\u0027s my order of importance (and this whole paragraph) in a nutshell: 1) Use Patreon to maintain constant creativity in a variety of fun ways. 2) Develop community of people who appreciate said creativity (YOU!), and deliver artworks to them directly. 3) Make a little $ to help keep creativity from being squashed by potential day job. *insert winky smiley emoji*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I get if I join your Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWellllllll... I\u0027m starting out with a few different price tiers and ideas for each one. They\u0027ll probably change as I adjust to what works and what doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll give me feedback on the rewards as we go. The main thing that everyone will get is access to downloadable cover songs, your name listed in my Thank You notes in my next album, and early access to EVERYTHING I\u0027ve got going on. You\u0027ll be the first to know release dates, tour dates, and any big (or small) news. You\u0027ll have early access to releases and music videos. And my extra special hope (as kinda mentioned above) is to get some friendships going --\u00a0 not only between you and me, but also between you and you (plural)! People start relationships online all the time, so why not make friends with other people who have similar interests? Anyway, back to the discussion of rewards. They\u0027ll vary depending on the tier you choose, but some for sure stuff is demos/pieces of new music I\u0027m working on, behind the scenes videos of being a musician, cooking/baking videos, cover song videos, custom birthday songs, postcards, chat sessions, choose your own cover song, and batches of cookies from me! I\u0027ve got lots of ideas for more stuff, but we\u0027ll start with this and see how it goes. I\u0027ll probably be throwing extra stuff in at all levels whenever I feel like it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly appreciate you just for having read all this. If you\u0027re interested in signing up, fantastic! I can\u0027t wait to have you as a patron and to be your artist! If not, please join me on your favorite social media platform by searching srvvlgd. And I still love you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exo Em"
