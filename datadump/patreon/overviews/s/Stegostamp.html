    "summary": "It\u2019s here. It works. It catches pirates so you can stop the leaks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you tired of pouring your heart and soul, blood, sweat, and tears into your work just to see it pirated on the internet moments after publication? I know, because it happens to my content all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStegostamp can help you solve that problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile nothing can prevent an unscrupulous patron from pirating your goods after they have their hands on it, what we CAN DO is find out who they are and cut off their access so they cannot do it again. You will know EXACTLY who it is so you can block them from future patronage, and Patreon\u2019s fraud department will gladly ban them as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStegostamp does its magic by hiding the patron\u2019s data in the pixels of the content itself, in a way that is invisible to the eye, yet robust enough to survive the following modifications:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eJPG\u00a0resaving/pixel reordering\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003escaling/resizing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eblurring\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHSV changes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecolor changes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003econtrast changes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebrightness changes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecropping\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eoverpainting\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eEven in the rare case that someone modifies the image enough to scramble the data, our scanner can still read a partial footprint and provide you with a match.\u00a0Essentially, the data will be readable up to the point where the image is either completely destroyed or vandalized beyond desirability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you find your image shared on a pirate site, you merely load it into the scanning utility and it will tell you exactly who the leak is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ipic.su/img/img7/fs/reader.1520035508.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis technology has been active in my other websites for many years and we are now bringing it to the Patreon platform. We already have it working as a Patreon plugin, and are refining it to be even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntegrating Stegostamp is easy, and requires no special software installation. You simply upload your image to our content server, paste a link in your post, and the plugin does the rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as a hint to what it can do: from initial tests with the newest (unreleased) version, the stamp is still readable after having been Photoshop-reduced to 15% of its original size, through a smartphone photo taken of the monitor. How awesome is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s also initially resistant to bot-parsing as it requires cookie acceptance, but we\u2019re also thinking of ways to make it long-term bot resistant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePresently the system works with JPEG files up to print resolution but we have also made it work for h264 video. Print-resolution lossless PNG files are on our to-do list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur eventual goal with this is to have it available as a low-cost subscription service for Creators. Hopefully, the more widely used it is, it will have a deterrent effect as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis initial offering of the Stegostamp service will be limited to a few creators, in order to test the system and work out bugs, make improvements, etc. Everyone participating in the beta test phase will receive a free year of Stegostamp service as a thank-you. Any additional patronage/donations will be used to fund the improvement and furtherment of the code and service.\u003cbr\u003e"
