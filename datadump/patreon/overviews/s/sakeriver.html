    "summary": "Keep the Channel Open is a biweekly podcast\u00a0featuring in-depth conversations with artists from a variety of disciplines.\u00a0The title of the show comes from an exchange between Agnes de Mille and legendary choreographer Martha Graham, which de Mille detailed in her biography of Graham:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe greatest thing she ever said to me was in 1943 after the opening of Oklahoma!, when I suddenly had unexpected, flamboyant success for a work I thought was only fairly good, after years of neglect for work I thought was fine. I was bewildered and worried that my entire scale of values was untrustworthy. I talked to Martha. I remember the conversation well. It was in a Schrafft\u2019s restaurant over a soda. I confessed that I had a burning desire to be excellent but no faith that I could be. Martha said to me, very quietly, \u201cThere is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep yourself open and aware to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. As for you, Agnes, you have a peculiar and unusual gift, and you have so far used about one-third of your talent.\u201d\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen I see my work I take for granted what other people value in it. I see only its ineptitude, inorganic flaws, and crudities. I am not pleased or satisfied.\u201d\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cNo artist is pleased.\u201d\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cBut then is there no satisfaction?\u201d\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cNo satisfaction whatever at any time,\u201d she cried out passionately. \u201cThere is only a queer divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\nIt is that drive to create, that blessed unrest that I seek to explore through conversations with my guests, diving into process and digging into the work. Creating a true collaboration with my guests is also important to me, so in each show I dedicate the second segment to any topic that the guest chooses.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the first year of the show we have shared conversations with photographers, novelists, poets, movement artists, painters, curators, and more, and we are excited to continue bringing you new episodes. Your contribution will help me cover my production costs, as well as helping me work toward my goals of being able to support the arts and literature. Even as little as $1 per month is greatly appreciated.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!"
