Through our podcast, we have made friendships (in person and online), we have been\u00a0intrigued, challenged, allowed to grow and most of all, inspired by our fabulous\u00a0listeners. We owe everything to\u00a0you for the\u00a0continued support, interaction and friendship since episode number one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are thankful and so happy to know you continue to tune in for\u00a0some good old fashioned,\nopinionated photography discussion in a podcast format. We hope you stay with us and enjoy the ride!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to\u00a0know a bit more behind the mics with Sid and Mac?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe may work in the fields of health \u0026amp; safety and IT respectively, but it is the world of photography which occupies our minds most of the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Shutter Time Roots:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter countless hours of conversations and a few shoots together, we realized we should be transferring our gift of gab to a platform where we can reach other photographers and photography enthusiasts alike. Shortly after our lightbulb moment and a virtual trip to B\u0026amp;H Photo, Shutter Time with Sid and Mac was born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHe Said / She Said: \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eShe \u003c/em\u003eloves to make outdoor images and look for wildlife, weathered structures and beautiful light. The Canadian Rockies and bacon-loving grizzly bears make her grin and she thinks shooting in the dirt is fun. She wants to be Moose Peterson when she grows up and has become obsessed with the art of printing her work. She has also been thinking about entering the drone world to change things up a bit. She is still all about decking out her gear in Realtree camo lenscoats.

He also looks like a combination of Indiana Jones and a National Geographic photographer on assignment from the 80s. True story. These days, you will find him on photo adventures with his wife and tinkering with medium format film whilst laying on frozen lakes to shoot the methane bubbles as he perfects the \u201c\u003cem\u003eart of arting\u003c/em\u003e\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are both highly opinionated, love photography, our wide-open Alberta skies and prairies, Elk Island, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksCTVFtjM4\"\u003eIT Crowd\u003c/a\u003e and cannot live without our cameras.
