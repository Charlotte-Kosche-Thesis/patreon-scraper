After a game is released, it\u0027s easy to say, \n\"well of course X performed like that, because (insert favorite pet \ntheory).\" Not only does this kind of punditry suffer from \n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias\"\u003ehindsight bias\u003c/a\u003e, it also suffers from \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\"\u003esurvivorship bias\u003c/a\u003e\nbecause these kind of statements are usually only made about whatever \nrandom assortment of games happen to bubble across someone\u0027s attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBut what would happen if you looked at \n\u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e the new releases and \nhad to commit to your predictions in advance? Would you still be so \nconfident in what you think you know about how the market works? Is it \nactually true, as some proclaim, that \n\u003cem\u003e\u0027all \"good\" games will always succeed?\u0027\u003c/em\u003e (Implying that games that don\u0027t meet some arbitrary metric failed to do so because they are somehow \"bad\")\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s find out.

It\u0027s primarily aimed at game developers, but anyone who has an\n interest is welcome to participate, either through regularly testing \ntheir own predictions, or by merely observing. I believe new developers \nwill learn the most, but we have found that even veterans have sharpened\n a few skills. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhen I first started out as a small developer, I was completely lost at\n sea. I didn\u0027t even know what questions to ask. Almost nobody shared \nsales results, and it seemed you needed to \"know somebody\" to get \ninformation or help. This experiment is a way to train business \nintelligence muscles in developers of all shapes and sizes, in an \nengaging way people are likely to stick with. It\u0027s also a way for \ndevelopers to connect with one another and share information that helps \nus all survive. It\u0027s not magic and won\u0027t make you a business genius or \nanything, and the data it generates is far from infallible (especially \nif it\u0027s not interpreted correctly), but it can help you tell which way \nthe wind is blowing in the unruly storms of the Steam marketplace.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSteamProphet in no way affiliated with Valve Software or the Steam game store.\u003c/h3\u003e"
