    "summary": "Thank you so much for stopping by Life With A Squeaky Touch (aka Life With Squeaky)!\u00a0 It warms my heart that you have chosen to spend time in our little corner of the world.\u00a0 You will find a vast array of Magickal things here, and I hope you enjoy what we have to offer you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me start by introducing myself.\u00a0 I go by many names, but those closest to me call me Squeaky.\u00a0 I have a passion for life that is far bigger than myself, and this passion is seen throughout all of my work.\u00a0 As someone who suffers from chronic physical and mental illness, I chose a unique career path that would allow me to contribute financially to my household while still being able to function in society (basically, I chose something that would keep me moving without putting me in excruciating pain and would allow me to interact with people and the world around me, all while having a schedule flexible enough that I can take extra time for myself when I get really sick).\u00a0 It was one of the best decisions I ever made, and I am so grateful that I get to do what I love every single day.\u00a0 All of my creative ideas, however, require money in one way or another to bring them from dream into reality.\u00a0 The more money we are able to collect, the bigger and better I am able to make things for all of you to enjoy.\u00a0 As a monthly patron, you will have access to my unique world while supporting a form of living art, an art which is crucial to humanity, especially in these times.\u00a0 We all need experiences around us to keep our hope and imagination alive, to make our voices heard by the masses, and I seek to create these experiences for all to enjoy.\u00a0 But first, a bit about exactly what it is that I do...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur company\u0027s mission statement:\u003c/strong\u003e Life With A Squeaky Touch\u2122 is dedicated to bringing unique, high quality professional \nentertainment and learning opportunities to the world. Our goal is to \ninspire and evoke creativity in those around us, as well as to foster an\n appreciation for and support of the performing arts. We also strive to \nstrike a perfect balance between doing well and doing good, the two most\n important elements to true wealth in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur company has many aspects to it.\u00a0 I will add to this description as we expand here on Patreon, but I will start with my dance.\u00a0 I am a Freelance Bellydance Fusion Artist.\u00a0 In the dance world, I am known as Luna Ketta\u2122, which translates to \"The Moon Cat\".\u00a0 Through my dance school and production company, Temple Of The Crescent Moon\u2122, I offer performance, instruction, choreography creation services, and event production.\u00a0 I have been studying dance professionally since 2010.\u00a0 While working at the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire back in 2004, I saw a beautiful group of dancers who would perform regular shows around the Shire, and I fell in love with a style of dance most commonly known as Bellydance.\u00a0 But it wasn\u0027t until January of 2010 that I finally found an opportunity to begin my studies.\u00a0 Since then I have studied both traditional and contemporary styles of Bellydance, as well as other dance styles.\u00a0 Over the last seven years, I have worked hard to create a style of Bellydance Fusion that is completely unique to me.\u00a0 I call it Dark Cabaret Bellydance\u2122.\u00a0 I take inspiration from my many dance mentors and those I admire.\u00a0 To this I add my own creative storytelling, a heavy dose of theatricality, and a touch of Spirituality to create something Magickal, something both inspirational and entertaining.\u00a0 I have earned multiple certifications in different dance disciplines as well as an award for my achievements in dance so far.\u00a0 I have also been featured on a local television show called \"Culture And Main\" in a segment on art that heals.\u00a0 In addition to the large variety of training that I offer to those seeking to add the beauty of movement to their world, I also currently produce three dance based events throughout Central Pennsylvania.\u00a0 The more support I get for these events, the bigger and better our team can make them for everyone.\u00a0 This support also allows me to focus more on continuing to evolve my craft.\u00a0 Please see the rewards section to see ways you can contribute to a living, breathing, ever evolving art form.\u00a0 (www.facebook.com/LunaKetta)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a singer.\u00a0 Since I have been able to speak, I have been singing.\u00a0 I had some rather traumatic events happen throughout my childhood involving my voice and lost complete confidence in myself for many years.\u00a0 I refused to sing for anyone.\u00a0 Then I got the opportunity to take some singing lessons.\u00a0 Between the lessons and the confidence I was gaining from performing as a dancer, my faith in my voice started to return.\u00a0 This past year, for the first time since high school, I auditioned for a musical.\u00a0 After that I decided to release my very first singing video on Facebook.\u00a0 I got a lot of positive feedback, so I am going to continue sharing my voice with the world.\u00a0 For all of my Patrons, I am currently offering monthly singing sessions.\u00a0 For every month that my current number of Patrons is 10 or more, I will offer these sessions LIVE with an exclusive opportunity to chat with me in real time and request songs for future broadcasts.\u00a0 I plan to pick up vocal lessons again after my surgery, and I will continue to expand and offer more goodies as I progress.\u00a0 I even have a crazy dream of releasing an album someday.\u00a0 Your support helps me to continue shaping this part of my dream, which equals more entertainment for you!\u00a0 The money you contribute will go towards things like vocal lessons, music production costs, and my ability to create new work.\u00a0 Your support of my voice means so much more to me than you will ever know, and I feel so blessed to be able to share it with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e"
