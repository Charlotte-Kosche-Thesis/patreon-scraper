    "summary": "Hi Everyone and welcome to my Patreon Page.  Most of you\nknow me from my Youtube page where I give lessons on the Seagull Merlin. \nI have been doing lessons for just under 3 years and have over 150 lessons\nranging from Traditional to Celtic to Country to Rock to a bunch in between. I\nlove doing my videos and don\u2019t see myself stopping anytime soon.  I have\nbeen asked in the past to start a Patreon Page and always thought I don\u2019t need\nsupport for something I love.  So why start a Patreon page now? Cause a\nmuch as I love doing lesson videos, I never wanted to do tabs.  So this\npage is the start of tabbing out all my lesson videos.  Now just like all\nmy videos are free and will always be free so will my Tabs.....overtime. \nI need to have a benefit for anyone that wants to support me. So I will release\naround 25 free tabs to start and then as I add new tabs they will available to\nmy supporters first and then after a week it will become free to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be posting 2 types of tabs.  There will be melody tabs where I tab\nout the song as an instrumental.  Basically taking the chords and adding\nthe vocal line that you play all at once.  And there will be Chord\nProgression tabs where I change the key of the song to work on the Merlin and\ntab out a basic chord progression.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease remember when reading my tabs, that I do not know how to read music.\u00a0 There\nfor the timing may be a bit off.  They are meant to be used with the\nlesson videos and used as a guideline.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe tab app I am using does not allow me to format for a 3 string instrument\nbut it is a far superior program that allows me to work fast and accurate. So\nwhen looking at my tabs ignore the top line as it means nothing.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to thank everyone who has supported me.  Without support and kind\nwords this would not be as fun.  Let me know if there is anything you want\nme to add to the rewards.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd as always Practice, Patience, and Have Fun."
