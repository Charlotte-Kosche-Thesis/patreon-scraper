    "summary": "I started using the Rust programming language a couple of years before its 1.0 release and started contributing to the gamedev ecosystem developing a collision detection library and a physics engine. I also contribute to the scientific computing ecosystem by developing a linear algebra library. I\u0027ve always found this programming language exciting and wanted to use my scientific knowledge to contribute to the community. All my projects are (and will always be) open source and free, under the BSD-3 license.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessionally, I am a R\u0026amp;D engineer in computer science. I work on the streaming of large 3D models on all platforms. I currently work part-time so that I can dedicate at least 2 full days to my rust project. Though I don\u0027t know for how long this will be financially viable (see the first goal of this patreon profile on this).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope one day to be able to work full-time on my Rust projects in order to contribute as much as I can to the community. Currently, I do all this during my free time, and pay for the websites and the user forum. Financial aid of any amount would be greatly appreciated and may hopefully allow me to contribute part-time or full-time to the Rust ecosystem in the future. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks a lot!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaintained projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe source code of all my projects are hosted on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sebcrozet\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egithub\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.nalgebra.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enalgebra\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u2212 A linear-algebra library written in rust.
