    "summary": "NOW, for those of you who\nchoose to purchase a piece my soul, it is yours for all eternity as we know it. \u00a0Thanks to your support, I will be able to continuously create anew. \u00a0Please know that I will be\u00a0\u003cem\u003eeternally\u003c/em\u003e grateful.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have many videos,\nnew music, and other rewards featured here for those of you who kindly become a\npatron!  Thank you for being on this journey with me.  This is just\nthe beginning... which continues always!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecoming a patron is not\nlike Kickstarter.  This is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e a\none-time donation.  You are\nbecoming a long-term investor in the continuation of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I would like to be able to put\nbits of my soul into tiny bottles and send them to you, but obviously, that\u0027s\na little challenging, because who can say how much soul fits in a 1 ounce\nbottle or in a 10 ounce bottle? \nBecause of that, you are simply going to have to trust me!  It will be coming to you on silver wings\nwith my every breath. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027d certainly rather sell\nmy soul to YOU,  the people who\ncare about what I do, as I continue my journey in art\u2026as opposed to the\nalternative! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou may ask, how can I\nbecome an investor in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sarahfimm.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSarah\u0027s work\u003c/a\u003e, and become a steward of a piece of her\nsoul?  Well, here\u0027s HOW IT\nWORKS:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon lets\nfans support their favorite creators by becoming patrons. Unlike other\nfundraising services, which focus on raising funds for a single project, Patreon is for\ncreators who create a stream of smaller works constantly!  You can set a budget as a patron, and decide on\na particular amount.  It can\nbe $1,$5, $10, $100 and so forth!  If you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, there\u0027s an\neasy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your\npayment info. Also, it\u0027s important that you know that you can opt out at\nanytime.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI plan to dole out\nfractions of my soul once every month to all my patrons in the form of music,\nvideos, photography, writing, demos, original lyrics, and all kinds of other\ninformation that is virtually inaccessible through any other medium, and is\nonly available through my Patreon page and other password-protected locations\non the web!  Rewards are relative to the amount that you donate.  The\namount and type of new and original content you receive will depend on the\ndegree of your investment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! YOU decide what portion of my soul you\u0027d like to procure. No amount is too small! \u00a0I am confident that with you, it will be in safe keeping. Better you angels than the other option, (and we all know who that is)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n*Remember to store all soul fragments away from\nwarm temperatures exceeding 4000 degrees in a 100% crush-proof and fire proof\ncontainer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "At heart, I am a composer. I work to champion the efforts of the dreamers that add to the substance of the world we inhabit through curiosity, talent, action, and the wonder of the imagination. I have a consuming passion for creating events where musicians, visual artists, dancers, scientists, and non-profit organizations can work together to generate awareness for important causes.\u003cbr\u003eIn between creating \u003ca href=\"http://www.sarahfimm.com/mystore\"\u003eten studio albums\u003c/a\u003e, I toured internationally with Peter Murphy of the iconic rock group Bauhaus in 2005, and with electronica band, Delerium in 2008. In 2009, I released the six-song EP \u003ca href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/fimm4\"\u003eWhite Birds\u003c/a\u003e, the studio album, \u2018Red Yellow Sun\u2019 and a collection of B-sides and remixes called \u2018\u003ca href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/fimm6\"\u003eThe Vanishing Sessions\u003c/a\u003e.\u2019 In 2010, the \u201cKarma Phala Music Project\u2019 was born. This collection of 31 tracks, photography, artwork and a personal message, was given away for free to people willing to help share the music in a conscious way. The project, which has been downloaded and streamed over 1,000,000 times on file sharing and streaming sites, was made available on a free 1GB thumb drive to anyone that agrees to pass it forward or create something with it. Just six months after the release, I began receiving stories from around the world detailing the journey of these drives. The result was touching beyond words. Hopefully with your support, I will be able to expand this idea on a number of levels, and bring people together through music while creating roads for people to discover new, independent artists and musicians.\u003cbr\u003eFor nearly three years now, I have dedicated a great deal of time to a concept I call INSPIRE ART. This blossoming internet community which now has thousands of participants worldwide is meant to encourage collaboration between talented souls across the world, act as an engine to facilitate the creation of new music, emerging art, and encourage different forms of expression. Human rights, conservation, and psychology are just a few topics that have infused the essence of Inspire Art since its inception. Above all, Inspire Art is a supportive environment where creators can meet each other, get constructive feedback on new work, and discover new methods. If you are a musician, artist, dreamer, engineer, inventor, educator, or just someone who\u2019d like to join a movement toward a world where art can flourish, there are now several online portals on \u003ca href=\"http://www.sarahfimm.com/inspireart\"\u003eFimm Inspire Art\u003c/a\u003e, Facebook,\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/115315032076517602507\"\u003eGoogle+\u003c/a\u003e, Tumblr and so on!\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012, from June 10th-June 30th, at the Bearsville Complex in Woodstock, NY, I created an art installation entitled, \u201cMirrors of Near Infinite Possibility\u201d AKA \u201cThe Sparkle Park.\u201d The presentation was meant to honor artists both living and departed. The names of visionary musicians, artists and poets who have in some way contributed to the inspiration for this project, were glowing all night long beside the river. After sewing together 5,000 mirrors by hand with fishing line, and placing 500 solar-powered lights in the ground alongside them, people arrived to witness the spectacle. 3-D Glasses were available to all who came to visit the installation. It was an extraordinary experience. On June 30th, the final evening of the Sparkle Park Installation, a gala celebration was held at the theater, featuring a concert performance with many notable Woodstock musicians. It was such a pleasure to be on the stage that night. Together, with the help of the SEVA Foundation, we raised enough to restore the eyesight of nearly 60 human beings. \u003ca href=\"http://www.seva.org/\"\u003eSeva Foundation\u003c/a\u003e partners worldwide to create self-sustaining programs that preserve and restore eyesight. The Sparkle Park was dedicated to Artist Ian Sharp (February 17th, 1978 \u2013 March 25th, 2012) and the list of legendary people that contributed to that evening includes Joel Bluestein, David Baron, Danny Blume, Andrew Shober, Manuel Quintana, Pete Caigan, Peter Buettner, Jeffrey Barnes, Denise Parent, Burnell Pines, The Hooligans, and more. Hopefully, with your support, the Sparkle Park will live again soon!\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I am working hard on completing two, new albums. The first two singles, \u2018\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fax6TMb6Uu4\"\u003eRock And Roll Star\u003c/a\u003e\u2018 and \u2018\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9puTWHqiUPU\"\u003eI Am\u003c/a\u003e\u2018, are now available through my website. The first album, \u201cPotnia Theron,\u201d is a collection of anthemic, orchestral rock songs infused with analog, electronic synthesizers. The second album to be released, \u201cAdaquarium,\u201d is an experimental album of purely instrumental compositions. Dozens of rare, one-of-a-kind instruments make their appearance on both new records. Nearly 100 musicians, including our friends at the FAMES Macedonian Orchestra, came together to help complete this project. I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to properly thank all these wonderful artists. Most particularly, I would like to thank my producer and friend, David Baron, who is nothing short of visionary. His continued presence on Earth is something I cherish deeply because, I know the world is a better place with him in it. All of the musicians that participated in the creation of this new music instill within me a drive to be better at what I do, and to accomplish each task with more passion and determination than I did the moment before.\u003cbr\u003eOver the next several weeks, I am creating a limited-edition package for all of the human beings who are deeply supportive of what I do. The \u201cGolden Honeycomb\u201d package will be filled to the brim with two brand new albums, a personalized 8\u00d710 one-of-a-kind Sarah Fimm acrylic, signed painting, a limited-edition Fimm T-Shirt, a thumb-drive with high-res WAV files of additional bonus tracks from the new instrumental record \u2018Adaquarium\u2019 and other unreleased, rare material. The people who buy this package through my website will make it possible for me to continue on this path of music and visual art. I am assembling these special packages for you with my own hands. It is incredibly important to me to bring art into the physical world, and bring it to people in a personalized way.\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who choose to become a patron of the music and art that I create in one way or another, please know that I am forever grateful as it is my dream to continue doing this. I have many videos, new music, and other surprises coming up for those of you who kindly support my life and work by on this here our planet Earth! Thank you for being on this journey with me. This is just the beginning, which continues always!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
