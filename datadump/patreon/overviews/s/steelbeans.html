    "summary": "Hello my name is Jeremy and for over 10 years I have been the leading force behind Salmonella Records, located in North Everett, WA. I have produced hundreds of songs of literally every genre, countless acrylic paintings, album and flyer art produced through photoshop (often utilizing derivatives of my paintings and physical art) Music video content including abstract colorful psychedelia sharing my style for visual art, as well as comedic work as well.\u003cbr\u003eAside from writing and recording music I also do my best to properly represent the songs in live performances, but what is equally important is that\u00a0 I strive to put on a one of a kind show every time including improvisation, theatrical additions involving sketches, costumes, props, jokes, lights and more. Most importantly the energy is always there at the forefront. I take pride in knowing whatever I do, I do my best and I feel like we are a big contribution to the local art community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you that help and support the vision there are no words to fit my gratitude for you in doing so. Art is my life, and the cost of producing the consistent output of work is every penny I have and nearly every minute of my time. \u003cbr\u003e"
