Below is some information about what I do and how you can support me and why you should!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love playing video games. Like, a lot! It\u0027s something that I really enjoy doing in my free-time. Oh and I enjoy helping out others who play games too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe problem is that I don\u0027t earn a lot from YouTube. I don\u0027t even earn anything by streaming on Twitch and outside of YouTube (ie real life), I don\u0027t have other income. This Patreon page is your way of helping to support my YouTube channel, allowing me to continue to reinvest into it, with new games, PC repairs and so on. You also help indirectly to ensure that I can actually stay online with my fibre broadband connection, allowing me to actually stream video game content! See below for examples of my video work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFreelance Moderation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut this Patreon\u00a0page is not just about what I do on YouTube/Twitch. I am a moderator and \"Community Manager\" on many Discord communities, helping them with moderation, leadership and more. Those who donate $4 or more to the Freelance Moderator rank will be able to benefit from my large wealth of experience to boost their community in a positive direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you need more details on this, it\u0027s best to send me a message on Discord: to reduce spam, I have my DM\u0027s closed in many servers, but you will find me easily over at my personal server:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/e3cppNg\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/e3cppNg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBenefits\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery person who supports me here on Patreon get access to my Patron-only posts. Those who donate enough money will get a special role on my Discord Server and a hidden channel that only Patrons have access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you have a small amount of money, go ahead and donate to this page, every little bit helps! I will thank you 20 million times (not really, but I\u0027ll give you loads of hearts!) for all your donations that will help to support me, not only in the real world, but in my personal freelancing interests!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eVideos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s some videos I\u0027ve created on YouTube, newest first!\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItMITvKUxQw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZknxMaVSVk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGkULkSWGPk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
