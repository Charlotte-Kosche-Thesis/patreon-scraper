    "summary": "I am asking for people to consider becoming a monthly supporter of these concert series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe events create performance opportunities for established and emerging Jazz ensembles representing the very best of the Twin Cities Jazz Scene. The weekly concerts are well publicized on social media, happen at predictable week-after-week locations, and are totally self-supporting through the voluntary contributions of audience members at the events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough your continued support, each performance in one of these series provides pre-negotiated and right-sized compensation for the participating groups. This allows the bandleaders to make fulfillable commitments to appear and perform with their regular group members on dates that are considered prime earning time for the first-call Jazz musicians. The end result of this financial front-loading is that we all have the opportunity to hear better and more cohesive Jazz acts. \u00a0Some series events also provide \u0027opening set\u0027 opportunities for emerging ensembles and artists, or for projects that are still incubating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past three years, these series have been underwritten for the most part by myself and my production company, \u003ca href=\"http://www.illicit-productions.com./\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.illicit-productions.com.\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0These series have been an overwhelming artistic and cultural success, and have become an important weekly fixture in the much heralded Twin Cities Jazz Scene, which was uniquely recognized by the City Pages in 2015 as \"Best Jazz Artist\". \u00a0... They gave the award to the whole Scene!! \u00a0(See the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.citypages.com/best-of/2015/arts-and-entertainment/best-jazz-artist-7366073\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCity Pages Article\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very grateful for the many regular audience members who have been generously contributing at the events, and I understand how each person who might be a staunch supporter of these concert series and of the Jazz Scene in general cannot always show up on a weekly basis and contribute to the tip jar even if they wanted to, so this\u00a0Patreon campaign has been created to allow people to \"subscribe\" to the series as a supporter by making a monthly contribution to these efforts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll money will go directly to the Musicians performing at the events and for the modest marketing and promotional efforts undertaken by the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the three specific Concert series your contributions will support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Saturday Night Jazz at the Black Dog series, located\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.saturdaynightjazzattheblackdog.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe illicit Jazz Workshop, located\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theillicitjazzworkshop.info\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thursdaynightjazzatreverie.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \"All Originals\" Jazz Series, located\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.originaljazz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteve Kenny\u003cbr\u003e"
