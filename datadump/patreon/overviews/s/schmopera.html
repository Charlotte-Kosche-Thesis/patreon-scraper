    "summary": "WHAT IS SCHMOPERA?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all, Schmopera grew out of a love for singers. We\u2019re lucky to count opera singers among our friends and colleague, and we noticed a disappointing disparity between \u003cstrong\u003ehow these singers are represented in the media, and how fascinating and down-to-earth they really are.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust like the real-life opera singer - who is nothing like the large, horned-lady stereotype - opera itself is an art form that is likely very different from how opera virgins might imagine it. We\u2019re committed to pulling back the curtain on the whole thing, and proving that \u003cstrong\u003ea night at the opera is for everyone\u003c/strong\u003e; it requires no homework, and costs less than you think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSchmopera is a place to get to know opera and the people that create it. We publish how-to articles for artists, crash-course pieces geared towards newcomers, interviews with singers, reviews of performances, and opinion pieces. \u003cstrong\u003eAll of our content is written by people who work or have worked directly in the opera industry\u003c/strong\u003e, and all of our contributors are committed to talking about the art form without pretension or stereotype.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re proud to bring you quality content within a clean, user-friendly experience, and we want to bring you more unbiased, broad-reaching material. Frankly, \u003cstrong\u003ewe don\u2019t like the idea of placing ads on our site\u003c/strong\u003e; but with the help of you, our passionate readers, the creators of Schmopera can make it a full-time job. We can bring you more frequent content from more cities around the world, and our supporters can suggest ideas for topics and interview subjects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor almost four years, we\u2019ve grown Schmopera organically with very little paid marketing; \u003cstrong\u003eour content speaks for itself.\u003c/strong\u003e That\u2019s why we\u2019re confident that it\u2019s not ads, but our readers who are our biggest source of support. Your contributions can guarantee that we give our full attention to offering you candid interviews, learning opportunities, and topics to pique your interest about the grand art form you already love.\u003cbr\u003e"
