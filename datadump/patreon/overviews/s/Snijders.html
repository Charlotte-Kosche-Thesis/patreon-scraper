    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ben Snijders, I am a second year student studying computer programming at the University of Leiden. I have been coding and 3d modeling for quite some time. I decided to make my first game using RPGmaker. I also have a partime job in the weekends to pay for my study (poor student :D). I will be working on this RPG game project in my free time (between university and partime job). One of my goals will be to quit my part time job and focus more on developing games!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game which I am working on is titled \"Happily\u00a0Married (and the virgin friend)\". This game will be mainly focused on Netorare :). It follows a story of a woman named Rachel. The protagonist who is happily married to her husband is a typical housewife, she loves to cook for his beloved husband. One day the husband gets a promotion at work and they decide to move to a bigger house. At the new job the husband meets a guy named Bill (the virgin :D) A few weeks later Bill the virgin gets fired from his job, and even though Max and Bill have been friends for a short period of time the husband named Max decides to bring Bill over to his house for dinner. When the wife opens the door the husband explains to her that he brought a friend from work named Bill for dinner, because Bill just got fired and since Bill doesn\u0027t have any other friends. During the dinner the married couple tries to motive Bill by saying that he shouldnt be sad and that he should be able to get a new job in no time. Beacuse the couple were so nice to Bill (and the wife is super hot) Bill gets an idea, and asks the couple: Now that im fired and no where to live, do you mind if i stay with you guys for a couple of days unitll i find a new job? The couple were shocked, because they diden\u0027t expect to hear this. The husband met Bill and knew him only from work and that for a very short time. When Bill sees the couple talking about it he suspects that they won\u0027t agree to this, and Bill gets sad. The couple still talking about it and agreeing that i\u0027ts not a good idea to let Bill stay since they dont\u0027know him very well. But after looking at Bill and seeing the frown on Bills sad face, the couple talk for a few more minutes more and after a while they decide that Bill could stay a couple of nights with them. When they tell Bill about this he gets so excited\u00a0and hugs Max and his wife Rachel (he hugs the wife a little longer :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this adult rpg game you play as the housewife. Cleaning and cooking for your husband and waiting for him to get back home from work is one of the things you do. When the husband goes to work you and Bill are alone in the house. Bill is mainly spending his day looking for work on the internet. Rachel the wife does her normal daily routine, doing house chores. After a few days when Bill gets comforatble living with the married couple he gets a few ideas in his head. Because he is a virgin and never had a girlfriend or any female friend he is always shy and very excited to be arround the super hot wife of Max. Bill has many ideas on how to try to trick the married woman, he thinks to himself \"I could apply for a photography job, and ask her to pose for me?\" \"Or maybe I could ask her to play a little game with me, while we wait for Bill to get home, I could ask to play a guessing game, where the person guessing has to put on a blindfold and has to taste the stuff and try to gues what it is. It is up to you as the wife to agree to this or decline it, the choice\u00a0is yours :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am trying to create a realistic scenario for this game, i never liked games where the protoganist starts innocent the first 5 minutes of the game and then becomes a cock hungry slut in the next 10 minutes. My goal is to bring an Adult rpg game that will bring slow corruption (or not) to the wife, the decision is up to you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of yet the corruption stats are not included in the alpha (not released to the public yet) I will release the first demo with a few scenes and try to implement the corruption stats into the game, but i will mainly focus on the story and scenes of the game. Each day you will have small routines, go shopping , clean the house, buy groceries and make dinner. And the choice whether to get tricked/corrupted is up to you...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some screenshots of the 3d model im using in this game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Tmran6i.png\" style=\"width: 383px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iOmPr6P.png\" style=\"width: 385px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3CPpolC.png\" style=\"width: 395px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3rYj1Ln.png\" style=\"width: 380px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/g3VY2b2.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just a few of the many pictures, mind you that i\u0027m trying to make the model better and better each time. I am from The Netherlands, and the game will be 100% in English! I will proof read it myself and ask my friend at the uni. No more machine hooking and trying to understand what the game and story is all about just enjoy it in full ENGLISH ! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game will have different costumes as will interact with the scene and the reaction to them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe progress of making this game will depend on whether i get enough support from you guys, the more support the faster and better the game will be! Because i am a student and working a part time job in the weekend i can only work on this game when i have free time. If i get enough support i can drop my part time job and focus on this game!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is currently in Alpha stage, a demo/playable version will be released depending on how much time i get to work on this game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like \u00a0to thank you all for checking my Patreon page, I would apperciate it if you become my Patron, and I hope you enjoy the game when it comes out!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
