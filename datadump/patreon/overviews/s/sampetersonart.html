I am always creating art and\u00a0have a large list of personal projects I want to pursue. I have plans for art and projects that span months, and even years into the future and\u00a0Patreon will allow me to take on less commercial work and dedicate more time towards my own art and personal pursuits.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese would primarily be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal art\u003c/strong\u003e: Personal art and illustrations that aren\u0027t freelance related.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube videos\u003c/strong\u003e: A YouTube series that would include art tutorials and timelapse videos where I discuss various art related topics I am frequently asked about on my Twitch channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal projects\u003c/strong\u003e: Long term personal projects I\u0027d like more time to pursue. Currently this includes some games I\u0027d like to make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a Patron you will receive\u003c/strong\u003e the various rewards (depending on the tier you choose) that I don\u0027t post anywhere else online, which include: \u003cbr\u003e-Access to my Patreon exclusive feed.\u003cbr\u003e-Full res images\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Animated process GIFs\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e-In depth step by step process images with explanations\u003cbr\u003e-Layered PSD files.\u003cbr\u003e-Access to the Patreon Exclusive Discord community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will share my process and art with supporters as well as anything I happen to be working on. Patreon supporters will be the first to hear news about any projects or announcements, and often times see art before it\u0027s posted elsewhere. Throughout each Month I will release various art and creations. This might vary a little bit each month between concept art, illustration, sketchbook work, and YouTube videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe $10 tier has access to my \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive Discord \u003c/strong\u003ecommunity.

I will also share with you what I\u0027ve learned that month, and any realizations or new techniques I\u0027ve been using and how I feel they\u0027ve helped me. I\u0027ll be sharing and explaining what I\u0027ve been learning in the hopes that it might be of use to you too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccess to Patreon Lens: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a Snapchat-like feature on Patreon where I can show exclusive behind the scenes content. This could include current sketchbook work, in-progress art, or any daily life events or sights I think could be fun to share. This is a way to get a little more of a personal look at what I\u0027m up to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNews and art not yet shared elsewhere online\u003c/strong\u003e: As Patrons you\u0027ll be the first to see hear any news or projects I haven\u0027t yet announced outside of Patreon. As well as the first to see finished art and things I\u0027ve been working on that haven\u0027t yet been posted online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for the support!"
