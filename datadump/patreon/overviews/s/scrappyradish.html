Let me share this space with you and fill it with small details for those who are curious, caring, or just faraway fans. In addition to sharing full photo sets and behind-the-scenes content, I use this space to share concepts, inspiration and travel writings.\u00a0Common themes I enjoy exploring with\u00a0my photography include: the body, nature, unpredictable elements, and eroticism expressed through \u003cem\u003ecuriosity\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eexpression\u003c/em\u003e. I often work with nude, implied nude or images that tell a story using the body and natural light.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSelf Portraits:\u003c/strong\u003e Nearly all of the images you will see on my Patreon will be \u003cem\u003eself-portraits\u003c/em\u003e. Although most of my fine art photography features other artists and muses, I don\u0027t feel comfortable profiting from these collaborations or someone else\u0027s body. For this reason I post mostly my self-portrait work, with the exception of monthly collaborative sets featuring paid models. These sets are only available to $50+ patrons (so that I am able to pay my collaborators).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAsk The Artist:\u003c/strong\u003e I encourage my patrons to submit questions to my message box about my process, interests, equipment, inspiration or anything else you are curious about! I will post these Q \u0026amp; A\u0027s for patrons to read (questions can be anonymous).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see more of my work visit:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/scrappyradish/\"\u003e@scrappyradish\u003c/a\u003e on Instagram\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hillaryolsonphotography.com/\"\u003ewww.hillaryolsonphotography.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
