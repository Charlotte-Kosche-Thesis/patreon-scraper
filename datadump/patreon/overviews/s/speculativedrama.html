    "summary": "I am an actor first, and world-builder foremost. In 2011 I co-founded Portland Oregon\u0027s only underground arts oriented venue, The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven with Myrrh Larsen. This venue provided an opportunity to create independent theatre, and in 2015 I combined my two passions as Artistic Director of Speculative Drama, an immersive theatre project in residence at The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven, creating site-specific work based in fairy tale and Shakespeare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeculative Drama is a unique producing company that draws from, but does not fit into traditional \"small theatre\" models. As an immersive and environmental theatre company, our primary thrust is actor and text-focused explorations of the intersection between classic stories and non-traditional storytelling. As such, many of the funding avenues open to theatre companies do not apply to us: instead we rely entirely on donations to this patreon, and twice-yearly fundraising events. Each year, we produce two 100% crowd-funded productions, creating some of Portland\u0027s most intimate and immersive theatrical experiences: with one foot in the faerie realm, and the other in the classics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeculative Drama\u0027s \"season\" consists of one wordless movement play based on a lesser-known fairytale, and one Shakespeare production, both pieces created in collaboration with local underground performance venue The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven and placing the audience directly into the action of our shows. Combining the principles of environmental theatre, rich and immersive soundscapes, and an extremely intimate setting, we create an atmosphere of innovation while honoring and maintaining the original texts or source materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve just begun pre-production on a brand-new wordless movement play, based on the Irish fairytale The White Hound of the North, which opens in mid-March!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"There are more things in heaven and earth\"...and let\u0027s make them together."
