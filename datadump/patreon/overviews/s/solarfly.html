Using TARGET, I have done the work for you by programming logical placement of controls for ease of muscle memory.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all of you for supporting the profile, backing me with donations and words of encouragement! I was asked by fans a long time ago to put up a Patreon page so they could show their appreciation. So if you wish to donate, here\u0027s a way to do that ($1.00 will get you my undying gratitude).  And, since I only bill patrons on major feature releases (like Star Citizen 2.1, 2.6 and 3.0) or training video, it will probably amount to less than a coffee at Starbucks per year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe profile for Star Citizen 3.0 is freely available at \u003ca href=\"http://3dpipeline.net.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://3dpipeline.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe profile is and will always remain free to use. There are truly over a hundred hours of planning, coding and documentation effort that have gone into the profile to date out of my love for Star Citizen and the growing community. Flying with HOTAS is a great experience!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really went into this expecting nothing in return, but have received so much enthusiasm and warmth from the community. You guys are awesome and it keeps me going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3dpipeline.net/thrustmaster/v30/TMW1_StarCitizen_v30.jpg\" style=\"width: 508px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3dpipeline.net/thrustmaster/v30/TMW2_StarCitizen_v30.jpg\" style=\"width: 507px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3dpipeline.net/thrustmaster/v30/TMW3_StarCitizen_v30.jpg\" style=\"width: 507px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3dpipeline.net/thrustmaster/v26/LMFD_StarCitizen_v26.jpg\" style=\"width: 508px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

In my gaming life, I play everything, from MMOs to shooters and simulations. \u00a0Star Citizen (http://robertsspaceindustries.com) is a passion of mine as I grew up loving flight and space sims. The Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS and Cougar MFD (Multi Function Displays) give me the level of control and customization through a low-level programming language called TARGET Script, which is powerful enough to meet the demanding complexity of Star Citizen\u0027s control mapping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsability and logic behind a mapping are important to me, and I depend heavily on community feedback to make the profile as good as it can be. So you\u0027ll find me frequently on the RSI forums and on reddit/r/starcitizen.",
