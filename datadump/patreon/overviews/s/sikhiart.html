However, after graduating, all I ever wanted to do was paint Sikh legends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 9 years, I have been working hard at Sikhi Art, at creating beautiful paintings of Sikh legends, of Sikh Gurus and Guardians, with a special emphasis on Bir ras and Sant ras, the Essence of Warriors and Saints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I meditated on the Saints, I grew spiritually, I began to understand the depth of the Indian Epics that Guru Sahibs and their Poets translated for us. Immediately, they filled me with strength and inspiration. So I started creating paintings of the Gods as well, to share that inspiration with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuys! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is my passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making art, I love to read and study our history and culture, and I love to interact with you guys! I love to read your comments, they fill me with glee and inspire me to create more paintings for you guys to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(It\u0027s a cycle - I paint, you enjoy, you tell me you enjoy, I enjoy, I paint more...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to work on Sikhi Art full-time, which will allow me to enter a positive space where I can focus on my energy and creativity on creating more awesome paintings and projects for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will allow me to focus on paintings that will inspire new generations to come, paintings that bring to the forefront those hidden gems of the past. It will allow me to focus on building my art tutorials to help young artists grow to their full potential. It will also allow me to work on side projects like educational games and scriptural translations, which will provide tremendous value to our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my art tutorials and side projects will be distributed for free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I need your support in this endeavour!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows you to support your favourite artists and their projects, for as little as $0.03 a day. It seems like a great way to sponsor projects we care about as a community that benefit us, individually and as a whole. So I am excited to join the large community of artists on Patreon who are using this service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I can focus on providing value to you through paintings, art videos and other projects. Additionally, I can focus on improving my craft as well as the content I create for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the left hand side of my Patreon page, you can see my Goals and my dreams, and how I would grow Sikhi Art into something even bigger, through a variety of projects. These are projects which I have been working on for a while like educational games, translations and comics. I have included a brief summary of the projects in this section. I will share more information about these projects as our Patreon community grows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Goals section also contains rewards for Patrons, however they are designed to benefit the community as a whole. We will do things to celebrate their completion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, anything you give is appreciated a lot, so please support me in this journey and Become a Patron of Sikhi Art!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are not able to give anything and you still want to support what I do then share my art on Facebook, Twitter and tell your friends and family about my art. That helps a lot as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI appreciate all your love and support. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBhagat Singh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSikhi Art\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
