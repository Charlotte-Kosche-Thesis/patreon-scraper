    "summary": "Hi there! I\u2019m Wendy Crescent, if you are here then you most likely know me from \u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Wendy%20Crescent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFimFiction\u003c/a\u003e where I write My Little Pony fan fiction in a variety of settings. Most notably I am the author of \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/346962/the-makings-of-a-songbird\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Makings of a Songbird\u003c/a\u003e\u201d, a completed work of almost 21,000 words set in the Clocktower Society created by Manifest Harmony. More recently I have begun work on \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/359063/fallout-equestria---the-chains-that-bind-us\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Chains That Bind Us\u003c/a\u003e\u201d set in the wonderful universe of \"Fallout: Equestria\" created by Kkat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write general erotic and Fallout: Equestria content, including shipfics and one-shots. At any given time I have several stories in progress which have yet to see the light of day and there\u2019s a few I have pulled from Fimfiction after deciding they\u2019re best re-written entirely.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, you are\nprobably asking, or some of you might be screaming:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\"Wendy, girl, this is clearly a cash\ngrab. How could you become a sell-out!?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhich is a\nfair question.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst and\nforemost regardless of how this Patreon thing turns out I will be continuing my\nwriting, and will be releasing new content as I can. That being said as of\nOctober 1st 2017 I am officially without a job and commission writing on sites\nlike\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/wendy_crescent/write-your-epic-story\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFiverr\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fimfiction.net/user/218072/Wendy+Crescent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFimfiction.net\u003c/a\u003e and Patreon are my only sources of income now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease Schedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eMonthly:\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne 5,000 word story chapter\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eOne 2,500 word story chapter\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eOne 2,000 word Patreon commission Tier chapter\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eBi\nMonthly\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e3,000 Word Patreon Exclusive\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Original Writing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary reasons for writing are to entertain, enlighten or simply offer my own view to others. Most of all to entertain and hopefully make other people smile through of my writing. I love hearing from people that what I wrote brought a smile to their faces or just made a shitty day marginally better for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately my goal is to become a professional writer.\nThis means eventually writing content other than MLP: FIM fan fiction. However\nthis will not mean I will stop writing within the My Little Pony universe. My\nfirst step into that is already in the process of being written in the form of\na story by the name of \u201cThe Road To Lichdom\u201d which is a non MLP story focused\non anthropomorphic ponies in a medieval fantasy setting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story follows a young mage by the name of Emerald Night on her journey from being a novice to fulfilling her destiny. It\u0027s a story about love, loss, duty and sacrifice. You can find an excerpt of The Road To Lichdom story\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fFbG8hrDEeZJ6DHe2NFzja0TUG2cdZ7NjUy9dtGNLPE/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e if you are curious about it. I will be posting chapter here upon\ncompletion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, to sum things up, regardless of success:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- You don\u0027t need to pledge to gain access to my normal content. \u003cbr\u003e- You can pause or stop the pledge any time you want, there will be no hard feelings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to take a moment to thank you for your consideration of supporting me. It means a lot to me that you would take the time to read through this. So, thank you for taking the time and if you decide to pledge thank you for your support. If not, then I hope you have a good day as well regardless. Please consider sharing my page, it does really help me get out there."
