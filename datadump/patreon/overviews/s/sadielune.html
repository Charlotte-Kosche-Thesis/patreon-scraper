She has won awards for her short films and performances, exhibited explicit whore-positive work in venues from a former army barracks latrine to the SFMOMA, and shown her cervix internationally (in homage to the great Annie Sprinkle). Her writing is published in anthologies and magazines in the United States and Europe such as Bend Over Magazine and $pread.  She is co-editing WhoreLover, an anthology of writing by the romantic partners of sex workers with P. Crego and Gala Vanting. Sadie lives in Berlin with her baby.",
