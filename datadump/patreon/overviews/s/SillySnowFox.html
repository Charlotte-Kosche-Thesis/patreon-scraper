The game is coming along nicely, but it would be nice to be able to work on it more then I currently am able to. But to do that, I would need some other source of income beside my current job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect much, but even a few bucks would help me produce more content faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, Consume isn\u0027t the only game I would like to make, I have ideas for two other text adventure games that I would like to create, currently they are going to have to wait until Consume is much further along then it currently is. Were I able to focus even part-time on the game I would be able to start working on a second while still making progress on Consume.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game can be found on my FurAffinity page; \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/genkokitsu/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGenkoKitsu on FurAffinity,\u003c/a\u003e on the \u003ca href=\"http://dancingfoxstudios.com/phpBB3/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDancingFoxStudios forums\u003c/a\u003e as well as here. And feel free to stop by the forums and say hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA note for those of you thinking about pledging. If you do, and then decide to deny the payment I have to ask, why? Nothing I\u0027m putting up here is behind a paywall, and even if it was I\u0027d be kicking you off for not paying anyway. So why do it? Just don\u0027t pledge if all you\u0027re going to do is deny it.\u003cbr\u003e"
