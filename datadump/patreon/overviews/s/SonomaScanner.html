    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome to \"Sonoma County Scanner Updates.\" We started on the premise of posting Scanner traffic so people would know what was going on around them, and then we would update it later on with an article or press release. We have more access to info and knowledge of public safety then the average joe, and use that to bring information to people. We had a small following until The night of October 8th, when devastating fires hit Sonoma County, and it turned out we were the only ones providing real time, up to date information. I had finally gone to bed at 7am Monday, and when I woke up at 2pm for work, Readership had tripled. Over the next month, our page went from 2,500 to 10,000, and now it is at 19,000. With it comes a lot of responsibility and our desire to assist our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFrom Admin 1, why I started this page: In 2010 I moved from Sacramento County to Lake County. In 2012, there was the Wye fire. I had 15 minutes to get all my stuff, and had no idea where to start. I grabbed my birth certificate, my purse, artwork, some photos, and my dogs.  I sat on the side of Highway 20 for 4 hours waiting for a CHP escort to an evac area. I had no idea where the evac center was because there was no cell phone service where I lived and the phone lines were down. I only knew we were being evacuated because of the huge plume of smoke and the fire marshall driving through with a loud speaker. I remember driving out of my neighborhood with burning trees around me. I had to wear those clothes for two days, but returned to a home 2 days later. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 I had a job as a non emergency dispatcher, for water companies, cal fire, etc, and I volunteered for a local news page as well taking photos and writing articles. The Rocky and Valley Fire hit in 2015. The apocalyptic smoke was terrible. The fire alarms kept coming into our dispatch office and that\u2019s how we knew where the fire was going, and going into neighborhoods. I dispatched graveyard and did day shifts at the shelter, using my press status to get into neighborhoods to feed animals, checking on people\u2019s homes, and evacuating those without vehicles. THEN the Clayton fire hit. Same thing, and once again I had to evacuate... but now I had a system down, and a checklist. During this time is when I decided that my calling was public safety and service and that is what I stuck with as I moved down here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I moved Sonoma County California, for more opportunities. In Lake County there are many community awareness and scanner related pages, and I wanted to bring that to Sonoma County, MINUS hearsay and gossip, because I could not find anything similar to it here, except pages for specific neighborhoods. I was going to be living here, and I wanted to to be safe for me, my future family, and help those around me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmin 3, is a military policeman in the national guard, born and raised three generations in Petaluma, and as responded to a few California disasters, giving him experience as well in these areas. He helps out on the page when he can, but mostly gives me info that is not restricted by OPSEC and I post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn July 2017, I asked admin 2, a retired SeaBee Navy vet to join our team. He is able to dedicate a lot of time to the scanner due to being retired. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2017, these terrible fires hit, but unfortunately for me, it was nothing new...  and I knew exactly what was happening and how to handle it and did what I know to do, help people. I gave all the advice I had, used all the resources of information I used in previous fires, and if I didn\u2019t know the answer, I found it. I never dreamed that my readership would go from 2500 to 10000 by the end of the month. And with it comes a responsibility to make sure everything is correct and reliable which we do our best job of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmin 2 has done a stellar job, Scanners are not easy to listen to and make awful noises. In the job I do now and jobs I have done, I have a radio or ear piece in over 8 hours a day, and the noise of a scanner doesn\u2019t fade me. Admin 2 had to get used to it and get used to it QUICK when he was jumped into this fire and I commend him. We all work as a team, and we so appreciate the support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of our jobs we have a lot of contacts in law enforcement to get information and guidance, and we have met with different departments to get their support for the page and make sure we are not posting anything that hinders their work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can be found on Twitter : \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SonomaScanner/status/953638122792796161You\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/SonomaScanner/status/95363812...\u003c/a\u003e can text tips and forward Nixles to : phone: 707-273-4288 \n-If you are a resident you can get nixle alerts in your very immediate area. We use Nixle to get base info and then expand and follow up. My favor I ask is that those who DO receive nixles forward them to the following number : 707-273-4288 , so we can better keep you all informed!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of late, we have had people wanting to make donations. We gladly accept energy drinks, Starbucks, and equipment (scanners, batteries for scanners). If you insist, we do have a PayPal account for donations, to use for gas to drive to the court house and cover cases, buy aforementioned energy drinks etc. Again we are volunteers and expect nothing but will gladly accept donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhere the charity comes in:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI was a foster child, as well as a domestic violence survivor, and have a spot spot for those causes. Once a week, we do what is called \"Pay it forward Sunday.\" We make a donation to a child who can\u0027t have the \u0027extras\u0027 or go shopping with an adult who just needs that extra boost. We get these items on our own, and have one donation so far of a kindle fire. Having contributions would help us greatly to do these acts of kindness. We have donated such items as a purse and wallet to a girl in high school trying to get a job to help at home, a tablet to a student who doesn\u0027t have a computer at home and needs to do homework, groceries for a single mom who was stressed out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe also have launched a project where we sew t-shirt on to stuffed animals and under the t-shirts we write the numbers to various hotlines, and give them out to at risk children. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAs of late, people have been wanting to donate, and we will not turn you down. Monetary donations would be used to get these kids the extras, to use for gas to drive to the court house and cover cases, batteries for our scanner, etc. Again we are volunteers who love our community and expect nothing but will gladly accept donations, to be more effective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this page: we want to focus on just presenting you with articles and pay it forward moments, no scanner traffic, and there are benefits. Here we can go live and chat with our patrons, let them get to know more about us, divulge our names, and respond to specific requests such as \" can you let me know when something is happening on my street specifically.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
