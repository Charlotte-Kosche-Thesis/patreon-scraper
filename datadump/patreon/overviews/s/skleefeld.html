There are old comics and art that I can\u0027t afford, and don\u0027t look to be reproduced in any way any time soon. I\u0027m not asking for people\u0027s help to cover my living expenses so I can focus on writing or anything so grandiose; I\u0027d just like some assistance in trying to do more research. To be able to find out more about the medium of comics, and be able to share my findings with you."
