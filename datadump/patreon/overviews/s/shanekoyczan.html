    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003efirst off thank you for even visiting this page. I understand that not everyone is in a position to financially support the artists they love... if that\u0027s the case, no sweat. I still really appreciate your support in every other way. Whether that\u0027s you spreading the word, sharing a link, or even just blasting poetry at a stop sign through your open car window (which is so literary gangster by the way)... it all helps and is very much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m guessing that a lot of you know me because of other work I\u0027ve done, To This Day, Troll, Heaven or Whatever, Shoulders, and the like. I get asked a lot to make more videos or record more pieces or re-record pieces to make them classroom friendly. Believe me when I tell you that there\u0027s almost nothing else I want to be doing, but you guessed it... it\u0027s costly. I work with a lot of amazing people and am always trying to expand my collaborative horizons, but we\u0027re all limited in how much of our time we can donate. As much as I\u0027d like to be paid for what I do I would also really like to pay the people who help me do it. Yes, I write the poems, but there\u0027s a lot of other magic that goes into the videos, music, and illustrations. When I say magic I mean really hard work done by monstrously talented individuals whom I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why should you pledge? So we can keep doing it. There\u0027s a ton of projects I\u0027d like to get off from the drafting board and into actual production, but i need your help to do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a short list of things I\u0027d like to do with your support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcast\u003cbr\u003eVideos\u003cbr\u003eAudio Recordings\u003cbr\u003eShort Films\u003cbr\u003eWeb Series\u003cbr\u003eGraphic Novel\u003cbr\u003eChildren\u0027s Book\u003cbr\u003eFeature Film\u003cbr\u003eDocumentary\u003cbr\u003eAnimations\u003cbr\u003eIllustrated Poems\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think the \"per thing\" method makes more sense than the monthly path. Some projects will just take longer than others so it will help keep the pressure off and insure the quality of each creation. Sometimes you can end up cutting corners if you\u0027re trying to reach a deadline... this just makes sure that I won\u0027t have to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you again for any and all of your support in its many forms. Now let\u0027s make art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours,\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shane\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
