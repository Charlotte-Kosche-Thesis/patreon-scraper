     "about": "Sean Buvala has been engaged with storytelling and communication since 1986. He started his work by accidentally using active storytelling to convert a classroom of slightly (but comically) homicidal 8th-grade teenagers from angry kids to storytelling practitioners themselves. From then on, both the kids and Sean were sold on the influence of a great story. An author, speaker, trainer and performance artist, Sean describes the collection of stories in his head as \"life and legend\" representing the mix of stories from his  experiences, myth and legend from many cultures, sacred stories and observations of shared life events. He lives in the desert southwest in the Phoenix, Arizona area with a number of young-adult roommates (his kids) and one wife.
