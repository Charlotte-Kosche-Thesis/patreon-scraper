    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ve seen what we can do with a small budget. Now imagine the impact we can have with more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Matt Weaver and I\u0027m the editor of \u003ca href=\"http://stscene.com/\"\u003eShort Track Scene\u003c/a\u003e! You might recognize me from Autoweek Magazine. That\u0027s my full-time job, making my short track work more of a side project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut make no mistake, this is something I take very seriously. I treat Short Track Scene with the same diligence as Autoweek. We currently have a staff made up of 10 volunteer journalists, photographers and web editors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to make sure my volunteers are rewarded for what they provide short track fans.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be totally honest: I have a pretty cool job. For the first time in my life, I finally have security and flexibility to professionally write about motorsports and I\u0027ve invested a lot of that money into Short Track Scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the next step is paying contributors and watching our website grow. I want Short Track Scene to cover more regions, disciplines and divisions. But I can\u0027t single-handedly do it. Readers tell me every week they wish I could cover the west coast, Midwest or USAC -- but that\u0027s expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is your chance to fund the kind of short track journalism you wish existed elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support will NOT go into my pocket.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will not take a salary from Short Track Scene. Instead, your contributions will go towards the writers and photographers that have already made this one of the most dynamic websites in motorsports. I want to make sure that Paul Lambert, Aaron Bearden, Seth Eggert and Christopher DeHarde at least break even during their coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther, if you guys are supporting Short Track Scene, I want you to be able to tell us where to go. There\u0027s so much going on in the short track world that it\u0027s a challenge to know what\u0027s most important to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in short, if you like our stories and want to tell us which races to cover, this is your chance to be directly involved with the expansion of short track racing\u0027s best independent journalism."
