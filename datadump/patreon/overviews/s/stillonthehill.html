We have 9 CD\u0027s to our credit and have been described as \"folk-grass\" which is a blend of \"folk\" and \"bluegrass,\" but labels don\u0027t accurately describe what we do.

Heck, former Mayor Coody proclaimed December 21st \"Still on the Hill day\" to honor the ongoing community outreach we do. As much as we love traveling, we long to spend more time locally with our family and friends.

Patreon allows you to support the \nartists you enjoy by pledging money \nfor each creation they make. There is no limit, high or low, to what you can pledge, the levels specified below are simply suggestions with fun incentives; it is like you\u0027re giving us a TIP every time we perform for you! We release on average about two videos per \nmonth, sometimes more, sometimes less. If \nyou\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, there\u0027s an easy way to \nset a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment \ninfo. Of course, becoming a patron is totally optional!\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e If you don\u0027t \nhave the money to do this, it\u0027s totally cool - we\u0027ll be doing what we do no matter what, your support just helps us make it even better! If you have any questions just ask!\u003cbr\u003e"
