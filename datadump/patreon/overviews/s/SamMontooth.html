    "summary": "Sam Montooth is a creative musician who is going to begin working on an all original recording project for 2018. Sam\u0027s been performing as a musician for over 20 years. He is a singer, a bassist, pianist, and composer. Sam has primarily worked as a jazz musician for most of his career, but has also spent lots of time playing island music and working in top 40 bands playing popular music. He is also a music educator and has taught many musicians of all ages who are taking their first steps toward expressing themselves musically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, Sam is focusing on creating new music and is hoping you will come along for the journey. The plan is a simple one. Record a new song for each month of 2018 and have a completed 12 track album released digitally in December of 2018 and a CD version in early 2019. If enough patrons sign on, the costs of recording, mixing, and paying side musicians will be covered for each month. If the amount coming in is consistent then he will schedule a standing date each month for recording the song of the month at a local studio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will have the ability to watch the exclusive live stream of the recording sessions as they happen, and they will see all the milestones of the song creation as they are written. All Patrons will get the mastered final track when it is completed each month. So, at the end of the year, you will have the completed album before it is officially released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSam is excited to take this creative journey with you. The Patreon platform allows excellent communication between the Patron and Sam. There will be a discussion page available to all Patrons to share their suggestions, comments, and ideas. At certain pledge levels, there will be opportunities to shape the creation of a song, or to commission a separate song just for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSam hopes you will go on this musical journey with him through 2018. Please consider supporting the creation of new music. The basic pledge level is $1 a month, and at the end of the year you will have helped create a new album with a cost to you of $12.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to pledge more, there are other levels of support you may choose with some select perks for higher levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSam thanks you for your time and hopes to see you inside as a Patron and looks forward to creating music for you!"
