I\u0027m hoping Patreon will encourage more art from me and help me manage some financial independence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can grab me on tumblr most easily, at sleepymccoy.tumblr.com if you want to chat, I\u0027m very keen to talk to anyone who wants to patreon me, you\u0027re beautiful!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting a teaser artwork every Saturday to let you know what\u0027s coming, I will post one paid artwork every Monday for you. I will post a personal blog entry every Wednesday or Thursday that will contain things you won\u0027t see on tumblr or insta or anywhere else. I will post a poll at the start of every month for you to vote on what you want me to draw through the month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will occasionally post free Patreon specific things if it occurs to me, but there will be no surprise paid posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is set up to charge per piece, I promise to keep it to one paid piece per week, I will not suddenly post ten and squeeze you dry. You can set a monthly cap, so if you can only afford $1 per month you can set it to that, I won\u0027t begrudge you that, but if you can afford more I would appreciate it. You will see everything no matter what you spend, I know what having no money is like and I don\u0027t want to punish anyone for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you get some joy out of this!! I\u0027m so thankful to everyone who\u0027s jumping onboard"
