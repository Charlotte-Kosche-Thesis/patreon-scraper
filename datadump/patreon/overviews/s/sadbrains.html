    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003eI am a game developer and illustrator living in Auckland NZ, originally from the UK. I currently work producing my own small games. I also do art conventions when able to, and used to paint quite a bit. Some of you may have heard of me, but if you haven\u0027t then that\u0027s okay too! Because getting paid to do what I love helps with that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCURRENTLY I AM CHOCK FULL OF (VOLUNTEER) WORK UNTIL DEC. I HAVE ALTERED TIERS TO REFLECT THIS FOR NOW.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA lot of the things I do are voluntary. I give talks around Auckland, I help with gamedev and tech events, and I help others network with other developers. All while making free games and art. While this is all fun and basically my dream, I want to expand what I do. I want to make bigger games. I want to set up workshops to teach those with no programming background how to make their own worlds. I want to tell other aspiring developers about what they\u0027re getting themselves into. To do this I need income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy don\u0027t I just work at a studio? I am very open about dealing with depression, like many creatives. I also undergo treatment for other disorders that make working in a less sympathetic larger workplace more difficult. This is \u003cstrong\u003eNOT\u003c/strong\u003e a request for pity, and I do not want \u0027victim\u0027 donations. This is simply the facts as to why I travel this route, and why I\u0027m happy to do so. Working on my own stuff gives me full creative freedom, and the odd day when I don\u0027t feel like getting out of bed? Well, I don\u0027t shout at myself. That\u0027s life. I move on without annoying a superior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to let people donate what they feel comfortable with works better with what I want to achieve, which is to be able to keep making games, artwork, paintings, and teach others how to do all those things, while keeping a roof over my head.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you hope to achieve at the end of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI would like to establish a decent fanbase who are interested in my work, and to teach people how to make games while providing them with the pieces to do so. It would also be nice to have enough financial support to paint again and take my artwork around NZ, something I just haven\u0027t had funds to do for a couple of years. Being able to do that means being able to create art books, prints, wallpapers, and custom pieces for people. Ideally I\u0027d also love to have enough spare change to set up more game jams and game teaching workshops in Auckland, since we have a small but steadily growing gamedev community. However, we don\u0027t have the luxury of having many hiring big studios, so encouraging people to create their own studios would be pretty awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
