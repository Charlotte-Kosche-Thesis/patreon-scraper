I\u0027m here to regale you with delightfully spooky fairy stories that are sure to make you shiver and maybe even twitch.

This work is unpredictable, comes and goes in spurts and isn\u0027t paid well. This makes it impossible for me to plan a regular upload schedule or to produce videos as often as I would like.

I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more of this precious resource to creating videos for you! That means more uploads and a regular uploading schedule. Reaching this level of funding will be a major achievement as well as a relief for me because I have been struggling for so long to sustain myself as a creator. This money will give me the ability to do just that and I could not ask for more. Sending love and luck to all those who help me get to this point.

I\u0027ll also put money into translating my videos into different languages and adding accurate English captions. At this level I\u0027ll also be producing videos more frequently; I\u0027ll expand the series I\u0027ve already started (like the Fairies in Focus series and the Scary Fairy Bestiary) and produce whole new video series for your enjoyment. Stay tuned to find out what those might be ;) I have lots of plans for this channel, though it will surely take some kind of magical fairy miracle to reach this level of funding. If, somehow, it should happen, the channel will be all the better for it and I hope you\u0027ll agree and enjoy all the videos that will come. Thank you so much!!\u00a0",
