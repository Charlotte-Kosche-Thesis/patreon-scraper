     "about": "I am originally from the small little town of Woodbury, Tennessee. \u00a0Multiple members of my family played guitar and created their originals (Granny Simmons, Uncle Glen, my Father) and my Grandpa Simmons played guitar and sang as well. \u00a0My Granny Bryson wrote poems all her life. \u00a0I mostly just wanted to join in when I was a child, to be a part of the family pastime. \u00a0I was the little artist. \u00a0The child drawing on the walls of the rent house in crayon, later drawing my own comic books by my early teens. \u00a0I wrote poetry as well and learned to play the guitar (as well as hacking my way through piano and saxophone in school for a bit). \u00a0Songs just started popping in my head in my late teen years. \u00a0Until the moment High School ended, Sports vanished (I wasn\u0027t that good, just competitive), and I promptly got my heart broke the first time; it had never dawned on me to put those songs to chords on the six-string and put pen to paper. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollege soured me on being an art major. \u00a0Graphic Design sounded like a nice degree for someone with visual arts skills. \u00a0But I now know why I didn\u0027t like it, I wanted to be an artist not work in \u0027commercial\u0027 art. \u00a0I started playing more and more guitar and writing songs and recording them alone in my bedroom. \u00a0I had a couple friends who encouraged me and I shared my songs with them only (Rod and Tammy, and Alison). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter College I tried really hard to make my round-self fit into a square peg. \u00a0I wrote more and more and started playing gigs around my college town and then venturing to Nashville to play open-mic nights. \u00a0Fast forward to the day I turned 30 and I quit my job for good and jumped full-time into a pursuit of a music career. \u00a0I\u0027m now into my 40\u0027s and I\u0027ve released ten studio albums, played over a 1,000 show and counting in over ten different countries, and had plenty of my share of indie record deals (both good and bad) and still I\u0027m kinda that same kid drawing on the walls, playing in the woods alone, daydreaming at school, staying up all night drawing, writing songs, recording, and searching. \u00a0Sometimes these days I get up early and make coffee and create instead, pretty much the only difference. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more about me as a professional singer/songwriter here: \u00a0www.StephenSimmonsMusic.com but on Patreon, I\u0027ll be sharing unreleased songs, alternate demos/versions of older songs as well, short stories, poems, art, videos and whatever else comes out of this platform. \u00a0Whatever comes In Spirit. \u00a0",
