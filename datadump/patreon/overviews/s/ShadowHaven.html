I do a lot of anime styled art with many different styles, as well as paintings and speedpaints to small tutorials. I\u0027ve been doing art for many years, since I was about 10 or so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I\u0027ve been doing freelance. Currently, I am putting myself through college to get better at what I do, learn more animating, and hopefully go into character design and illustration. What I do in most of my time is characters and illustration, and hopefully when I have the time, I would like to start up my own webcomic! I have a lot of ideas for it, but unfortunately I haven\u0027t the time or money as of recent to keep up with illustrating, commissions, youtube, and my comic. If you decide to be a patron, I\u0027ll be able to have more time to commit to my art, animation, and characters, and especially my audience: YOU. Once I start hitting goals, I intend to do more tutorial videos, more speedpaints, and even more in the future with your help!"
