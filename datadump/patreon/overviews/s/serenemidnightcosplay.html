We\u0027ve been together since 2011 which is also the same year we started cosplaying. Over the past few years we have done many characters and learned so much in the process.We are very versatile in our techniques which consists of styling wigs, sewing, armor building, prop and weapon building, makeup and special fx, etc. Although we don\u0027t have a lot of experience yet, we are trying to get better at all those. We are super excited to be competing at our first masquerade at Anime Boston 2018!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSerenity Lockhart:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey SweetHarts, I am so excited to join Patreon! I started my craft back in 2011 with my very first cosplay as Pit (Kid Icarus). Shortly after, I started to do drag for a charity organization I was a part of and although I did some female impersonating in an artistic way, something was missing and I wasn\u0027t truly happy. One night I came up with the idea of combining my talents as a female impersonator and cosplay and I found (in my opinion) crossplaying to be a heck of a lot more fun. I love to relive my childhood by cosplaying some of my favorite characters. I\u0027m usually known for doing very outlandish looks (Twinrova: The Legend of Zelda Series) and playing with genders (Jack Skellington: The Nightmare before Christmas). I get so passionate seeing some of my favorite characters come to life through sewing, build props, armors, etc. to the point were my inner child flails his arms in awe. The friends and fans I\u0027ve met along my journey has moved me and I don\u0027t plan to stop what I love doing. Your pledges (in any amount) \u00a0will truly help in our endeavors \"to become the very best\" *cues Pok\u00e9mon theme song* \u00a0I look forward making some awesome cosplays such as Angewoman (Digimon), Kaguya (Naruto), Mercy (Overwatch) and Fem Skull Kid (Zelda)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTito Midnight:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have been going to anime and comic conventions since 2006 but it wasn\u0027t until 2011 that I started cosplaying. My first cosplay was Dark Pit (Kid Icarus). I have been a huge fan of video games since I was very little and I started watching anime when I moved from Puerto Rico in 2000. Since 2011 I have focused most of my time and energy into making cosplay outfits for Serenity; however I\u0027ve been able to make a couple of cosplay outfits for myself such as Gaara (Naruto), Flareon (Pokemon) and Togepi (Pokemon). Bringing so many characters has been very tough but at the same time so rewarding. I\u0027ve learned so many new things such as to how to sew better. I look forward your support and being able to make more cosplay outfits for myself such as Ganon (The Legend of Zelza Series), Xibalba (Book of Life) and Iron Man.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u00a0signed up for Patreon as a way for our followers and us to mutually benefit from each other. We spend all of our free time making these costumes because it is what we love doing. Your support has pushed us to come as far as we have gotten. We appreciate all forms of support, following us on social media, chatting with us at a con, sharing a photo, writing us a letter/message, we are beyond appreciative no matter what shape the support comes in.\u00a0It is no secret though that cosplay can get expensive.Your support on here will allow us to create these costumes faster than ever before and produce new content each month. Since cosplay is a hobby, we prioritize our real life over it, never putting it before our full time jobs, rent, bills or feeding ourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will always have the same high standards for our craftsmanship, but the support from Patreon will allow us to continue making cosplays uninterrupted, get more equipment, a better work space and an overall improvement of quality in our content. It will also allow us to create more elaborate cosplays, have access to new materials and go to more conventions.It is our dream to do this for a living ! \u0026lt;3 \u00a0 We would love to convert some of our shows on the road to video versions for everyone to watch without being restricted by distance or age (most venues we perform at are 21+). \u00a0We will always give back to everyone that support us here.\u00a0\u00a0Even the lowest pledge grants you access to our Patreon exclusive news feed where you get sneak peeks of what we are up to that we don\u0027t post on our public pages. You\u0027ll also be the first to know our show dates and even have the ability to vote on our future outfits. Higher pledges get access to our tips and tricks as well as some of our Patreon exclusive tutorials for all our techniques including armor making, prop and weapon making, make up tutorials for some of our most exotic looks and so much more! Higher pledges also receive rewards in the mail each month!
