    "summary": "Hi!\u00a0Welcome to the \u003cstrong\u003eStation Blue Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eChad Ellis\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0Good to see you! Let me tell you about my podcast, my goals for the future and this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst of all, what is Station Blue?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eStation Blue is a fictional podcast about a 20 something burnout who takes a mysterious job working alone in Antarctica. It\u0027s an isolation horror that uses story telling, atmosphere and suspense to deliver the frights. Think of it like a mix of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe Thing\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and \u003cstrong\u003eFight Club.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI love what Podcasting does for horror. It\u0027s intimate, no theater full of people gasping, screaming, laughing, it\u0027s just you and your headphones, an experience free from outside judgement. And it\u0027s personal, I supply the voices and story but you decide what they look like, who they are. This makes for an immersive experience and a powerful connection with the characters. If I\u0027ve done my job right you\u0027ll be able to transport yourself from your daily activities straight to a lonely research station at the bottom of the world, just by pressing play!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals for the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eStation Blue is a Three Season show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst on the list is to finish Season One of Station Blue. That\u0027s 10 episodes, about 3 hours frigid Antarctic audio. Towards the end of that process I\u0027ll be writing and planning Season Two -if you think Season One is good wait until you hear what I can do with some actual experience under my belt. All the\u00a0while I\u0027ll be saving my pennies to upgrade my audio equipment and get some soundproofing (I write, record and edit the show in closets and bedrooms on one mic) I like investing in my own stuff, that way I\u0027m less susceptible to production hiccups when life swoops in to wreck everything. Plus it allows me to not only make my own shows faster, but also produce shows for exciting budding Audio Dramatists who\u0027s voices need to be heard!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m not going to tell you that I \"need your help to keep the lights on\", that \"podcasting is expensive and without you I can\u0027t keep making the show.\" Podcasting IS expensive, but I\u0027m thrifty, crafty\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eand passionate about this show. I can commit to picking up an extra shift a month to make sure that all canon episodes stay FREE for EVERYONE FOREVER.\u00a0I\u0027m going to find a way to make it with or without funds. I love writing it, I love sound design, I LOVE the community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to get you in on the process.\u003c/strong\u003e I want you to be behind the scenes with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you\u0027re going to get access to the Station Blue Discord server (it\u0027s a chatroom) I\u0027m going to answer your questions, show you what the process of making the show is like, share influential books and movies... it\u0027s going to be a conversation between you and me.\u003cbr\u003eThose who toss in a few dollars more are going to get \u003cstrong\u003etwo Patron exclusive shows a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBehind the Door\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0gives you an episode by episode creator commentary of Station Blue. Want to know the complaint EVERY voice actor had? Character backgrounds? What went wrong? This is your show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChasing Fear\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a freeform storytelling podcast where I tell you the true stories that inspired the fictional events of Station Blue. I spent six months hiking from Mexico to Canada. I\u0027ve slept on haunted grounds under the North Star. I used to be a Priest. I\u0027ve had a pretty crazy life and I\u0027m going to get real vulnerable and real silly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are other neat things you earn with your Patronage (check them out in the sidebar) And as we hit our goals the perks will expand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf Station Blue has ever made you feel something\u003c/strong\u003e, if it has entertained you, inspired you, connected with you, consider becoming a Patron. Join me in bringing this experience to the masses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s go make some art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Chad\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
