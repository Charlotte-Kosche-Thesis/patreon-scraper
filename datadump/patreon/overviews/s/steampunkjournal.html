    "summary": "Steampunk Journal is arguably the most popular online steampunk magazine in the world! This is all thanks to you - the readers and fans of the site - who come back and support us by sharing our work and getting involved. It couldn\u0027t be done without your help. I\u0027m Moriarty Viccar and I founded the Journal in 2013 to document my journey through steampunk.\u003cbr\u003eWhat began as a simple scrolling blog has become a large, gorgeous self hosted magazine.\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way I\u0027ve joined forces with Phoebe Darqueling. She also ran a blog called For Whom The Gear Turns. She began writing for the Journal in 2016 and we\u0027ve been co-Editors ever since.\u003cbr\u003eWe also get regular contributions from Bess Goden of Steampunk Parliament, Victoria Szulc and Eric Fisk from The Fedora Chronicles.\u003cbr\u003eOur house photographer is Sean Tice, who will supply photography for patrons and our house band is Victor \u0026amp; The Bully. The boys have agreed to supply music for Patreon subscribers as we add tiers. We\u0027ll also be interested in including other artists and distributing a portion of the income to them.\u003cbr\u003eFor now, we want to concentrate on beefing the site up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re looking to get a dedicated server to speed up the site and allow us to integrate a brand new theme. The latter is ready to go but the shared server we\u0027re currently on can\u0027t cope with the stress of the new theme or the volume of new work we\u0027ll add once it\u0027s up. A dedicated server will only be used by Steampunk Journal and associated websites so won\u0027t have hundreds or thousands of other sites fighting for server space.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re starting with a $1 pledge to get us going. This is ideal for fans of Steampunk Journal who, like us, simply want the site to be bigger, better and faster. The reward for this pledge is the support you give to us through your love of steampunk and the incredible communities we serve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt would be marvellous if you joined us on our journey through steampunk and let\u0027s see what it can really do.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My name is Moriarty Viccar and I\u0027m the Founder and Editor of Steampunk Journal. I started the Journal back in 2013 to document my journey through steampunk. The community I\u0027d recently discovered for myself. As I attended events, interviewed people, reviewed albums and posted news I began to increase the popularity of the magazine. It currently sits in the top three steampunk themed online publications in the world. Most of the time we\u0027re the top, but the internet is volatile so we share it with two other magazines.\u003cbr\u003eAs the site increases and we get more traffic, our original shared server is getting exhausted and we need to switch to a dedicated server. The cost of that is significant. Being a free to use publication, we don\u0027t make money from it, so we will struggle to find the additional funds.\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are at Patreon. We hope you love the Journal enough to see it continue and improve. We have so many new ideas on the horizon and we really need the site speed to increase to implement them. Here\u0027s one or two to give you an idea of what we\u0027d like to do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThemes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a brand new theme waiting to go, but the servers won\u0027t support the sheer volume of expansion that it will allow us to do.\u003cbr\u003eThe current theme was used when the site first went self hosted in 2015, so it\u0027s getting old and won\u0027t serve us for much longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDirectories\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re starting up a new Directory page for steampunk and alt themed businesses to advertise on the Journal. In order to make this safe to use, we need to lease Authorise.net which is surprisingly expensive. Patreon will help contribute to that lease payment.\u003cbr\u003eDirectories will then be free to use with optional paid upgrades. But we realise that steampunk creators are rarely swimming in cash, so the plan is to make it very cheap to use the upgraded service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDating site\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been planning for some time to create a dating site dedicated to members of subcultures. It would be a place that would be free to use with optional upgrades for luxury features. It would also be a safe haven with a zero tolerance approach to online harassment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just some of the new ideas we\u0027re toying with. We have much more on the horizon and by getting a faster server we\u0027ll be able to start implementing them.\u003cbr\u003e",
