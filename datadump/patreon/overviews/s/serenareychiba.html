    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there, everyone. I\u0027ve been writing pretty much whatever comes to mind since around 2001. The idea of making a story that will draw readers in and essentially create a movie within their minds that they can see with perfect clarity appeals to me deeply. I like to write with as much vivid detail as possible, enough that there\u0027s little confusion as to what\u0027s going on, unless that was the original intention. I want to write stories that people may be uncertain of at first, but can\u0027t help but continue to read as events take place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create universes that people wish they could take a step into, and I also want to expand on universes that already have caught people\u0027s eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to say it\u0027s obviously because I\u0027m awesome, but to\u00a0be perfectly honest, I love writing, no matter what it may be. However, because of procrastination (my own fault, usually), and real life issues, it\u0027s hard for me to sit down and just focus on what I enjoy most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think of this place as an opportunity to maintain a specific schedule, and if I\u0027m receiving any type of benefit as Patreon is known to give, then that means I must maintain a specific schedule that will assure my readers that all is well and in continuance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write fanfiction, and I do it not to receive compensation, but because I genuinely enjoy it. My works, every single one of them, will always be \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e. It will \u003cstrong\u003ealways\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0be free. What you are doing, should you so choose, is giving me donations - initiatives - to stay on track and keep everything smooth and ongoing. Every little bit helps, and with enough of that charity, real life things can take a hike and I can focus solely on the stories you guys love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier System\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are six different tier levels that a person can access, each with their different advantages. Of course, those who unlock level two and beyond can also claim the benefits of the previous levels as well. If there is anything of interest you would like that I add, just let me know, and I\u0027ll see what I can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePayment System\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany writers may employ a monthly payment system because they may write quickly and dish out a high number of chapters every month. I, however, prefer quality over quantity, and I believe my stories deserve more than just some quick scrawling and then a swift post to the internet. As such, I chose to do a chapter system, as that is far fairer to you patrons. I would rather you get your money\u0027s worth out of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether you came by because you have an interest in helping me out, or just because you wanted to poke your head and see what was up, I thank you for visiting my page! Thanks for taking the time to check me out!"
