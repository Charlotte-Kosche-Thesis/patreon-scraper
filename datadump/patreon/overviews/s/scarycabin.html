    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWhat is this thing?\u003c/h2\u003e\nScary Cabin is an A.I. storytelling project made by a 4-and-a-half person team of ambitious technologists and writers in Vancouver, Canada (one of whom won an Oscar for introducing new VFX technology for blowing up buildings.) We may be a small crew, but we have a big idea: \u003cstrong\u003eto create a brand new format of entertainment\u003c/strong\u003e! That\u2019s all...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nImagine a future where you can actually change the ending of that movie you mostly loved, but the last ten minutes truly sucked. No problem--with the assistance of our A.I.-screenwriter, \u201cMashi,\u201d you can try out new ideas and edit the story to be far less sucky. The best part is, you don\u2019t need any movie-making expertise at all. No cameras, no editing software, not even any writing experience. Simply tell Mashi what you want to have happen and it will try to produce something that works with your idea.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd what if lots of other people did the same? You\u2019d have potentially hundreds of versions--hundreds of \u003cem\u003enew\u003c/em\u003e stories--which could be enjoyed in new ways. Stories would be \u003cem\u003edynamic\u003c/em\u003e; different every time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSounds great. But how?\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe dream big, but we\u2019re just starting out. Our proof-of-concept project, Scary Cabin, is live now at \u003ca href=\"http://app.scarycabin.com/\"\u003eapp.scarycabin.com\u003c/a\u003e and you can participate for FREE! (No ads either!) The best way for you to understand what we\u2019re doing is to try it out. Go ahead. We\u2019ll wait...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nThe whole thing is an evolving experience. In its first phase, Mashi is hungry to learn from humans. It doesn\u2019t know much about storytelling right now, but the more stories you create together, the smarter it will get. Even if you don\u2019t end up supporting the project financially, you can still have a big impact by making a story or two to help Mashi learn.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce Mashi is sufficiently smart, then the interesting stuff really starts to happen. Stories become more nuanced, Mashi starts to sound more sophisticated and the possibilities for creation become endless. Imagine one day, strapping on a VR headset and saying, \u201c\u003cem\u003eOkay, Mashi, give me a bank heist scenario with four gang members, two tellers and a couple of customers. The first guy through the door is gonna say \u2018Everybody down!\u2019...\u003c/em\u003e\u201d and then working on the scene with Mashi as it unfolds around you. Holodeck, here we come! (Big, big dreams!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy do we need money?\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe have been building Scary Cabin on a shoestring for the last couple of years and although we have made amazing progress, there is some stuff we need in order to break through the limits of what we can afford to do right now. For example:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA collective goal of $1000 per month would allow us to continue developing this project. Simple as that. If our vision of future entertainment is one you would like to see come to pass, please consider helping us reach the modest goal of continued existence!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e$1500 per month would allow us to run dedicated story servers to make the experience better and faster, and handle more creators on the system at once.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnything beyond that means we can enormously improve the content with things like new characters and locations, audio content, voice control, voice recording, new story scenarios, even customizable content! The sky\u2019s the limit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso, we all have families who like food sometimes. :)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eI like your project, but I\u2019m not ready to become a patron. How else can I help?\u003c/h2\u003e\nFirstly, for absolutely \u003cem\u003enothing,\u003c/em\u003e you can play with Scary Cabin to your heart\u2019s content at \u003ca href=\"http://app.scarycabin.com/\"\u003eapp.scarycabin.com\u003c/a\u003e. This totally FREE, ad-free experience showcases the potential for A.I. to tell stories in collaboration with humans. And it \u003cem\u003eneeds\u003c/em\u003e your smarts to help it improve. So, bring a friend and come and tell Mashi some stories!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nFollow, share, or post about this page using the handy buttons above! One of our goals is to build a community, which, as well as giving us all warm and fuzzy feels, also helps us out when asking for funding from the big money guys. Once again, we can\u2019t continue to exist without you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInteresting idea, but what about the existential threat of malevolent A.I.?\u003c/h2\u003e\nYou\u2019ve been watching too much \u003cem\u003eTerminator\u003c/em\u003e. Perhaps the greatest part of getting involved with A.I. in its infancy is that you have a chance to influence its ethical development. Think about how you learned about good moral behavior--maybe you recall some stories or parables from your youth or saw a movie where someone made the hard choice because it was the right thing to do. There\u2019s a reason we have the saying \u201c...and the moral of the \u003cem\u003estory\u003c/em\u003e is\u2026\u201d: we often pass on our morality \u003cem\u003ethrough storytelling\u003c/em\u003e. Come contribute to humanity\u2019s future by demonstrating to the system what is decent (or indecent!) human behavior to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFREE!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFREE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFREE! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHead over to \u003ca href=\"http://app.scarycabin.com/\"\u003eapp.scarycabin.com\u003c/a\u003e and co-create stories with our A.I. screenwriter.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou get: to contribute to the future of A.I. and our warm thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAlso FREE!
