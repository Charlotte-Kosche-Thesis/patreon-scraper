I\u0027m mostly famous for my mods Brutal Doom, Brutal Hexen, ArmageDoom, my megawad Hell On Earth Starter Pack (also known as Extermination Day), and many loose maps and contributions for other projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SGtMarkIV/videos]You\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/SGtMarkIV/videos\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI have created this Patreon to maintain my youtube channel, where I showcase and document the mods I develop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge $2 or more a month you will get access to at least one backup of my mods a month even before I make videos and document them.\u003cbr\u003eI usually take several months before releasing open betas of my mods to avoid too many files floating around the internet and causing repeated bug reports and version confusion. Getting access to these backups will get you to play my mods earlier and get more in touch with the development process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Alternatively you can donate directly to my Paypal without having to pay Patreon\u0027s 7% transference fees, my account is marcos.mk3@hotmail.com and I will have a way track you and your donation amount, and get you the same files as the Patreon donors by the same periods paid in that month. (I will send you an e-mail when a new file is uploaded.)\u003cbr\u003e- If you don\u0027t visit your e-mail used for your Paypal account, PLEASE provide an e-mail on the donation description which I can use to contact you and send your rewards. Right after I acknowledge your donation, I will send you an e-mail telling you which days of the month I will be sending your rewards.\u003cbr\u003e- If you receive the \"Can\u0027t donate to recipient of this country\" message, use the \"Pay for Goods or Services\" option.**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and I hope you enjoy my videos and my mods."
