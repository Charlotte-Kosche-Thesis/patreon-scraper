In order to effectively produce and market the music that I make it takes money. I\u0027ll be spending the money on studio time, music videos, marketing and packaging. My life partner, Ben, is an incredible musician and producer as well. It\u0027s our dream to have our own studio to really be able to let the creative juices flow and bring it to you.

Some of what I experienced was positive and life-transformative, but a lot was not. Fear was at the root of almost all of the teachings and interactions. In 2003, I had an incredible breakthrough. I discovered God as unconditional love. I decided I would stop following any thought or belief system that stemmed from fear. This experience radically changed my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI now help others break free from fear-based conditioning and limiting belief patterns so they can step into their innate peace an power.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe we are unconditional love in the deepest part of us. Any fear, hate, anger, resentment or jealousy that shows up in our lives is just a part of us that has forgotten that we are Love.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a transformational teacher, spiritual mentor, divine channel, healer, singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.
