In addition to all the above rewards, I will take you to lunch during EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh (and pick up the check) in order to express my gratitude personally for your support of my work, and answer any questions you may have, technical or otherwise. I will also invite you to call me up to once a month for a 30-minute one-on-one consultation about anything aviation-related you\u0027d like to talk about. Finally, your name will appear in a special place of honor in my forthcoming second book \"Mike Busch on Engines.\"",
