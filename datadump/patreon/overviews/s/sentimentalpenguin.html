Themes in EYP will be: romance, comedy, fluff, male pregnancy (MPreg), and the unreasonable standards of male beauty in modern society. There will be multiple endings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy game was inspired by Coming Out On Top, Newlife by Splendid Ostrich, and Stardew Valley.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen finished, Exercise Your Paternity will have customized 3D models of the major characters. Animating these models are currently still out of my abilities, but who knows how good I\u0027ll be by the time we\u0027re done?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is currently in pre-Alpha. I\u0027m still fleshing out the characters and finalizing the mechanics of the gameplay, as well as working on the graphics for it. I\u0027ll be putting up a link later to the FREE, playable intro to the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to try it out, you can download it at the following links:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/file/g6gxmh71est6suj/Paternity_0.1-0.1-pc.zip\"\u003ePaternity v0.1 for PC\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/file/i42lh2s5uw42e7p/Paternity_0.1-0.1-mac.zip\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaternity v0.1 for Mac\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share my stories with the world, and Exercise Your Paternity is only the first of many, I hope. With your help, we can make that dream a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I started this project as a labor of love, I need to fuel my work with ramen noodles and liquor. Also, to get the best graphics, I need to upgrade my rig, which is running into issues when I\u0027m crafting the models for some of the characters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can commit to making monthly releases of the games I\u0027ll be making, with noticeable progress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you, as a patron, will have the ability to vote on the direction of the games I\u0027ll be making, as well as give direct feedback to me. There will be polls on the graphics, the storylines, the mechanics, and anything else that I can\u0027t make up my mind on. I value your opinion, so please, give them to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, all patrons will be thanked in the credits when I finally release my game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all patrons in the first tier, you\u0027ll be getting early access to the latest build of the game I\u0027m working on, currently Exercise Your Paternity. You\u0027ll be getting it at least one month ahead of the public release, and the version you\u0027ll be getting will also have certain cheats and tools enabled to make it easier to playtest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all patrons in the second tier, in addition to the first tier rewards, you\u0027ll be getting the ability to vote! There will be special polls accessible only to second tier and higher patrons that will let them vote on the future of Exercise Your Paternity, and hopefully you don\u0027t get drunk with power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all patrons in the third tier, you get all the benefits of first and second tier patrons, but your votes will count as triple in the polls!
