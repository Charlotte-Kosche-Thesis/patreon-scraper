It\u0027s about two forest spirits and their relationship with humanity over thousands of years. I am working with a good friend and writer Jeremy Gaulke to get the whole plot line worked out right now, and you will see Sa, Hiisi, and the other characters from the graphic novel in my sketches and in other places. If you are able to give me 1,000 a month of support then I can really crack down and get this big project rolling at a good rate, a full page a week at least. Each page takes me about 20 hours, so it requires more time in my life than I currently have because of other paying gigs. After reaching this goal I will pay a web designer to make a simple web page for Metsanhaltia also, and make it real official.",
