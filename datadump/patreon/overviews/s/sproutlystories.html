I\u0027m a beach-loving, avocado obsessed 25 year-old living in the beautiful beachside suburb of Bondi, Australia. I have a passion for food, nutrition and healthy living. I am a qualified high school teacher and am currently studying a bachelor of Nutritional and Dietetic Medicine. My aim is to combine my love for education and health. I created Sproutly as a place where I can share my passion and knowledge for health to help you make healthy changes in your life that leave you feeling your best.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tNo matter what point of your health journey you are at, I believe the biggest change we can all make is to include more plants in our diet.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou will probably notice that all of my recipes are plant-based, gluten-free and vegan. While I have so much respect for people who commit to a 100% vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, I\u0027m not a fan of using labels for my own dietary choices. For me, I find that labels box you in to a certain way of living and create guilt around occasionally making choices outside of these boundaries. I believe healthy eating is about listening to your body and making choices that make you feel alive. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor me this means a mostly plant-based and gluten-free diet, however also being flexible when necessary. Everyone is unique and has different requirements so you may find that you thrive off this lifestyle as well or that you prefer to use some of these recipes to supplement your current way of eating. Do whatever works best for you and remember that it\u0027s okay if you don\u0027t fit inside a particular box! Healthy eating is about taking the time to experiment with what works best for your body, what makes you feel the happiest and what is most sustainable in the long-term for you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope that my recipes can inspire you at whatever stage of your health journey you may be at.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5646985de4b0182dab6ba42e/t/59339bf720099e9f00a22ccf/1496554564997/?format=500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccess all my e-books as they come out.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the money will do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour Patronage will allow Sproutly to grow into something magnificent.
