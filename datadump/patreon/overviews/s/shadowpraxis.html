    "summary": "So this is a thing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is Rob. You might have seen me around. You more than likely have not. That\u0027s okay. We\u0027re working on that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing about video games since around 2007. Following the 2009 1UPocalypse that saw EGM shuttered and massive layoffs at Ziff Davis, I drew inspiration from the talented folks in the games press I admired and started a site of my own - Crush! Frag! Destroy! What started as a three person operation (myself writing, two folks doing site graphics and art) grew until a couple of years later I was managing a team of about 10 people. We did a podcast. We covered conventions live. It was a great time. Then, shortly after grand plans to expand coverage to other forms of geek-friendly media (tabletop games, comics, etc) went into effect, it all went to hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a pretty serious breakdown and for the next couple of years, my life continued to fall apart. A couple of failed starts aside, it took me until last year to begin getting everything back together. 2014 was transformative for me, physically, mentally, and creatively. I have a lot of projects currently in various stages of development and I\u0027m writing regularly for a couple of different outlets at the moment, but that doesn\u0027t really make enough to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so much stuff in the works. Board and card games, a YA novel series I\u0027m hammering ideas out for, comic scripts that just need artists, plans for podcasts. I\u0027m also taking my first, wobbly steps, like a newborn fawn, into the realm of indie video game development. Additionally, I want to start doing Let\u0027s Play videos on YouTube and regularly streaming interesting games on Twitch. There are a lot of potential irons in the fire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you know what would be cool? Being able to eat. And also maybe affording some of the materials and equipment I need to bring a lot of these neat ideas to fruition. Sadly, none of that comes for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you guys come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for whatever spare cash you can throw my way, I\u0027ll give you... stuff! At the moment, I\u0027m still working on reward tiers - \u00a0they might just be small \"thank you\" gestures to start off, but eventually I\u0027ll make space for bigger things as my projects start rolling out. Hopefully I\u0027ll be able to keep you guys entertained in the meantime. I\u0027ll also get to keep food in the kitchen, too. We both win.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by. I appreciate your time and patronage very much. I hope I get to show you guys some neat stuff very soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Icon/character art courtesy of Petra (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/petrianthe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@petrianthe\u003c/a\u003e) - Banner courtesy of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/artpunxstudio\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZ.
