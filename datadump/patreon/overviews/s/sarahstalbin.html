    "summary": "THANK YOU for being a patron of the arts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is awesome. It gives fans the opportunity to directly support their favorite artists. And when you support me by subscribing on a per-project basis (meaning you pledge a certain dollar amount per song, video, etc. that I create), \u003cstrong\u003eyou become part of my team\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e part of my creative process\u003c/strong\u003e. You\u0027re in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know me, I\u0027m Sarah. I live in Seattle, WA. First and foremost, I\u0027m an indie piano pop/rock musician and performer. However, I\u0027m also an artist in a more general sense:\u00a0I make music, music videos, music biz tutorials, drawings, paintings, poems, short stories, blogs, vlogs, and podcasts. When you become a patron, you help me do things like release records and tour. Your support might even mean I can play a show in your town!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you\u0027ll get to download my latest EP, \u003cem\u003eSmall Voice\u003c/em\u003e, and everything I release in the future. We\u0027ll hang out in a patron-only online community. You\u0027ll get voting privileges: at least once per month, I\u0027ll send you at least one piece of art (a demo of a song, a digital prototype for a new piece of merch, a video, album art, etc.) that\u0027s being considered for public consumption. You get to tell me \"yes\" or \"no\" -- yes, you dig it and think others will too, or no, you aren\u0027t feeling it. Basically, you guys tell me what you like best and I\u0027ll release it into the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for believing in me and for valuing what I do. Being a full-time independent musician has its ups and downs, but my favorite part of the job is connecting with people through my work. Thank you for letting me connect with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exo Sarah\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_______________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***FAQs***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: If you have questions for me, you can get ahold of me or my team by submitting them on Facebook, Twitter, emailing sarah@desibelleentertainment.com, or on our patron-only community. Patreon also has a Help Center if you have a question relating to the platform!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What constitutes a \"creation\"?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Projects or creations include songs (demos or commercial releases), music videos, music business tutorials, and live webcasts/concerts. I\u0027ll also occasionally create artwork, in-depth blogs, short stories, and poetry that only you guys have access to. My creations will become more technologically advanced as our community grows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What is the difference between a \"creation\" (or \"project\") and a \"reward\"?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: A creation or project is something I\u0027ve created (see the last question) that you\u0027ll be charged for, unless you\u0027ve met your monthly cap. A reward is an \u003cem\u003eadditional \u003c/em\u003eperk you\u0027ll receive based on how much you\u0027ve pledged per project. For a full list of rewards, check out the righthand column of this page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Why are pledges \"per project\" instead of \"per month\"?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: If I\u0027m super busy (like on tour or in the middle of a release campaign), I might not have time to create something for you during a particular month. I don\u0027t think you should be charged if I haven\u0027t created something!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What if I\u0027ve pledged $10 per project but can only afford to pledge $20 per month and you create 5 things that month? Can I set a cap on how many times per month I\u0027m charged?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yep, and I strongly suggest doing so! For step-by-step instructions, go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002984506-How-do-I-set-a-monthly-max-to-my-pledge-\"\u003ehttps://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1150...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Can I just donate money to you once and not do a recurring per-project pledge?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Sure thing! Go here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/donate?donatePageId=59f8e6cc27ef2d8d39dcf847\"\u003ehttps://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/donate?do...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Can I choose to NOT receive rewards but still make a per-project pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: You sure can. Select \"Your Pledges\" from the dropdown menu and then click \"edit\" on the righthand side. You can select the reward tier you want (at the dollar amount you\u0027re pledging or any lower tier) or choose none at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: If I hit my monthly cap, do I still get access to rewards in my reward tier if you keep creating stuff?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yep! I don\u0027t penalize people for setting caps. In fact, PLEASE set a cap. I don\u0027t want you to be unpleasantly surprised if I go crazy creating stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
