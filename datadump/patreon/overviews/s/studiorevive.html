We are a brand new team, working to create Machinima. Virtual Cinema, where we use videogame rendering engines as a tool to create episodic shows. We love videogames, but more than that, we love good stories, and that\u2019s what we are trying to do. Take worlds and expand them with new and exciting adventures filled with unique characters. This all is definitely a labor of love, and we\u2019d like your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are coming with all kinds of stories that you can directly be a part of funding and making a reality. Many of our levels include rewards that can list you as contributor right in the intro or credits, and that\u2019s no little thing. We want people to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless if you pledge or not, every episode we release will always be free. Pledging to us will always be your choice. We\u2019d love anything you give, but we will love you just for viewing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to Patreon and want to know more about it, check out this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3VF1oeL66o\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe debated a bit about whether or not to make pledges monthly or per episode, and decided a per episode/video would work best for us and for you. You get what you pay for that way. We are a small team, and would like to get to a place where we release videos more frequently, but never at your expense. This also incentivize us to put out more content, more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince these projects aren\u0027t a one-time event, and we are always coming up with ideas and creating something new, Patreon was the best thing for us. It\u2019s a way for you to continually contribute and see direct results from your pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest reasons we ask for help is because there are many expenses that go into creating our videos. From time to time we have to purchase videogames, DLC, and/or expansions, but a majority of the funds in the beginning will go to subscriptions that sometimes go along with the game. Eventually, we\u2019d like to look into new equipment to boost the quality of our productions. The more we raise, the faster and more frequent we can release content, and with better quality as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we have \u2018normal\u2019 jobs that take a majority of the day, but we hope to change that. This is a passion, and we plan to see our current series to the end, but want to do so much more.
