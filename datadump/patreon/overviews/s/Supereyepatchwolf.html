First off, if you\u0027re here then chances are you watch my videos, and I just want to say I\u0027m insanely appreciative of that alone, but if you do feel like you\u0027d like to contribute to the channel further, then this is the place to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is John Walsh and I run the channel Super Eyepatch Wolf on You tube, I make in depth recommendation videos on anime, games, films and comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you\u0027ll be directly supporting the creation of all future videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the Money be used for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe most important thing this money buys me is time. Making videos like I do takes a great degree of research, writing and editing, generally I\u0027ll spend well over a full working week on a single video, and so the Patreon money will give the time and space I need to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would also allow me to invest in better audio and editing equipment, which will save time and increase the quality of the videos themselves, as well as allowing me to occasionally pay illustrators animators and editors to do some work for the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have any other forms of income?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes - I do make some money through You Tube Ad Sense, however between false copy right claims and You Tube\u0027s fluctuating algorithms, it\u0027s by no means stable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Many Videos will you put out a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be aiming to produce three videos each month. I want to aim for three rather than four due to the average length of my videos, currently clocking in at around 15 to 20 minutes per video, meaning you\u0027ll be getting at least 40 minutes to an hour\u0027s worth of content every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill all your videos be on Anime?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot Necessarily, I\u0027m interested in all forms of media, and so am interested making videos about games, movies, comics, everything, but right now at least the channel is heavily anime focused, with occasional one offs on other topics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImportant Notice to Patrons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy donation type is by video and not by month, which means that if you donate 1 dollar per video, and if I release 3 videos, you\u0027ll be donating 3 dollars that month. If you\u0027d like to limit the money you contribute each month you can do so when making your donation. Also, I may occasionally put out short update/vlog style videos, and\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0you will not be charged\u003c/strong\u003e for these, you will only be charged for my regular video essay style uploads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, in my video \"What Makes a fight Scene interesting?\" I listed a patreon video raffle as one of the rewards,but unfortunately, I was informed that Patreon terms of service don\u0027t allow for raffles as it gets them into some murky waters with gambling laws, and so instead we\u0027re going to be holding the raffle over on the Super Eye Patch wolf discord.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eREWARDS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon exclusives video Polls\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also occasionally be\nputting a vote out to what the next video I should work on will be, and I\u0027ll be\nholding an exclusive Patreon for Patreon backers where you can vote on what you\u0027d like to see me work on next!
