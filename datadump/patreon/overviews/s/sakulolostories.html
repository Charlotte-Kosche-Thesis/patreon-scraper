    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIt may be fact, it may be fiction but what is undeniable today as much as it was since time immemorial is that humanity lives based off the stories it holds true. Colonization of the past and neo-colonialism of the present has corrupted (or done away with entirely) many crucial stories to our cultures and civilizations today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany have heard the quote, \"well-behaved women seldom make history,\" but many have also mistook Laurel Ulrich Thatcher\u0027s emphasis.\u00a0 What she meant was that the narratives of our history which are passed down by generations are stories of heroics with value placed on conquering and developing instead of care taking and other domestic affairs. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alexandra Scrivner from California, U.S\u00a0 and I\u0027ve been trying to weave myself into \"our\" story for a long time but so much of what I\u0027ve been taught about the world disconnects me from it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hold a B.A in Journalism and Global Studies and will soon commence a Master\u0027s thesis in Peace and Conflict Studies in New Zealand beginning February 2018.\u00a0 After living and studying in downtown Los Angeles I wanted to join the movement of \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003etransitional justice\u003c/span\u003e and I believe that the re-telling and resurrection of women and \"domestic\" narratives can re-connect us to place and our environment, educate culturally inclusive moral values and give just perceptions of gender and racial equality to our fragmented and rapidly developing world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;\u0026gt;Definition:Transitional Justice\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTransitional justice is an approach to systematic or massive violations of human rights that both provides redress to victims and creates or enhances opportunities for the transformation of the political systems, conflicts, and other conditions that may have been at the root of the abuses.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s pillars and core actions include:\u003cbr\u003e- truth commissions and memorialization efforts\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Reparation Programs\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- security system reforms\u003cbr\u003e- Access to justice and criminal prosecutions (www.un.org)\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking in Timor-Leste with two transitional justice organizations from 2016-2017 (\u003ca href=\"http://asia-ajar.org/\"\u003eAJAR\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://chegabaita.org/\"\u003eACBIT\u003c/a\u003e), primarily with women survivors of the Indonesian occupation period, showed me how much collective suffering can be relieved through recognition.\u00a0 Through living in Timor-Leste, learning the language and forming deep friendships with men and women of varied lives and ages I learned real change takes time and belief is still more powerful than gold.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy project and my wok:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eis threefold...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Continuing to support ACBIT through the translation of women\u0027s narratives from Tetum into English so that their stories can be acknowledged internationally. Editing these stories in easily accessible books and online audio and visual platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Developing my thesis which will use indigenous methodologies in order for my research with a community in Timor-Leste collaborative and tangible. I will aim to re-define within this community approaches to cultural and ecological preservation and historical education for future generations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Working with communities in New Zealand for creative actions which preserve indigenous livelihoods and peace principles; this is achieved though working with significant Maori symbolisms and making more community initiatives for listening to elder perspectives on how the country can best develop towards the future as well as individual and community level healing strategies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** Note\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0 Your kind donations/monthly support will go to the incredible TIME it takes to do this \u00a0\u00a0 work as well as future travel expenses within my area and to and within Timor-Leste.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
