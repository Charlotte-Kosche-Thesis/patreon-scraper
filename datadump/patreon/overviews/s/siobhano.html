    "summary": "Issa Lopez, a director, contemporary dancer, and educator (Philippines), and Siobhan O\u0027Loughlin, a writer, performance artist and activist (USA) are creating a new cross-continental performance for six weeks in Manila. \u003cstrong\u003eWe are currently only asking for a SIX WEEK COMMITMENT. If you wish to stay on, you can! But as Siobhan is only in this part of the world for a limited time, we\u0027re asking that you simply commit for six episodes of our work. Then we\u0027ll let you know so that you can unsubscribe.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur work is called \u003cem\u003eColonize(d)\u003c/em\u003e, which\u00a0seeks to explore how personal experiences of two people with extremely different backgrounds intersect and how the context of their countries\u2019 histories impact their personal relationship. We\u00a0will use these stories and journeys to explore the joys and the challenges of intersectionality in a world that suffers from oppression and injustice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe collaboration will result in a two person theatrical experience, devised and performed by Siobhan and Issa, with its international premiere taking place in Manila in the Fall of 2016.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a person who is passionate about intersectionality, who loves performance for social change, who is inspired by collaborations between women of different backgrounds and experiences, your support is the kind we are looking for. We seek the support of world citizens who work towards social and racial justice in their own communities, as well as Americans and Filipinos who believe that progress is fueled by compassion, creativity, and empathy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have blessedly received a grant from the Network of Ensemble Theatres in the United States, which we hope to match with your help to cover the following costs:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Dramaturgy: Sipat Lawin, a Quezon City-based Filipino performance ensemble, is generously providing direction and outside eye dramaturgical insight. We wish to pay them for their efforts, especially as they will continue to produce the international festival Karnabal, which is where Siobhan and Issa met. \u003cbr\u003e2. Stage hands, videographers, and technicians: We will be working with community members to mount our performance here in the Philippines, and we want to pay them as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. Sustenance: Our grant provided Siobhan with a means to travel to Manila, but we didn\u0027t get so far as paid food. A plant powered diet is indeed a frugal one, but our process is rigorous, and we are working full time on this piece for six weeks. You will literally be feeding Issa and Siobhan while they rehearse during typhoon season.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4. Performance space and technical equipment: We hope to make our performances as accessible as possible to the people of Manila. If we earn enough money through YOU, we can offer at least one performance completely free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you very deeply for your involvement in our work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMaraming salamat sa inyong paniniwala at suporta sa aming pagtutuklas at paggawa.\u003cbr\u003e"
