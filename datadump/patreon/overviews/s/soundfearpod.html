    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eA HUGE THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS PLEDGED SO FAR!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027You know, it\u0027s Halloween. I guess everyone\u0027s entitled to one good scare, huh?\u0027\u003c/em\u003e - Halloween (1978)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverybody loves scary movies, and one of the most important elements of a good horror movie is the music. But where does the music come from and why is it so effective? Well, allow us to dive into that with THE SOUND OF FEAR, a series of podcasts that looks at the scores behind the scares, from Alien to Zombie Flesh Eaters. The first episode is already completed and is below for your listening pleasure and as a proof of concept - what we\u0027re asking for is a few bucks here and there to be able to turn this into an ongoing series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the initial run of THE SOUND OF FEAR is set into six episodes, which will look across some broader areas of the horror genre including the Universal monsters, slasher films, science fiction in horror, and more. If this series is successfully completed then we can look to concentrate on some of the music we\u0027ve had to skip over, including specific episodes on composers and franchises, as well as producing some bonus material such as interviews with composers and directors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what we\u0027re asking is for money to go towards the running costs of the podcasts. This includes hosting, equipment such as microphone accessories and help with making it sound as great as it possibly can be, obtaining research materials such as movies and music - the latter is obviously the most important of the two, especially as it dictates what can be played on the actual podcast - and then there\u0027s the labour and the time it takes to make the podcasts. At the moment, every podcast is exclusively created by myself, with consultation from friends and colleagues, so it may be that in the future I may be able to hire others to work with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, enjoy the show we\u0027ve put together, and please consider donating if you can - and we\u0027ll hopefully see you for the next episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/308575796\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\u0026amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
