    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my friends know me as the nerd. The geek who knows all sorts of things technology. In my life\u0027s journey I\u0027ve come to accept this, and well, I\u0027m here to share it all with everyone I meet. I\u0027ve been interested in science and science fiction for as long as I can remember, and I\u0027m taking on this video series as a way to share what I love with the world. I am endlessly fascinated by the amazing things that are happening in the world, or things that are being created every day. I feel like sharing all of these fantastic things with people, because I believe it can help make life easier, more fun, and enjoyable\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving worked in the technology field for many years, including my education in electronics, I feel that I\u0027ve got a nice insight into the world of gadgets. I hope to share this vision with you! I am a gamer, and my preferred platform is still the PC. I feel that personal computers afford a greater sense of precision that I haven\u0027t found with other systems, so I\u0027ve stuck with what I am most comfortable. I\u0027ll be sure to include games I\u0027ve played in the past, as well as the present \"addictions.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also look forward to my coverage of some local conventions I only recently began attending. I started three years ago at Starfest here in Denver, Colorado. I\u0027ve since been to a few more small conventions, as well as the newly minted Denver Comic Con, which is now in it\u0027s third year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully you watched the introduction video to my page here and understand what Patreon is all about. If not, here\u0027s the quick, quick version: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to make some sci-fi, science/tech, and gamer/gadget videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis takes time, effort, and resources. Think cameras, software, lights, beer, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon is like crowdfunding (lots of people making itty bitty contributions) and you become a Patron of mine.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m actually creating free content - think of it as \"tipping\" or \"donating to the arts\".\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e I produce good content for your viewing pleasure!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThink of me as the small business/mom \u0026amp; pop kind of operation - I could use the local (and beyond) support to pursue this endeavor. Remember too, you can set limits to how much you donate, so you don\u0027t go over budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to producing some great shows for you. I also plan on having special guests, whether they be my own friends, or people I meet at Starfest and Denver Comic Con. I hope to have all of that fun content available for you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003eBradley Greager"
