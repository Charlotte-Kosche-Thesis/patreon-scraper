I\u0027m Eric Patton, the lead developer and Co-CEO of Stasis Soft. My brother and I, along with our friend, started Stasis Soft back in 2012 to develop games. Not just any games, \n\u003cem\u003egood games\u003c/em\u003e. We toyed around with several ideas over the years, and we decided to start working on Aegis as our launch title.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve spent years writing out the story \u0026amp; lore, working out the gameplay, and deciding on art and music styles. In total, we\u0027ve put together roughly 815 pages worth of data (single spaced 12 point) in our online game design documents. We\u0027ve got details for every single animation, item, and skill so that anyone who works on the game with us will be able to use it as a reference to do their part. Can you tell that we\u0027re passionate about what we do?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo why do we need your help? Well, even though we\u0027ve got everything planned out, we only have programmers and sound designers between me, my brother Alex, and our friend Peter. We don\u0027t have an artist who can animate our main character, enemies, and bosses in the core team, so we\u0027ve had to contract out and hire an artist. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI saved up enough money since 2012 to fund our development for one full year, and I quit my job in February of 2016 to start. One year later, and we\u0027re over halfway through with the game\u0027s development! The price of art has definitely been our biggest cost, but we got amazing quality from the cost.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we\u0027re going to continue development of Aegis and finish it, we\u0027re going to need funding. \n\u003cstrong\u003ePledging here will help offset the costs of art and will ensure that I can devote all of my attention and time to the development of Aegis.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Is Aegis?\u003c/h4\u003e\nAegis: Innocence is a 2D Platformer Action RPG with a heavy focus on challenging gameplay, rich combat, and exploration.
