    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cI don\u2019t think people in Massachusetts realize it, but there were Olympians competing for Braintree High School.\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose words have rung around in my head for over three years. In the summer of 2014, I was interviewing Tim Daggett, Olympic gold medalist, NBC commentator and Western Massachusetts native, about his son Peter, who was about to compete at the P\u0026amp;G Gymnastics Championships for the first time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this interview, Daggett opened up about the state of men\u2019s gymnastics. After I shared that I had covered the MIAA boys gymnastics championships for a few years, Daggett started on a history lesson about high school gymnastics, which included the above line. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt might be hard to believe, but the sport that in 2017 only had five teams in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was once enough of a powerhouse to put two athletes on Olympic medal stands in the 1970s and 80s. Boys high school gymnastics nearly was discontinued by the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletics Association (MIAA) in 2012, but was given a reprieve due to its rich history. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u2019t just a problem for Massachusetts. Boys (and girls) high school gymnastics is disappearing across the country. In 2014, USA Gymnastics formed a partnership with the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) to try to keep boys high school gymnastics viable. However, with the current issues surrounding USA Gymnastics, this topic (understandably) is not a priority. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDecades ago, American gymnastics was built on the sport being taught and practiced at the high school and YMCA level. Currently, however, the sport is only practiced at private clubs. We may not be able to change this progression, but we can move to document the history of American gymnastics, particularly on the high school level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to write an ebook on the history of boys high school gymnastics in the United States. I would also love to eventually do so for girls high school gymnastics, and it\u0027s possible that this book eventually encompasses both (depending on how the research progresses.) Your support of my Patreon will allow me to get interviews transcribed, travel to interviews and fund my research. I would like to finish the book by December 2018. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do not wish to give financially now, that\u2019s fine: you can help in another way. If you were a high school gymnastics participant with a unique story and wouldn\u2019t mind being interviewed in person or on the phone, please contact me at \u003ca href=\"mailto:katcornetta@gmail.com\"\u003ekatcornetta@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e. Also, I am eager to find men\u2019s gymnasts associated with the Southern Connecticut State program for this project, so if you are one or know of one, and wouldn\u2019t mind being interviewed, please contact me! \u003cbr\u003e"
