Creative writing has been a part of me since I was in preschool making up a short story about a frog. The madness of the creative process and the parental love of a written creation is my black coffee. I\u0027m at my happiest when I think about the different worlds and the people who live there; and the many stories that I can create if I just look deeper. I want to share these stories and give the readers an experience that they\u0027ll keep wanting to return to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I joined Patreon was to prove to myself that creative writing as a career choice is open to me. That what I write is worth reading and people will enjoy reading what I\u0027ve written. I hope that I\u0027ll be able to support myself with my writing, and I wish to create pieces of fiction that\u0027ll reach a number of readers. That\u0027s why even if it\u0027s $1 or more, I\u0027m just happy that the people reading my work like it and want me to continue writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s My:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/svnight\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://serenityvnightinga.wixsite.com/svnight\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SerenityVee\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/serenityv_nightingale/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
