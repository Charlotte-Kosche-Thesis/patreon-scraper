    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! Thank you so much for coming by!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Shannon, but I\u0027m better known online as Silvousplaits (pun intended). I create artistic and unique hairstyles, many of which are from popular TV and movies such as Game of Thrones, Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings, Vikings, etc. I then create instructional materials like tutorials and pictorials so you can learn to do these hairstyles on yourself, which I post on my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/silvousplaits\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://silvousplaits.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"hoverZoomLink\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://silvousplaits.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3168-683x1024.jpg\" width=\"200\"\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"300\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/silvousplaits.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_4355.jpg\" width=\"200\"\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"hoverZoomLink\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/silvousplaits.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4115.jpg\" width=\"200\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to translate your favorite on-screen styles into approachable tutorials you can do on yourself, with normal tools you might have at home. Through this, I hope people are able to achieve a fun, creative mode of self-expression. \u00a0I try my absolute hardest to not only make sure my hairstyling is refined and unique, but that I can teach you most effectively how to get the look as well. I\u0027ve worked for several years on these endeavors, completely as a side hobby, and with every video I spend hours upon hours planning, styling, filming, and editing. I love doing this! I love styling hair, and I especially love knowing I can help others find the same joy. I hope to continue developing my styling/teaching skills and expand into new creative directions so I can better help you get the hair you want.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, as I mentioned, this isn\u0027t my full time job. I\u0027m actually a PhD student, studying social neuroscience at the University of California - Los Angeles. That takes up a lot of my time and pays very little, so it\u0027s hard to afford the expenses that come with running a successful Youtube channel (nice camera, lenses, studio lights, styling materials, taxes...)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s where you can come in! I will always offer my videos for free - that will never change. But if you become a Patron by creating an account and donating on this page, you can help me continue making hairstyling resources for you, and improve their quality.\u00a0You also get cool stuff for being a Patron!\u00a0You can pledge anywhere from $1 up, per tutorial video (other currencies will be converted to the equivalent USD value). I post a new hairstyle video roughly twice per month, so that means your donation will automatically be delivered twice per month (you can quit your donation at any time). And on the off chance that I post more than normal, or you don\u0027t want to donate twice a month, you can set a monthly cap for your account so you never go above budget. Each donation tier has certain perks that come with it, so check out the side bar to see what those are and to decide what tier you want to donate in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, you\u0027ll help me continue what I\u0027m doing now, get BETTER at what I\u0027m doing, and you\u0027ll even get some cool stuff in return!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for coming by and donating. It means so much to me that you value what I do and are willing to help me do it.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll the best,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShannon (Silvousplaits) \u0026lt;3\n\u003cbr\u003e"

If you help me reach $30 pledged per video, to celebrate this first milestone on Patreon I\u0027ll host a giveaway contest on Youtube. There\u0027ll be lots of cool hair and tv/movie stuff to win (I\u0027ve got a sick Etsy wishlist going) and you can help me choose the theme or objective of the contest on my Patreon blog.",

     "description": "Right now I have a DLSR and a tripod, but quality Youtube videos these days often require good lighting, different perspectives, and crisp imagery. With $60 pledged per video, I could afford a reflector, stand and boom, remote shutter, extra camera batteries, and even a better lens in order to make my videos look top notch. In return for reaching this milestone, I can offer each $3 and up patron a customized pictorial for a style of your choice, photographed with the new equipment :) And if you\u0027re in the $10 or above bracket, that pictorial will turn into a video just for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
