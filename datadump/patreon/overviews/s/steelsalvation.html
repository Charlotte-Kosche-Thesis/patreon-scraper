    "summary": "Hey everybody! This is J.S. Conner, and I\u0027m the author of Steel Salvation, a sci-fi webcomic about a tiny killer robot stranded on a dead world in the wake of the Robot Revolution. This project began as a collaboration between myself and two of my best friends - together, we created Steel Salvation Part I: Prisoner of the Dust. Our story was pretty rough around the edges, so in order to step up our game, we hired artists to work with us on Steel Salvation Part II: Shadows in the Ash. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis brings us to our dilemma. See, we loved the work these artists put out, but over time, my collaborators had less and less to do with the comic. Now that Part II is finished, we\u0027ve decided to go our separate ways, but as the writer of this comic, I have no intention of quitting. Our most recent (fantastic) artist, Kenan Halilovi\u0107, is interested in continuing the project, but I can\u0027t afford the cost of a professional artist alone - at least not at the rate we were making strips before. I\u0027m getting married in less than three months, and adult life bills are piling up. This is the part where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can get a steady donation of $10 per month, then I can afford to make one strip per month. The good news is, we\u2019re already there! And if I can get $50 per month, I can bump up production to two strips per month. Once I have 25-30 strips completed, I will begin posting Part III at a rate of two strips per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hate withholding\u00a0content behind a pay wall, but it\u0027s the only way I can afford to keep this comic alive while meeting the quality standards we set in Part II. And, if you\u0027re all caught up on the comic, then you know by now that everything is about to change. As an added incentive and proof of concept for Part III, I\u0027ll be posting some new character designs for $1 patrons while I prepare to start production again. And once we start making new strips, I\u0027ll be posting previews as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading and supporting this comic so far! I promise to return as soon as I can with Steel Salvation Part III: War in the Depths."
