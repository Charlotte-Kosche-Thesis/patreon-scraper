    "summary": "It\u0027s an ancient dilemma, a question all nerds have asked since time immemorial: \u003cem\u003eWho would win in a fight?\u003c/em\u003e Who would win in a wizarding battle between Gandalf and Dumbledore? Could the Power Rangers take down Godzilla? Is Batman\u0027s endless supply of contingency plans a match for Doctor Doom\u0027s deadly combination of science and sorcery? Alas, these questions could never truly be answered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Smash Fiction Podcast settles, once and for all, the deepest mysteries of popular culture. Each week, five of the most passionate nerds in the multiverse gather to systematically debate a match between fictional characters who are carefully chosen and set in a scenario that tests their respective strengths and weaknesses. Matches can be direct fights, competitions, or a race to complete a specific goal. Sometimes a match pits a character against a hostile location, or tests a non-combat skill, relationship strength, or SCIENCE! And then there are the truly absurd three- or four-character free-for-all matches. From archery tournaments to hacker battles, from the Scare Games to the Hunger Games, absolutely anything can happen on Smash Fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach side has one or two advocates arguing for them, while an impartial judge moderates. But it\u0027s not all research and preparation, because eventually the judge announces\u003cem\u003e Th\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ee\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eLightning Round\u003c/em\u003e, in which the advocates are presented with a surprise scenario! Maybe the advocates suddenly have to argue why their characters would still succeed while drunk, or at Disneyland, or at running for president. The insanity continues until it\u0027s time for the judge to render a final, binding, and irrefutable verdict!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u2019s not all! Once a month, Smash Fiction breaks from its usual format to present the massively popular actual-play RPG, Extraordinary League! Dan Mulkerin GMs an epic crossover-laden story while the other hosts play an eclectic cast of characters, including Sterling Archer, Stitch, Luna Lovegood, Mordin Solus, Dante, and Nico Minoru. Follow along with the League as they fight, quip and perform musical theater in a cross-dimensional adventure that has seen them visit Eternia, Jurassic Park, and Westeros, in an attempt to defeat the evil forces of Phyrexia!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmash Fiction is free to its fans, and always will be. But it isn\u2019t free to produce. The hosts spend their own time and money researching characters each week and purchasing storage space. Moreover, we\u2019d love to do more with the show\u2014with your help, we can start a website, upgrade our sound, and even start creating bonus content for our patrons to enjoy. There are tiers and goals aplenty, and every little bit really does help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve always wanted the answers. Smash Fiction provides the answers and an hour\u0027s worth of laughs along with them. Join us, and let the fight be never-ending!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca class=\"redactor_btn redactor_btn_orderedlist\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
