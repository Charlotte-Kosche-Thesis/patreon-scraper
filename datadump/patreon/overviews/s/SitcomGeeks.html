    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the Sitcom Geeks Patreon page, friends.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\nenjoy the things we do, and you\u0027d like us to carry on doing them, and you\u0027d\nlike to HELP us carry on doing them, well now you can.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you may know, Patreon is a site which allows\nfans and supporters of artists and creators to directly sponsor those creators\nto create more stuff, be it videos, podcasts, blogs, teaching notes, or (as in\nour case) all of the above.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\nchoose to become one of our Patreon patrons, you can pledge amounts from $1 per\nmonth (we know most of you are Brits but Patreon is an American site so dollars\nit is). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn\naddition to our regular work, we\u0027ll be producing extra stuff JUST FOR YOU, our\nsupporters. Exclusive videos, surprises, offers and rewards, to thank you for\nyour help because you will be supporting us, and taking an interest in the\ncreative process and helping us stick it to the man, by which we mean paying\nour taxes on time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut why, no doubt you\u2019re wondering, are you\nbeing approached for funding for two blokes who make a living as writers for\nthe telly? Doesn\u2019t everyone who works in telly live in a gated mansion in\nHampstead with hot and cold running servants? Isn\u2019t everyone in TV a cocaine\naddict, are you asking us for nothing more than to finance your daily fix? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere is\nstill a lot of misunderstanding about what crowdfunding actually is.\nCrowdfunding is a way for people to directly support and sustain artists and\ncreators whose work means something to them, in a collaborative framework,\nmaking it possible for those artists and creators to carry on being inventive\nand risky. The companies we have always worked for are becoming ever\nmore risk averse, so crowdfunding is simply asking you as individuals who have\nsupported us over the years to take on a small part of that risk.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u2019t mind giving stuff away, as our 50+\npodcasts and dozens of comedy writing blogs testify. And not everyone CAN\npay. But somebody has to get paid at some point or one day there won\u0027t BE\nany more content. If the only people who can make comedy are the\nmainstream or the independently wealthy, there\u2019ll soon be nothing to choose\nfrom. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLike all freelancers, our working hours are mainly spent\ntrying to achieve a balance between paid work, speculative work to get more\npaid work, getting involved in Facebook conversations about comedy and\nconvincing ourselves this is real work, telephone calls to the bank explaining\nthat the money for last decade\u2019s paid work that should have come in to the\naccount yesterday from my agent now won\u2019t be arriving until next week, and free\nstuff that\u2019s there to help us become better writers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDAVE: I realise it\u2019s\nselfish, but one of the reasons I started to teach comedy writing was because I\nwanted to learn it. Everything up until then had been instinctive, picked up on\nthe job, working around others. And since I began teaching in 2006 I have\nbecome much gooder at riteing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know there are\nplenty of great teachers out there who aren\u2019t necessarily masters of the craft\nitself, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to communicate well about comedy if\nyou\u2019re not spending most of your time doing it.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJAMES: In the ideal\nworld we would be like the many pro writers we knew from 20 and even 10 years\nago, spending five days a week writing TV and radio episodes of our own shows,\nor being around when they\u2019re being shot or recorded. Indeed, for a few years we\nwere them. The reality is that there are now almost no comedy writers in that\nposition.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhich is where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love recording the podcasts\nand we want to do more, loads more. We have a ton of great ideas for extra shows,\nway more than we ever have the time to record. We want to make our regular\npodcast weekly, we want to do more live q and a sessions, record shows live at\ngigs and comedy festivals \u2013 and we\u2019d love to record and film a bunch of\npodcasts in which we create our own sitcom, which maybe we could develop over\ntime with your suggestions...\u003cbr\u003e"
