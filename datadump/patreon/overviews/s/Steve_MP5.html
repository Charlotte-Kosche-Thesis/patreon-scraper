My years spent in this community have really made me grow to love being in and around the firearms community that much more. \u00a0In my experience, everyone has always been ready and willing to help wherever/however/whoever/whenever they could for the community. \u00a0So here I am, not only asking you to come along on this journey with me, but to also give back as much as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is one of the main hurdles/expenses to this lifestyle? \u00a0\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAMMO\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003c/span\u003e\u00a0Firearms are normally buy once cry once. \u00a0Ammo is that constant expense that is always hitting you up for your spare change every. single. day. \u00a0You turn into Dave Chappelle\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://juliascottdouglas.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/celebrity_tyrone_biggums.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTyrone Biggums\u003c/a\u003e looking for your next ammo fix! \u00a0Since I don\u0027t own any businesses, I can\u0027t offer merchandise discounts. Nor am I \"famous\" enough to meet, so AMMO are my rewards, both in goals and tiers, to all of you beautiful supporters! \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eEVERYONE NEEEEEDS AMMO!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince YouTube has changed Adsense, \u00a0I have lost what little revenue I was making (enough to buy a box of ammo a month). \u00a0I take what little extra money I can scrape together after life\u0027s bills to create content I think others would want to see. \u00a0Many of the videos I have made were because no one else made one on that topic and I was left with unanswered questions. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn comes Patreon. \u00a0I\u0027ve seen many channels turn to this venue, so I decided to give it a shot. \u00a0I want to be able to keep making content people would want to see and help others along the way. \u00a0The goal always was for my YouTube channel to be able to support itself. \u00a0To be able to take that revenue and put it back into the channel for equipment, ammo, a new gun here and there, and upgrades. \u00a0Like the majority of us, I know I couldn\u0027t afford $50 a month extra on something like this. \u00a0That is why I aim to keep the price as economical as possible to reach as many as possible. \u00a0$25 is the highest and that won\u0027t even fill your gas tank! \u00a0Take the money you throw away on lotto tickets every week and put it into something that has MUCH better odds of paying out. That is the dream. \u00a0I hope together, we can make that dream come true. \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eKeep an eye on the goals!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I have exciting rewards planned for those. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAMMO\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eAMMO\u003c/strong\u003e and more \u003cstrong\u003eAMMO\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eSPREAD THE WORD! \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThe more people we have the \u003cstrong\u003eMORE\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAMMO\u003c/strong\u003e will be added as an incentive. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eYOU all\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e will be the deciding factor\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0This doesn\u0027t work without the community pulling together to help. \u00a0If there is not enough interest to sustain this, it will have to end. \u00a0Don\u0027t let a good thing end! \u00a0The more people we have per tier will garner higher round counts as I will adjust Tier/Goal Incentives (and/or) add more. \u00a0Think of your patronage\u00a0as helping yourself and others in our community by getting rewarded with ammo at\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDEEP\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eDISCOUNTS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0To start off, many of the rewards are lower than I\u0027d like, but that is by design. \u00a0I can\u0027t offer a high round count for a reward with very few patrons. \u00a0It wouldn\u0027t be sustainable. \u00a0The more we have the more you shall receive. \u00a0For example: \u00a0If \u003cstrong\u003e100\u003c/strong\u003e people sign up for \u003cstrong\u003eDelta Force,\u003c/strong\u003e then it could change from 300 rounds 10 times a year to \u003cstrong\u003e1,000\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0ROUNDS EVERY MONTH \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eMULTIPLE WINNERS\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0Who knows? \u00a0Again, this only works if \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e make it. \u00a0Think of me as a vessel and \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e are the one driving it. \u00a0I want to get as much ammo into as many hands as possible, to get the most out of all of our passion and not be burdened by the high cost of ammo. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSHIPPING\u003c/strong\u003e isn\u0027t cheap folks- and it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eFREE!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eHELP ME HELP YOU!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Stay safe and responsible everyone!
