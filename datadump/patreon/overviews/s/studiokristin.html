I\u2019ve been making art for fifteen years. I\u2019ve exhibited\ninternationally, hold an MA and PhD, and have taught at Oxford University. My work has been in books and won some prizes. And I\u2019ve made everything from public\nartworks with museums to a one-hole miniature golf course in a closet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m making independent and passionate contemporary art. My practice goes beyond a single genre: I\u2019m creating architectural installations, drawing, photographs and fiction. Each project relates to the next a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. This is unknown territory \u2013 daunting, exciting, ambitious territory \u2013 and I\u2019m looking for the freedom to take all it to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgbox.com/G2csD21H.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pictures above and below document an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2eVNrH3\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earchitectural installation\u003c/a\u003e: a two-story-high work I made with a museum in the Netherlands. During the research phase, I went to the ghost town of Metropolis, Nevada, and photographed every inch of the last remnant of building still standing \u2013 an archway.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2v5CE3F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLater, I rebuilt that structure at 1:1 scale using photographs as a surface over plywood.\u003c/a\u003e The reconstruction was sited on a vacant lot in a recently founded city in the Netherlands \u2013 a contemporary frontier on track to become one of the largest cities in the Netherlands. As an example of my fiction work: I wrote a short story about a sculpture, videogames, and an intimate family relationship, which was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2vRCZV5\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublished by a UK literary journal\u003c/a\u003e. You can see some of my past work \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2u6x2RZ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earchived here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is an\nincredibly difficult time for artists. Our culture rewards instant\ngratification, clickbait and superficiality, and nearly all art business models\nare succumbing to this immense pressure. Increasingly, the gallery system looks for safe, cookie-cutter art-as-commodity, while the slower, thoughtful and engaged\nwork we need most falls by the wayside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgbox.com/qmRJP02m.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLast year I\nhad a catastrophic and disabling problem with my spine, resulting in lots of\ndays in the hospital, unbelievable pain that prevented me from doing simple\nthings like standing up, and eventually surgery to implant a titanium aneurysm\nclip in my spine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor basketball fans, I had a spinal csf leak \u2013 the same issue\nthat has caused NBA Coach of the Year Steve Kerr such horrific pain and medical\nleave from the Golden State Warriors. There were many months where I didn\u2019t\nknow how or if I was going to get better. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s\nincredibly thrilling to be on the other side of that experience: I was very\nlucky in that my surgery was successful and I\u2019m continuing to get stronger. Still,\nthis was without a doubt the most difficult experience I\u2019ve ever been through,\nand a major setback for my career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt makes this particular moment extra\ncrucial \u2013 both financially and as a key time to be seeking out a core,\nkind-hearted community \u2013 so it\u2019s a big factor in asking for your patronage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4303/36034648495_8779d738e0_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have an\nalmost stupidly unwavering dedication to art. I\u2019ve lived in a sleeping bag in storage\ncloset. I\u2019ve considered a hotplate my \u201ckitchen\u201d for years at a time. I remember\nwhen a friend gave me stained twin mattress on two wood pallets and it was a\nmajor life upgrade. (Yes I was over thirty at the time.) I\u2019ve uprooted for opportunities\nin odd places where I didn\u2019t know a soul, and for a decade moved every year, or more. As so many of us have, I\u2019ve paid the long hard grinding years of\ndues.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I\u2019m\nlooking for the freedom to make the best and most ambitious work that I\u2019m\ncapable of. I\u2019m looking for a small, positive community, for folks who\u2019ll be\nreceptive and interested in seeing this work evolve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage equals less\nhustling for freelance work. It means time in the studio, more deep research, more\ndrawing and writing, more work on brand new stuff, which down the road will\nlead to more shows. As things progress, I want to be able to afford quality\nmaterials, so that I can make enduring, archival work, and because I\u2019m still physically limited, to hire some help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/151912512@N02/35491439875/in/dateposted-public/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4215/35491439875_da2dc88224_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you know\nthat women make up ~80% of graduating MFA classes, while contemporary art\ngalleries represent just 17% women, if that? The higher you look, the fewer\nwomen, and the disparity in pay and opportunities becomes worse and worse. As\nwomen advance in art it only gets harder to be taken seriously \u2013 as powerful\nminds, as intellectuals, as creators. LET\u2019S CHANGE THAT.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe in\nart that\u2019s accessible for everyone. This page is an experiment, and it\u2019s scary.\nIf you become a patron, you\u2019ll have access to all kinds of behind the scenes material\nand a community of subscribers. You\u2019ll be giving me a gentle kick in the butt\nto share with you, which is incredibly inspiring. You can send me tips, Q\u0026amp;A,\nand, I would hope, silly cat video links. I realize that being a patron isn\u2019t\nabout the rewards, but I really do want to exercise the art-making muscles and repay at\nleast some part of your generosity. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe\nthis is a time for challenging, reflective, and thought-provoking art. My years\nof experience put me in a unique position to deliver that, but I need your help\nto realize ideas as finished pieces that are ready to get out in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u2019s see\nhow far this can go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
