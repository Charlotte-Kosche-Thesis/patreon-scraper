    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eIf you\u0027ve watched the video, you can scroll down to the pretty Knitty Patron logo. (It\u0027s the same stuff till then.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2002, Knitty freaked people out. We published the first issue of our online knitting magazine when there was nothing else like it on the internet. It was completely free, and it didn\u2019t stink. In fact, it was pretty good and it surprised a lot of people. I created Knitty to collect knitting talent from all over the web and publish it in one professional-looking place where it would be properly vetted, showcased and get the recognition it deserved from knitters worldwide.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve continued to do, for the last 13 years: seek out and publish amazing knitting patterns, encourage and expose more inspiring work from budding knitwear designers, share great patterns from names you already know and love, and showcase great knitting yarns and products. We have helped launch the careers of some of the most talented people in the handknitting industry. As more and more people have become designers thanks to the ease with which they can publish on Ravelry, we continue to bring the brightest and best to your attention, helping them stand out and get the notice they deserve.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany of the most legendary internet-instigated knitting patterns and techniques found their audience through our pages: the iconic Clapotis, the mind-blowing Skew sock, the inspiring Lizard Ridge blanket, and the body parts we love to knit \u2013 the Womb, the cute and cuddly reproductive organ, and the Tit-Bit, a design which is a functional solution for those who have lost one or both breasts. And so many more, it would take a whole page just to list them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are proud of our role in the online knitting world and we want to continue to uphold that mission for the benefit of readers like you, and the designers, patterns and knitting products you\u2019ve yet to see. And so we are doing something unprecedented. \n\u003cstrong\u003eWe are asking for your support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u2019s get something clear right now: \n\u003cstrong\u003ewe are a free magazine and we will remain free as long as we are able to publish\u003c/strong\u003e. We have been supported by our advertisers since 2003. However, since the worldwide financial crisis of 2008, as I\u2019m sure you have personally witnessed, budgets worldwide (those of individuals, small businesses, and even huge corporations) have gotten leaner. Advertisers everywhere have cut back on the ads they run in all media. Not just with us \u2013 it\u0027s affecting every industry in some way. We\u0027ve continued to produce the best possible magazine we can while making less and less money doing it, because we love making Knitty for you, and we want to continue to support and promote all aspects of the knitting industry. The hard fact is that we\u0027re currently bringing in less than half what we were making in 2008. The hard fact is that it\u0027s only getting worse, issue by issue. At the same time, we\u0027ve been working hard to keep Knitty as Knitty as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCovering every square inch of screen space with the same flashy, obnoxious ad stuff you see all over the Internet is not an option we want to choose. We want to do better.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf Knitty is to remain free and advertising alone is no longer covering the cost of producing the magazine, how are we to stay in business? Well, we\u2019ve found a solution.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://knitty.com/images/PAT/2017/KNITTYweblogo2017colICON.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eYou\u0027re looking at it.\n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e is like an ongoing Kickstarter.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s a way for people who love something to support it financially at whatever level they wish, and get some extra-cool stuff in return. \n\u003c/strong\u003eThat ongoing support allows us at Knitty to count on a reasonably stable income so we can continue to pay our staff and contributors fairly as we produce the best possible magazine for you. It will also allow us the freedom to plan exciting new features for our readers, once the contributions grow beyond our staff costs. Patreon will help us grow and thrive.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nDo you have to pay? Absolutely not\u003c/strong\u003e. Knitty will still come out every 3 months absolutely free, for as long as we\u2019re able to produce it. But could you pay? Would you contribute a few dollars an Issue to thank the contributors for their work and to make sure it can continue? For all the enjoyment you\u0027ve gotten from Knitty over the years? To make sure that you don\u2019t miss out on the next Dunfallandy blanket, Gemini sweater, or inspired sock designed by a ridiculously talented 15-year-old high school student?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat do you get in return? Scroll down past this message to see the different reward levels. I hope there\u0027s one that feels right to you. Do you have an idea for a reward level I haven\u0027t included here? Write me and maybe I can make it happen!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe rewards\u003c/strong\u003e are designed to give you \u003cstrong\u003eaccess to Knitty in a more personal way\u003c/strong\u003e than has ever been available before. You could get early access to every new issue and surprise, ahead of the rest of the internet. You could have access to Knitty\u2019s Editor/Publisher (that\u0027s me) and our staff and the design talent that we feature each issue. There are even tangible goodies available at some levels, because we love cool stuff, and we want you to have some, too, if that\u2019s your thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing able to connect with Knitty readers like I\u0027m going to be able to through Patreon has me super-excited to meet you all, and hear what you\u2019re thinking, working on, dreaming about. Several of the reward levels include two-way web hangouts with me (and occasional guest visits from the knitterati!). So we can talk and knit together and get to know each other. Just you, me and the yarn.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat will your money do?\u003c/strong\u003e Our first goal was reached soon after we launched this campaign: thanks to Patron support, we are now able to pay our staff and contributors (writers and designers) a fair wage. We were also able to rework Knitty\u0027s current design into one that works well on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets (they call it Responsive design...we call it awesome!). Most importantly, as advertising has continued to decrease since Sept 2015, the funds we receive from our Patrons are keeping us alive, plain and simple. \u003cstrong\u003eWe would not be here without our Patrons\u0027 support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nTwo dollars every Issue from a large number of our readers\u003c/strong\u003e would really add up. That\u0027s just $8 per year. A larger pledge will make an even bigger difference. But if every person who enjoys Knitty puts two dollars or more in our coffee can, that would quickly add up to a lot of dollars over the year. It means a secure future for Knitty and our readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould our level of funding increase past the current level, we\u0027ll be able to hire a designer who will help steer Knitty towards an even more user friendly experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne important thing to know about Patreon (besides how cool it is) is that it\u0027s been built with both the artist (that\u0027s us) and the Patrons (that\u0027s you) in mind. When we release a new Issue, I\u0027ll send out an official New Issue post that says we\u0027ve made something and released it to our Patrons. You then have to the end of that month to decide if you still want your money to go to Knitty or not. You\u0027re not stuck supporting something you don\u0027t love. If you leave things be, we\u0027ll get your dollars at the beginning of the month following a new release. The surprises are part of the Issue (no extra charge). So you\u0027ll be contributing 4 times per year, and that\u0027s all.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are other less-Knitty (less friendly, less tasteful, less positive) ways to pay our bills, but this is the one that feels the most right to us. It will change the magazine for the better and allow us to do things we\u0027ve only dreamed of for years. Knitty was groundbreaking when it launched in September of 2002, completely free. Patreon is similarly groundbreaking and we\u0027re excited to be part of this new platform that allows creators and their community to work together to make beautiful things happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(If you have about 6 minutes, take a look at what the Knitterati had to say about our Patreon campaign.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/137878929\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore questions? \n\u003cstrong\u003eRead our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://knitty.com/ISSUEdf15/patreonFAQ.PHP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFAQ page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support for the past 14 years, and for your help in ensuring Knitty stays strong and vibrant into the future!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\nAmy\n\u003cbr\u003e\n[editor, \n\u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FKnitty.com%2F\u0026amp;h=bAQEBV32ZAQEu8sy8Bbzqesa8Kav_1Qd0sG0O9ya3MpTRCg\u0026amp;enc=AZOWnTaS99693u3cvcNlqcB5pwA-iXcJE4FGRKeG-B_graJmI1XBKniuBnBb_cefatAXI9fP-4c-j166-sahn_glapJu1lZF2nR8MwfCLQ0fxpHgG3oWu6IGEzPvA8Ed4S6GJVLX1JEdJEywfPtXm5kLxziDX6hbQ5s5ZvVoRL9Ptg\u0026amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKnitty.com\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
