On my channel you won\u0027t find any falsity or cut and scripted, fake videos. People get thrown off by the way that I am, the things I speak about, and the way I choose to live my life for myself and not others. Because of this, I have been a target for many bullying sites over the past 6-9 years (it gets hard to pinpoint because the talk about me has moved from site to site for a few years before I became aware of it). People like to get close to me just to go onto these sites and lie about me or over exaggerate what type of person I really am.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I also dress and look alternative, though I don\u0027t like to call myself \"Goth\". I\u0027m 41 years old and refuse to be forced into normality because others want to put an age limit on my life. I try to spread the general thought that your life is your life, and no one has the right to control you. What you look like or what you enjoy, who you love, and what you do for fun...none of this matters to anyone but you and those closest to you. If you aren\u0027t hurting anyone, no one has the right to try to shame you into changing to suit \u003cstrong\u003etheir\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0ideals. I really enjoy being there for others, and love hearing from people who tell me how much my life and my videos have helped them. However, my personal interaction is cut down because there\u0027s just no way to tell who is friend and who is foe, so to protect myself and those around me, I tend to keep to myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI am here, quite honestly, because Youtube has changed and made it harder to get paid for your videos. Because I talk about serious issues such as bullying, and like to curse, monetization isn\u0027t working for me. Roughly 85% of my views are the hate sites spying on me, so I\u0027m going to be holding back on the juicy stuff unless they pay for it. Sorry to everyone else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
