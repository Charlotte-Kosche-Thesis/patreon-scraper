I had also moved from Colombia (South America) to the U.S. to experience first-hand the American culture, something I was always curious about. By the time I had reached my 20\u2019s I had moved on to a knowledge based business, teaching English. And during my 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s I got married, became a self-taught investor, started trading stocks in the U.S., Australian and Colombian markets, traveled the world, migrated to Australia, did 2 MBAs and started all the startups listed below. I also speak three languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese), have been to over 60 cities in 10 countries \u0026amp; 4 continents and have also lived in Colombia, Mexico, USA and Australia (my home). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Entrepreneur\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e***Business Startups\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Udemy\u003c/strong\u003e - 10th course launched, more to come. | Knowledge turned into useful / commercially viable courses\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Numbby\u003c/strong\u003e - Shutdown | a crowdsourced/curated source of data, statistics and everything in numbers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Todoenbienes \u003c/strong\u003e\u2013 Shutdown | a social network for selling and buying products and services. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e***Personal Startups\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Global MBA with Tulane University.

Even though I have had many successes as a person, professional and entrepreneur, I have also been rejected many times\u003c/strong\u003e. A lot of people have not believed in my projects or ideas and have not supported me in my journey. Yet, like Jack Ma I have kept moving fwd because I strongly believe I\u0027m doing the right thing in pursuing my dreams and projects (go to youtube and search \"Jack Ma rejected by Harvard\"). Here is a list of the people who have rejected me recently (to name a few):\u003cbr\u003e1) The prestigious University MIT, twice in 2016\u003cbr\u003e2) The Boston Global Mass Challenge in 2014.\u003cbr\u003e3) The Colombian Government - Trip to Silicon Valley in 2014. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the above, you should know this about me. It\u0027s not easy for me to share this publicly, but the time has come for me to do it. I always knew this day would come as what I lived has helped others around me and will continue to help many more. It is not a movie, fable, legend or novel. It\u0027s a true story, my testimony, my story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you believe it or not, doesn\u0027t really matter \u0026amp; is probably not really important, but it happened just as I am about to tell you. Like many rock stars, in the past I battled depression, anxiety, insomnia and even suicide. At one point I thought I wasn\u0027t going to make it. I felt I just couldn\u0027t battle any longer and felt not only lost and weak, but also very alone and sad... But my family stood by my side in my darkest moments, all of them. My mom (or my Angel as I call her sometimes) cleaned the sweat of my forehead as I spent sleepless nights in a battle for survival where I couldn\u0027t even get myself together for a simple prayer. Her deep love kept me alive many times. As did the help of good doctors (who were also close friends), two monks who taught me the true value of life, forgiveness, sadness \u0026amp; happiness and the love of a guy I like to call dad. Ultimately, he would save me and would transform me into what I am today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I can say about that experience is that it was probably one of the most (if not the most) painful, sad and hard moments in my life. Metaphorically, blood tears came out of my eyes many times. But it was also one of the moments where I have learnt the most about me and who I truly wanted to become. After spending days reflecting, sometimes alone in a mountain, I left behind my worldly empty ambitions and changed a \"promising future,\" rides in limousines and ten thousand dollar dinners to pursue my passions, like love, helping others, education, technology and even the little things that make me happy such as teaching. So here I am today. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Adventurer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I reflect on what I\u0027ve done in my life I always conclude that even though I\u0027ve done a lot, I still feel there\u0027s a lot for me to do, to explore. But I\u0027m happy with what I\u0027ve done so far, so I wanted to share some of those unique adventures or special moments with all of you. Moments that I treasure in my heart and that will always be part of who and what I am. I also realize that not everyone gets the opportunity to experience some of these things first hand, so I feel both grateful and fortunate for all of these experiences:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Climbing the Great Wall of China. I\u003c/strong\u003et wasn\u0027t so hard going up, but coming down was a true challenge. I could feel my knees shake all the way down due to the small steps, the incline and the weight of my body. I had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath but I made it all the way up and all the way down. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Hunting Crocodiles in New Orleans.\u003c/strong\u003e You can watch this one on youtube, just search \"Mauricio the Crocodile Hunter.\" I had a blast with this experience and probably took unnecessary risks which could have lead to me losing a hand lol, but I had a lot of fun. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Swimming in an Underground River down in Mexico\u003c/strong\u003e. The water was crystal clear and it was a very unique experience. I loved it. At times I was a bit scared too, but overall I enjoyed it. The trees over the river were amazing...\u003cbr\u003e4) Visting the Salt Cathedral in Colombia. This place is a human marvel. An entire cathedral built on a salt mine, with salt!! Yes, salt!! It\u0027s one of the most beautiful things I\u0027ve ever seen in my life and on that day I have to say I felt really proud of being Colombian. \u003cbr\u003e5) Seeing the Opera House and Harbour Bridge in Sydney, Australia for the first time. You have no idea how excited I was on this day. I almost couldn\u0027t believe I was there and could feel my body shake with excitement. For a moment I thought I was going to cry and I guess I almost did. You experience the true might of Australia when you\u0027re in Sydney.\u003cbr\u003e6) Climbing the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Seeing all of Paris from the top of the Eiffel tower was so amazing... But even better was having some wine with friends on a bridge, visiting the Louvre, Sacred Heart and Arc of Triumph. All incredible experiences. \u003cbr\u003e7) Driving 20 \u0026amp; 40 Ton Half a Million Dollar Excavators in North Dakota, near the border with Canada. Oh this was so much fun. Brought me back to when I was 5 years old and playing with friends in the sand with cheaper toys. Fortunately I didn\u0027t wreck any of these bad boyz. \u003cbr\u003e8) Putting one foot in the ocean and another one in a river at the same time in Brazil. This South American country is rich in culture, good food, friendly people and beautiful views. I never thought I could be in a river and the ocean at the same time until I went to Brazil. Definitely memorable. \u003cbr\u003e9) Climbing the Sun and Moon Pyramids in Mexico. Everything looked so small from up there and I felt so much peace at the top of these places that I will never forget them. You should know that despite of its violent international reputation, Mexico is probably one of my favorite spots on Earth. \u003cbr\u003e10) Snowboarding \u0026amp; Rafting in Aspen. This place is one of the top ski resorts in the world and its international reputation is well earned. The views and mountains of Aspen make you feel like you\u0027re in a postcard. \u003cbr\u003e11) Eating ants and frogs with the locals. Yep, I\u0027ve done it but wouldn\u0027t do it again. Of course these weren\u0027t the typical ants you see around, nor were the frogs. They are both \"special dishes\" where I had them and to be honest they weren\u0027t that bad (the ants were roasted and tasted a bit like nuts), but like I said, once in a life time for me.\u003cbr\u003e12) Visiting Potsdam in Germany. This was once the house of Kings and Queens and it truly is a very unique place. Of all the countries I\u0027ve been to, Germany is one of the Top 3 places I would go to. I love it. Such a great place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Professional (My CV)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaster of Management and Engineer with ten years\u2019 Project Management experience (Agile certified).
