    "summary": "Though we\u2019ve had countless shows, it\u2019s still hard to believe it\u0027s been an entire year since we\u2019ve launched the Patreon. Thanks to everyone\u2019s generous pledges, we\u2019ve been able to do some amazing things with RollPlay that otherwise would not have been possible. From the bottom of our hearts: thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor year two, we want to shake things up and try to offer some unique rewards fans of Rollplay can\u2019t get anywhere else. However, with the added costs of experimenting with new things, we\u2019re adjusting some of the tiers around to help facilitate these changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFEED ACCESS AND MONTHLY Q\u0026amp;A ($1)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe heard your feedback, so the $1 base tier will remain. You\u0027ll still be able to access any content that was published during Year One at this tier (character creation, behind the scene videos, etc). For Year Two though, we\u2019re changing the reward, to be RollPlay feed access (ability to preview the content before you increase your pledge) and access to the new monthly, streamed Q\u0026amp;A sessions thanks to Crowdcast, these Q\u0026amp;A sessions are one of the new things we\u2019ll be trying with the Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBEHIND THE SCENES ($3)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe original $1 tier benefits will be moving to the $3 tier. We\u2019ve got a new, increased dedication to producing behind the scenes content, and we feel the reflected increased cost to fans will be well worth it. If you have ideas on what you\u2019d like to see, or find that the new pricing isn\u2019t justified, we would love to hear your feedback so we can continue to improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that this will obviously be a big change for a lot of people and that there will be some current Patrons for whom their budget doesn\u2019t allow a continued to support at the new level. Our hope, though, is that we\u2019re making enough content to encourage a continued support at the $1 tier, or enough that the $2 increase is worth the increased amount. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of being a Patron or not, we want to make it clear that we appreciate everyone who watches and supports RollPlay by being active in the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCHANGES TO THE MP3 TIER ($5)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn year one, we decided to feature two different tiers for the MP3s: access to current, ongoing shows and, at a higher tier, access to the entire library of RollPlay MP3s. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith our new MP3 tier, Partons will have access to both of these. For $5 a month, you have access to every RollPlay show ever produced in MP3 format to take with you wherever you want to listen (and now 2500+ hours worth of content in the library, you can listen more than ever). New RollPlay fans, we wish you good luck getting through all of it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE ROLLPLAY ZINE (PDF) + ROLLPLAY ROLL20 MAPS ($10)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs one of our higher tiers, we feel never quite got the PDF tier right, and it\u2019s important to us to feel that the benefits our Patrons receive accurately reflect the cost. So, we\u2019ve brought this benefit down by $10 and added in a little something extra for people who use Roll20 for their campaigns: monthly, handcrafted digital maps to use in your campaigns. At the launch of this tier, we currently have 10 unique maps available for download, with the expectation of featuring five new maps a month (along with our monthly RollPlay Zine). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those looking to \u201cdemo\u201d both of these items, we\u2019re giving away the latest RollPlay Zine and a map for free by clicking\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://itmejp.com/Freebies/\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e. We would love feedback on this tier especially to see what you guys think! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME TO YEAR TWO!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope everyone enjoys what we have planned going into our second year. The last change to be made for our Patreon is that we\u2019ll removing the total monthly earnings from the page. Due to one-time, unique charges like the RollPlay Party at PAX Unplugged and the signed merchandise, the front facing monthly will have many highs and then perceived \u201clows\u201d to be able to accurately reflect the success of RollPlay and reached stretch goals we can realistically maintain. We are dedicated to remaining transparent with the earnings, though, and will be very vocal about everything we\u2019re planning to use Patreon funds towards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us on Twitter or submit a question during the upcoming monthly Q\u0026amp;A session. We\u2019ve experienced a lot of positive changes in the past year, and we can\u2019t wait to get started on the next. \u003cbr\u003e"
