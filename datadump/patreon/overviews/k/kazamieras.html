    "summary": "If you\u0027ve made it this far, chances are you\u0027re thinking about pledging to support me. I\u0027ll thank you for that first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps you need more persuasion though. Totally understandable. Let\u0027s go over the reasons why pledging to me; for me; for the people, would be a good thing. Something that you should do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a degree (BSc) in Zoology; I am qualified to do nothing. Imagine having a degree in Biology but having no one take you seriously and the frequency with which I get asked the question \"So are you going to work in a zoo?\". I need to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough money being pledged I will be able to remove the adverts from my videos. It\u0027ll stop my income from Maker Studios (which averages ~$250 per month), but it\u0027ll mean no adverts for you. Even if you have AdBlock I think you can appreciate this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have to start being a real adult, which means that I need an acceptable monthly income. If I can\u0027t get that from YouTube then I\u0027ll have to get a proper job. That means less time for videos, less content, less time to refine my amazing editing skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money won\u0027t go to anything other than keeping me alive and helping me run my channel. I will not buy shares in Bitcoin or mountains of porn. Probably.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour or five videos a week to keep you entertained in return for minimal financial investment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dunno. I could say more but I think I\u0027ve dragged this on for long enough. If you\u0027re here then you know me, you know I reply to almost every comment you leave. I reply to as many messages as I can. I\u0027m just making videos to entertain you and so that I can keep speaking to you all. I\u0027d like to keep doing that. If that sounds agreeable to you then you know what to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003eJames xxx\u003cbr\u003e"
