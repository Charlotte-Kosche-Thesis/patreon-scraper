My main interest are BBW\u0027s, Fighting games and wrestling and I think most of my character designs reflect that. \u00a0I want to create characters for mugen that can reflect my interest since I don\u0027t think anyone else will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create characters for mugen that can reflect my interest since I think I may be able to make some interesting play styles that work in several furry kinks. \u00a0Currently I have Jumbo and Jiggly completed and I want to work on several other characters. \u00a0Depending on how long this goes I could eventually end up with a stand alone game if I make enough characters and stages. \u00a0But honestly My gold right now is just to provide characters for the furry community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brought me to Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been working on characters as a side project for several months now and its really hard to do all that it takes for a character while also having to do the grind to make rent, food, supplies and etc. \u00a0So I wanted to give this a shot in case there are others that would like to support this goal. \u00a0The support would give me more time to do the animation and coding without worrying about other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo will your stuff be accessible\u00a0exclusively\u00a0here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. \u00a0I really just love the creation part for making characters. From the animation, planning, coding, and discussions about fighting game mechanics and balance. \u00a0I would do this regardless to if I had support but support would really help! \u00a0Mugen Characters tend to get spread on the net and I would not try to control that. \u00a0So the characters will be free downloads for all, but supporting creating those characters will give early access to their WIP stages."
