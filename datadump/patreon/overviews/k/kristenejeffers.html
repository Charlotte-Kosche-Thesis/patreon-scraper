    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, I\u2019m Kristen. I write and speak about place. I am Black. I am Urban. I am an Urbanist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy (late) dad was a key influence in me being interested in the city. We used to bike around our working-class neighborhood, walk to the neighborhood ballpark and go downtown to all the festivals. He also took me to more school buildings than I would care to share. In essence, I grew up with a love of architecture, streets, trees, buses, trains and lots of other things in the environment. Oh and my mom and dad grew up on farms and took me there to visit. I respect and even like the country. But I love the city. They both encouraged me, especially my mom as a middle school teacher and lover of libraries, to read, write and tell my own story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve traveled across the U.S. and Canada telling those stories of cities and helping others share theirs too. I\u0027ve contributed to several major urban planning and city living publications. But I want to make my own platform, The Black Urbanist, the premier platform for issues and ideas facing the African Diaspora in the design and governance of spaces and places. I want to write and advocate full-time and I also want to be able to pay a team of writers, editors, producers and contributors to help me advance that mission.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy desire to breathe new life into my platform really began in earnest at 9:30 on November Election Night 2016, as the map began to wash the color of blood, at the bar in my beloved new neighborhood in Washington, D.C. I began to weep. Not because of what was about to happen to the White House, but because I believed that I was running out of time to do all the things I wanted to do before it all ended. Between losing a parent, falling into debt, having a litany of work failures and just over all being a ball of fear did not help matters much and I still am battling a lot of these struggles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarching or doing any direct protest action felt so hard and with all the things we\u0027ve been told would happen, felt like it was impossible, just like all of the times I\u0027ve gone to work and been told I\u0027m not good enough or I should work harder or I should work less or be less smart or that I was flat out wrong. And then there were all the times those things were true and I failed to forgive myself and pick myself back up and keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as I spent the inaugural weekend with yet another friend I\u0027ve gained in the over ten years of speaking my mind openly in the written word on this and other platforms and I think of all of the ones I\u0027ve gained all over the world and I think of how so many of them were out on the streets, risking lives and standing up not just for women, but for all that\u0027s right and good and not just on the Mall, but in Center City Park (in my hometown) and at Washington Square Park (a town I took a huge risk to go work in and helped me gain the courage to step out on my own) and in Moore Square (my college town) and so many other venues that I\u0027ve had the privilege to visit over the past 12 years since I went off to college. Plus, being able to walk in and around Harlem and support so many black-owned businesses and witness so much everyday black and brown resilience and joy, was so healing, especially contrasted with what continues to go down at the White House and throughout the federal government.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, as I detailed in\u003ca href=\"http://wp.me/p3HbH5-O8\"\u003e this recent post on The Black Urbanist\u003c/a\u003e, I got the idea to open up my site, hire a managing editor and start commissioning work in the quest to make The Black Urbanist the premier publication for advancing black urbanism and the stories of black folks and how we take up space worldwide. As I work on building up to the goal of being able to hire on staff, I\u0027m freelancing and providing editorial support to other publications and organizations, editing and producing a weekly radio show and newsletter and writing blog posts as I see fit. I\u0027m also in the process of revising and re-releasing my first book, A Black Urbanist. You\u0027ll be the first to get a copy of the new book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support no matter how large or small, supports all of this."

In 2010, after an early career in the nonprofit and professional services sector, she took the communication degree she\u2019d earned from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC and combined that with the Master of Public Affairs she would earn in 2012 from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to create \u003ca href=\"http://www.theblackurbanist.com/\"\u003eThe Black Urbanist\u003c/a\u003e, an outlet for her interests in promoting urban studies and community development. Her thoughts and comments have since been featured in The Atlantic Cities (CityLab), Next City, Sustainable Cities Collective, Streetsblog Network, Yes! Weekly, \u003ca href=\"http://triad-city-beat.com/fresh-eyes-from-an-ambassador-to-kansas-city/\"\u003eTriad City Beat\u003c/a\u003e and the (Greensboro) News and Record and on \u003ca href=\"http://kcur.org/post/loop-de-loop#stream/0\"\u003eKCUR\u2019s \u003cem\u003eCentral Standard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. She has spoken as a keynote, lead breakout sessions and and served on panels at the Congress for New Urbanism, CityWorksXpo, APA Virginia National Meeting, 2012 UNC Global South conference and a number of other summits, classroom lectures and professional gatherings. In 2014 she released her first book of essays, \u003ca href=\"https://gum.co/blackurbanist\"\u003eA Black Urbanist\u003c/a\u003e. She makes the best mixtapes, knows all the best restaurants in Greensboro and cheers loudly for her Wolfpack, especially on the basketball court. She currently resides in Washington, DC, but spent a wonderful year as a Midwesterner in Kansas City, MO. She\u0027s also taking applications for a new city or for a good reason to not be a digital nomad for good.\u003c/h2\u003e",
