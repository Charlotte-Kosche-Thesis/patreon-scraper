Those handful of characters that are like a warm welcome safety blanket, whose lives and tales and trials are embedded in your heart? Those words that rattle around in your head for decades, waiting to be written?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell that\u0027s what this novel is for me. \u00a0Bloodstone has been knocking around my head for over ten years now and I\u0027m finally in a position to buckle down and actually write the thing. \u00a0But, in order to make that happen, I could still use a little help. \u00a0Currently I am a grad student working on my PhD and trying to figure out the best way to make my own bread because food is ridiculously expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/o7py8o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAh, yes, but what is this whole Bloodstone story about, you ask? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Buzzword Version:\u003c/u\u003e Hope, Death, Spies, Assassins, Secrets, Siblings, Revenge, Romance, LGBTQIA+\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Short Version:\u003c/u\u003e A vaguely traditional coming-of-age story in a fantasy realm following the lives of Knave and Elli as they navigate the trials and tribulations of politics, magic, and trying to figure out the difference between vengeance and justice. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Long Version\u003c/u\u003e: Bloodstone is a story of\ndark magic, death, and desperation as sixteen-year-old Knave and his fourteen-year-old\nsister Ellison have their lives turned upside down one fateful night. \u00a0The events of that night haunt the siblings\nas the two escape to the city\u0026#8217;s capital, Hull, but ill luck continues to follow them like a\nblack cat. \u00a0The Great Purge sees swaths of necromancy accusations and hysteria gripes the kingdom in response to a plague that has been decimating towns left and right.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFaced with trying to build a new life, Knave begins working for an undertaker,\nChristian, but he soon learns that Christian is not at all who he seems to be.
