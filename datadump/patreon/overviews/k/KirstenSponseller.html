It\u0027s for locals and visitors to our lovely, artistic city. I talk about events that are off the beatin path. Original stuff to do, hosted by local artists, filmmakers, chefs, musicians and other creative types that all make Sarasota a place worth existing. I\u0027m all about spreading the word for people who support me. It\u0027s like \"the good ol boy network\" without the \"ol boy\" part.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Good people approach me and say \"Hey Kirsten! I really love your video and you make me laugh tons. How can I be apart of the events you mention?\" Well this is the answer to many questions and bad ass ideas.\u003cbr\u003e  I want to make each video more interactive for the good people who watch every week. If you want to become a patron I will make you apart of What\u0027s Up. I\u0027ll mention your name, a buzz word of your choice, a special occasion you\u0027re celebrating or your event to help you spread the word and get people out to your event. This will help you make money! See? We help each other....keep in mind this is for a southwest Florida audience, it helps if your target crowd is near here. But I can still mention your name or a buzz word, wherever you are.\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s a local video that goes up every Thursday and gets 4,000+ views within 2-3 days.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0that\u0027s not too shabby for a local video that focuses on a certain time frame.\u003cbr\u003e In my Intro video you can see my 150th webisode (from Sept 2016). In the intro there\u0027s a montage of how far I\u0027ve come over the years. It\u0027s also a taste of the ridiculous ways I get people excited about what\u0027s up."
