I\u0027m not sure what the future holds for me, but I know that art is going to be a huge part of it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art style is typically more traditional, but my focus is on current issues in the world. Poverty, war, abuse, and injustice are recurring themes throughout the majority of my work. But sometimes I like to take a break and create works with simpler meanings, focusing on landscapes and nature. I work with traditional mediums for the most part, and I favour graphite, charcoal, coloured pencils and acrylic paint. I do, however, occasionally create digital works as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do YOU Get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOn Patreon, artists can set rewards for patrons who donate a certain amount per month, and goals for when they reach a certain number of donations per month.

I\u0027m currently unemployed because of my disability, and being able to afford food, rent, transit and supplies is becoming increasingly difficult. By supporting me, you are helping me pursue my dream of a career in art, and you are helping me stay off the streets. The biggest goal of this Patreon isn\u0027t a speed paint, it\u0027s helping me get my Bachelor\u0027s degree, and I am so incredibly thankful for anyone willing to contribute to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
