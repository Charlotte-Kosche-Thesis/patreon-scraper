    "summary": "Heyo! Welcome to my Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMy name is Koyzumi, or Koy for short and I am a US based cosplayer currently residing in Maryland and am a full time college student who also works part time so I do apologize for inconsistency in my posting. Why do I have a patreon? Well, if you like my content and would like to support me so I can provide more content, you can help me here or on my twitch account when I do live streams. Generally, I like to try and do streams on Sunday nights US EST, but I will try and post notifications either here or on my facebook when I am doing streams on a different day. I have been a cosplayer since 2009 and have been making my own cosplay when I can for about 5 years and still going. Recently, I have started to take commissions for cosplay, mostly through close friends, but I am totally willing to work with you and take cosplay commissions for either props or costumes. For more information, feel free to shoot me a message via my facebook since I am most active on that social media platform.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSome other tid bit information about me: I enjoy playing soccer and volleyball, but every now and again I also go hiking through the woods just cause. I enjoy photography, though I am not that great at photoshop. So just about all of my photos are taken either with my phone, by someone else at a photoshoot, or my personal camera (I will caption which photos are by others. Which speaking of, my profile pic was taken by my amazing friends Glitzparty Cosplay, who you can find on facebook as well). Along with photography, I also enjoy videography and am fairly decent at video editing. Most of my stuff on my twitch video log though are just basic edits, but I have done a few, a little more involved edits on my youtube channel. I am 4\u002711\" and am full Japanese though I am not fluent in the language (though I am taking college courses to hopefully become bilingual in English and Japanese). Ummmm.... If there is any other information you would like to know, feel free to message me anytime and depending on what you are trying to know, I will gladly answer promptly.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhy did I make a patreon? To be honest, I had thought about making a patreon for a few years now but was not really sure about it till recently. The main reason that I made a patreon is to make it easier for those who want to support me in my craft but don\u0027t really have a way to. But like I said before, by no means is this an obligation. Its purely by choice.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for poppin in. ^w^ Hope to see you either during my streams or at future cons I plan to attend in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e-Koyzumi\u003c/div\u003e"
