    "summary": "Knight Quest is an original comedy cartoon developed by a team comprised of stand up comics from Austin, Texas. The cartoon is set in a realm because fantasy stories always seem to be set in some sort of realm. We aren\u0027t 100% sure what a realm is but our cartoon is DEFINITELY set in one. It stars Sir Brennick (The Gray Knight), his sidekick Galdorcraft (the necromancer) and their new little buddy Pampy Barblegarg (the squire). They go on quests which almost always go perfectly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney made from this Patreon campaign will go directly towards the cartoon. First off, have you seen the FIRST EPISODE YET? If not:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FuiINuHxz160\u0026amp;h=ATOGValEfUvy-e3RQk2L6RjINUznU5xvz7oUEaPGLVYtHqhNgsuSuziL6n5Magie9vx21TVV2MI7Ml58_TeRTy3TiIbIELfMEGeAQD-U1MmpHOgs0eQt8VvQW3uPBly2iCRcGgDESn2UIDYslglegvIIuFEQ2w\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/uiINuHxz160\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOk now that you\u0027re familiar, let\u0027s get down to brass tacks. See, we made this little cartoon in our spare time with very limited resources. IF YOU LIKED IT, please consider contributing a few bucks to this page. 100% of your contributions will go toward making NINE! MORE! EPISODES! OF! KNIGHT! QUEST! WHOA! Look, I\u0027m gonna level with you, we\u0027re going to produce these episodes whether you contribute or not BUT IT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER because we all have to work like dogs at our disgusting day jobs, leaving very little time left to do important stuff like make a fun cartoon with friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know what you\u0027re thinking, why give $$$ to this if it\u0027s all going to be uploaded to youtube for free? I don\u0027t know, because you\u0027re a good person? PSYCH, here\u0027s why:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributors get access to exclusive content, uncensored episodes \u003cimg src=\"https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v9/z57/1/16/1f609.png\"\u003e, deleted scenes, production art, outtakes, AND THE SATISFACTION ONE GETS FROM SUPPORTING THE ARTS. Well, I\u0027m sold. Won\u0027t you join us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we all work day jobs we\u0027re not looking to pay our bills with your donations. We\u0027re interested in growing this into a full time job some day but that means delivering a quality first season. Money will be spent on hiring additional voice actors, animators, and artists. We\u0027re grateful you\u0027ve stopped by the page to check this project out further. Thank you for your time! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur cast / creators:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRob Gagnon (Sir Brennick): Rob is the creator and co-host of \"Stoned vs Drunk vs Sober\", which was referred to by Laugh Button as \"one of the 9 most unique comedy shows in the nation.\" Rob was recently a finalist in the Funniest Person in Austin contest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePat Dean (Galdorcraft): Pat hosted \"BBQueue\", a barbecue webseries for VICE.
