I am a 3D artist, game designer \u0026amp; father with an extreme passion for games, music and art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was eight years old, I have been fascinated with games. Even at that age I had the dream of creating my very own adventures to share with the world. As soon as I finished school, I studied Game Development at college, and moved on to earn a BSc in Computer Game Production at University. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have been creating, learning and commissioning work for other studios. I have been creating in Autodesk 3Ds Max \u0026amp; Maya, Blender, Unreal Engine, Zbrush, Substance Painter and more for more years than I can count.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this passion, I have started up my own company, Kenomica Productions Ltd, with the aim of making video games and 3D commissions for video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What is Kenomica Productions?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKenomica Productions is an independent game development company based in the UK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt Kenomica Productions, we aim to create exciting experiences that appeal to various ages, genders and cultures - from light hearted games for children, to serious games exploring mental health. We believe that games are art. They can be fun, they can be thought-provoking. They can make us laugh, they can make us cry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGames can be simple experiences to pass the time \u2013 but also so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Where does the money go?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll pledges will go towards keeping up subscriptions, hosting and supplies - as well as keeping up with cutting edge technology and software, such as improving our photogrammetry kit and keeping owned software up to date. Pledges will also go directly to development costs of the projects themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall, this means less time is spent on chasing commissions to be able to work - and more time is spent on making games! This income will allow Kenomica Productions to be my full time day-job! This also helps put food on the table for me and my family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What\u0027s in it for me?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledges of $1 or more\u003c/strong\u003e will gain access to the patron only feed.
