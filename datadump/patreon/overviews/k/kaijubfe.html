    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon! My name is Brandon Giudice and I am an independent game designer. I am eager to put my skills to work and create enjoyable experiences for gamers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Kaiju Battle for Earth\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is a game centered around Kaiju and all the exciting things that go along with them. The game will be a third person action game with arcade and rpg elements. The player will control monsters and fight their way through cities and other areas to get a high score and unlock more stages, monsters, etc. The monsters and landscapes will be composed of simple 3D geometry while pretty much everything else will be made out of voxel graphics. Players will have to destroy cities, fight monsters, and defend themselves against the Earth Military Forces(EMF). The EMF will have tanks, boats, planes and of course giant robots. Most monsters can utilize light, heavy and special attacks and also use a mobility move like sneak, roll or hop. The goal of each stage is to rack up the specified amount of Destruction Points. DP is gained by destroying buildings, crushing cars and people and eliminating enemies. There will be a wide range of monsters to choose from as well as unique skins for each. There will be plenty of stages to select and the game will feature a non-linear progression through them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinancial\u00a0State\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am working a full time job every week and it is really digging into my ability to focus on what is really important to me. I am hoping that together we can make this happen. It wont require much icome for me to leave my current job and focus entirely on my games. My biggest goal with Patreon is to create a game that is absolutely free when it is complete. You will not have to pay for the completed game at all, no paid DLC, no micro transactions, nothing. By allowing people to donate what they want, I feel that this will limit the number of people feeling robbed by an indie developer. I understand the issue a lot of gamers have with indie games, why pay $15 for a game that may not be what it was originally advertised as or does not meet expectations. I want to help gamers by allowing them to donate what they feel the game is worth or pay nothing at all and just enjoy the game. That being said, I still need to support my home\u0027s growing needs. So people who donate before release will get monthly builds of the game when they are finished. They will also gain access to exclusive features centered around the current project I am working on. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Future\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe majority of the money made from the community will support me but the rest will be saved to aid in my next project. I have a huge backlog of games I would love to work on and show gamers. Once I deem Kaiju Battle for Earth complete, I will \u00a0setup a poll with ideas for the community to vote on and go from there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSome ideas include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Megaman Legends inspired mining game\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA first person shooter with elements of the original Quake and modern rpg shooters with a unique twist on inventory that I have not seen ;)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA space exploration game where you outfit a ship for bullet-hell planetary travel and explore planets with your boots on the ground \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSocial Media\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eKeep up to date with my progress on these platforms:\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kaijubattleforearth/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/kaijubattleforearth/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kaijubattleforearth/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/kaijubattleforearth/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kopsnu.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttp://kopsnu.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrello:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/ylDKsjLJ/kaiju-game\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://trello.com/b/ylDKsjLJ/kaiju-battle-for-earth\u003c/a\u003e"
