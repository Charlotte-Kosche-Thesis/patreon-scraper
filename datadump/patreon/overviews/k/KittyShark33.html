    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are you?\" I am everyone\u0027s best friend. I am the smiling stranger on the bus mouthing the words to her favourite song as she scribbles on a clipboard in pen on her way to the mall. I am the overly helpful sales associate whose face is red from grabbing the ladder to find that item you\u0027re looking for. I am that encouraging social media like, you know, the one that made you smile after a hard day at work. I am the bubbly, curly haired brunette Canadian wearing glasses that will tell you her life story and about that time she went to the hospital because she had a kidney infection and a kidney stone in the same kidney. I could write a book series with a movie adaptation and a tv series spin-off about myself to be honest. Search me on instagram, find me on facebook, look for my tweets. It might be easier to experience who I am and what I am doing than to read about it or watch it. I am everyone\u0027s best friend and I want to live my days behind a counter at a money box selling artwork and helping people find and follow their passions in life. I want to travel to shows with friends and enjoy those precious memories with them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a02017 Furnal Equinox was one of my best experiences because I encouraged a good friend to join me at my table, and got to witness her meet one of her favourite artists and draw in his commission book. I got to draw someone\u0027s fursona for like $1 and her promise to like every facebook post I make to my page forever. Fun fact it\u0027s a year later and she still likes my posts despite how far apart they tend to get. I get post con depression after even a four hour craft show, because I live for the feeling behind the table. Greeting customers, telling them about my art or a product, ringing them up and packing a product in a little bag with a business card and a thank you. It\u0027s my drug, my lifeline.. my passion. If you decide to support this account I cannot guarantee a reward every month, but I can guarantee I will forever be thankful and that I will cry every time someone sends me money. I am a young, naive girl who wants to keep her parents proud despite my career path being so weak financially. I will most likely forget to edit this later on so if you do receive a reward for donating please know I make this description expecting the worst outcome possible but hoping for the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely, your best friend,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eKittyShark33 (Katie Sharkey)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eof KittyShark Studios"
