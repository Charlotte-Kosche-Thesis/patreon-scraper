Today it has evolved into a monthly podcast, presenting new music from the liquid dnb scene and also including guest mixes from amazing producers. We\u0027ve received so much positive feedback from listeners, and this is one of the main factors to keep me going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating and experimenting with music has always been a big passion of mine. I\u0027ve always enjoyed producing and mixing, and it\u0027s been my main hobby for as long as I can remember. The concept of music being available and free to enjoy has always intrigued me, which is why most of my own productions are as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy pledge to this project?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLiquid \u0026amp; Beyond has already become a project I\u0027m very proud of, but I would like to take it even further. New gear is definitely on the list for improving Liquid \u0026amp; Beyond. A better microphone would allow for better voiceovers. A webcam would allow for live streaming of the mixes (which would be awesome!), and maybe even weekly liquid dnb mixes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo, if you enjoy the episodes and want to help improve quality, quantity and a bunch of other stuff to come, consider pledging a small amount :)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently studying and working a part time job to pay the bills, but I try to put all I can spare towards music production (may it be new hardware gear or software such as new plugins etc.).\u00a0There\u0027s already a few expenses to cover, mainly the cost of my server hosting the episodes so they can appear on iTunes. I enjoy discovering new music for the episodes, and even though it can take me a few days to create a new episode, it\u0027s something I love doing.\u003cbr\u003e"
