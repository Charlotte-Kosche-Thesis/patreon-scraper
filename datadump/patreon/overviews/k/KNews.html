    "summary": "Hey there!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lukas and I am an independent YouTuber who produces an english show which I call kNews Space (kNews - short for Kilonewtons) on a weekly basis where I talk about and showcase upcoming rocket launches. My inspiration for these were people in my surroundings who just didn\u0027t know what rockets are all about and why we spend so much money burning fuel to leave our atmosphere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to make everyone able to understand how a rocket launch works, what the payload is and why it is launched at all. I\u0027m however not a rocket scientist or aerospace engineer and I have to research and understand most of what I talk about myself first. If I can understand it you can too! I typically list the sources I use in the video description and you are always welcome to check them out or add something to the discussion in the comment section. By sources I btw. mean official publications from the rocket launch and satellite companies or governments. I do not read any news websites or blogs about space to avoid plagiarism. So what you get to hear from me you will hopefully not hear anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs probably everyone spending a lot of time making videos, I dream of one day doing it more than just part time and I chose to go the Patreon or crowdfunding route because I believe it suits me best. I still use ads on YouTube but that is mainly to also somehow support the platform. I\u0027m not sure if Google would promote videos they make no money with. However, the amount of ad revenue I receive will probably never justify the time going into my videos and I don\u0027t think I would be still around if there was no other way to fund such a show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of work, how much time does it take to create kNews episodes? Well, to give you a quick overview. Making an episode involves..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eResearching the launches and payloads of the upcoming week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreating a script of everything I say which is typically 800-1000 words long\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecording somewhat pleasent ingame footage in KSP using self made craft which ressemble the real ones\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGoing through the roughly edited footage and note where I want to place animations, cards and comments\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThinking about how to illustrate something, again making a lot of notes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreating 3D models and animating everything I need using the free animation software Blender\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRendering the animations which sometimes takes a whole night\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCombining everything into a single video nicely so that my voice over fits the video cuts and so on\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUploading it to YouTube and waiting for your feedback to talk with you about it! :)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProducing other original content about aerospace I can share with you on Twitter (.gifs and renders)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all I would say I can get an episode done - if I really focus on it without distractions - I look at you Reddit - within a day from morning until evening. However, because I also have a private life I of course spread it onto several days which means one episode per week is currently the maximum I can offer. Having more time for videos I would ramp up the kNews production by a kNews Special per week and I would also get into livestreaming so I could maybe show you some things behind the scenes or just play around in KSP or whatever you want me to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow to the financial stuff: How much do I need? My costs for producing kNews are not so high actually. It\u0027s mostly electricity and eventually some computer hardware I will have to replace at some point. Most of what kNews costs is time, a lot of it. I\u0027m just a normal guy who has to somehow justify the time he puts into his projects but I have no kids so nobody besides me is affected by it. It would be cool if one could be paid in time but that\u0027s at least for now not possible. Maybe in the future when we will all transcend\u00a0to robots :D Today the only thing I can really ask for is a tip bascially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could make a number up of funding I would need to somehow do kNews for a living - which is my ultimate dream - but others allready did it. The minimum wage in Germany is round about 1500 \u20ac / 1650 $ per month (\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=minimum+wage+germany\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLink\u003c/a\u003e)\u00a0and I think that\u0027s a good estimate for what I would need to quit everything else and focus on kNews alone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it\u0027s a lot to ask for and a very high goal but this is what it would take to make sure kNews never ends. It\u0027s of course far away right now but I believe it\u0027s in the realm of possible achievements. However, I\u0027m not sure if I or my content are worthy enough for that which is something you have to decide. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank all of you who believe in me and I hope I can meet your expectations and continue to improve myself! Feel free to contact me at any time if you have a question but please understand that I don\u0027t really feel comfortable enough to share private things. I don\u0027t want to make a big secret out of my personality though so if you really really want to know who you are supporting before you do (understandable), I will of course provide all necessary contact details. I have actually registered a small business for my channel so it\u0027s quite legit and I hope I can get a \"verified arrow\" on YouTube at some point. ;P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest Regards,\u003cbr\u003eLukas aka. kNews Space\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/kNewsSpace\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/kNewsSpace\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/kNewsSpace\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/kNewsSpace\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ekNews_Lukas_[at]_out_look_[dot]_com \u003cbr\u003e(Formatted so it is a little harder for bots to pick up and send spam.

It\u0027s hard to specify what exactly that means but as long as you use your own name you will be safe. As an example: I will not credit websites because I don\u0027t want to risk linking to malicious content or just stuff I do not agree with. Please do simply not try to abuse it ;P Should your name not comply with my rules you can of course change it at any time and I will also write you a message in case \u00a0of a problem occuring!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Next to your \"real\" name I decided to also add Twitter handles because these are actually unique. If @kNewsSpace supports my channel there can be no confusion. It\u0027s me ;P If you want your Twitter handle to be seen simply make sure your Patreon account is linked to Twitter or if you don\u0027t like that, send me your handle via direct message.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e- I will keep crediting you even if you stop your monthly support. Should I ever forget about it or have a typo please let me know! I do everything manually and flaws happen. You can at any time decide to become an anonymous supporter but for that you also have to write me a message. I recently decided to split current supporters and past supporters in two distinct groups, which is just fair I would say. If you ever feel treated unfairly please simply write me a message aswell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e- This section will develop over time and I will listen to the feedback I get to improve it. I also reserve the right to change anything at any time but I will inform you about big changes so you know what\u0027s up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe End\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

In a weekly episode I cover all the upcoming rocket launches for the upcoming week explaining what exactly is being launched and go a little deeper into relevant topics I feel might interest you.\u003cbr\u003eMy second video series I hope I can release more often in the future are KNews Specials. I use these to showcase and explain all kinds of things which are related to space but not necessarily include rockets launching.\u003cbr\u003eTo create my videos I use the game Kerbal Space Program as a tool to visualize what is going on when a rocket takes off and also share my .craft files so you can fly the rocket for yourself if you like! Another big and growing part are my self made animations with the freeware Blender. I really enjoy doing these and they help me to get my point across.",
