    "summary": "(Video coming later. Writing samples in creator posts.\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s quite a bit of writing here. Keep in mind you\u0027re supporting a writer! TLDR for those who want a quick recap!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR\u0026gt;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first novel I\u0027m working on in this style will be a mix of fantasy, sci-fi, with a touch of steampunk following four to five characters through the narrative based on reader choice. The interesting choose your own adventure style narrative will be special because of its re-readability due to the character chosen and alternate story paths. I am currently looking for the best ways to present this particular media (I have one in particular I know works already). At higher milestones I should be able to self contain the project in it\u0027s own application for different devices (phones, tablets, ect). Supporters at $5 a chapter and up will get chapters for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering the lengths of chapters you wont be charged very often. Expect a month or more, at the moment, between actual chapters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLonger story -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hello there and welcome to my Patreon Page. First of all, thanks for stopping by and considering to support my work, or if anything just checking it out. It really is a big deal for this to get around for my sake and for the content\u0027s sake so if you have a chance think about throwing a link around to your friends that like reading.\u003cbr\u003eBecause that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing here.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m writing.\u003cbr\u003eSo you should probably like reading for one reason or another or in the very least enjoy contributing to a profession that only 5% of writers can support themselves on. Holy cow right? Yeah. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. Especially since publishing can be such a nightmare and I\u0027m doing something (gasp!) outside of the usual box when it comes to writing. So ultimately I\u0027m hoping to get some support from all of you not only to help me keep going and keep me producing content but to maybe even show a publisher, if it comes to that, the kind of interest I have in what I\u0027m producing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be familiar with the sort of new genre of video games that\u0027s a sort of choose your own adventure game. Aside from being a nightmare to flip through (paper novels) and probably a nightmare to organize considering it was in handheld form they were generally child oriented and of limited scope. So I had come to the realization that this form of entertainment is largely gone from my understanding aside from one publisher in particular who is now labeling them as \"games\". Only there was an issue. The majority of the people who read and played these \"games\" never went back through them and did it again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the interesting things you\u0027ll be getting by supporting my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eReplayability\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e re-readability \u003c/strong\u003ewithout clicking through page after page of text. I decided the best way to tackle the problem of people not wanting to read it again by splitting the story into multiple characters each with their own prologue. Starting with four characters each would have their own opening. So maybe you want to play the story again and see those scenes from a different point of view? Choose a new character. You\u0027ll get entirely new opening so the beginning is fresh and interesting. You\u0027ll get to see those scenes again with a new perspective. You\u0027ll see the side of the story you missed playing one of the other ones or where that character was while the others were off doing something else. Sure, it\u0027s more work, but ultimately this is about replay-ability. It also means that if you really don\u0027t want to read from that character\u0027s perspective after a few pages you can switch to someone else, still get the full experience, and not be annoyed perhaps by that character\u0027s inner monologue or perspective.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eAlternate story paths\u003c/strong\u003e. You aren\u0027t the main character of the story. There are at least four characters each with their own wants, needs, and dreams. Each character has branching stories per chapter that can drastically change the reader\u0027s experience. No more wondering what would have happened if that character had done that interesting thing or started to panic. While every character has a \"true\" path they will follow if you are not playing them, the character you read will present you with alternate and interesting paths that can in small ways and in bigger ways change the story. The \"true\" arc is the path the character would have followed without player intervention. Why do this at all? I feel like giving the player or reader some choice in what they want to read is a truly interesting idea. See how your choices for the character would change the story and their path through it. This includes possible romances with other characters (which has it\u0027s own special concept).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStretch goal:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eIndependent\u00a0Romances\u003c/strong\u003e. Unlike most CYOA (choose your own adventure) novels or episodic writing content the romances are both a part of and separate from the story. Romances can continue, stall, and end at all different parts of the story. Just because you missed a romance point in chapter two doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t start that romance in chapter four. Because of the progressive nature of the romances and how they are written the actual point in the story (within reason) won\u0027t force or destroy a possibility with that specific character. Some of the content in chapters can even change based on romances eliminating or even creating choices that hadn\u0027t been there previously. All characters will be romance possible by each other character. While every character is romance neutral (with their own preferences) the player can choose to alter those preferences by starting a romance with that character. So while a character might be straight when it comes to their \"true\" character the player can alter that to see the novel they want to see. No more \"he should have been with her instead\" moments! Have each character fall in love as you see fit, or not at all, and decide what YOU want to see. Even go back and see it again from the other character\u0027s perspective!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said you\u0027re able to read more of the novel you might want to read. Or read it again and only read it from a totally new perspective. Try a new romance. See how your choices truly effect the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reader/player gets to choose their flavor and make the story their own. The overall plot itself wont entirely change, if it did the scope of the novel would simply spiral out of control, but the player has choice about the journey. After all isn\u0027t the journey more important than the destination?\u003cbr\u003e"

Content will come out regardless but I can\u0027t quite give any release dates or anything like that. What I put out will ultimately depend on how much time I have. Considering every chapter has to be written from each character\u0027s point of view this might certainly take a while. But it will get done.",

That means content is going to probably come about as fast as I can get it out of my head and onto the page while maintaining a standard of quality I would expect from a writer. I might still be eating Ramen for lunch but at least I\u0027m getting somewhere. I should be able to push my own website out at this point based on what my Patrons want.",
