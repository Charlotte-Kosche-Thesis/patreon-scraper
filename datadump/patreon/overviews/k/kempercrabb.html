    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWORSHIP. ART. WORLD.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two fundamental questions that followers of Jesus ask today: \u003cstrong\u003eHow did we as the Church get into this mess?\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eHow do we get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKemper Crabb has been thinking about these questions his entire adult life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe modern world is a confused and difficult place. It seems over the last century the Church\u2019s influence as a moral anchor for society has waned and its leadership for the trajectory of civilization has lost its mark. Two questions the modern Christian might ponder is how did we as a Church find ourselves at this place and how might we, as a unified front, emerge from it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKemper has dedicated his adult life studying the causes and searching for solutions to both questions. He is a modern man, artist, and visionary steeped in historical Christianity.  He preaches a Gospel of artistic truth and Biblical foundations that draws men and women into his music, writings, and teachings.  His message is uniting the Church\u2014the Colony of Heaven\u2014into an eternal dialogue that leads to glorifying God through the Arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany know Kemper as a recording artist and a pioneer in the Christian music industry through the music of \u003cem\u003eArkAngel: Warrior\u003c/em\u003e, his enduring and influential classic solo project \u003cem\u003eThe Vigil\u003c/em\u003e, and the PBS Christmas concert \u003cem\u003eDowne in Yon Forrest\u003c/em\u003e. In 2017, he published his first book, \u003cem\u003eLiberation Front\u003c/em\u003e, a timeless message that provides a framework for how we should live in community together and resurrect our Biblical Commission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKemper also is an exceptional teacher. He makes deep theological truths accessible to ordinary people and is driven to demonstrate how Scripture can be applied to every aspect of life. Through a unique combination of Biblical understanding, theological insight, and historical perspective, Kemper demonstrates how the present is rooted in the past. Questions the ancients asked and answered do more than explain how we got here; they can also help move us forward in a way that honors Jesus and advances the Kingdom of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many people, Kemper\u2019s teaching is a refreshing rain on a parched land. Their first question is always, how can I get more of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage makes these talks and studies available online. The first series of talks will be \u003cem\u003eThe Revolution\u003c/em\u003e, a study about the Church as a way of being. We will release the following talks once per week in podcast format:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the Church?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eFour Marks of the Church\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eGifts for the Body\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHow Big is the Gospel?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhere do we Worship?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe Anamnetic Nature of Worship\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe Eucharist as World\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhat is Destiny?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe Church as Whore\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHow do we Fight?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe Path to Liberation\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther studies will follow.\u003cbr\u003e"
