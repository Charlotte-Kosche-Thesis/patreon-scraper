    "summary": "Hello there everyone! My name is Jacob, but you may know me better by the name Kavo. I am a WoW Parody Artist on YouTube as well as a gamer and overall goofball. Ever since I could remember, I\u0027ve been singing. At the age of 3, I sang on stage for the first time and since then, music and singing have driven me to become what I do now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I became an adult, I started to struggle with how I wanted to pursue my music. I was, and still am, challenged in playing instruments and all I have is my voice. My struggle continued when I enrolled in the Music Program at my university. What I saw were people filled with egos, competition, and the so called \"diva complex\". It turned me off completely and I started asking myself, \"this is what it takes to study music?\" . In the end, I changed my major and for a while, music sort of disappeared and I went into a bit of a depression. \u00a0I would play WoW as an escape and to help myself get through. I would play the game as well as watch machinimas of WoW entertaining myself for hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s when I discovered the likes of Nyhm, Sharm, Gigi, and many other singers known as WoW Parody artists. The fact that gamers like me were making music about a video game instantly appealed to me. I found it fun, entertaining, and also inspiring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May of 2012, I started my YouTube channel. Originally, I only planned on uploading music parodies, but quickly became interested in expanding into VLOGs and Gameplay Videos. My focus nowadays is to bring my subscribers regular content that is equal parts music, video games, and still maintain a personal connection with myself. Now that I\u0027m deciding to expand my channel, I felt the next step was to create a Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that I have made a positive impression upon you and that hopefully you will support me. I will work my hardest to bring you high quality music and gameplay videos. Thank you for taking time out of your day to meet me, and I hope to see more of you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s have some fun,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJacob (Kavo350)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
