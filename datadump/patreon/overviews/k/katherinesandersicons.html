    "summary": "I\u0027m a native of Scotland, a long-standing member of the Orthodox Church and an iconographer for the last fifteen years, so naturally I\u0027m fascinated by the rich religious culture and heritage of my own land. Growing up, I only vaguely knew about St Columba of Iona and St Margaret of Scotland, with her chapel at Edinburgh Castle, but had no idea about the many saints who had inhabited these lands for generations. Their names are literally those of our landscape, towns and villages yet so many have been forgotten.\u003cbr\u003eMy journey this year will be to gather information on just 12 of these saints, document their monuments in photographs, sketches and watercolour where they survive and paint an Icon of the saint which is suitable for use in worship and prayer, especially within the Eastern Orthodox tradition. I believe that I\u0027m not alone in this need for both knowledge and the presence of the saints - \u003cem\u003ewill you join me\u003c/em\u003e? To allow the time this will take, I\u0027m looking for patrons to join me on the pilgrimage, from wherever you are in the world.\u003cbr\u003eMembers of my \u003cem\u003ePatreon Clan\u003c/em\u003e will get access to inside knowledge on how I go about researching, preparing sketches and painting the Saints; will hear recordings of audio discussions with priests, archaeologists, historians, other iconographers - \u003cem\u003esinging of the hymns when possible\u003c/em\u003e, as well as videos and photographs just for clan members from the religious sites I\u0027m visiting. Even more than that, you will have prints, cards and even original icons depending on which reward level you choose, at the end of our year. \u003cem\u003ePlease read my community based goals\u003c/em\u003e - there\u0027s a surprise or two in there! \u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to see where we\u0027ll go - join me! In all things let us praise the Lord: I am choosing to trust that the Saints of Celtic Scotland (and eventually Ireland, England and Wales?) will pray for me and all patrons, so that my materials and earthly needs are met by the blessings of God and the generosity He inspires in those who follow my journey."

Any of the traditional twelve Great Feasts, for example, would be suitable. Due to amount of work and time involved, there is no time limit on this icon and I aim to complete it within 2019-2020, God willing.\n\u003cp\u003ePrevious rewards are also included:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA full colour postcard of each icon at the end of the year\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA single, unframed A4 colour print of the most popular icon chosen by Patreon Poll in November at the end of the year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProcess/behind-the-scenes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA digital copy of the final line sketch used in each icon (personal use only)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA full colour calendar at the end of the year (will ship in January)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy gratitude and inclusion in my prayers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
