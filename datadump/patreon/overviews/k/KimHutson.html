Then I wrote less and less to try and find the essence of something but eventually words weren\u0027t enough and I had to start making pictures again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to understand people - humans and what happens inside - and how you can tell from the outside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/f9e204b426.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love doing portraits and studies of people for this very reason.

I was doing it for a release and to gain some inner peace and I reckoned that if I started taking commissions or selling my work there would be a sort of stress to it or a friction that sullied the process for me. So for a while I said no.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/f9e4407b07.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027ve given in to this capitalist society and I also realise people actually do want to buy my work. And quite honestly I really need the money. And if the money can help me to have the time to do more art then that can only be a good thing, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/f9e8d4adc5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I hope you enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003eKim x\u003cbr\u003e"
