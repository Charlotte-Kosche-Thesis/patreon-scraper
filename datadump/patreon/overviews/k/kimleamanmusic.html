It was recorded at home using a Zoom recorder. I have TONS of songs I\u2019ve written, and I am in the process of writing more everyday. At times I write four songs a day. I want to record these songs for you so that they are listenable. I\u2019m reaching out for help so that I can get the things needed to do just that - GET MY SONGS OUT TO YOU! You\u2019ve been asking and I want to deliver.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will I do all of this? I have bins....and bins....HUNDREDS of songs I\u0027ve written, ready to be recorded. I have the musicians standing by waiting patiently to record them. I also have gigs lined up on both the East and West coasts. I just need to get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve spent most of my life playing gigs all over the country. That came to an end after a bad car wreck, paralysis, surgeries, and years of slow recovery. It took me a very long time to be able to play guitar again, but I don\u2019t give up! I\u2019m finally ready and able to record and perform my new material live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve gotten back into performing and recording, with the help of MANY dear friends who believe in me. They have been a HUGE support in my life. With their help I started learning how to record at home to save on recording costs. I\u0027ve been able to record some demos and early takes with more on the way, but his doesn\u2019t take the place of a good, solid recording that I could do if I were able to pay for LIVE musicians, recording equipment and studio fees. The limitations resulting from my injuries have made it difficult to make the money needed to pay for these. It also makes it difficult to travel and perform. I know you would rather hear good sounding recordings instead of my home recordings! (I would too!)\u003cbr\u003eI will record my vocals and guitar at home and then bring it to a studio and record with musicians.\u003cbr\u003eThis will save time and money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo earn extra money I make and sell jewelry, which goes toward gas for our generator and propane to heat our trailer. Jewelry doesn\u0027t really make a whole lot - about $40-$50 a month, if that. I\u2019m trying to sell off anything I own to get the money to record. That doesn\u2019t bother me as long as I keep my old guitar, some other music stuff, and some clothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSomething I really wish to get is an SUV or van so that I can gig again. Finding rides, scheduling gigs without meeting in person, and hauling equipment without a vehicle is another hurdle. I have gigs ready and waiting for me back East as well as on the West Coast. I need enough room to carry music equipment and rest on the road if need be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d also love to go see my Dad as soon as possible. After 15 years of looking for him I received a phone call and was informed that he was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u0027s disease. He\u0027s now in a facility back East. I need to go see him after all this time. He\u0027s the one who taught me to play guitar. He was my musical partner as soon as I could talk and sing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5JaOEsi.jpg\" style=\"width: 337px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst photo I\u0027ve seen of my Dad in over 15 years, 2017.\u003cbr\u003ePlaying guitar!

We\u0027ve never been separated since he was weeks old and since he almost didn\u0027t make it....I don\u0027t like being far away from him. A vehicle is imperative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing I love to do most in this world is write songs and to sing. To be able to record those songs, to hear them with all parts - all the instruments that I hear in my head when I write them - is a DREAM! I\u0027m hoping, with help, to make that dream - those songs - become reality. The ability to play and write music, let alone walk, was almost take away from me. I want to do everything I can to make it happen now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming a patron on Patreon, you will have exclusive early access to new songs, videos, lyrics, stories, and other treats. I believe so deeply this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. Your monthly support of $5, $10, or more will make a huge difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have hundreds of songs trapped on paper and waiting to be heard. With your help we can get these songs out to you and to everyone who has been waiting and asking for them for the years I\u0027ve been unable to play. I want them to be heard the way I hear them in my head. I hope you do too. Please support my music, and I\u2019ll do my best to entertain you and and to move you.

It never fails! They ask, \"Who is that?\" or \"Where is that band from?\" or \"It sounds familiar, why?\". I felt the same way the first time I heard it too. Then I sat down and thought about it, and here is what I came up with. When a song is this good, it feels natural, so we assume we have actually heard it before. Meanwhile it\u0027s the emotion in the song that we have actually felt before. Of course, this is only my opinion. However, I am sure it gets my point across. Kim\u0027s voice is simply angelic and the music creates illuminating melodies that leave a truly lasting impression. This my friends, is the kind of music that can stand the test of time. Please join me in getting the word out about this amazing group.\" -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDanbury Entertainment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Every musical genre these days seems to suffer from label-phobia. Pop music is equated with glamorized attitude, and alternative rock with bubbly trash, punk with tuneless boredom. But as the corporate music industry has chewed and swallowed it\u0027s share of all musical genres, indie music is returning to the forefront in all it\u0027s original glory. The real, raw rock-based sounds that have defined every youth based musical declaration are back. Enter, Kim Leaman, a moody and emotionally tinged band headed by Kim Leaman. Evidenced by her powerful CD, the group alternates between grungy fuzzy guitar licks, slamming drums and dripping sonic movements, all held in place by Leaman\u0027s haunting, melodic voice which lulls you like a strong narcotic. Sure it\u0027s not all happy-go-lucky, but one thing\u0027s for sure, this multi talented singer, songwriter, musician is unpredictable and is likely to do, play and say anything.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e-Fairfield Weekly\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cKim has appeared as a guest and featured guest on radio stations in MA, CT, and NY and her song \u201cWealth of Words\u201d was the number one most listened to song on 91.7  WXCI. \u003cbr\u003e\nShe has also appeared on 95.1 WRKI singing her dark and haunting song \u201cBeads of Water\u201d and became an instant hit with listeners as they called in asking where to purchase the album.
