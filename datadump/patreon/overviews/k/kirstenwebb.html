It was\u00a0produced and mixed entirely on an old, barely-working MacBook with an old version of Ableton, as a big part of my artistic practice is to use what I have on hand rather than relying on expensive technology. In creating the EP, I allowed my technological constraints to help form something organic, lo-fi, and raw, held within the structure of electronic production.

     "description": "The next big step of my creative\njourney is to bring the Traveling Medicine Tavern into being. This is a vision\nand project that feels interwoven with my heart\u2014if we\u0027ve spent time together in\nthe past few years, you\u0027ve probably heard me talk about it. And maybe you\u0027re\nexcited about it too: part roving apothecary, part mobile tea den and wildcrafted speakeasy,\u00a0part pop-up performance\nvenue, the aim of the Traveling Medicine Tavern is to gather and nurture\ncommunity as it offers a safe space for anyone to learn about health and herbalism, receive remedies, imbibe wildcrafted food and drink, take in magical\nlive performances, and share the experience of imagination, inclusivity, and festival. Wherever it sets up, it creates sweet space around it\u2014a space of imagination\nand delight where anything can happen; where anyone can come and receive\nnourishment, medicine, support, and herbal wisdom; where people and communities can form, merge, evolve,\nand create together. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWherever it goes, the Traveling\nMedicine Tavern will bring and nurture delight, nourishment, community,\nimagination, music, magic, and medicine\u2014a sense of wonder, abundance, and\npossibility grounded in real, wild food, drink, remedies, conviviality, beauty, and a\nsimplicity borne of interweaving with place, season, moment, and planet. This\nis an experience that\u2019s available to anyone\u2014the Traveling Medicine Tavern\nwelcomes everyone, and the gift economy factors deeply into its workings. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat do you think? Does this sound like\nfun? (For visual inspiration for the vision, check out my Pinterest\u2014link to the right.) With\npatronage support, I\u2019ll be able to devote much of my time to making this vision\neven more of a reality\u2014I\u2019ll research mobile unit possibilities and connect with\npeople who can help make it happen; start and tend to even more batches of\nherbal beers, wines, elixirs, tinctures, infused vinegars, honeys, dried herbs, and wild treats; and continue inventing installations,\nevents, and other happenings the TMT could host. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m also open to ideas about this! When\nyou hear \u201cTraveling Medicine Tavern,\u201d what does it mean to you? What would you\nlove to experience, imbibe, see, or hear? Where might the TMT visit, set up\ncamp, or appear?
