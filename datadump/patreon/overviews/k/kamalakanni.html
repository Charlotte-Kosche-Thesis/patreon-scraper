    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAn investment of $100 in Bitcoins in 2010 would be worth over $70m today. Crypto currency, or \u201cDigital Money\u201d may just turn out to be one of the best performing investments in history.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello My name is Kamal Akanni and i\u0027m an Ico investors or crypto-currencies investors.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2017 was the Bitcoin year. With mainstream media and people all over social media talking about bitcoin, we have seen the price of a bitcoin rises up to $19000. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo who am i, and what do i do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst,\u003cbr\u003ei am a Co-founder of Horizon ICO. We are a group of cryptocurrency , Bitcoin, ICO investors, speakers and Blockchain developers. We launch on January 15th, 2018 Horizon ICO Blockchain Events, to organize Free Meetup events across the world educating everyone in our communities of members and the public  about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology , ICO through networking and by bringing industry experts and players in to speak about their projects and knowledge. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore than just talking, we guide our members to invest and make 6 to 7 figures in Crypto investments,  as well as using cryptocurrency in practical, every day applications, and inspire people how to augment their businesses and projects via blockchains.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond,\u003cbr\u003eLike you, maybe just a bit sooner than you, i have heard of bitcoin, a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system.\u00a0It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator.\u00a0The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo now we have this amazing blockchain technology out there that everyone seems to be excited about because\u00a0it had made lots of people millionaires and billionaires overnight. \u003cbr\u003eBut unfortunately, the Bitcoin Spaceship has took off since 2009 and already landed passengers on the moon, and is continuing further to other planets as price still growing. So the rest of us late for the flight, what do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell thanks to the amazing great minds out there we have new start-up every week with great idea to build more applications on top of this technology to make it better and easier for the average person to use on their day to day activities. those start up then offers Altcoins\u00a0in return after they raise money from the public. Altcoins are the alternative cryptocurrencies launched after the success of Bitcoin. Generally, they project themselves as better substitutes to Bitcoin. The success of Bitcoin as the first peer-to-peer digital currency paved the way for many to follow. Many altcoins are trying to target any perceived limitations that Bitcoin has and come up with newer versions with competitive advantages. There is a great variety of altcoins, Ethereum, Neo, etc....\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you\u0027ve Heard of bitcoin, based on your research, or what you heard from friends or family the first thing they told you was to download Coinbase wallet and purchase your bitcoin or litecoin, and in oreder to purchase others altcoins like Ripple XRP or Tron TRX, you would have to transfer your Bitcoin from Coinbase to an exchange like Binance to Purchase altcoins at approximately $1/coin with a market capitalization of more than 15 Billions dollars.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if i tell you that you are still late for that party as well? \u003cbr\u003ePurchasing a coin while on exchange is like getting picked up by the space ship while its making a stop to get gas and picked up more passengers. The initial passengers on that spaceship had already gotten a great ride already from where they took off, for a great deal and great price with bonuses. And Where they took off?\u00a0 We call it ICO (Initial Coin Offering).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn Ico is an unregulated means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture. An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is used by startups to bypass the rigorous and regulated capital-raising process required by venture capitalists or banks. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for other cryptocurrencies, but usually for Bitcoin, Etherum, Neo.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So what i do, i find out what are the new and high rated Icos out there, ones with great projects, great team, and i get on that ship and get the best deal before it cost more after it already took off,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI created a Patreon page to share with you as a patron, the result of my research so you don\u0027t have to spend late night on your computers researching\u00a0the best Icos out there, how you can be part of that private sale, and how you can rich your financial goals and finally buy that car you been wanting to buy, or the house you been wanting to buy for your mother. \u003cbr\u003eSo become a patron now for almost Free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLooking forward to speak with you.\u003cbr\u003eThank you."
