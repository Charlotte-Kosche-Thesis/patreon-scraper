    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Kelaeno, or Kel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing things (mostly pretty ladies, lets get real.) for as long as I can remember. I mostly drew for me, but it was always really nice when I got to connect with others over my creations. After exhausting all other options to make a living for myself and take care of my health, I decided to finally try and offer the only skill I\u0027m really passionate about to the world. After a couple years, I\u0027ve learnt a lot of things about the online art business, and about myself and my relationship with my art. I\u0027ve learnt that having new content and posting often is crucial to success. I\u0027ve learnt that although I want to pay my bills and progress with goals that require funds, I\u0027m most passionate about my art when I\u0027m the most creatively free and connecting with others like me. and the last thing I\u0027ll mention that I learnt, which is the most important, is that I LOVE this. I love focusing the majority of my time on creating, and I love the process of creating and shipping products start to finish by myself, I love being able to express myself in this way so consistently, and I am going commit to those things for many MANY years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO WHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003elet\u0027s start with the obvious - capitalism sucks and my disabled artist butt has a hard time staying afloat, monthly patreon earnings would give me more financial security without me taking any time away from creating, which I truly feel is where I should best dedicate my time. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also struggled with posting frequently on social media before, because I found I didn\u0027t want to post work in progress shots often, and I seem to be perpetually working on 5 different things for a week or two. This leads to a lot of behind-the-scenes type content available for chunks of time, and then photos of finished products sprinkled in between silence, which is not helping me draw in a new audience or sell prints. By posting all those behind-the-scenes type material for you for as low as a dollar it puts me in more of a situation where I am progressing towards my goals and posting more content without compromising my artistic integrity (posting meh stuff) or my health (routine \u0026amp; balance are very hard for me due to my disability and I would not like to disturb my established system unless its necessar.y)\u003cbr\u003ePatreon would also allow me to create a community around my art by being a dedicated space to show a lot more of my process where only people who really want to see and respond to have access, and I really want to do tinychat art jams every two weeks or more with patrons where we can hangout, connect, collaborate and support each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebasically its an opporunity for me to do what I love even better, and its an opportunity for you to support me in a more affordable way without your house filling up with prints, and we all have a party. =)\u00a0"
