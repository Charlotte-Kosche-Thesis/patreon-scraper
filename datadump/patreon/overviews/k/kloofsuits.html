This means that creating new works and tutorials is very difficult, with paid commissions taking priority over product development, educational videos and resources. This Patreon scheme is designed to help us provide more content for the pleasure of everyone else! This includes tutorials, time lapse videos, written guides, Livestreams and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease feel free to take a browse at our work using the links provided, and take a peek at our tier of pledges and what they have to offer. We hope to be able to provide more opportunity for raffles and handmade products for our patrons in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would also like to thank everyone who has pledged to us at any point in time, and we hope to provide you with more in the near future. Thank you for your support, and we would love to keep you around!\u003c/div\u003e"
