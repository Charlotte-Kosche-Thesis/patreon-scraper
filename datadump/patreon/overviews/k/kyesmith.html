     "about": "I am a drummer and video producer from Newcastle, Australia and I have been putting together drum videos on YouTube since 2012. My band was recording our first album and there was downtime while waiting for it to be finished so I decided to try something a bit different in the meantime. I was studying media production at university so it made sense to try and combine my two hobbies into one project. This resulted in covering some of my favourite songs on drums and recording the covers for YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomehow over the years it has morphed from being drum covers of single songs to drum medleys and drum chronologies, where I try to cover a band\u2019s entire career in 5 minutes. So far these chronologies have covered bands such as The Beatles, Nirvana, Green Day, Blink-182, Foo Fighters, The Offspring, No Doubt, NOFX, Lagwagon, Pennywise, Strung Out, Rise Against, Hi-Standard, Frenzal Rhomb, Chris Duke and the Royals and Fuzigish along with record labels Fat Wreck Chords and Epitaph Records. \u003cbr\u003eI started recording these videos with no expectations and over the years they have resulted in some pretty amazing experiences including receiving kind words from some of my favourite bands/personalities. Right now I am getting ready to head over to the United States to perform The Beatles Chronology at halftime during a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.",
