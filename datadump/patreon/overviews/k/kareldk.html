Well, not entirely true. Some of the stories might cause you to flip tables or irregularity in breathing (okay, that was an exaggeration). My point is I\u0027m here to bring out the excitement with storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Karel Dharmananda Kosasih.\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, that is my name and yes, it is freaking long therefore I prefer Karel D.K. on the display. I am an Indonesian and have lived in Malaysia and Australia, away from home for about 10 years now. I used to study science, physics particularly, and loved all things about universe and the great unknown. But I love one thing more than that: writing. I love writing science fiction and fantasy, telling stories of weird and insane characters from fantastic worlds that I never want to admit to be fictional. They may be fictitious but doesn\u0027t mean they can\u0027t exist in our world. Being real takes many forms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now I have more time to write about them I can share more to the world. Here lies the challenge.\u00a0I am at that point in life where I have to start earning for myself. Being the way I am and what I love to do, writing is the most available thing for me to earn some pennies. Of course by available I mean things crazy enough for me to venture with limited experience and skills and won\u0027t chew and then spit me out badly. Plus, did I tell you I really like writing? And while I\u0027m working towards being a novelist and hopeful publication in the next year or two I still have responsibility to carry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in\u003c/strong\u003e; giving me another opportunity to get extra money. With its way of operation, the website provides me a chance to not only get paid for my shorter works but also build bigger audience. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is also my quest in forming my mercenary army, The Insaners!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m gonna post sci-fi and fantasy flash fictions, short stories,and chapters from a fantasy novella on weekly basis. You can \u003cstrong\u003echoose which tier you want to pledge and will be charged per creation, of course Patreon allows you to change the tier or even stop pledging at anytime, so no pressure\u003c/strong\u003e. And as the support gets bigger and my goals get fulfilled little by little I will be able to offer more pieces more frequently, like twice or thrice a week. As for the rewards, I have listed every tier with the rewards on the page as well. In short, what you will get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$1 you will get access to the stories here on Patreon.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$2 you will get reward from $1 plus my novella available for download.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$3 you will get rewards from $2 plus a thank you letter from a character.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$5 you will get rewards from $3 plus drafts of a sci-fi book I\u0027m writing or drafts from other novellas AND concept ideas of the stories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdditionally, this extra tier will only come out every 4 months. It\u0027s a bit of surprise so let\u0027s just wait.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am, asking for your support and pledge for this journey. Here I am, venturing to the great unknown with nothing but the feeling there are some readers insane enough to join me on this adventure. Here I am, looking to inspire you and waiting to be inspired by you. I know you are out there, Insaners, and I invite you to tag along. You\u0027ll help me get through my life and I\u0027ll help you get through yours.\u00a0I hope my stories can ease your hard days and when you read my works, wherever you are or whatever you\u0027re doing or how angry you are at the world, you can smile a little. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet us conquer the world together.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
