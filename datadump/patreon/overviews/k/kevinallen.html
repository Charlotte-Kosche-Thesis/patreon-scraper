    "summary": "Hello everyone! My name is Kevin Allen. I\u0027ve been drawing since I was a kid and there\u0027s nothing in this world I would rather do for a living. I went to college for multimedia design and development and have worked with companies like Anheuser-Busch, Faction Media, and Mile High Graphics as a graphics designer. Even though I can make a living off of those jobs, there\u0027s still something crucial missing in my life - the time to make my stories come to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life, I\u0027ve always had vivid dreams that send me straight to a notebook when I wake up. Those dreams become stories and eventually comics. I know that the ones I develope have a unique charge because when I share them with others verbally, they want to know more and truly get interested. So my goal is to get to the point where I can quit my day job as a designer and become a full-time storyteller through my comics. With your support I\u0027ll be able to produce comics in issues, eventually print them, then bundle them together in a final graphic novel. Once a story is finished, I\u0027ll move on to the next dream turned to story turned to comic. As the arsenal of books grow, I\u0027ll be able to have a presence at comic cons and eventually move into developing a site where I can sell the books and merchandise and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut all of this starts here with me and you. With your help, I\u0027ll be one step closer to realizing a dream I\u0027ve had since I can remember. I\u0027ll be able to write, draw, and share my work while earning a living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading. I hope to meet you soon!\u003cbr\u003e-Kevin Allen"

I absolutely love to draw and craft stories. I love sharing experiences with people and I can do that through comics. \u00a0I\u0027ve always wanted to take my passion for comics and my artwork much more seriously but had to put them on the back burner because of life and bills. A dream come true for me would be working from home building my stories. That\u0027s why I came here. I want to grow a loyal fan base as well as see if there\u0027s any support I can gain while sharing my passion with others. I look forward to the relationships that may grow from here, and that includes talking with you! Hope to hear from you soon. And thank you for visiting :)",
