    "summary": "Hey guys!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kievan Havens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working in the Art support preparation/Art handling business in NYC for the past six years at Simon Liu Inc, as well as freelancing as an Art Conservation Technician.  In the past, I\u0027ve worked as a full-time, in-house illustrator for a comic book studio. Primarily worked on color comps, inking, and storyboards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I explore and share the process of my art and painting techniques here on Patreon, I also want to share some information not learned in art school.  I graduated with a BFA in Illustration, however, from my experience, most of the education revolved around painting techniques and evolving your ideas.  In art, this should be the case. However, there was still never any lessons on how to adequately prepare a painting support and surface.  Most of the prep done through buying cheap premade painting support from a local art store.  These are not always structurally sound approaches and are usually just a quick fix for an in moment solution.\u003cbr\u003eWhat I see in galleries is a mix of good and poorly executed preparational steps.  I\u0027m not talking about the quality of work or the artist\u0027s techniques but the preparation of the support and surface which shows through the painting in its presentation.  In the Fine Art industry, most of the supports, like stretchers and panels are custom made. Companies like the one I worked for have been preparing surfaces for decades with the supports structural integrity as its highest priority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking around the web, I don\u0027t see this topic discussed, and when it is, it\u0027s usually misinformation of the same things picked up in art schools. I want to use this Patreon channel as a way to introduce artists to proper support preparation, using the training and knowledge I\u0027ve obtained for over six years in the industry. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be going through step by step Instructional pictures and videos of the following materials below. All of which I\u0027ll discuss why I\u0027ve used specific materials and the purposes behind these techniques.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePriming cotton canvas.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSizing and priming linen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStretching cotton and linen on squares, circles, and custom shapes (how not to have it sag or wrinkle, especially at the corners).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSizing and stretching watercolor paper.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe idea behind stretcher keys and when to use them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo\u0027s and don\u0027ts for stretchers and panels.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
