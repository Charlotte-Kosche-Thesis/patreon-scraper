I grew up with an unexplored interest in art among other interests, engineering being the other big one. Midway through my engineering program at university I decided to try out art for a semester and immediately fell in love. There was no going back, but the art program at my university was so bad I soon dropped out to study art independently. Like many artists, there have been a lot of ups and downs in my pursuit but I finally feel I\u0027m able to successfully communicate some of the things I find most beautiful. I\u0027m grateful to be here and I want to share the things I notice.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/453/262/large/ky-tran-luminous-growth-in-the-unknow.jpg?1498696517\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Works \u003c/strong\u003eare\u00a0mostly surreal fantasy-scapes and abstract form explorations. They explore the connection between ourselves and our world. To me beauty is about the interaction and dance between the self and other. I hope to create visual art that invokes more than just the visual sense. Often times my thoughts and ideas are accompanied by vivid visual impressions that persist and animate as I navigate a thought. In my abstract form explorations (I call them Thought Forms) I attempt to visually communicate the sensation of a specific thought or a mingling of thoughts. My environments are greatly inspired by fantasy and nature. I try to convey what is familiar to us in the natural world in unfamiliar ways. My hope is that viewers can see nature as if looking at it for the first time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/010/161/932/large/ky-tran-2016-moonflower-for-the-silent-magician-srgb.jpg?1522897798\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons\u003c/strong\u003e will get a personal look into how my ideas come about as well as the technical creation process. My process is more than just about communicating an idea, it is a conversation with the canvas and a way for me to navigate my emotional, intellectual, and philosophical ponderings in a visual way (How artsy-fartsy right? :P). I am constantly exploring new methods and the way I come to my finished works change drastically from one to the next. I hope to share these explorations with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn rare occasion things go smoothly, kind of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/283016229579522049/431646609785356289/for_patreon1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes the idea needs to expand! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/283016229579522049/431671034412793856/Crysalis_of_the_High_Frequency_WIP.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther times it evolves a mind of it\u0027s own, slaps me in the in face, and demands big changes.
