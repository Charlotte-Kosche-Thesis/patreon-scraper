    "summary": "Welcome to our Patreon page! \nPatreon allows viewers to set up recurring contributions to help us\nproduce our series of adventure videos. \nYou decide the amount you want to contribute per video. We post a video,\nyou enjoy it and we get a contribution from you that will makes it possible for\nus to produce videos for everyone to enjoy! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe support of our patrons has helped us shoot produce and share\nvideos from all over Japan and around the world.  YouTube can be unreliable for a few reasons,\nincluding demonetization by bots and returns per views being fractions of a\npenny.  That setup alone would have\nkilled this project long ago. \nFortunately, Patreon has provided a worry-free way for us to keep making\nthe content that you enjoy and we thank everyone who has supported us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it works. \nPatrons are charged for 2 long-form videos per month.  We may post short videos during the month, but\nyou will never be charged for these.  Short\nvideos give us a chance to share experiences that don\u0027t fit into our longer\nvideos and appeal to new viewers who might be turned off by jumping head first\ninto a 45-minute Kyde \u0026amp; Eric video. \nIn short, you will be charged 2 times each month at the level that you\ndecide.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheck out the perks available in the rewards section on this\npage to find the right contribution level for you.  Thanks so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKyde \u0026amp; Eric\u003cbr\u003e"
