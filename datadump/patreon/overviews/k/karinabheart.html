    "summary": "Thank you for checking my Patreon Page and for engaging with my words and works!\u00a0 I especially want to take a moment to offer my gratitude to those of you who jumped at the opportunity to become Patrons of my arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has impacted my writing life profoundly. Knowing there are people who \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0me to write, who look forward to my words, and who are willing to offer their support through a monthly contribution has given me a kind of \u003cem\u003epermission\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to write that I\u0027ve not enjoyed since I was a college student. Honestly, I was a bit nervous at the prospect of being obliged\u00a0to write. I don\u0027t respond well to obligation or imposed deadlines. The Muse arrives in her own time!\u00a0 She and I are both pretty stubborn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027ve come to remember, since beginning to write here, is that the more I \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0write, the more I \u003cem\u003ewant \u003c/em\u003eto write. The more I\u00a0write, the better I get at it. Doing anything more often makes you better at it. So, I\u0027ve also excitedly watched my writing improve.\u00a0 Patreon has offered me practice and development as well as a place to showcase different writing styles, topics and genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027m here for all of those reasons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also here because I\u0027m currently working on several books for publication. Obviously, I can only focus on one big project at a time--that\u0027s how my creative process works. But, I\u0027m collecting thoughts, scribbling notes and allowing inspiration for the others to bubble up.\u00a0 As the sole-parent of two near-adult kids, and as someone who earns a really meager income teaching spiritual paths, Patreon makes it financially feasible for me to dedicate a bit of time for writing.\u00a0 It would \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be possible for me to do so otherwise. Instead, I\u0027d be scrambling to teach more classes to make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of May 1, 2018, Patreon is allowing me to spend some time writing. I am looking forward to it affording me the chance to get away on writing retreat every few months for up to a week at a time. I know lots of writers who can sit down and churn out three pages of writing everyday like clockwork.\u00a0 I can write a two-page essay if I make myself. But, I cannot write those three pages that add up to fifteen, sixty, three hundred, a book.\u00a0 For that, I need time away from my household, my kids, my students and my daily round.\u00a0 For that, I need a simple place to retreat to where they \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0thing on the agenda is writing.\u00a0 My Writing Self is crying for this.\u00a0 The books in the queue are demanding it of me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks ask me for a big surface to spread out sheets of paper and highlighters, post-it notes, open books, ink pens and pads of paper, file folders and cold cups of tea.. Books require that I not stop working to cook dinner, clean up the dishes, empty the litter box or pick up the kid from school. Books demand I have room to pace around and talk to myself without my teenager yelling,\"What did you say?\"\u00a0 Books want draft pages covered in red ink strewn across a floor where the cat doesn\u0027t mistake them for toys. Books want me writing, reading, editing and re-writing for a stretch of at least four days and nights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping for with regards to my Patreon members and current book sales.\u00a0 At this point, I\u0027ve gone on three four-day long retreats.\u00a0 What I\u0027ve found is that two of those days entail travel, un-packing/packing, getting settled in, or ready to depart.\u00a0 One day, I wrestle myself into the writing chair, read my past writing and jot down notes.\u00a0 And, \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0day, I actually get into a deep, juicy, productive writing groove.\u00a0 It\u0027s a lot of time, money and effort for one day of writing!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027m paying attention and asking, \"What \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0work.\"\u00a0 I\u0027d be happy with fewer retreats that last longer.\u00a0 I\u0027d be happiest moving some time and energy consuming items off of my over-booked To-Do List, and creating stretches of time to write from home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy last book was exactly 100 pages and took three years to write. Twice during those three years, I was able to slip away on retreat for four days each time. So, in reality, I wrote it in eight days.\u00a0 I\u0027d like very much for the opportunity to get these next books out faster. They become \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0heavy to carry in my mind while they wait and wait for the chance to be written.\u003cbr\u003eSo, when you\u0027re looking at my financial goals here on Patreon, that\u0027s what you\u0027re seeing.\u00a0 $500 per month will allow me to keep up with writing more frequent essays, but will also allow me to go on retreats where I focus completely on greasing the wheel and then riding it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my first book,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Witchs-Book-Silence-Karina-BlackHeart/dp/0996922520\"\u003eA Witch\u0027s Book of Silence\u003c/a\u003e on Amazon.
