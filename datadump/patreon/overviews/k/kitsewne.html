    "summary": "Hello everyone! Welcome to my ongoing journey into plush making!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took a keen interest in sewing, specifically plush making, back when I was still a small child in early elementary school. My inspiration came not only from a love for stuffed animals, but also a large admiration of my great aunt and great grandmother, both very skilled in sewing and crafts. I remember making all kinds of things with whatever materials I could get my hands on, wanting to someday make quality stuffed animals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took a single class on sewing in highschool, but life had its twist and turns which kept me from returning to the craft for several years. It was in early 2015 when I finally decided to get serious about plush making and my journey into the wonderful world of plushing began.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is my gateway to not only share with others finished products and occasional progress pictures, but also so much more. By pledging a dollar or more, you\u0027ll have access to my activity feed which includes weekday posts regarding WIP photos, thought and creative processes, discoveries, learned tips and tricks, and more that happens behind the scenes with my process in plush making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve experienced a lot of creative growth within the past few years and I have so many ideas to continue that growth, all of which I\u0027d love to share with you through Patreon! I\u0027m about to launch a youtube channel for various little tips, tricks, and mini-tutorials, involving plush making and sewing in general, in hopes of helping and inspiring others who are interested in becoming involved with plush making. I also have goals to start making patterns to share with the world sometime within the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many possibilities lie ahead and I\u0027m so excited to share what comes of them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
