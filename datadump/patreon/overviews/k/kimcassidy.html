It\u0027s time we remember that we are all brothers and sisters, remember our divinity, look after ourselves, each other and our Mother, Planet Earth. We all live here with each other in the smallest wrinkle in time, we have to ask ourselves, what will we do with our time here on our beautiful planet? I, for one, want to love, be grateful, heal, teach, forgive, learn, laugh and accept. By being the change I want to see in the world, I hope I can play my part in leaving this world a little bit kinder, wiser and more loving than it was before I got here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eHOW WILL I USE YOUR SUPPORT?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to fund the continuity of my musical life. Funds will mainly go towards recording at this time. I have recently written quite a lot of new material amd I\u0027m very keen to make a new e.p. also funds will be used for getting to and from gigs, equipment (new strings, leads etc) and very importantly, it will help me to support myself and allow me to have more time to write and focus on music, and eventually, it can help me to travel to play music in various places, hopefully meeting you and playing for you. I aim to tour with a collective of musicians called The Lyrical Nomads (please check out their beautiful music) and spread our message. I feature on some of their albums, and will join them onstage for gigs and tours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have plans to write and self publish a book. It will be all about philosophy, spirituality, and psychology. Very much similar to the stuff you may have seen me post on Instagram @sa.ta.na.ma This project may take a few months to put together, and probably won\u0027t be ready for a while.\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, please check out a live Lyrical Nomads show!\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for your time, kindness and support\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Love you\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0950\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKim\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

I perform gigs, festivals, and busk on the streets regularly, and because of my keen interests in world music and spirituality, I am starting to explore sound healing ceremonies.

People inspire me to become the best version of myself I can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my music I hope to provide people with some sort of healing, teaching, or metanoia. The way I see it, is that the human race as a whole has been going through an adolescence the last couple hundred years. We are products of our conditioning, and that can be either the best thing, OR it could be a catastrophic force. And it seems for centuries we\u0027ve been taught from a young age to live in fear of others, to look for happiness or answers externally, to criticise, judge, and to separate ourselves from eachother with imaginary boundaries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strongly believe a shift in our consciousness has arrived.
