Fond as she was of her god, she had no\nintention of meeting him face-to-face any time soon; she put a fair\namount of time and energy into not getting killed.  The fact that he\u2019d come so close got her attention.  And\nhe\u2019d gotten away!  That was nearly unheard of.  Her group didn\u2019t like\nleaving threats alive, as a rule.  When\nthey engaged someone in battle, that someone would not walk away from it. But he did walk away.  And to top it\nall off, to add insult to injury, he\u2019d taunted them as he vanished!  Rubbed their faces in it and tossed her, personally, a condescending \u201cgift\u201d as he left.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nHis laugh still ringing in her ears, the chaos of battle surrounding her, she\u2019d made a promise to herself.  If she\never met that jackass again, she knew \u003cstrong\u003eexactly \u003c/strong\u003ewhat she wanted to do to him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nGet him on the payroll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003eGreetings and salutations! My name is Kristy Griffin Green - depending on what corner of the web you inhabit, you might also know me as Kristycat, Elijah Byron, Teteli, Pisha, or Rory Griffin. I write stories - and they\u0027re pretty good, if I do say so myself! Sometimes people publish them in books, and that\u0027s nice. I write original short fiction, fanfiction/fiction based on roleplaying games, poetry/songs, nonfiction essays (often in the form of rants), and I\u0027m currently working on a novel about two little old ladies on an epic fantasy quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a backlog of several years\u0027 worth of stories and other writings that I am excited to share with the world. Currently I do not have a webcam, but when I do I also hope to include videos: songs (mine and other peoples\u0027), poetry and story readings, live commentary on the hot-button issue of the day, etc. All this and more can be yours if you become a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am 35 years old and a resident of Orlando, FL. I live with my spouse, SpouseMan; my needy, clingy cat; and a small human that I made myself in my belly. My pronouns are kie/kir."
