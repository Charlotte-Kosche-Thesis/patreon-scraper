So now I\u0027ve decided to give writing a shot, as I already know I enjoy it and that I have a certain amount of talent for it.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I don\u0027t have all the free time in the world to deliver content to my readers. This is where patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created a few milestones to see if I can create time for writing and making more content. It is entirely up to you guys, the readers, whether this will be a thing or not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do have a book in the works right now, and plan on a total of four books. These are the starters for different stories to see if anyone is interested in what I write."
