By becoming my patron you can allow me to continue to make content, livestream and live life to the fullest while doing the things I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have made my patron\u0027s pledges \u003cstrong\u003eprivate\u003c/strong\u003e meaning strangers will not see how much you pledge. I feel that this privacy is important to me so there is a good chance its important to many of you too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.kimberlyann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/patreon_art_preview.png\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.kimberlyann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/patreon_art_preview.png\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you you probably know I create mixed content based entirely on my own life and interests - it would probably be better to split it into multiple channels and profiles but \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elife is too short\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003etime is too precious\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! So I make videos about \n\u003cstrong\u003ecancer, life, my family, art, design and whatever randomly interests me\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate about sharing my life with cancer so that others can be informed, comforted, inspired, have someone to identify with and to satisfy the curiosity of the interested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also passionate about using art as therapy - looking after our mental well-being when the fates seem stacked against us and finding joy in creativity, colour, form, learning new skills and connecting with others through this common love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can see my videos on my YouTube channel:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/kimberlyanndebling\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/kimberlyanndebling\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd my personal website, with loads of info and links to all sorts is \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.kimberlyann.co.uk\"\u003ehttp://www.kimberlyann.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/kimberlyanndebling\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.kimberlyann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/patreon_videos_preview.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI really hope this stuff interests you too, so I\u2019ve put together some patron tiers to whet your apetite for rewards.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy me providing rewards this turns into a wonderful patronage rather than me being a charity case!! And I hope that I can brighten your day when your rewards come through. I\u0027m going to try my best to make sure you get value for money whatever tier you join me at.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTOP TIP:\u003c/strong\u003e If you ever fancy trying a higher tier you can \u0027level up\u0027 for just one month then switch back down to a lower tier. Perhaps you fancy a parcel in the post or want to see what sort of contents you get before committing to more months - thats totally cool.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo please have a look at the 6 tiers I\u2019ve created - bear in mind that tiers 4 and above are limited so that I know I\u2019ll have the time to devote to them. Also note that tiers 4 and 5 are the same other than whether you live in the UK or internationally - the only difference is the cost so I can cover the extra postage.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
