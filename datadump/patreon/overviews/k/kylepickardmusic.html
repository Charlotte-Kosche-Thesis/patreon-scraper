     "about": "Kyle recently completed his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music \u0026amp; Sound Recording with University of New Haven and is currently living in Hartford, Connecticut after studying at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, TN. Kyle has been honored with multiple musical awards and honors such as performing in the URI \u0026amp; UMASS Honor Bands as lead chair of the 2nd flutes and at the RIMEA Honors Festival. His original sound comes from fusing supportive acoustic guitar rhythms with complex flute melodies, which can be seen on his many YouTube videos featuring covers \u0026amp; original songs. He consistently creates high-quality covers for YouTube and shares his craft with the world.\u003cbr\u003eKyle grew up in the small town of Scituate, Rhode Island. There he began playing the flute at the young age of ten. A few years later, he bought an old, used Ibanez electric guitar with all the money in his bank account and practiced it religiously. He joined the school jazz band after playing guitar for only six months. As his acting career became intertwined with his music, Kyle became the lead guitarist and flautist for the musical \"Footloose\" with Swamp Meadow Community Theater in Foster, Rhode Island. After this, he picked up the piano and took vocal lessons. As he works toward a thriving career in the audio industry, he maintains the idea that happiness should be a number one priority in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
