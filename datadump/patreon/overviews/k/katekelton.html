     "about": "Born in Bamberg, Germany after her parents escaped Czechoslovakia, Kate Kelton spent her early years in a VW bus traveling Europe with her artist mother. Settling in Toronto, Canada at age seven, she attended the Etobicoke School of the Arts as a Visual Arts Major, and received a Bachelor of Applied Arts in Film from Ryerson University.  Kelton has had two successful solo shows at LA\u2019s Gabba Gallery, and she has also shown her work at Art On Scene in Beverly Hills; La Luz de Jesus and Durden \u0026amp; Ray in Los Angeles; New Walk Museum \u0026amp; Art Gallery in the UK; Gallery 1988 in New York, Venice and West Hollywood; Galerie F in Chicago; Lawless Concept Gallery in Montreal; and The Sony Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto, Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApotheosis through reclaimed, reapplied Art Nouveau: Who says we aren\u2019t gods? Like a dj sampling the Detroit sound, mixing it into an updated groove, Kelton samples her own lineage, her DNA, and transforms a historical body of work, itself a thing of lasting beauty, into a message for today. Artists, armed in the garb of the ages, eyes open and taking in the new world, are new gods, measuring out their judgement and craft upon you, the viewer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGranite is exchanged for graphite, plaster for paint. Ancient and distant godlike beings, surveying a dying empire, trade places with the fresh blood of the art world. The work presents a tactility against the digitized space, and represents a taking, an acquisition of power back from the tastemakers. Here, the mantle of the artist is above brand influencer, above internet commentator, above mere marketability. In their gaze is a warning, \u201cArt is immortal. Come for me, why don\u2019t you?\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Art Nouveau and Abstract Expressionism collided on the highway, and you drew a chalk outline of their corpse?
