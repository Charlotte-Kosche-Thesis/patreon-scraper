    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSubversive, Fun, Feminist Stuff by Kristina Wong\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aesthetic is quirky, crafty, and subversively playful.  I make the social commentary that nobody realizes they are swallowing.  My most complex work are the theater shows I execute for 85 minutes for live theater audiences.  My short videos and clickbait essays online are the \u201cfluff\u201d that helps my audiences find me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s the Deal\u003c/strong\u003e:  For the last 15 years I\u2019ve managed to string a surprisingly successful career together as a live touring performance artist, writer and alt comedian. It has been as grueling as it\u2019s been enthralling.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have come close to quitting so many times. But I didn\u2019t because \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m a cockroach.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat has saved my ability to make a living in the seemingly archaic field of live art is the same behemoth that challenges it-- the internet. \u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019ve put out web videos and essays in the last few years that have increased the visibility of my message and have grown the demand for my theater shows.  While I\u2019ve made some money in the TV and Film world, the bulk of my income still comes from touring live theater work and guest speaking at venues around the country. That money I\u2019ve saved up has been reinvested in the making of videos, essays, and online shenanigans that most of my global followers know me by.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u2019ll always make theater, I\u2019m now trying to flip my financing equation and make enough video and film work to underwrite my ability to do theater-- not the other way around.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve done most of my videos by calling in a lot of favors from my friends in the industry who have graciously worked for next to nothing or completely free.  I\u2019ve turned my home inside out for shoots, I have sewed sets and props with my bare hands.  I have shaken down friends and all available connects to shoot at locations for free or cheap.  This is getting more and more difficult to work on this goodwill because artists (just like everyone else) need to make ends meet.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make creative work until I drop dead, but unfortunately, \u003cstrong\u003eit\u2019s running on empty that will kill me first.  \u003c/strong\u003eThis is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis year I have a goal of releasing 12-20 well-produced web videos, podcasts, and online shenanigans with awesome content\u003c/strong\u003e.  This means, at least one web series (Six Episodes) and a few fun bonus videos on the side, along with other internet subversions.  I\u2019ve already shot six episodes of a web series that will be released soon...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m interested in making the stuff you aren\u2019t seeing on television yet-- humor that highlights marginalized voices, that takes a nod to my kooky weirdo performance art roots, and blows your brains out with laughter.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will NOT go in my pocket,\u003c/strong\u003e it will go towards covering production expenses-- equipment and studio rentals, editors, camera people, producers, and other super talented people who have been working for peanuts to see my vision through.  Being able to pay people (even at their bottom line \u201cfriend rate\u201d) ensures that projects will be churned out quickly and at the quality I want.  \u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line cash cost to produce my past short films has been approximately $500-$2500\u003c/strong\u003e to cover editors, camera people, make-up artists, craft services, parking and rentals. Everything else has been subsidized by the sweat equity of my amazing friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaking a cue from my previous track record with arts grants, I\u2019m using the \u201cearned income\u201d model of investing  Patreon money.  So rather than use your money to pay my bills, I\u2019ll use your money to make videos and will pay myself if the videos get licensed or screened, or lead to paid work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you give nothing or something, everything I make online will always be available for anybody for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestions/ Answers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I just give you a ONE TIME contribution outside this site?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes!  I have set up \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026amp;hosted_button_id=62YN79JYPTKJ2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e for such a purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo I\u2019m pledging you X amount per thing, what if you make so many things and it breaks my bank?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can set a monthly cap when you pledge, so that you never spend more than whatever amount you set per month.  In all, I intend at maximum to release 20 videos per year, and a minimum of 12.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou say you aren\u2019t going to pay yourself with any Patreon money.  How are YOU going to pay your bills because \u201cexposure\u201d doesn\u2019t pay the bills!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for thinking of me and my survival!  Ideally, the web stuff will do so well that the demand for my touring and speaking engagements will increase, and that is how I will pay my bills because it\u2019s already sorta how I\u2019ve paid the bills!  So as long as I have a happy healthy Patreon \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if you get so much in Patreon Pledges that you have no choice but to pay yourself?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, there are Patreon all-stars like Amanda Palmer that I dream of emulating ($30K pledged per thing she makes!), but in the event that this does so well we have an excess of money after paying for production, we will roll over the money to support larger projects in the hopper like a concert film recording of my current show \u201cThe Wong Street Journal\u201d and costs to archive my performance work for a new generation of web viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not just make money doing Film and TV instead of live engagements?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat would seem logical wouldn\u2019t it?  I made several attempts in my live theater career to quit altogether and make all that money in film/TV... it\u2019s not as easy a transition as it seems.  And that film and TV money is a lot trickier than you think.  I love live theater, but I also know that I cannot do live shows at this pace for the next ten years. And your support in this endeavor is part of my career transition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou know I\u2019m a fan but if I don\u2019t give you anything, will we still be friends?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course! I feel pretty weird about this \u201casking people to be my patron\u201d shit myself which is why I\u2019ve already decided that none of your money is going into my pocket.  I have many artist friends and friends with families that are already stretched past their means.  But getting your love on social media is always appreciated."
