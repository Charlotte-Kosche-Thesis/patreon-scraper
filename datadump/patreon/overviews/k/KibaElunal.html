    "summary": "Hello everyone! Many of my readers have suggested that I start my own Patreon, as I\u0027ve lately been struggling with some financial issues. Rest assured, I wish to keep creating fan fiction, as well as my own original content. As much as I\u0027d love for it to be a full time gig, I\u0027m afraid that I have to also work in addition to my writing. Lately, the school has been piling up on my workload, I\u0027ve enrolled in College classes (where I\u0027ll be for the foreseeable future), and soon, two of the three teachers at my school will go on maternity leave, requiring me to step in as a teacher. Normally, I\u0027ve been able to write through out the day as a tutor, but with my new position I fear I\u0027ll lose a lot of my valuable writing time. However, with your support I\u0027ll be able to turn down additional tasks in order to make ends meet and use that free time for writing instead. You may notice that I\u0027ve made my Patreon a monthly subscription. I did this because I don\u0027t want your bank accounts being drained quickly through the amount of chapters I create. Let\u0027s say you donate five dollars a chapter. On average, I release about 10 chapters a week, spread out over different stories. That means every week, you\u0027d be forking over fifty dollars. Four weeks in a month means that you\u0027d be giving me 200 dollars a month if you were paying per chapter. While I wouldn\u0027t mind getting such a gratuitous amount of money, I know that it would be unfair to you, my readers and friends. My writing, thanks to your funding, will not only cover my Fan Fiction, but also original novels and series that I\u0027ve been working on, as well as rewriting older works in order to make it more entertaining for you guys. I greatly appreciate all of your support. Every dollar helps, so even if it\u0027s just a little, it can make a large difference. I wish you the best of luck in life and literature. -Kiba"

     "about": "Joshua \"Kiba Elunal\" Roberts is an author and teacher. He presently works at Focus Academy as a private tutor in math, science, history, and english. His first successful fanfiction was A Boy and His Fox, which led to a boom in his passion for writing which has only escalated since then. Presently he has two complete original novels: Trinity Wars and Warren High, both of which are planned to be series. Right now, he is also going to University in hopes of obtaining a Master\u0027s Degree with which he can become a University Professor or (if successful) a full-time writer. He enjoys playing League of Legends and Dungeons and Dragons in his spare time. He specializes in writing romance and fantasy, but has started attempting to branch out. He loves talking to his readers, so feel free to send him a message.",
