    "summary": "I began my professional life as a theatrical designer, Lighting, then Scenery, and finally adding Projection design. I spent almost three decades working in theaters big and small, mostly in the Washington, DC area but also in NY and regionally, even as far away as Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska. My work received critical acclaim and garnered a number of award nominations, including three Helen Hayes Award nominations here in Washington, DC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut over the years, as my artistic eye developed, I became frustrated with the number of steps one had to go through onstage in order to get to the most dramatic moments of the play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat had always attracted me to theatrical design was using the visual elements to help tell the story. This use of visual story telling was also why I was interested in history painting, particularly from the Italian Renaissance. Here was painting as an illustration of tales that those who were viewing already knew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me the most striking thing about Michelangelo\u0027s \"David\" or Da Vinci\u0027s \"The Last Supper\" is not just the composition or the craftsmanship of each, but is instead the moment in the story that each artist chose to capture. Da Vinci\u0027s \"The Last Supper\" is the first time in Western art that the artist has depicted the moment just after Jesus has said \"One of you will betray me\", which is certainly the most compelling moment in the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I began to examine the stories that were part of our cultural identity. The tales we knew the idea of even if we had never read the book or play, and started to imagine the couple of moments from each which encapsulated the themes of a given work. Lear, naked, screaming at the storm. Hamlet, dying from a poisoned sword, surrounded by the bodies of his friends and family. Ahab, wrapped in a deadly embrace with the white whale.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the ideas I have been exploring, while trying to get my technical skill as a painter up to the level of my minds eye.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been incredibly lucky to have friends and family who have been unbelievably supportive of this shift in my life. I hope that those reading this will also find these ideas intriguing and choose to support this development."
