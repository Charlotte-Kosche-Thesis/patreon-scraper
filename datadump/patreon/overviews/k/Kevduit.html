I mean, I create content for fun, to help people, to bring joy, put a smile on people\u0027s faces, maybe a cringe here or there. I enjoy what I do. Having an extra dollar here or there helps out with bills, food, that kind of stuff. I HATE it when YouTubers are like: \"I NEED TO RAISE THIS MONEY TO MAKE VIDEOS AND LIVE!!!\" yeah, screw those guys. If that\u0027s their encouragement for making content, they need to find a job with definite hours. Regardless of the money I make, I will always put my 100% into the content I create, because to entertain my audience, to bring a few minutes of joy in their lives, that\u0027s what this is about for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat can I expect from Kevduit?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eWell, I make lots of Elder Scrolls Online stuff, pretty much my third favorite game of all time (First place goes to Oblivion, second to Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker). I make humorous stuff that ends up in people thinking I\u0027m an idiot when I actually know how things work. I do little story driven videos as well, for example,\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I45O9i1V6k\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHIS VIDEO RIGHT HERE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and get lots of other YouTubers and Streamers to help out with them.

I try to hit as MANY conventions (that are gaming revolved, don\u0027t get too excited you comic nerds) that include: PAX, E3, TwitchCon, and other events that I\u0027m invited to or just feel like I need to have a poorly planned trip that results in me paying WAY TOO MUCH for that dang taxi ride to the airport... never forget June 13th, 2016...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut yeah, I attend those things, so if you\u0027re wanting to meet up, supporting me is a very nice way of helping me go meet you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eAbout Kevin (For Real tho):\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI was born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and lived there for 4 years before moving to Alberta, Canada, in which I lived THERE for 9 years (give or take), and headed off to British Columbia, Canada, which is where I now reside. I grew up in a very loving and close family, yet I\u0027ve always struggled with a lack of self-importance, so I kinda wasted 17 years of my life FEELING like I had a crappy life, when (in reality) I was living a dream. My dad sat me down at age 1 or 2 in order to show me how to play games on the computer like \"Duke Nukem 2\" or \"Commander Keen.\" I absolutely loved it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life, I began to expand my hobbies, as I felt as though my worthlessness needed to be filled with possessions. I picked up SO many consoles, Nintendo, Xbox, Playstation, all that stuff, and slowly transitioned into PC. When I was in grade 7 I bought computer parts to build my first PC JUST for Minecraft. On top of Gaming, Dirt Biking and Airsoft were my LIFE. I loved going out with friends on the weekend to adventure around the area I lived on dirt bikes, riding all the ditches and back alley\u0027s i could find.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrade 9 struck, and I found out we were moving... again. I was devastated, and fell to my lowest point that I\u0027ve EVER been at, but it was in this time that I also began pursuing satisfaction in encouraging others through the making of YouTube videos. I loved guys like Tobuscus, thinking about how amazing it would be to bring smiles to the faces of all those who felt as low as I did, even just for those moments of joy would my work be worth doing. And thus, Kevin sat down to make a YouTube channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eunlike most YouTuber names, the name \"Kevduit\" didn\u0027t just pop out of no where, it took a LOT of thought and time, I needed something unique, yet also meaningful, that when I look at my channel, I would remember something important that it stands for. In my time of lack of self-worth, I found a song by the band, \"Newsboys,\" that spoke about how we are simply conduit\u0027s, waiting to be flipped on, to be a light in the darkness REGARDLESS of who we are, we can still be the light that shines bright in that dark room. That song helped me come into a mindset of self-WORTH. It helped me realize that a little conduit, something so small, a backstage thing, can be the cause of light in an entire room. To me, Kevduit isn\u0027t just a fun play on words with the name, \"Kevin,\" it stands for EVERYTHING I set out to do. YouTube is a dark place, full of lies, cheating, greed, anger, discouragement, pride... and to try and be ONE little light, amongst the thick darkness, that is what I strive to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy gaming, dirt biking, airsofting, and working on cars. Editing videos is hands down one of my favorite things to do. I\u0027m 19 years old, turning 20 this year. I\u0027m roughly 6 feet tall, have very brown eyes and thick brown hair. I dunno what else to say here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
