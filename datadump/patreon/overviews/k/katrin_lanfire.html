     "about": "Hello, I`m Katrin Lanfire, alternative model, designer of gothic accessories and headdresses, and aspiring photographer (retoucher).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, in a poor country, which is not suitable for comfortable life and especially not for being an artist. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, I was artistic since my childhood, a classical baby bat in love with books of E.A. Poe, tales of witches and vampires and medieval engraves. \u003cbr\u003eDuring my schooltime I never found a real connection to my classmates, so I had a lot of free time for dreaming and learning various interesting things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was teenager, I couldn`t find any clothes, which would fit to my \"dark style\" in my country, so I started creating them by myself. \u003cbr\u003eAlso I began to study painting and engraving and even had 2 personal exhibitions. \u003cbr\u003eGoing further in this direction opened my artistic horizons more than I could ever imagine, especially because of some incredibly talented people, which were close too me. \u003cbr\u003eAfter some time I found myself as a model in some projects and designer of accessories for myself and friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first time my world was completely changed in 2013, when I visited Wave Gothic Treffen in Leipzig and realized, how many people around the world are interested in my creations and even know some of my photos! It was priceless!\u003cbr\u003eThe year after, me and my dear Ukrainian friend Alexey founded the brand \"MyWitchery\". \u003cbr\u003eMyWitchery is all about handmade gothic and witchy headdresses and accessories, created with inspiration and love.\u003cbr\u003eDuring this time I also worked on my model portfolio and collaborated with amazing photographers and designers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life was changed completely once more in the year 2017, when I moved to Germany and now I have to start everything over again: finding and buying new materials for the headpieces, travelling from time to time for working with great photographers (I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere) and even start to buy equipment for a home photo studio (and learning everything about photography as well).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to grow up in every of my fields of art and show to people, how varios, inspiring and creative the dark side of beauty can be.\u003cbr\u003eFor this I need quality supplies, from lenses for my camera (now I have only one) to cosmetic and wigs. Also I plan to make more beautiful tattoos and participate some cool projects around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately these things aren`t cheap and I am not in a position where I can afford all these by myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I decided to join Patreon - any amount could help me a lot to acchieve those goals and I\u0027ll be very grateful for every support you can give me, in order to make it reality.\u003cbr\u003eYou can also have a look at my shop and support me with a purchase: \u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FMyWitchery\u0026amp;h=ATPN6fRCsA-Ivb_T5486RfqnmNbgbo4fEX2eUPEKBh2X05lG3IjIGl-KGPNvPing9-IR56MYOY8hB0nlP511rZ7ZcAeBX80dARAL4cGVz9lr4pkQsZc2sCxizsFeyDlsxuFB4lscJpAbeAKWr-Xh8ugoQf3rwQ\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MyWitchery\u003c/a\u003e.",
