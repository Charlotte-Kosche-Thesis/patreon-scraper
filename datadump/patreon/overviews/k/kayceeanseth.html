    "summary": "I take fashion and home decor glossy magazines, full of images of pretty emaciated ladies and goods I can\u0027t afford, and in turn cut them down and reassemble them into large scale collages that describe a world I would rather play in, one of myth and archetype, of joy and story, of magic and enchantment. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe old fairytales have it right.  They talk about classism, violence, anger; but with whimsical characters.  I\u2019m not so much putting human conditions on the animals, as I am using them as stand ins for humans.  I can\u2019t effectively collage a portrait of a refugee, but I can create a portrait of a lowly pigeon. I can\u2019t tell a story about how complicated the relationship is between opposing dogmas, but I can create a curious relationship between what is typically known as predator and prey.  With a luscious palette, with the gold leaf, with the approachable animals; maybe I can succeed in creating a space of thoughtfulness: a place that allows for contemplating and valuing relationships that are overlooked.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI desire to make a living as a creator, but at the same time I want to balance being a maker and seller of things I make with being a gifter of things I make. This Patreon Campaign allows for there to be a balance between the two. Your support allows me to have a tiny bit of stability (both financially and moral supportively). Your support will also allow me to gift my artwork to someone who really connects with it, in situations where dollars are out of the equation. So far, I have been able to gift two pieces of artwork, a truly loving experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my Patreon Campaign, you are not only valuing my creative process, but you are becoming a part of it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
