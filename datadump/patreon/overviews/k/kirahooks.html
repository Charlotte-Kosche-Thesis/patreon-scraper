I was born in Houston, TX and grew up in The Netherlands, Nigeria, Scotland, and China. College brought me back to the US (LA College Of Music - Pasadena, CA), where I would study music with professionals that continue to thrive in the industry. Then, I moved to Nashville to be surrounded by the master songbirds - in hopes that it would someday rub off on me through lots of listening, writing, and editing. Lately, I\u2019ve been working on a pop record and have been doing a lot of house concerts/touring on the eastern side and middle of the US.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon? What\u0027s in it for you and me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a beautiful platform that allows me to express my inner child and claim my responsibility as an adult at the same time. Through Patreon, you can subscribe to me for as little as one dollar a month, and in return get exclusive access to my little crazy world and material that others won\u2019t get - sometimes WAY in advance! It\u2019s similar to Kickstarter, but instead of pushing a one-time project, you\u2019re pledging a much smaller amount per month (or for every video posted for other artists). The more patrons, the more I\u2019m able to build my career as an independent artist, build the team that I\u2019m looking for, and attain better resources for the projects I wish to pursue. With your patronage, I promise to work hard and do my best to make my content worth your time with the cash YOU worked hard to earn. You can increase/decrease/cancel your pledge at anytime. Rewards and patron-only streams will be exclusive to patrons, while SOME videos posted on youtube will eventually go public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the rewards included - depending on pledge:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Executive producer credit\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 My favorite plant based recipes - crafted by yours truly\u003cbr\u003e\u2022    Video tutorials where I teach you my songs\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch/Dinner/Coffee Date\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Handwritten letters, postcards\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Custom songs\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Private House Concert\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Custom Covers\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 The ability to tell me what to do next ;) - but nothing weird af plz :I!\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 MP3 downloads with commentary tracks\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Early access to content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I post videos and when will I start doing so?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwice a week on Mondays and Fridays, starting Monday Oct. 9th, 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happened to all the videos that were on your youtube page already?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThey\u2019re coming back, I promise.

Her brand new album, \u0027Elephant Heart\u0027, features a \ncollection of 12 songs that fall somewhere in between the warmth of \nsoul, the melodies of pop and the explosive grooves of Latin/Funk music.\u003cbr\u003e\n  The album is colorful and kaleidoscopic, featuring the performances\n of an ensemble of proficient and expressive musicians whose sound is a \ngreat complement to Kira\u0027s vibrant and heartfelt vocals.\u003cbr\u003e\n  This self-proclaimed \u201cold soul\u201d managed to create a sound that \ndefies genre limitations, borrowing inspiration from many different eras\n and performers the likes of Billie Holiday, The Andrew Sisters, Ray \nCharles and Cole Porter, just to name a few. Kira is an eclectic \nperformer and talented songwriter who refuses to get stuck in a box, \nwhile managing to keep her music accessible and easy to relate to.",
