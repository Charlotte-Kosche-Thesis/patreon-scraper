I want you to see me photographing the things that are truly important to me. That often means that I will be photographing things that are not commercially lucrative. So, for me to continue to do this important work I need your support. Join me in this adventure and experience what my life and photography are all about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my projects is photographing the dogs and cats at our local animal shelter. I give my photographs to the shelter so they can use them on their website and in social media to promote the adoption of the animals there. I also post about them on my social media and websites to help raise awareness of the animals available for adoption.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have been working with out local running club to photograph their races and free youth events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also enjoy writing about a variety of topics that interest me."
