    "summary": "Greetings. My name is Kwakerjak\u2014well, not really, but if you\u2019re here, that\u2019s probably the name you know me by. I\u2019ve been writing fanfiction for about ten years now, but for the last three years or so, I\u2019ve been focused almost exclusively on \u003cem\u003eMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\u003c/em\u003e. Several of my stories have attained a modest amount of attention, but again, the mere fact that you\u2019re here means that you probably already knew that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly love writing: coming up with ideas, expanding them as I commit them to paper (or more accurately, an electronic document), and sharing them with the world. It\u2019s very rewarding, but the tricky bit is staying motivated long enough to get to those rewards. In the past, I\u2019ve relied on such tried and true methods as, to cite just one example, \u201can irrational fear of my own premature death\u201d to keep me from ignoring my muse (and no, I\u2019m not kidding about that). However, after some consideration, I find myself wondering whether good ol\u2019 fashioned \u201cmoney\u201d might not be more effective at focusing my energies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, I have set up this Patreon to fund the metaphorical carrot-on-a-stick. If you choose to contribute, you will be giving me a means to keep myself motivated that does not rely on fear or panic, which I am assuming will be better for my mental health in the long run. If you\u2019d rather not, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll still have the same access to all of my work that everyone else has.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this is primarily a carrot fund, I\u2019ve set it up in order to best maximize my productivity, which is why I\u2019m taking payments by chapter, rather than monthly, as that would only encourage me to procrastinate after the first time I posted something in any given month. For the purposes of this Patreon, a \u201cchapter\u201d refers to a chunk of narrative text that is at least 4,000 words in length. Why that number? Because I normally aim for a minimum of 5,000 words in a chapter, but I also want to give myself some leeway to avoid needlessly padding my writing with useless words simply to justify charging my patrons. Anything less than that, I think, can be reasonably called a \u201cshort chapter,\u201d and would either be a freebie, or, in the event that I\u2019m writing something with multiple short chapters in a row, I may lump two or more chapters together before taking payments for them. Needless to say, there will be no premium for longer chapters; that is, a 10,000 word chapter is still just one chapter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Here I should briefly digress to point out that I have absolutely no intention of using this Patreon in connection with any original fiction I may write; I simply do not feel comfortable asking people to give me money when I intend to charge everyone for the end product.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnder normal circumstances, I only post one or two chapters in a month; the only exceptions I\u2019m aware of involve those \u201cshort chapters\u201d I was referring to earlier. If you\u2019re worried, remember that Patreon allows you to put a cap on the total amount of money you give away each month. I certainly don\u2019t want any of my readers to put themselves in financial trouble over me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what the money received would be spent on, for the most part, it will go towards the sorts of things I like to reward myself with whenever I accomplish a goal: going to see a movie; eating a meal at a restaurant instead of making it myself; purchasing books/music/video games, and all the other little things that make life more enjoyable, though that could of course change in the event of some unpredictable shift in my financial situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, whether you decide to support me or not, I hope to keep you entertained for a long time to come."
