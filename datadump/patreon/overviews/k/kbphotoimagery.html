    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFirst things first I would like to say thank you to all for taking the time to look at my page. Any and all support is hugely appreciated! The more you donate the more perks you receive, see the sidebar for perk details.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to be completely honest I\u0027m not very good at self promotion.. I created this page after several friends introduced me to Patreon saying it was a secure way to share the work I don\u0027t post anywhere else. I\u0027ll be straight forward - I\u0027m stubborn, easily distracted, typically have five to ten projects going on at once, and I\u0027m constantly working on something new. I primarily shoot models and automobiles/motorcycles so if you like either or both than you\u0027ll likely enjoy my work. I try my best to keep things different and interesting so I like to play with new ideas and concepts from my See-Through photos to shooting using alternative lighting like candles and light bars however I favor natural light and shooting outdoors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try my best to update as much as possible but at times it\u0027s difficult due to work load however I will update as much and as frequently as I can, but with that being said I also don\u0027t just post 15-20 photos per set, I tend to throw out an overload of photos and add complete sets including goofing around and behind the scenes photos all together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to start a studio of my own and expand my knowledge and skill set in my craft. Thank you for your time and best wishes to all.\u003cbr\u003e"
