I absolutely always knew that no matter what I ended up doing, I wanted to give back, in a way, and contribute to someone, somewhere feeling the way that getting lost in a book made me feel. When I was 16, I had a vague idea for a story I wanted to tell. At 22, I\u0027m still working on that same story, and I have faith that it could be a worthy contribution to the genre I have never stopped adoring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is hard for me at times for a lot of reasons. I have major depression as well as debilitating anxiety on top of a few other things and it makes it hard to clear my mind and write comfortably without worrying or having to stop because my motivation is at a standstill. Even the tiniest donation means there\u0027s a couple dollars I don\u0027t have to worry about now to cover my costs of living and will ultimately go towards getting my books published and out there."
