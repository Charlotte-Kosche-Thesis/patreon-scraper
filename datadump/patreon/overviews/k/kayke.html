I\u0027ve been making comics since I was in college and last year I was lucky enough to start getting opportunities to write and illustrate comics on a bigger scale and as my main source of income, which has been really rad! ... and kind of stressful... but mostly rad!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently neck deep in working on two graphic novels. Both \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eClick\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and the yet-to-be-named sequel follow Olive, an outgoing and funny 10-year-old, as she attempts to navigate the complex pre-teen social structure and maintain her friendships while staying true to herself and not losing sight of her varied interests and passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a68d79fcf81e08edcd2addc/5a79f51f085229ff171f8600/5a79f836e2c48358c68f9d1e/1517943066820/clickpatreon.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also the creator of the webcomic\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eCreep \u003c/strong\u003ewhich tells the tale of\u00a0Riley, a teen who received strange powers after a fruit punch related accident and is peer pressured into using them to fight crime by his best friend... even though he would much rather spend his time playing music with his band and fawning over his crush. This comic is free to read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapas.io/series/Creep\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon Tapastic\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a68d79fcf81e08edcd2addc/t/5a6aba3df9619a74ceb0c732/1516975040773/creeppostcard-sm+copy.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from that I\u0027m also always working on pitches for new comics and even a few mini-comics in my spare time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMaking comics can be sort of expensive. There\u0027s the cost of software, hardware, and art supplies since I do my sketches and inks traditionally. There\u0027s also the costs of traveling to conventions, printing promotional material, and paying for my website. These are all things that are necessary to the creation of my work and for the growth of my brand - which allows me to get my work in the hands of more readers. I exclusively use the money from my Patreon to pay for these art-related expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating to this Patreon you\u0027ll be giving me helping me to keep my business running and affording me more opportunities to work on a variety of projects. In return, I\u0027ll keep you in the loop as to what I\u0027m up to. This will include sneak peeks into the graphic novels I\u0027m currently working on in the form of what I call \u0027Work-in-Progress of the Week\u0027 where once a week I will post my favorite panel that\u0027s currently being sketched, inked, or colored.\u00a0You will also get a look at character designs and concept work for upcoming comics, behind the\u00a0 scenes info, postcards/prints whenever I use Patreon money to make promo material, and a chance at winning Patron-Exclusive giveaway raffles of my books and merch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also just... like... make me happy? Sometimes being a cartoonist can be a solitary job, especially while working on longer projects where I can\u0027t share everything with my readers instantly the way I was used to doing with my webcomic. It means a lot to me that there are people interested in the stories and art I\u0027m creating, so thanks to everyone for your support wether it\u0027s through becoming part of this Patreon or just following my work elsewhere.\u00a0I\u0027m looking forward to using this Patreon to share snippets of my less public projects with interested parties as they\u0027re being created and being able to reward those supporters with secrets and swag!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
