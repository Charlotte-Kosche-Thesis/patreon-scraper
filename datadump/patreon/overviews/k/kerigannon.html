    "summary": "On November 7th, after making complaints about sexism and ableism, I was fired from working as a software engineer at a biomedical research company in Chicago. During my interview, I was told that this position would not be a good fit for someone who is pregnant, about to be pregnant, or has a small child at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter writing an article detailing more of my experiences, I felt supported and heard by my community. To everyone who listened to me, supported me, consoled and reassured me: this book is for you. I want to write a story that will empower people to unpack the dynamics in their interactions and help people heal who have experienced trauma in their families of origin, educational settings, and professional workplaces. After trauma, when people process and share their stories, people have a profound opportunity for growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plans for this book involve carving out time to write, edit, and publish. My hope is that readers will be able to walk away from the book believing that they are enough just as they are, accept their\u00a0upbringing and family of origin for how they shaped them to be who they are today, and feel more comfortable processing their feelings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife is about human connection, and when we love ourselves, we are able to love other people. Let\u0027s be kind to each other because we deserve it.\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m looking to explore how women are shaped by their environments. Specifically, I want to write about how formative childhood experiences and figures, interactions and social dynamics in public schools, and professional environments influence, and even prevent, women\u0027s ability take care of themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to set aside time to write, hire an editor, and publish.\u003cbr\u003e",
