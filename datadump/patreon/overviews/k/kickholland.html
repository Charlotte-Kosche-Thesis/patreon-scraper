The pieces I make are a window into some world that has long since vanished or is just about to invade our own. I have been told my pieces bare certain similarities to the art of the ancient Celts and to the work the Mayans and Incans left behind, this was never by own design, but I feel in good company.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI act in films and plays, I perform my own pieces which wound up being described as improv, stand up comedy, performance art, poetry, physical comedy, etc. etc. Recently after a show a middle aged man approached me and told me that my set had induced a hallucination in him in which he had left his body, left the venue, and wandered down the street where he was confronted by a great deal of floating faces, before snapping back into his body as I was winding things down.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot say this was my explicit goal, but I can say that I am here to disrupt. I was born to explore that fascinating link of the sacred and the profane, and I am looking for a little bit of assistance from you, so that I can continue to put food into my face while I am on this quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like Monty Python\u0027s Flying Circus, Buster Keaton, Luis Bunuel, William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, or Ren and Stimpy; I will not be a waste of your money or your time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for any help you can provide."
