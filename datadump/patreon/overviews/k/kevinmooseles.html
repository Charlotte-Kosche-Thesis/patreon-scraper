    "summary": "Currently I am working on a kick-ass book series that is one part gonzo horror fantasy, one part political fantasy, and one part apocalyptic conspiracy thriller. Very few people beyond my immediate social circle know who I am or what I\u0027m working on, and this Patreon page is one step in a systematic approach to change that. My name is Kevin. I am a black belt video game and pop culture nerd, a horror novelist, a musician, and a recovering introvert. I\u0027ve spent the past four years building my writing career and in all that time I avoided every social media platform available like the plague. It took at least six months of learning the fine art of self-marketing and audience building before I started my Twitter account, just over a month ago. In working through my social anxiety, I am realizing just how silly my avoidance behavior has been. Hindsight is 20-20.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2014 I started to get money for writing. My first article for the Escapist was about how much Fight Club was inspired by the Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails. In fifteen years since the release of the film no one else in the fan community had realized just how many points of comparison existed between the two works. The article took off. Last week I bought the hardcover version of the Fight Club 2 comic series and told the cashier about my article. She was shocked and told me that she\u0027d read it. That made my day. To be honest, I feel invisible sometimes. It can be hard for me to know what kind of impact any of my work has. To have a perfect stranger be familiar with what I\u0027ve done is both strange and wonderful. I want more of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother milestone article explored how much the JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot was really like a remake of A New Hope, in the general Hero\u0027s Journey sense, but most clearly with the planet-destroying super-laser weapon that is used successfully on one character\u0027s home planet mid-film and then destroyed at the end. I wrote that six months before the release of The Force Awakens, which was largely criticized as a remake of A New Hope. So I\u0027m also that guy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a very analytical, fun, thoughtful and precise writing style that was developed at The Escapist. My fiction series is a natural extension of that style. I\u0027m writing a one-of-a-kind zombie trilogy (possible quadrilogy, but no more than that. This story has a specific ending that was in mind before the first page was written). I\u0027ve been writing while working a full-time job, and am working towards the dream of just writing and creating for a living. But I\u0027m not there yet. I am here. And now, so are you. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am active in a number of other social media platforms and will become more active here as the numbers grow. Check out my goals to see what I have planned for the future. Sign up and tell your friends if you like what you see. Thanks for stopping by :)\u003cbr\u003e"
