We bounce back and forth between St. Petersburg and our family land in rural Gulf Hammock, FL that we call \u003cem\u003eThe Floating Woods\u003c/em\u003e. As a native who spent my formative years continually out of doors exploring and observing, I have a deep connection to and love for Florida\u2019s unique wilderness.\u00a0My diverse conceptual practice includes the collection and manipulation of found specimen, sculpture, installation, painting, photography, and occasional performance art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my inspirations and source materials are gathered from extensive\nstalking in and around \u003cem\u003eThe Floating Woods\u003c/em\u003e, as well as from my work\nas a native plants landscape gardener in St. Petersburg. The varied artworks emerge through linking these\nwanderings/dwellings in the field with a similar studio practice, allowing the\nintuitive process of making to guide the direction and meaning of the artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy newest sculptures and paintings are the result of my studio practice evolving and expanding over the past few years. Shifting away from using found specimen as the primary art making materials, I have begun to push toward more intentional manipulation and reproduction of the natural forms and patterns using more traditional sculptural materials. These new creations remain meticulously faithful to the original forms, while simultaneously exploring ecstatic new possibilities through wild exaggerations in scale, composition, and color.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike the naturalists of old who ventured into the unknown, returning with strange curiosities to contemplate and impart, I am a collector\nand composer of common phenomena hidden just beneath the surface of the natural\nenvironment all around us. By presenting and reproducing these findings in beautiful\nand unexpected ways, I seek to open up a dialogue toward new ways of seeing ourselves\nand our collective place in the world, with the hope of encouraging a deeper understanding\nof what it means to be human and to have a more grounded and sustainable connection to\nthe earth we were given\nto live and move and have our being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
