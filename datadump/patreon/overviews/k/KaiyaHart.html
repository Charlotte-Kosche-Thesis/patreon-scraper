With the help of Patreon, I am offering you the chance to get exclusive content and full access to every step of my process as well as getting a say in the directions I take and regular posts about living a happier life!\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I am hoping in the future to start a charity that will help children who lack the funding and support access their artistic talents. To learn more, check out my final goal. Yes, I want to be allowed to write and create many more wonderful books while making the existing ones better. Ultimately, though, I want to give all of this back to the world in a positive way. I appreciate your partnership; together, we can build something truly beautiful!"

     "description": "$3000 a month. This allows me to do some marketing and start paying for a regular, single editor. This also allows me to make bigger donations to the charity National Indigenous Women\u0027s Resource Center.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.niwrc.org/donate-niwrc\"\u003ehttp://www.niwrc.org/donate-niwrc\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you are Indie, you tend to bounce around. There are a lot of great editors, but not all of them are suited to the person using them. Being able to find and keep an editor that suits my style of writing is really important; an editor can be amazing at grammar, but lack the ability to understand my voice. It tends to suck all the soul out of a book and it is definitely not good for me as an author or you as a reader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also begin going to the different cons. We may start out small, a card table in the local gym, but, eventually, I would like to buy a table in Chicago, or maybe even go REALLY big and go to one in New York, where I can talk to others about my writing and the charity I eventually hope to turn my patron dollars to. What this means is I will take a stack of my books - there is usually a particular amount they want you to bring - signed. This helps me gain more readers and really get my work out there. My ultimate, big name conference would be in London, at their giant, yearly book fair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other thing this allows me to do is to find a cover artist. I am not about big names, here. As an Indie, I want to support other Indies. Your pledges will allow me to pay a fair price for an amazing, but untested artist and give them their dream as well. Who knows, we might even find the next Michael Whelan. But, any way you cut it, we are starting to pull other people up as we climb this ladder. If you are into Karma, let me tell you. You\u0027ve got some amazing things coming your way!\u003cbr\u003e",

To do this, I need to be able to pay them for each picture they do and artwork like that takes a lot of time and effort.

In the end, I appreciate every dollar you give me. And I would like to take that money and pour it back into the world in a positive way.

I will still be going to conferences, and this is where we start looking for a way to get my books into regular bookstores. Be it through Ingram Sparks or a hybrid Indie/traditional type deal, I am going to start focusing on getting myself into Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, Books A Million, and any other bookstore that will have me, especially the independents. This is a semi expensive endeavor, but well worth it; now you will be able to go get your own hard copies of my books and I will begin to do some signings. At this point, I will begin to make monthly donations of $500 to the NIWRC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.niwrc.org/donate-niwrc\"\u003ehttp://www.niwrc.org/donate-niwrc\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where we start looking at the charity as the next step, so let me explain to you what that is about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe government seems to be taking more and more away from educational funding for public schools. Particularly in the arts. So I want to create a sort of after school arts club for kids. Tentatively, it is called Creative Club and it would be my intent to see at least one in every town and city in Illinois (then expanding as financially possible into the rest of the US).Once I do the research and figure out base costs for starting, there will likely be some sort of online fundraiser. Maybe an auction for things like a handwritten book (that\u0027s my planned donation) and whatever else we can get other local celebrities to donate. Once the initial money is raised, that is when we\u0027d start opening physical clubs for the kids. We would give them mentors and provide the supplies for their chosen art form. Once a month or so, we could do live chats with any artists willing to get involved. I bet there are plenty of those!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore this, however, I think it is time for me to start stretching out. Now, I already, as of this writing, do some coaching. I don\u0027t teach people how to write, I teach them how to communicate with their muse. Anyone who has ever done something creative and hit a rocky patch knows that it is a nightmare. Everything that used to come so easy is now a monumental struggle. I work hard to help people overcome that and grow into a place where they can face it without fear. Now, at this level of patrons, hopefully gaining a whole lot more through books sales, I am going to host a twice a year, three day workshop. The funds from this workshop will go to cover my expenses for the venue and supplies. The rest will be given to various charities. I will put up a poll for all of you lovely folks and you will get to decide where that money goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, now that we are at this amazing level, we are going to up the number of illustrated special editions of my books to three a year. Also, we are going to start having all sorts of fun things. I am going to host some events for you, my dear patrons, that will truly show you how much I appreciate you. I don\u0027t have a solid plan what these will be, yet, be it a party or a gather of some sort at a con, I don\u0027t know. But this will be my chance to really give something back to you. I am a believer in making memories and we are going to make some amazing ones!",

This does not mean I don\u0027t still need and adore you, though! You guys are just massively beautiful people and I think each and every one of you needs an award.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere actually is a point where I will just happily sit with my books, present and future, accepting the money from my sales, and not need anything more. I may love paying my bills, but I don\u0027t really need to own a basketball team or two yachts (I own two huskies, that is enough to keep anyone busy). I may buy a house, but I do not want to use your money to do it. That will be my reward for a job well done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m not going to continue to give you all the things I\u0027ve been giving for your money (and way, way more) and here\u0027s why. Should we hit this mark of 20,000 dollars a month, I will be taking anything I don\u0027t need (my need, ideally, is 0 dollars of Patron cash) and funneling it into the charity for the kids AND the NIWRC as well as going to meet the people we are helping. Kids should not be limited from becoming artists based on their parent\u0027s bank accounts or status. Or where they live. And, at this level, here is the new thing you are helping support. And, let\u0027s be honest, this is the thing we have probably been talking about endlessly for ages because I am really, really into this idea that we can help the young people overcome the limits that are currently being set for them. Being any sort of artistically driven person is hard enough. To be born without the privileges and the funding of the more well off just makes it that much harder. Success is always going to be a challenge. Why undermine our children before they even have a chance to see what they are really capable of? The other charity I am donating to is the National Indigenous Women\u0027s Resource Center. I am going to dedicate the royalties from Getting Thin, Bone Deep, and Beneath My Skin to continuing support of these women who face a tragically high rate of sexual assault and violence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy this point you probably will be totally tired of hearing me talk about these two issues. But I want to take a minute to say thank you. On behalf of every person who has ever felt the effect of all our donations, I say thank you. For every child kept safe or encouraged to explore their creativity, thank you. You are creating the opportunities we need.",
