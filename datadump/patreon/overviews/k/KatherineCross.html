I\u0027ve been published\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gc-cuny.academia.edu/KatherineCross\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ein peer-reviewed journals\u003c/a\u003e for my work on roleplaying gaming, cultural imagination, and the dynamics of online harassment. In addition, I\u0027ve been published in a number of popular publications which I detail below. I\u0027m also a public speaker who has lectured all over North America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDapper Cultural Criticism? Surely You Jest!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, yes and no. My writing style has always tended towards the (sometimes ostentatiously) well-dressed and formal, and I breathe in thousand word bursts it seems, so it feels rather appropriate! I have written about law, transgender politics, feminism, right-wing extremism, reproductive justice, pop culture, and, of course, video games for a number of websites and publications over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might know me from Feministing,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://feministing.com/author/katherinecross/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhere I wrote a weekly column\u003c/a\u003e, or from Bitch Magazine, where I\u0027ve been\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bitchmagazine.org/article/lets-get-digital-gaming-erotic-roleplaying-rpg-sex\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea frequent contributor\u003c/a\u003e, or from Gamasutra where I keep a (more-or-less) weekly column on all things gamey.\u00a0I\u0027ve also written extensively about video games in both publications, as well as in the gaming press, for Polygon, Kotaku, Paste Magazine, and Offworld.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a somewhat academic style of writing which is useful for exploring topics with depth and nuance but is often ill suited\u00a0to the demanding turnarounds of the 24 hour news/outrage cycle. I tend to sit with things for a while before writing about it, and while I\u0027ve been blessed with indulgent editors in that regard, the demand for impulsiveness and timeliness does see me lose more than a few opportunities to get paid for my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will fund my continued freelance work. It will also allow me to publish more on my own blog and fund cultural commentary there which can\u0027t live anywhere else.

A column about reproductive justice without a videogame angle, for instance, wouldn\u0027t exactly be suited to a game dev magazine.\u00a0Point being, you help buy my creative freedom and my ability to do that much more per week, as well as help me make a regular and predictable sum from my work in a way that I can\u0027t depend on with freelancing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and I might be able to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/01/two-concepts-of-nudity-bayonetta-and-error404.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewrite about sex in videogames\u003c/a\u003e more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does chipping in to my rent do to make all this possible?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, since starting here on Patreon, my writing career has taken me to new heights including Wired, Rolling Stone, Time, The Baffler, and The Verge. The more I write, the more my work gets noticed, the more opportunities I have to publish in previously unreachable publications. Thanks to all of you for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m totally in, what do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a little bit per month helps.
