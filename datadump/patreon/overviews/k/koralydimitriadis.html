The main aim of my art is that I am trying to help people who don\u0027t fit into the mould of society. Being a Patron for me will help me do this.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the author of the poetry book, Love and F**k Poems, the premise is a women fleeing her marriage to find her personal and sexual identity. Many women are raised in communities where they are taught sex is wrong or bad or dirty. These teachings have ramifications on the way we relate in our relationships.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn anthropologist of sorts, I write lots of articles and have been published in many major media publications in Australia. I am hoping to extend that to America this coming year. I am extremely determined and I don\u0027t let hurdles get in my way. I have been pursuing my art for the last eight years and I enjoy it. There is nothing else I would rather be doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more on my art on my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.koralydimitriadis.com\"\u003ewww.koralydimitriadis.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note: if you would like to give a one off payment, you will need to register for monthly payments then cancel after the first month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
