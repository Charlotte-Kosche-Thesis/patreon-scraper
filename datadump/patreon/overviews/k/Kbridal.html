    "summary": "Dearest Patrons,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly want to thank you for your time, your support and for your interests in this crazy dream of mine. I\u0027ve been building my small business over the course of this last year as a brick and mortar located just outside of Milwaukee, Wi. I opened up my first studio boutique to the public in June of 2017. \u003cbr\u003eIn this cozy space, I dream, illustrate, drape, draft and sew all of my own pieces. I am currently in the process of creating my first collection under my own label, and I couldn\u0027t be more thrilled. This has been a long time coming. Lots of blood, sweat and tears are behind each piece, but I know that going into business is what I\u0027m meant to do. I have had a career working amongst the most elite and notable names in New York City. I\u0027ve worked for peanuts along the way, knowing that my time invested in learning the industry and perfecting my techniques was something I couldn\u0027t put a price on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI first started this dream, this notion, \u003cem\u003ethis business \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in a 3\u0027x5\u0027x7\u0027 storage container located in the depths of midtown manhattan. Yea. I did that. I called that place home, I called it shop. It was the hardest chapter of my twenties (and life for that matter), taking those initial steps, and downgrading my livelyhood to this small, hot and claustrophobic square footage. But honestly, I never felt more driven.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFast Forward to today, I sit in a sun-drenched studio overlooking a river and I spend every waking moment hunched over my sewing machine. My collection is nearing completion. I can\u0027t tell you how ready I am to see my gowns hanging on that rack that frames my space.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to get my label circulating amongst the New York Bridal Week shows. I know thats a few years out now, as I\u0027m working the front just to get my \u00a0label started. But with your help, I\u0027ll be able to grow at a manageable pace, purchase machinery and equipment needed for this business and hopefully be able to hire an extra set of hands down the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being a patron of my work. Your efforts and support are much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost Sincerely,\u003cbr\u003eKit Hunzinger\u003cbr\u003eOwner \u0026amp; CEO of Kit Co.\u003cbr\u003ewww.kithunzinger.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u003ch2\u003eTransplanted from New York City, Kristin Hunzinger, most commonly known as \"Kit,\" has spent a lifetime establishing her career within the fashion industry.  Self-taught in sewing by age 8, she continued to push herself with proper studies receiving her BFA from the Savannah College of Art \u0026amp; Design and furthering her expertise in New York City. Working as Designer, conceptual Designer, and sample maker for corporations such as the GAP,  and in- house atelier for a handful of couture designers both LA and NYC -based, creating one-of-a-kind pieces that graced the runways, and turned pages in major fashion editorials.  \u003cbr\u003eAfter a career explored and techniques perfected, Kit made the bold decision to set herself apart and create a label all her own.\u003cbr\u003eWith a focus on womens evening wear, creating gowns for both runways and aisle debuts, she also balances her vision in the world of accessory design. This label that is created and maintained entirely by the hands of Kit here in the USA is admired from clientele throughout the world. Her aesthetic reads sophistication with a balance of adventure and whimsical ambition. \u003cbr\u003e  Be it layers of silk, or handbags made of the finest leather, her hand-crafted quality sets a standard above all else, reading a true testament to the art of couture. \u003cbr\u003eWhen Kit isn\u0027t in her Flagship Studio draping up her latest dream or stitching up a bag of adventure, you can find her biking around town in search of the perfect cafe to lose track of time with her watercolor paintings.\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003e",
