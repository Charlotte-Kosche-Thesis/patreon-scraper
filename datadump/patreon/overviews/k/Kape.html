Currently we are working on 2 projects. The first one is a comic book called \"Lit Birds\" and is inspired from the song with the same name by a well known Romanian Metal/Hardcore/Progressive/Rock band,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/implantpentrurefuztm\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eImplant Pentru Refuz\u003c/a\u003e. All the pages are carefully hand drawn and inked on 300 gr A3 Canson paper, scanned, and digitally colored. The second project is a graphic novel called \"Suferar\". It will have 3 volumes, but there may be more. Compared with \"Lit Birds\", \"Suferar\" is integrally hand drawn, inked and painted on 300 gr A3 paper. Bellow you can read more about each project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLit Birds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe comic book, is made to illustrate in a personal way the mood that both the melody and the lyrics inspire. Besides the making of the comic book, the main purpose of the story is to help create one of the band\u2019s future animated music video (the animation will be made together with Electronic Resistance) The story behind \u201cLit Birds\u201d begins with a small desolated city, floating somewhere in the vastness of the galaxy. The town\u2019s inhabitants have been imprisoned by a group of hateful beings known as \u201cSpecters\u201d. Their numbers grow with each victim they devour or turn into their kind, a soulless and faceless creature blinded forever by the bird cage they carry on their heads. Deep in the non-material dimension, chained to an artificial prison sun, a grieving lit bird dreams of the moment of its liberation. Outside of its world, located at the bottom of the floating city, an old man has had enough of the Specters\u2019 reign and calls for \u201cLit Birds\u201d to put a stop to them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ftsr1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13095796_537579606412861_2152427859432882838_n.jpg?oh=cf257442eb759db8da3704618f7cbfda\u0026amp;oe=5A3EF004\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ftsr1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13103489_541548446015977_744788771378519527_n.png?oh=d06ebb719517d63759033dbed48d27f0\u0026amp;oe=5A52A876\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fomr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/13268481_549169155253906_8929500411097427758_o.jpg?oh=b88e4d394c918014065cf88d1dd4d37a\u0026amp;oe=59E5A345\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eShowcased at Romanian Design Week 2016\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u273d\u273d\u273d\u273d\u273d\u273d\u273d\u273d\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuferar\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe magnificent city, Ziluvitha has not been the same ever since it survived a star collision. Particles of the star known as Suferar have spread everywhere throughout the town and have contaminated its inhabitants. Ever since then, the daylight has fallen into a deep sleep, as did many of the residents. Others are struggling and hoping for the Bronze Days to reappear. The collision has also caused the city to split into many sectors and has given birth to strange, yet curious sponge beings who have multiplied exponentially. They have been drying the ocean and the city canals where they have been seeking refuge. On their way towards Zilluvitha, Phoebe and Sprinkler, two adventurers, stumble upon the sponge folk in the most critical time of their lives. Being threatened by extinction because of constant attacks from the rat armies, the sponge folk are helped by our two adventurers in their great battle for survival.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ePhoebe\u00a0\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fomr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11070972_810840675659057_237435221038291360_n.jpg?oh=658cd9780d33027d4d3a35ac5489641e\u0026amp;oe=59B681D6\" style=\"width: 427px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.facebook.com/Suferar/photos/a.810840635659061.1073741828.653139714762488/810840675659057/?type=3\u0026amp;theater\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ftsr1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11070972_810840675659057_237435221038291360_n.jpg?oh=0fc90a503d4aac15d60db20abbe85dcf\u0026amp;oe=5A54B5D6\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003eHaving a strong connection with the Suferar stars and Suferar particles spread everywhere throughout the town, Phoebe always finds it easy to relate with all the contaminated inhabitants of Ziluvitah.

As a result from all the tests, in Sprinkler\u2019s mind, the world is structured as a continuous labyrinth in which we are all test subjects, passing from one room to another. This kind of thinking will later help him survive certain perils which he has to face alone. While the circus is under attack by rats, Sprinkler makes his escape. He then finds Phoebe and decides to bond with her, being able to regenerate every time she is near.
