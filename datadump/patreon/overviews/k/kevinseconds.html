    "summary": "Hi. My name is \u003cstrong\u003eKevin Seconds\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, you probably got here by following a link I posted on \u003cstrong\u003eFacebook, Twitter\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eInstagram \u003c/strong\u003eso you probably know at least a little something about me and what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know, I am the singer of the longtime American hardcore punk rock band \u003cstrong\u003e7Seconds\u003c/strong\u003e. We have several albums and EPs out on various labels and have toured North America, South America, Japan and Europe. We\u0027ve been playing, touring and recording for over 35 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides that, I\u0027m also a performing/recording singer-songwriter and have released several albums and have toured all over the place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over 35 years, I\u0027ve attempted to stay close to the music and the writing and the performing and the touring and do what I need to do, as long as it feels good, right and honest, to avoid ever working some crappy job for some crappy person or corporation. This is not because I hate to work. I work every day and hard. I just work hard doing what I know and love and believe in and it\u0027s taken a good long while to be ok with knowing and admitting that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the greatest job I could ever have. I write songs, I play music, I record things, I film things, I draw, paint, tattoo and screen print things. I even podcast things and do Internet radio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut writing and recording songs is just about my favorite thing ever to do. Honestly, I try and write a song every day. In fact, all of last year, I attempted to write 400 of them, falling short by 130 (dammit!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I telling you all this? I need your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince you\u0027ve read this far, you probably already support me (or have) by downloading my songs and albums, or listening to my podcasts, going to my gigs or buying my artwork and t-shirts. If so, THANK YOU and please know that I appreciate every single bit of love and support that has ever come my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to try something a little different from how I\u0027ve been sharing my music throughout the years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, I now have a place online where I organize all of the music that I have written and recorded in recent years and can make my songs available to the public, build up a nice little community of like-minded fans and at the same time, raise a little money for upcoming projects that I\u0027d like to see come to fruition in 2016, particularly the release of the 270 songs I wrote and recorded for my ill-fated 400 Songs in 2015 project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to make all of the songs available on vinyl with a download code but that would be a major undertaking and cost more money than I have at the moment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the time being, I\u0027d like to go with a multi-disk (CD) box set with booklet, lyrics, etc. etc. included. I\u0027ve looked into manufacturing costs and depending on the numbers I have done, I\u0027m looking at anywhere between $3500 and $4500 to make this box set happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other goal is to organize and edit all the video footage I\u0027ve taken of me writing, arranging, recording and putting together a bunch of the songs I wrote and recorded in 2015 and making a mini-documentary film from it. A few people have asked me and I like the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of all that, I have a full-length album of material I would like to release completely independently, on my own record label.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever funds I can raise through my Patreon page will go towards the manufacturing of the new album, the box set, the making and completion of \u00a0the mini-doc film and, if we have greater success with it, put a bunch (if not ALL) of the 2015 songs together and release them on vinyl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join and continue your support of me and my musical/creative endeavors. I cannot do this without you. No pressure, just basic fact \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be offering music, live concerts, art, films, podcast and stuff here that you won\u0027t be able to find anywhere else because I feel that it\u0027s time to do that sort of thing and Patreon seems like a perfect place to do it at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom, middle and top of my heart, I thank you so very much for reading this and even contemplating becoming a patron of mine. I promise, every bit of your moral and financial support goes right back into waking up the next day and creating more to share with you and I am eternally grateful\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love and many thanks,\u003cbr\u003eKev"
