    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout KnowingBetter and the Channel:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a veteran, gamer, and former social studies teacher with bachelor\u0027s degrees in Social Studies Education (with a focus on Modern World History) and Psychology - and a minor in Insect Biology, don\u0027t ask.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been creating videos for fun for well over a decade, so I decided to finally create KnowingBetter as a way to continue educating and put my hobby to good use.\u00a0 Only now, I get to gear my content more towards an adult audience, which allows for a lot more freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Supporting the Channel Does:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do everything on this channel myself, from researching and writing to filming and editing; KnowingBetter is a one-man operation.\u00a0 It currently takes about 2 hours of work for every final minute of video, so a 20 minute video can take upwards of 40 hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I would love to make this a full-time job, it simply isn\u0027t economically feasible at the moment.\u00a0 Especially because of the seemingly random nature of Youtube demonetization.\u00a0 Videos like \"Out of Context\" and \"Going After Gandhi\" have been demonetized and made less than $2 a piece.\u00a0 Your support helps make that future goal more of a reality and more than makes up for the loss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePromises to You, for Becoming a Patron:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- At least two videos a month, barring some sort of disaster.\u003cbr\u003e- Limited ad placement, only videos over 20 minutes will have a mid-roll.\u003cbr\u003e- If I remake an old video, it would only be because I have something substantially new to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get for Supporting (Explanations of Rewards):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Behind-the-Scenes, Lens, and Bloopers: See the production process for yourself!\u00a0 Any making-of\u0027s, blooper reels, or special behind the scenes videos will be available to you here.\u00a0 When the Lens goal is reached, have access to live behind the scenes activity right through the app!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Access to scripts and artwork: A few days after a video goes live, the final script (including all of the annotations and markings letting me know how to film it) and any original artwork created for the video, will be available on the feed for you to do whatever you want with.  Aside from remake my video or sell it as merch, I suppose, obviously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Shout-outs: Your name will appear as a thanks in every milestone video (subscriber counts, Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s).\u00a0 At the higher tiers, your name will jiggle around in the end card of every video while you\u0027re a patron.\u00a0 At the highest tier, I\u0027ll even say your name out loud!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Early Access: You\u0027ll get to see the videos several hours (or days if I\u0027m that ambitious) before anyone else!\u00a0 Give me your feedback, suggest corrections, get that top-level comment, whatever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The Vault: Occasionally, a video will be made obsolete by a newer version or new information.\u00a0 If that\u0027s the case, it heads to the vault.\u00a0 But fear not, you\u0027ll have unlimited access to these embarrassing old videos for all time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
