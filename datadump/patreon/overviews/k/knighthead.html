    "summary": "This Patreon will be an ongoing work in progress. \u003cbr\u003eSee it as a tip jar, if you will. All of the content I create here will be available to everyone, but I will try to provide extra goodies for those of you supporting me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, I\u0027m going to record at least one video process a month. For now, let\u0027s say it will be one a month, but hopefully I can get fast enough to do more. I\u0027m in the process of resurrecting my YouTube channel, where I will be uploading sped-up versions of my process videos. For you Patrons, I\u0027ll be uploading longer versions. I\u0027m thinking about three hour videos, which should be slow enough to see exactly what I\u0027m doing, but fast enough that the idea of watching the process in one sitting isn\u0027t so daunting. I recorded a painting in May that I uploaded as a 15-minute video to YouTube:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-O5QpVJSO8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be uploading the longer version of that drawing process here in the next week or so. \u003cbr\u003eThe next few drawing processes will likely be my own characters, however I will be open to drawing fanart suggestions in the future! I\u0027ll figure out how to set up a poll and open that up to everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already upload my drawings at decent resolutions, but I tend to draw pretty large. I\u0027m personally into that ungodly amount of pixels, and I\u0027m sure some of you are, too! I\u0027ll upload the full-resolution .PNG files for my monthly illustrations here as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt some point I\u0027ll put prints up, as soon as I find a good way to handle that. If there is anything in my gallery that you would like to see as a print, let me know! I will be making up a print list to go here soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2606Under Construction\u2606\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is my life. Naturally, it\u0027s what I want to spend all of my time doing, and for that, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003eI have been sustaining myself with private commissions, where I explore an illustration with a client. It\u0027s exhilarating, really, creating a piece of art for someone, having it grow before their eyes, and their excitement to see the final product. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027m relatively unknown, so my active clientele grows thin quite often. With your help, I will be able to work faster and provide content, and content \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e want created!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a goal of releasing my webcomic before the new year. It keeps getting pushed back because it doesn\u0027t generate income, and I have to put it on hold while I work on paid work to afford my rent. If I can see a little bit of success on Patreon, I will be able to concentrate on my passion and create this comic. In addition to allowing me to follow my dreams, I will be creating art for you all. If my first goal is reached, I will be able to pay my bare minimums through Patreon, and I will create fanart for you on a weekly basis. I will release all of the work I create here publicly, but you Patrons will receive the high resolution files, and be able to suggest and vote on what I draw for the weekly fanart. \u003cbr\u003eIf I reach my second goal, on top of the weekly fanart, I will begin releasing my webcomic and keep up two pages a week. For helping me create my comic, you will also have access to the high-resolution pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am completely new to this, but I hope you will join me on this adventure to be a full-time artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough not milestones (currently), there are other things I would like to provide to my patrons. Eventually I will make painting and drawing tutorials (both image format and video), and perhaps begin streaming.\u003cbr\u003e"
