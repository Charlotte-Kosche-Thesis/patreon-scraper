    "summary": "Thank you to our Patreon donors who are so generous to accompany us on our journey through the Godzilla series, and to our listeners and fans.\u00a0 By listening and donating, you are adding to the excitement we have as we work hard to create more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKaijuvision\nRadio is a high-quality, advanced podcast about the appreciation of\nkaiju (giant monster) movies and discovering their cultural and\nhistorical value.\u00a0 We are concentrating on movies from the Godzilla\nseries - the largest, longest movie series made by any major movie studio in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are covering the series chronologically, starting with Gojira (1954)\nand ending with Godzilla vs. Kong (2020).\u00a0 \u00a0Planning began in March\n2015 and our first two episodes were released September 20, 2017.\u00a0 \u00a0Episode 3 is the first episode about a movie in the Godzilla series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  The hosts are Brian J.\nScherschel, a graduate of the Indiana University School of Public and\nEnvironmental Affairs masters degree program and amateur film critic,\nand Nathan Marchand, a local author who has written a kaiju-related\nbook.  Though both of us are kaiju fans, Brian concentrates on the\ninternational relations and history issues and Nathan concentrates on\nacting as a member of the Godzilla fan community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe objective is\nto go above and beyond what all other kaiju podcasts have done. \nSince these movies are a great way to learn more about Japan, we\nrelate the movies to subjects like Japanese history, current events,\npolitics, and economics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn part 1 of each podcast, we describe (but\nnot summarize) the movie. It\u2019s an analysis tailored to kaiju movies, to arm the listener with the facts.  At last, a way to compare these movies to each other.\u00a0 In part 2 we discuss and give our opinions\non the movie.\u00a0 In part 3, we select one or more issues related to\nJapan that were either brought up by the movie or was going on in\nJapan at the time the movie was released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor instance, Episode 5 covers the first Godzilla sequel, Godzilla Raids Again (1955).\u00a0 In part 1 we talk about the mechanics of the movie to get the\nlisteners on the same page as us, in part 2 we talk about what we\nlike about the movie and discuss the film in general, and in part 3\nwe talk about the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF), mainly how the\nmilitary is depicted in the Godzilla movies, its post-war history,\nand the challenges it faces today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cover the issues logically,\nfairly, and without intention of political slant.\u00a0 \u00a0The objective is\nto get across what the movies are communicating from the Japanese\nperspective, which is the bedrock of comparative politics and\ninternational relations.\u00a0 In creating the podcast, we pay careful\nattention to quality and on being professional at all times.\u00a0 The\noverall sound quality of the podcast is excellent.\u00a0 \u00a0We are not\npart of a podcasting network.  We are currently on YouTube,\nBlubrry, iTunes, Google Play Music, TuneIn, and Stitcher.\u00a0 \u00a0Brian\nrecorded totally original 4k background videos of local natural\nfeatures and architecture for the YouTube channel.\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdNQWe5_g8XsFlsF7S-rJGNfyC5k40Q_v\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKaijuvision Radio on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
