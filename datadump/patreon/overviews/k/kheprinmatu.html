Often, we find ourselves in the situation where we\u0027re having to work an unrelated day job, or have to choose commission work, to pay the bills, hoping to pursue our personal projects in our off-time. Those precious projects can then fall by the wayside due to time constraints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope, through Patreon, that I can earn a little extra, so I can devote more time to my personal projects. In my case, that would be finishing The Iron Hound, and further fantasy adventures, as well as a science fiction graphic novel, entitled The Pistol Star.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m pretty much self taught when it comes to both writing and digital art. I have worked in the publishing industry, and that certainly holds me in good stead moving into a more serious writing role."
