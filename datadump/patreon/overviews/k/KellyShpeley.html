    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings Humans!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here, the experimenter/adventure art alien, and I am asking for assistance for this art journey. My gratitude to those suporting me thus far..I am still kind of getting the hang of the nuts and bolts of this Patreon thing, so again, I appreciate the patience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"So what\u0027s Patreon\"\u003c/strong\u003e you may ask? \u00a0Well, if you\u0027re just showing up here for the first time, here\u0027s the verbal download...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou are funding human innovation and original thought\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, like Kickstarter, allows people to pledge money to support a large project. But unlike Kickstarter, Patreon support is ongoing; patrons agree to make small, regular contributions (such as $5/month or $?(your choice)/month), and I receive a monthly cheque to help me with my project. \u00a0If you\u0027re a fan of mine and want to support me in the creation of new art shows/webcasts/theatre/toy making/videos/blogs/performance-art/projects and more random, unpredictable art-things, this is the place, as you can see. These things will become more varied as we go along. The more support, the better, and who knows what I will create next. Installations, animations. MAYHEM? Surprises are grand. \u00a0Feedback, and ideas are welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Your loving and brilliant support is greatly appreciated. Community is essential to the arts, and essential to human innovations.This site is an opportunity to be directly involved with me, and in my creative process, through art patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time to take new and less conventional approaches to how you interact with the arts. By helping me even a tiny bit, you are helping to make the art, and depending on your level of commitment, occasionally a gift or 2 may makes it\u0027s way to you as thanks for that support, and of course your name will be added to the list of sponsors that help me, no matter the contribution level. But to do this I require support from those who appreciate what I do, and are willing to help with the nuts and bolts of what builds the foundations on which creative humans stand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am committed to what I do.\u00a0 Art is my calling.\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the project size and sposorship amount, that can lead to an artsy reward. And as a contributor, you will get partial credit for helping to make the projects happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackstory\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e I have been working in fine arts, and film, for 8 years. I became ill from chronic Lyme disease (from a tick bite), which, if you know much about it, can have far reaching effects on ones ability to do a 9-5 like normal folk.. So It\u0027s made me rethink how to work and interface in this world, and how I\u0027d like to work, and to focus on what I can do, not what I can\u0027t. So, I am in a position where I have to tailor my work life to fit my health. Working as an artist and creative is what fits best, and again, you\u0027d be helping me with that. So I can learn what is still possible for me to achieve, despite the setbacks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m planing some larger projects and, I want to be able to explore those big ideas with some funding, and have you a part of that process. The by-product may be high quality limited edition merchandise, or an installation. Rest assured, It will be wacky and creative.\u003ca href=\"http://amandapalmer.tumblr.com/post/126884237426/a-round-up-of-all-my-official-patreon-content-to\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the funds:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be putting 100% of monies from these contributions, toward supplies for arts endevours. I will also do project specific posts, which you can contribute to if you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I do a lot of projects \u00a0where I am scrounging and repurposing, using \u0027environmentally responsible\u0027 methods. Sometimes costs are UNAVOIDABLE, but you can help with that part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do art shows pretty regularily, but largely regional. However, larger projects may have the possibility of touring to other places, which you may also wish to be involved in, depending on the project and your personal interest in it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s experiment together!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a collaboration between us. And whether it\u0027s $5 or $5000, all of it goes toward the process.\u003cbr\u003eEvery patron who\u0027s supporting me is important to this community, I\u0027m glad you found me here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...THANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I have worked in the film industry and have had gallery showings in Canada, the United States, and Norway. I have had work in Juxtapoz Magazine, Print Work, and Trend Prive. I have worked for a number of directors, to name a few,  Steven Spielberg, Duncan Jones, and J.J. Abrams. I have also worked with Miss Norway on a body painting photoshoot for Print Work magazine. Also, I have done artwork for Stan Lee... Excelsior! I was lucky also to be part of Neil Gaiman\u2019s \"Calendar of Tales\"(January). I am a  self taught artist, and I work in many different mediums. I have also been the poster girl for the Vancouver International Jazz Festival (Coastal Jazz), and John Cleese is the proud owner one of my art prints. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArtist Statement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI maintain my art practice in a large warehouse studio in \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnceded Territory of\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eSinixt, \u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBC, Canada,  where I have many printing projects, mosaics, and commissioned paintings I work on. Generally, I need to allow time for the vision to emerge. I have to soak up all the influences that encompass the ideas. I approach the project once I have a clear vision of what I want to achieve. I research the subject matter thoroughly, then I get to sketching out the solutions. I start by blocking down the major components of the work, then slowly add the details. It\u2019s quite meditative and methodical for me. I am in flow state when I make. It\u0027s the best possible meditation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
