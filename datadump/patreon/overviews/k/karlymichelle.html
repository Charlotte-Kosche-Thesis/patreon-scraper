    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome and Thank you!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting me here on Patreon, I really appreciate the time you have taken to have a look at what I do. I am a visual artist / jewellery maker / someone who just likes to make things and I\u0027ve come to Patreon because I hope to create a sustainable arts practice from the various things I do. Life\u0027s taken me into some unexpected places - one of the most significant was being diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2005 - so I\u0027m learning that I need to try some unconventional paths in life as a\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u0027work for money and then do art on the side while my business develops\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0approach isn\u0027t actually physically possible for me. If you can\u0027t offer any financial patronage, that is ok! There are at least 2 other ways you can help out if you\u0027d like - 1) it is really wonderful when people share what I\u0027m posting on social media as that helps bring my work to a wider audience and simply letting your friends know what I\u0027m doing, even in real life, can be a huge help! 2) Still kind of financial but less so -\u00a0Buy my stuff! I sell things online through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.etsy.com/au/shop/bykarlymichelle\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/karlymichelle\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRedbubble\u003c/a\u003e so any sales makes a huge difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do want to become a patron though (yay \u0026amp; thank you!) - just look to the right and click the big orange button that says \u0027Become a Patron\u0027 - and you\u0027ll be lead through how to sign up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a visual artist and I work with a mixed bag of materials - mixed media not just what I make but in my general approach towards art. I like to try and find interesting ways of expressing inner feelings - of making the invisible a little bit visible and of giving some physical shape and form to thoughts and feelings. I\u0027m also very interest in making work that explores health, or perhaps more accurately, ill-health due to my own experience in this area and this blurs into making work that started as less about making art to \u0027show\u0027 and more about finding restful and calming ways of \u0027being\u0027 within ill-health such as my exploration of repetitive drawing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current focus is exploring what \u0027home is...\u0027 which is the title of a residency and my general exploration into this topic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get for your patronage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy undying thanks and gratitude! Plus you must be congratulated for making the arts a priority and becoming a patron of the arts - very often this is not made a priority in society and yet the arts are a fundamental to it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhile I have outlined the rewards for different amounts of patronage, I hope to be able to update and adapt these as things progress and as I get more used to Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough Patreon (and therefore not publicly available) I\u0027ll share what I am working on, upcoming projects, some writing and reflections on art, first opportunities for purchases and invitations as well as downloadable art. I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027ll change and morph as I go. If you ever have any suggestions about what you\u0027d like to see / be a part of, then please let me know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do with the money\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLive and make art. I realise that encompasses both everything and nothing, so mostly what your support will mean is that I have the money to keep making art, as it will go towards materials and costs of art making. I also just have to keep up with some payments, like public liability / insurance, website bills, phone so that as an artist I am actually available and contactable.\u00a0But also, I do simply need to live, so it will go towards general expenses. Granted, that\u0027s not very specific but that\u0027s because it can be difficult to determine what is needed most ahead of time. However, materials always need to be bought before I can try to sell anything, rent needs to be paid and food to live.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn example of the process could be of my current residency \u0027Home is...\u0027 Before I even knew if I\u0027d been accepted, I\u0027d put the time into putting together a proposal of why, what, how, who. Since approval, I\u0027ve had to spend time on updating website, creating Facebook and social media posts to promote it and connect with people, general advertising fliers, posters and information, email messages to promote it and invite people to be a part of it, create a video invitation, plan workshop dates and promote them and that\u0027s just what I can think of right now. While the residency comes with free rent for the space and they help with advertising, I still need petrol to get there, and money for materials to make art once I am there. Plus I still need to live.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy one concrete plan though, is once I know have petrol to get to the residency, to also purchase a camera / video camera as I will be using my computer or a borrowed camera for the video project aspect to the Home is...residency.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I am interested in exploring how to express and make visible thoughts and feelings - those things within us that are invisible. This includes exploring spirituality through art and in creating work that tries to express the experience of having the chronic condition fibromyalgia. From the experience of needing space and rest I now invite other people into a restful and contemplative creative space through the Moments of Rest Project. I also love to teach and offer workshops and invite other people into a creative space to explore their own creativity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore can be found about these projects and others on my website www.karlymichelle.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
