From about 2006-2015, I was a busy bee of a self-employed content creator, and I loved every minute of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I still dabble, my life has changed a lot in the past three years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days I work in tech, managing community projects and transmedia activations for Microsoft, and I spend much less time on the internet than I used to. My most active time of the year online is November during NaNoWriMo, but each year I pen a new novel draft and hide it away. I\u0027ve now logged 12 NaNoWriMos, and \u003cem\u003eyou haven\u0027t seen any of them\u003c/em\u003e. No one has.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHaving a full-time job that\u0027s creative and awesome has been such a crazy new adventure for me, and I\u0027m learning and growing so much every day. It definitely pays my bills, but often drains me of the creative energy I used to have solely for my own projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd while I\u0027m feeling fulfilled in my life in a lot of ways, there\u0027s still this nagging feeling I have when I realize I STILL haven\u0027t really shared my writing with the world in any meaningful way, and that it\u0027s the thing I want to spend my\u00a0spare time on.\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003eSo what does this mean?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m completely overhauling this Patreon to help make that goal a reality. I\u0027m going to finally get my writing to a place that I feel comfortable sharing. I\u0027m not sure what form that will take yet, but I have a few ideas swimming around in my head, and supporting this Patreon will be the fastest way to find out what\u0027s next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, this is totally optional. If and when I publish or self-publish, it will be available to all. But if you want personal updates, and want to be part of the awesome force that helps me get there... well, for that I would be forever thankful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cinput class=\"btn submitForm bePatron\" style=\"width: 400px;\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Become a patron!\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
