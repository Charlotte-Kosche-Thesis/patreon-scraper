     "description": "There\u0027s power in the repetition of numbers. The combination 333 is the pinnacle, having mind, body and spirit be ONE in equilibrium. In harmony. This phenomenon is what\u0027s been hitting me \"harmoniously\" over the head in 2018. Everything is aligning and steering me far from any interests or income-generating sources that aren\u0027t directly creative. My mind, body and spirit are in an elegant, at times erotic, always powerful and passionate dance. Art is what my life is for. (No clue why I didn\u0027t realize this before age 44...but there you have it: Power in the repetition of numbers. Haha. At least I wasn\u0027t 55 or 66!) My mission is to reach and inspire an ever-increasing number of humans. This is the path I\u0027m forging for myself, and for all artists and makers of the world.\u003cbr\u003e",
