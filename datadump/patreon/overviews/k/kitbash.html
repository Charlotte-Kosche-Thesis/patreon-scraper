    "summary": "Hi! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kit Bash! I\u0027m an amateur artist mainly focusing on the adult Pony and Furry fandoms! I\u0027ve been drawing for as long as I can remember but not that long ago I decided to try and make a go at making this my full time job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon is to allow me to be more flexible in my long term goals of becoming a full time fandom artist. By pledging to my Patreon you\u0027re allowing me to create more fan art than if I had to rely solely on commissions to get by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get in return for pledging?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery patron that pledges will receive benefits, no matter what tier you pledge to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$1 a month and up patrons will receive the ability to vote on my monthly drawing, allowing you to influence what I draw for each month. You will also be eligible to join in on any Patron exclusive streams which includes but is not limited to, any private art pack work, Patron exclusive request streams, or potentially any extreme fetish streams if anyone expresses any interest in that sort of thing. Finally you will also receive access to all posts on my Patreon feed, which will showcase announcements as well as WIPs. Lots of value for one dollar a month, if every single one of my followers pledged just one dollar every month, my dream would already be a reality!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$5 a month and up patrons will be able to submit ideas to the idea pool for voting, basically giving you the ability to tell me exactly what you want to see before you vote on it. Additionally Patrons at this tier will receive full resolution copies of all my non-commission/canon work (usually these are 3300 pixels long on the longest size)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$10 a month patrons will gain all of the above but also have the chance to have me draw them a sketch commission each month!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$30 a month patrons are the same as $10 a month patrons but their commission is upgraded to cell-shaded!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
