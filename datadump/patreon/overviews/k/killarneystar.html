I created this page because I want to connect with you, my fans, and create music and inspire YOU to create something every day! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, I want this page to be about you and how you connect to music or other creative pursuits.\u00a0A former music therapist/ piano teacher, I\u0027ll break down the easiest, most essential parts of music theory that will help you learn to play your favorite songs by ear or improvise your own. Writing songs has been a central joy in my life, and I want everyone to experience musical creativity, even if you\u0027ve never played an instrument! Hint: I specialize in teaching total beginners :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my Deep Dives, I\u0027ll take you inside my songs and show you the story behind each song, as well as how I structure songs and why.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat song would you like to hear a unique cover of? Got an idea for a song that we can virtually write together and tell its story in your own video? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBring it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most important thing is for you to create something every day. Music aside, what are you creating? Let me know! I\u0027d love to feature your work here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m creating:\u003c/strong\u003e My first goal is to raise enough money to make more of these music videos. I want my music performance to be a catalyst to inspire others to be the very best versions of themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fun goal is to record and produce a totally rad dance EP. I\u0027ve written all the songs for it and am starting to work on the foundational beats and structures. However, this takes time, additional equipment, software, mixing, mastering, distribution fees and marketing to get it to really shine on Spotify, iTunes, etc. By supporting my work, you\u0027ll get access to tons of nifty behind-the-scenes stuff AND help rocket me towards my goal of dropping this album by summer 2018. Because who doesn\u0027t love a good dance album?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you believe the popular misconception that music is easy and free to produce, and artists shouldn\u0027t be paid for their time like everyone else?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot\u00a0\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e - you get it. Thanks so very much for your Patronage! YOU ROCK!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s play,\u003cbr\u003eKillarney\u003cbr\u003e"
