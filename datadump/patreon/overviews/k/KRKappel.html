    "summary": "Hey, everyone! So I am Keith Ryan Kappel, and I\u0027m a freelance writer best known for my extensive work with Fantasy Flight Games on their various RPG titles. I\u0027m on Patreon to share RPG content that explores original settings and characters. All of the RPG content is System agnostic for the moment. In order to play you (or your friendly neighborhood GM) will need a copy of the Core Rulebook of your choice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two main ongoing settings I\u0027m focusing most of my efforts on over 2018.The first is the Werelings setting of Aetharil, where\u00a0 woman-warriors of the Knights of the Lady Aether ride flying ursowls to protect their world against rabid werelings and the powerful kymermancers that control them. This setting already has two sizable short stories (with a third on the way) along with a lengthy 15,000+ word RPG setting book nearly completed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other setting is the Wandering Fighter Setting. Set to release before the new year, the Wandering Fighter is an unarmed combat setting similar to \"brawler\" and \"fighter\" video games. Throughout the course of the year, I will also be posting about a dozen system-neutral NPCs for use as opponents in a Wandering Fighter campaign, each with a gorgeous piece of original art by Sean Vrabel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly want to thank all my Patrons for supporting me over these past two years. This has made a huge impact on my life, and my ability to keep my daily focus on writing (no matter if its for this Patreon, FFG, or other projects). Because of all of you, I\u0027ve been able to replace my office chair, and now my computer, both of which were far past the must-replace phase of ownership. You\u0027ve all also been incredibly patient with me when it comes to getting content up on schedule, and you\u0027ve all helped with that too. I\u0027ve been able to bring in some help to crack the whip and keep me on task, so next year should see much more regular updates! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all again, so much. Despite my experience as a writer, I struggle to find the words to properly thank each of you, but find me at a convention, and I\u0027ll do my best over a drink, some food, or some dice. \u003cbr\u003e"
