    "summary": "Hey people!! We\u0027re Dan.n.y and Carter, also known as KyloReyCosplay (mostly on Instagram and Facebook). We both really love to do cosplay (and Danny art) and we would love, more than anything, to be able to cosplay for a living. Although we\u0027re only at cosplay and art at the moment, we plan on expanding to YouTube, Twitch, Photography, Design, and more! Our current goal is to travel to the conventions over Western Canada to meet out friends, family, and see more of our beautiful country while getting our names out there. Another current goal is to get Danny the money to be able to cosplay while in college. Our end goal at the moment is to be invited to conventions as cosplay or art guests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love to have input from people that love what we do. You\u0027re the audience, therefore you\u0027re the ones who allow us to do what we do, and we want to make sure that you get as much in return as you give to us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow here\u0027s a bit about us personally:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarter is a pretty tall dude, but only compared to Danny who\u0027s a pretty short dude, but only compared to Carter. He\u0027s been playing baseball for 13 years and currently is at Rep level. He\u0027s a Smash Bros enthusiast (trust me he comes over and all he wants to do is play Smash while I try to get him to work on this stuff). His instruments are guitar and bass, but mostly bass. He has four cats, Bagwell, Fergie, Doc, and Raven, and if you become a Patron you\u0027ll be seeing plenty of them. He was dragged into cosplay a year and a half ago by Danny, who desperately wanted someone to cosplay with, and KyloReyCosplay was his idea.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFandoms: Star Wars, Zelda, Pokemon, Fire Emblem, and Game of Thrones\u003cbr\u003eGoals: Improve in photography, get more involved in the cosplay process, start a Twitch and YouTube page for video games (and invest in the equipment)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDanny\u0027s the one that designs and puts together the cosplays. They also run a completely separate group of accounts under @dannydoesarts for art. They\u0027ve been cosplaying 4 for or 5 years now, their first cosplay being Clara from Doctor Who, who to this day is one of their favourite characters of all time. Danny didn\u0027t start making their own cosplays for a while. They started buying, then moved up to patterns and sewing (with help from mom), and the most recent Reylo cosplay was the first cosplay that they did entirely on their own (pattern, and sewing), and they intend on keeping it that way for the rest of their cosplay career. They\u0027re not against people who buy cosplay, but they personally prefer to make it themself. Danny\u0027s OTP is Reylo, so you\u0027re going to be seeing a lot of that.\u003cbr\u003eFandoms: Hannibal, Star Wars, Doctor Who, Pokemon, Bates Motel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the X Files\u003cbr\u003eGoals: travel for conventions and meet cosplayer friends (and make them), be the best cosplayer they can be, learn to edit using photoshop, learn how to use their camera properly, be the best artist they can be, be a guest (art or cosplay) at more conventions, and probably a lot more that they can\u0027t think of right now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and I hope you enjoy what we create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Dan.n.y and Carter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
