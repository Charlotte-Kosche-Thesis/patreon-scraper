It\u0027s the strongest, most kawaii\nvideogame comic on the internet, and it\u0027s absolutely unstoppable. But what is it? Where does it come from?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe adventures of Masaka and Majide in the gaming kingdom are the work of one guy (myself, David Cabrera) and the \u003ca href=\"http://comipo.biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eComiPo!\u003c/a\u003e 3D program. The comic is for free, and it is for everybody. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince beginning Kawaiikochan!! with no intention of keeping it going for very long, the comic has grown beyond anything I ever expected. It\u0027s grown in ambition, in scope, in silliness. So much of this growth is thanks to fans and friends who\u0027ve supported my work and motivated me into working harder on Kawaiikochan!!-- and spending more time on it-- than I ever imagined. I am incredibly grateful for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I only want it to keep growing, wherever that may take the girls. Even though they\u0027ve already been to space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, I give you the Kawaiikochan Fan/Fun (or \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3, which can be read as either \"Fan\" or \"Fun\"\uff09\nClub. The support of our existing, faithful Fan/Funs keeps the comic going and literally buys me the time I need to create this comic. Your support means that I can spend more time on the comic, which makes everybody happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully this will create by proxy a better and more kawaii universe for everyone to live in.
