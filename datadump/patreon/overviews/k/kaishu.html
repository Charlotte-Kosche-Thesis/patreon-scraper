(Which you can see here at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=3256493\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy pixiv\u003c/a\u003e or at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://canine-prince.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMy Deviantart\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, my current drawing method is with an older, simple drawing tablet. The disjointed nature of the basic model of tablets causes me to have to undo and redo lines over and over to get them right. \u003cbr\u003eThis is due to the fact that, where my pen is moving and where the lines are going are two different places. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I have decided to begin a Patreon for one of the Cintiq line of tablets. With a Cintiq, the drawing method is more seamless, since the tablet has an integrated screen. This will cut down dramatically on the number of redrawn lines and speed up the process of publishing webcomics and commissions for all of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
