    "summary": "Hello dear friends!\u00a0You might already know me, but if you\u0027re new - I\u0027m Kat Burns, a Toronto based musician, songwriter, artist, and video-maker. You\u0027ve come to the place where \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e become a very valuable part of my ongoing creative endevours. What exactly is Patreon, you might be asking? Well...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBack in the day, there were \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003epatrons of the arts. \u003c/i\u003eThese were people that wanted to support artists directly in their creative endeavours and see their projects through. The music industry has changed an awful lot in the last five years, and Patreon is trying to bring back the idea of supporting creative people in what they do - create things! I love the idea.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus far, my Patrons have helped me achieve some awesome things - new videos, a brand new album, and help with brainstorming song names and set lists. I\u0027m currently working on music videos, new music (always!), and a docu-series called Why We Work.\u00a0Your support means a lot, and, as an independent musician, I really do value your role as my \"record label\". Your pledge will have a direct impact on my work, and for that I thank you tremendously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI should note that I really do appreciate all my supporters, my patrons, those that I meet in real life, online, or at a show. Please - if you are totally strapped for cash, I don\u0027t want you to become a patron. You can still support me by watching my videos, sharing my music with your friends, tweeting me or stream it all on Spotify/etc. \u2764\ufe0f?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFAQ\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many things do you release a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I changed this recently to be a monthly contribution, I try and release as much valuable content per month as I can. You\u0027ll often get first looks at videos, mp3 downloads of demos or new songs, and a whole wack of behind the scenes insight.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nDo I have to pay in USD? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEverything is shown in US dollars, since Patreon is based in the USA, but your pledge will be automatically converted into your home currency that is linked with your credit card.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePLEASE NOTE: \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon isn\u0027t set up for one-time donations right now, as it\u0027s an ongoing patron-of-the-arts platform, BUT if you would like to make a one-time donation, you can do this:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- if you want to pledge $10, select that reward\n\u003cbr\u003e- you can cancel the next month if you choose (payments go through on the 1st of the month, and immediately when you become a Patron)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOR If you just want to make a one time donation without Patreon, or don\u0027t want any rewards, you can send it directly to \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.paypal.me/kashkamusic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.paypal.me/kashkamusic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTHANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.\u003cbr\u003e\n\txo\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\tKat\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
