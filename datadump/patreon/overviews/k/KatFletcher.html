Despite my finances it has truly been the most liberating year of my life, and the most rehabilitating.\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to fully embrace my creativity and explore my passions has been amazing. I am now a starving artist, but first and foremost an artist which is priceless to me.\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life it has frequently occurred to me that I may have been born in the wrong time period. The concept of Patreon gives me a new hope that we are heading towards a cultural reevaluation of the importance of creative endeavors.\u003cbr\u003eThere is a Tony Robbins-esque school of thought that suggest that to find the career you love you must discover where your passion, talent and opportunity intersect, for me this is it. \u003cbr\u003eWith a little help from a population of patrons I can pursue my dreams indefinitely, and that has renewed my optimism and faith in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would the funds be used for?\u003cbr\u003eI tend to live very frugally, I am not one to spend money on luxuries.
