    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAndraia Arlequis is the name, but many of ye call me Furball. Fur, Furbz, Fuzzy; I\u0027ve been called it all. I peruse in the realm of artistry and have been going strong for about 16 years, delving into the world of adult and furry art. I\u0027ve been in the game for nearly 16 years and have always strived to up the ante when it comes to my artwork and content. My ambition is to continue to improve on my craft, and share the results with my friends and fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo be frank, I love to draw; commissions, personal art, it is release for me. I am however a mechanic first, but artwork is my passion, and spend most of my free time creating stuff. With Patreon, I am able to experiment in ways which just releasing openly to the public just wouldn\u0027t be productive, and I want you the fans to be able to really drive my creativity different directions. Also, as more content is created, bonuses will be provided to the most loyal of supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor one, I have never been what one would call lucky. Terrible luck in the roommate department, in the housing market and the like; and to be able to suppliment my income--and at the same time, bring the sexy back for you--would not only be a godsend, but also a guilty pleasure of mine to be able to make one\u0027s day with just a few strokes of a pen, in bringing to life what the fans want to see right before their eyes. Nothing brings me joy like someone\u0027s eyes lighting up when I slide in front of them a picture they wanted to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProjects or plans in mind?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to try my hand at writing comics; it seems to be an all round assumption that people love to read that sort of thing, and it also looks like it would be fun to put one together, so that will be sometime in the future. Also, less churing out commissions like a machine,and more having fun artwise; I have been entertaining an ask box where you ask my characters personally and get responses visibly of them answering said questions directly. Something definitely to consider.\u003cbr\u003eSo, in short, a lot of personal art, and concoctions thunk up by you, the viewers. And maybe even some sassy answers to questions asked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn conclusion...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you for at least considering my patreon. I may end up rewriting this entire biopsy, because I\u0027m not entirely the best at this sort of thing, but we all have to begin somewhere. So thanks, and welcome aboard!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
