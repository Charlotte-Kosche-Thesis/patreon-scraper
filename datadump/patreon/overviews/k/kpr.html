    "summary": "Kitchen Party Records (KPR) is an independent record label and recording studio in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. KPR is also a collective of like minded musicians that have a number one goal of making the local hip-hop scene better. Through all our releases which have been free, to the venues we are collaborating with to create a viable platform for local hip-hop artists in Halifax, right down to the focus on quality entertainment for little to no money, we have been building momentum and fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith our focus on quality and local music, we are often found with a lack of funding for these ventures. We believe people want quality original content, and are willing to support it. However, we tend to release music for free as well as organize events in which we barely break even. We do this not because we are bad business people, but because we believe music trumps money. If we happen to make money because people enjoy it, we will put that money right back into KPR in order to continue to create and release interesting content for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ask those who appreciate independent content, local music, hip-hop, or simply music in general to pledge and be a major part of the reason KPR exists. Any and all donations will go into creating more and better content for everyone to enjoy. Thank you for reading, and I hope to meet you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Dane Richard (Owner - KPR)"
