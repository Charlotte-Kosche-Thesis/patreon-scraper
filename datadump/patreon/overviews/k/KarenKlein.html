    "summary": "Why do you care\nabout me being a writer? There are many writers out there, as there are many\nartists out there. I am a writing because I live and breathe words and stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBooks saved me\nwhen I could not save myself. They are my haven. Each story\ncontains multitudes. I can travel anywhere in the universe. I can become\nanyone, anytime. When life is overwhelming it can be refreshing to get lost in\na book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome people say\nthat art isn\u2019t life or death. But what those people don\u2019t understand is that\nart saves lives. It connects us to one another across time and space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I look at a\nStarry Night by Van Gogh I am connecting with his vision of the world around him.\nWhen I read Jane Austen, I am listening to her parlor room observations. And\nthese connections are essential to the human condition. Art and stories are the\nglue that connect us together. Harry Potter has grown beyond J.K. Rowling and\nspawned an entire fandom. A community that rallies around the world she\ncreated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe need these\nplaces \u2013 virtual or real \u2013 to come together. We are social animals. We need\neach other. Art isn\u2019t just icing on the cake. It is the soul-wrenching need to\nconnect with another person. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, all that\nbeing said, why support me? I write for two reasons: to make sense of the world\naround me and to help others. If I publish my works then I can share my work,\nwhich aides me in the goal of helping others through my art and through my\nstories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to help\npeople escape for a moment of reprieve and entertainment. I am a writer of\nfantasy and science fiction, I want to explore the what-ifs of the universe\nthrough entertaining and character driven stories. The stories I tell are\nmostly novel-sized. But some of them are smaller bites such as novellas and\nshort stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus far, I have indie published my first two novels, Torin\u0027s Legacy and The Guild Master\u0027s Quest the first two books in the fantasy series the Chronicles of the Mages\u0027 Guild.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am working on right now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIndie publishing \u00a0True Love Bites, a novella\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIndie publishing \u00a0Decision Days, a short story\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWriting a novel in a new world\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinuing the Chronicles of the Mages\u0027 Guild series\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
