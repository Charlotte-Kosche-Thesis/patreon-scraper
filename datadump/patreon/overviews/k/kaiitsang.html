For those who don\u0027t know me I am a 20 year old singer/songwriter from Belfast, Northern Ireland and I have been creating music content on Youtube for 2 years now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to post a cover one day the first week I began learning guitar and who would have thought it would amount to gaining such a gathering of supporters that I have today, c r a z y! Theres nothing more than I love than to just be able to create music and share it with you guys and it is so refreshing to see that people can relate and find comfort in my original (also cover) content. I feel that I\u0027m at a stage where I am happy with the content I am creating and would love to pursue it more so...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP A T R E O N\u003c/strong\u003e *plays angels singing sound effect*\u003cbr\u003eI decided to create this Patreon page for those who would like to support the music that I make. Personally for me I am very particular about my content \u0026amp; I love to make sure it is something that I am proud to call my own, however this can take a lot of time to assist my passion and can end up becoming a big aspect of my daily life. Although music is something I\u0027m extremely committed too, it is however just a hobby currently and with the help of Patreon, I would be able to strive towards making it more than just a hobby. It would be lovely to feel like I can put this time into my music with some sort of outcome at the end which is why I thought I have considered this pledge system for those who would be willing to pitch in towards my passion. Of course you don\u0027t have or need to fund my work, it will still be available on my channel. This is for those who have the funds available at their expense and would want to help give my music some return and follow down this little adventure with me! However there is rewards of course in it for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more details of Patreon you can also find information here:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.com/faq\"\u003ehttps://patreon.com/faq\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGIVE BACK\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor giving a part of yourself to me, I also would like to give something back in return. Previously I had set tiers with different rewards on Patreon, however I was not a fan of separating what I could give based on pledge amounts. I have decided to make the rewards available to any amount pledged to me and just have one solid feed I can post on. With this in mind, the amount you pledge is entirely up to how much you feel like helping a brother out, you will get access to the same patreon-only feed. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u2022 Free mp3 downloads of original songs that I create\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Patreon-only feed exclusive to anyone, here I post songs I\u0027m working on, lyrics, songwriting ideas, general discussions etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATRON FEED\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really eager to start up this Patron only feed for you guys! It will be my outlet for music and communication with you lot. Ranging from sharing with you guys new ideas I\u0027ve came up with, journal style videos of songwriting processes, the meaning behind songs, cover snippets, exclusive look into original songs that I have finished/working on. This Patron feed will also act as a place where I can just talk to you guys, answer your questions, chit chat and basically just learn more about each other!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW TO BECOME A PATRON? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u00a0Pick the amount you would like to give per song or video in the box above on the left, you can set a cap limit here on the amount per month when doing this!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2) \u00a0Select your reward level.\u003cbr\u003e3) \u00a0Enter your details.\u003cbr\u003e4) \u00a0Voil\u00e0!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can alter your pledge amount or cancel at any time as a Patron supporter whenever it suits you if you find it is no longer accessible for you, that\u0027s fine! The simple things such as watching my content, sharing, liking and commenting under my videos means a heck of a lot to me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVIDEO CAP\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon has a system of allowing you guys to set a video cap which allows you to only pay a specific amount per month, this is to stop you from funding 20 videos a month if i were to post an excess amount. I will be aiming to post two to three videos a month however whatever is accessible to you, please consider that as priority!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAgain, thank you if you do join Patreon with me, hope we can get to know each other!\u003cbr\u003e"
