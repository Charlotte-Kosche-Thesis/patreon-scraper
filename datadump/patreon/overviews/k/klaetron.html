I believe in the patronage model with my whole heart, because it puts the control\ninto your hands and builds a community. I want to create high quality content that will educate and\nentertain YOU. I plan to post new videos once a week. I strive to create\nnothing but the absolute best production and quality work, as we meet our goals the\nproduction will only get bigger and better. As we grow our community there will be ample room for involvement and creativity for you as well. If you\u0027re concerned about\ngoing over your budget, you can set a monthly maximum during the signup process. I understand very clearly what it means to give up\neven a dollar.

My hope[ is to film my\nvideo lessons in various different locations locally, nationally, and who knows\nmaybe even internationally, if funding allows.
