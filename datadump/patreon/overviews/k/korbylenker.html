    "summary": "Hi friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a lot of stuff - songs, stories, videos, essays. Something comes out every week. It\u0027s been that way for more than a decade.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I\u0027ve just given it away. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been super good in figuring out how to squeeze a dollar out of a piece of art. It\u0027s just not where I want to live. If you\u0027re wondering how I stay alive, I make my living touring around the country, playing shows. I\u0027ve played 100+ shows a year for the last five years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started researching Patreon back in the summer. I looked at about 50 different patreon artists - some of them were hard for me to understand. What you give for what you get. I thought a lot about it. Creating a bunch of reward levels seemed overwhelming to me. I realized: I really just want to continue making stuff and as little time as possible keeping track of who gets what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is my plan: \u003cstrong\u003eEveryone gets everything.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you pledge a $1 a month, you get access to everything. If you pledge $20 a month, you get access to everything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you are wondering why you would pay $20 for something you could get for $1, the answer is simple: it\u0027s because 1) you believe in me, and 2) you can afford to support an artist at that level. If you can\u0027t, no problem. Listen to my song and enjoy. Read my story and see what you think. Either way, I\u0027ll be at my house, working, I\u0027m just inviting you to participate in keeping the lights on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is just a simple truth: I spend all of my money on my art. Like, all of it.\u00a0When I have more time, I make more stuff. When I have more money, I hire more people. I\u0027m fortunate to have lived in East Nashville for more than a decade: I know \u003cem\u003eso many \u003c/em\u003etop-shelf creative people. The idea of being able to give them money to do what they love to do -- that feels very exciting. I am a very DIY kind of person, but more and more, it seems like doing things \u003cem\u003etogether\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is the way to go. I want to be in a situation where I can do more things together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m making a new TV show - MORSE CODE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery story needs a new chapter. Here\u0027s mine: \u003cstrong\u003eI wrote a TV Show\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s called \u003cem\u003eMorse Code\u003c/em\u003e, and it\u0027s about\u00a0an indie folk singer trying to strike an impossible balance between being a dad and a full-time touring musician.\u00a0We\u0027re producing it here in East Nashville this spring. I\u0027ve been working on it like crazy for the past 18 months - not just writing, but honing my acting chops at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.the4thwallactingstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe 4th Wall Actor\u0027s Studio\u003c/a\u003e. After several month\u0027s of preproduction, we\u0027ve cast the principle roles, hired the crew, and settled on the location. It stars Maggie Schneider, Sara Antonio and me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m financing the pilot myself, but my hope is that, once they see the first episode, people will be as excited as I am about telling this story, and help me make more. Each episode will be 5 - 7 minutes long. The first season will be 8 - 11 episodes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s my pitch. If you feel like jumping in at whatever level you can afford, please do. I promise your pledge will go a long way toward helping me make a joyful noise in the world. I have no idea what is about to happen, but I\u0027m going to give it everything I\u0027ve got.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for spending some time with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKorby\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

He doesn\u0027t just play it, he becomes it -- or maybe, it becomes a part of him.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKorby Lenker was born and raised in Twin Falls Idaho a mile from where Evel Knievel tried to jump the canyon on a motorcycle in the seventies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost recently a 1st place winner at the 2016 Rocky Mountain Folks Festival Songwriter\u2019s Competition (previous alum include Gregory Alan Isakov and Deb Talan of The Weepies), Korby is a dynamic, compelling performer. Sometimes up on tip toe, singing in a hush, his performances ride a penciled line between achingly personal and easily personable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now he is is a published author. Korby\u2019s book MEDIUM HERO is a collection of short stories based on his last decade touring the world. It came out on Turner Publishing in December 2015 to enthusiastic reviews. Steve Wozniak said: \"The stories in Medium Hero are just like his songs \u2014 clever and well-crafted, with a tendency to linger in your mind long after you\u2019ve finished reading.\u201d",
