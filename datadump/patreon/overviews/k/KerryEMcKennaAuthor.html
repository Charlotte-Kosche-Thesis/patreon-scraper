Leonardo da Vinci had patrons, including the famous de Medici family. Voltaire had Madame Pompadour. Shakespeare had the Earl of Pembroke. You don\u0027t have to be a royal or the Pope to claim this exalted position! In this modern world, you can do a part to elevate the arts. I am a great investment.

Watch these transform into full-grown essays and poems at $7 a month. Learn how the writing process works, follow my adjustment to the world of publishing with additional videos at the $14 level.

It\u0027s because I\u0027ve moved to my amazing new city, this is a temporary yet vital stage. Maybe you\u0027ve been in this position. The struggle for basic survival is distracting, and the time I would love to use for writing is still used for part time gigs, marketing my healing business building foundations. With minimal support, you can make a huge and immediate difference!
