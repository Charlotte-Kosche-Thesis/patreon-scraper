    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal Background\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI turned 60 on July 31, 2015; I haven\u0027t been on anyone\u0027s payroll in 5 years; I have been an audio and print journalist in the \nprogressive/alternative/community (i.e. poorly-paid) sector for 16 \nyears. I have an economics degree (B.A. cum laude) from Fordham \nUniversity in New York. I also have learned a lot about economics from \nthe School of Hard Knocks. But I don\u0027t type fast, or know the latest version of the hottest software, and I rarely do video and don\u0027t do it very well. I also do not thrive in fast-paced environments.\u00a0 Thinking, reading, investigating and analyzing take more time than spewing out \"content\" for the sufferers of technologically-induced ADD so prevalent today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t do anything useful or creative with my intelligence, education, talent, skill and experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePurpose of My Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are told, especially by the 1%, and their bought politicians, that we must take personal responsibility for our lives, that we must be able to support ourselves. Yet we must ask for permission to do what we are mandated to do, by applying \nfor jobs. What is overlooked about the competitive job market is that competition, by its very nature, creates losers well as winners, even in a world that is \nabsent discrimination, outsourcing, and replacement of humans with technology. Even if we \"win\", the victory may be only temporary. The good-paying jobs may go away even if we are hard-working, loyal employees.\u00a0 I will never forget how Enron employees were literally put out on the street in front of the office building in Houston,\u00a0 crying in each others\u0027 arms. Mounted police watched them and ordered them to disperse instead on going to the top floor to arrest the thieving executives.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is just the beginning of what is wrong with a money-jobs system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe lamestream media, propagandists for corporations and their government cronies,\u00a0 are not going to publicize alternatives very well, if at all. Fox, CNN, MSNBC et al. are too obsessed with war, \nstreet violence, Wall Street, and vapid celebrity news.\u00a0 Most of the allegedly progressive alternative media only covers movements calling for SSDD: more jobs, basic income guarantees--I thought that was Social Security--and allegedly socially responsible investment, which is merely putting lipstick on the capitalist pig. Frankly, I think that some venture capitalists are out to co-opt alternative economics movements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Need Your Patronage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got\u00a0 sick in May of 2015, and needed to cut back my work. Although I will do a few pieces--watch for what I will write on the Individual Mandate in Obamacare\u00a0\u00a0 in 4 to 6 weeks, I now will focus on my book.\u00a0 I will put chapters on the Patreon page as I finish them. They will be in no particular order\u00a0 I invite your comments for the inevitable re-write.I have already written about 100 pages of a first draft.\u00a0 What have I left out? \nYour point of view matters because I do not intend to reinvent global \neconomics alone. I want to create space on the Internet for my \nviewpoints as well as those of others who know that we cannot keep going\n in the direction we have been going.\nI have published \u003ca href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/319733\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e1 small nonfiction ebook at Smashwords,\u003c/a\u003e and I expect to publish the book on gift economies there as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Support is Itself a Creative Act\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eYour support for my work helps break down the current system a little because it \nis a gift that you choose to give, in whatever amount you choose--I\u0027m only asking for the minimum $1/mo. pledge; you decide if you want to give more--for \nhowever long you choose.\u00a0\u00a0 You are not paying a price demanded by someone trying to \nsell you something. Thus, it is a form of gift economy, even though it \nstill involves money. \u003cstrong\u003eThis makes you a creator\u003c/strong\u003e in the realm of \nalternative economics. So if you think you are not creative yourself, \nbut only hope to help people who are creative, guess again! By becoming a patron, you are breaking \ndown the scarcity paradigm that is the current money-jobs system \n(capitalist AND state socialist). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Books -- Your reward for having an attention span.\"  \u003c/em\u003e-- \u003cstrong\u003es\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eeen on a T-shirt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks on demonetization have been written, but they are largely academic works or works, as one author I interviewed put it, for the thinking activist. Mine will be for average Janes and Joes who perhaps never have thought about whole societies doing away with money. The book covers 1) the reasons why current economics CANNOT serve all of us and \nthe environment, regardless of whether liberals or conservatives are in \npower,\u00a0 2) the values we must adopt in order to establish universal \njustice, peace, prosperity and democracy within a healthy \nenvironment on a finite planet, through gift economies, globally and locally, 3) examples, past, present and in literature and games, of gift economies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Gift of Freedom\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage will give me what every creator wants and needs: \nFreedom. I will not be forced to write query letters and compete against\n my fellow journalists for space in someone else\u0027s publication. Queries, like job applications,\u00a0 \nare requests for permission to work.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also have freedom from restrictions I have experienced with other media outlets: restrictions on frequency \nof publication, limitations on word count or requirements that a \npoorly-paid article nonetheless is of a length that brings the \ncommission below minimum wage for California. I would also be freed from\n the requirement of fitting my stories into the time slots available in \nbroadcast radio programs and the requirement that I speak only to people\n of a certain race, gender or geographical location, because  certain \nprograms are dedicated to Identity politics. I would be free from an outlet\u0027s desire not to  be seen as critical of a particular \norganization or government. With your help, I can \"call \u0027em like I see \n\u0027em,\" as the umpires say in baseball, through my book. That\u0027s what journalism even in book form, is supposed\n to be about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing my patron also means that you are freeing others, because I will be able to distribute my work for free, (or for a price that each reader separately will name) and still eat.\u00a0 No one need worry that they \ncan\u0027t afford to learn.\u00a0 You \nwould not only have access to the information yourself, but also the \npride of knowing you are helping to spread creative economic ideas \nglobally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou mean that Patreon is for journalists, too?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes! Starting January 1st, 2015, I\u0027ve been supporting investigative reporter \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/Nafeez\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNafeez Ahmed\u003c/a\u003e of Great Britain with $5 a month! Creative journalism is not about making up stories. It\u0027s about digging up real stories that need to be told, looking for uncovered angles in seemingly familiar stories, and all too often, finding creative ways to get around blockages to information people like you need to have. It is also being creative in the presentation of information, especially in the Digital Age. Patrons are being generous to Nafeez.
