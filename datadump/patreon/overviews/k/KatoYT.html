    "summary": "Kato is a team of two best friends, Zero and Hoodie, with a shared passion for anime, comic books, and movies. In the past, we\u0027ve stuck to a pretty tight schedule of one analysis video per week. We thought of that deadline as the most efficient way of outputting content to gain as many viewers as possible. But in doing so, we ended up spending a lot less time on the projects than ideal. A lot of time was spent scavenging the cutting room floor for any bit of an idea that could be made into at least a 5 minute video.\u003cbr\u003eWe want to stop doing that. We want to make the videos we\u0027re passionate about and spend as much time as we need to get them as good as they can be. But in order to do this we\u0027ll need security. Sacrificing the amount of content we produce hypothetically means sacrificing the amount of revenue we make. That\u0027s where this Patreon comes in. Every dollar we make on here goes towards the idea that we can continue working hard on videos to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOf course, we don\u0027t want you guys to support nothing. Without setting a specific deadline, we will shoot to have at least one video out a month. And if we have time to do more, then so be it.\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all of our viewers, whether you patron us or not. We appreciate all the support we\u0027ve gotten from the very beginning to now, and hopefully as we move forward you continue to support us."
