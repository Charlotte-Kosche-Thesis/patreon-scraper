Casting from the shores of Prince Edward Island, Canada, King Fish Man-assumably landing in an ice shack in the 1960\u0027s-has been making waves with his songs about fishing (publicly) since 2011. A multi-instrumentalist/ writer/singer whom-must have implemented the rules of 10,000 hours of practice-KingFishMan has an innate ability to perform each instrument with such skill, that leaves many music enthusiasts to question if he\u0027s truly of this planet.

KingFishMan\u0027s music is catchy-like, really catchy-and the simplified hooks are perfect for a cookout or campfire with the kids. So, turn up the heat, peel the turnips, take out the turn-tables, and turn up the decibels to hear his blazing guitar riffs on \"Superstitious Fish\". I warn you, though, there is \"no catch and release\" once you\u0027ve heard these songs.

He has an album\ndedicated to TROUT TOWN USA! He just wrote and recorded a song for the TROUT\nPARADE 2017. He played guitars on a song about the Coney Island Mermaid Parade\n2017 (Debbie Harry of \u201cBlondie\u201d was the \u201cQueen Mermaid\u201d! He has a song about\nJOAN WULFF the Fly Fishing Legend of Trout Town USA (she actually spoke with\nTimmy a few times on the phone!) He has many music videos. He has a Holiday\nAlbum, a double album about Ice Fishing. He filmed enough source footage in 4K\nUHD Video for a two-hour documentary waiting to be edited! Maybe your readers\nwould be interested in learning about his zany fishing humor and some serious\ntunes as well? His style is Country/Rock/Blues and he sounds a little like\nCharlie Daniels meets Wilie Nelson and a hint of Johnny Cash at times.
