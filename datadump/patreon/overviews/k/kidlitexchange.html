We pass them around via USPS media mail and write reviews, and the reviews help authors as well as librarians, parents, teachers etc who are looking for quality kid lit! (See below for the long version) Check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kidlitexchange.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e for ALL of the info! Email Kate Olson at kidlitexchange@gmail.com for more info or to ensure that there are real live humans behind this amazing movement! If you are interested in a one-time contribution, you may send money via PayPal to Kate Olson at olskat80@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of this is lot of fun, but the cost REALLY adds up! \u003c/strong\u003eThe cost of postage (average $3/book), mailers, supplies, website hosting, business cards and bookmarks, graphic design, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: If an author donates to this group, the donation in NO WAY impacts our reviews of their title.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe LONG VERSION:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKid Lit Exchange is a movement started by \u003ca href=\"http://theloudlibrarylady.com/\"\u003eKate Olson of The Loud Library Lady\u003c/a\u003e with the goal of getting review copies of children\u2019s books into the hands of more willing and able reviewers. We so often hear that reviews are what make or break books, especially by debut authors, so why not work together to spread the word? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs reviewers, we love to read books before they are released, and this group eliminates the need for publishers and authors to send galleys to multiple people \u2013 send us ONE galley (or recently published title), and we will just keep passing it on for review! We mail books via USPS media mail, and are currently personally absorbing all of the mailing and packaging costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks are posted on the \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/kidlitexchange\"\u003e@kidlitexchange Instagram account\u003c/a\u003e for reviewers to request and all reviews are posted by reviewers on Goodreads and Instagram using \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/kidlitexchange/\"\u003e#kidlitexchange \u2013 head on over and take a look!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
