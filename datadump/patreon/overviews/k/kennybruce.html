    "summary": "You are here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOK, this would work better\nwith a map. Something a bit more visual. That way you could see that by \u201chere\u201d\nI mean you have arrived at my personal Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPhysically, you might be in\nOmaha or Orlando or Ox Bow. Yes, there really is an Ox Bow. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut through the wonders of\nthe Internet, you\u2019re also here, at \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/kennuybruce\"\u003ewww.patreon.com/kennuybruce\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI guess you really\ncan be two places at once. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA little about me: I\u2019ve\ncovered NASCAR and other forms of motorsports for more than 35 years. Always\nfor someone else. Now I\u2019m doing it for me. And you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI launched \u003ca href=\"http://www.kennybruce.net\"\u003ewww.kennybruce.net\u003c/a\u003e in January and that is where you can find the bulk of\nmy content. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis site, on the other hand,\nis where you can pay for that content if you so choose. Totally up to you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve won a handful of awards\nbut if you do something long enough, eventually someone hands you a plaque and\nshakes your hand and you realize you\u2019ve made a career out of doing something\nyou didn\u2019t consider work because you were too busy having too much fun. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy Patreon: It is costly to\ncover NASCAR, mainly because of the travel required. You can help with a monthly pledge \u2013 as much as you feel comfortable providing. As I\nsaid in a previous post here, I believe if you are willing to contribute, you\ndeserve my best effort no matter how much or how little you can afford. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also said no matter what\nyou decide, we\u2019d get along just fine. That hasn\u2019t changed either.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor those who have already taken\nthe plunge along with me, I appreciate your support more than you will ever\nknow. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs always, thanks for\nstopping by.\u003cbr\u003e"
