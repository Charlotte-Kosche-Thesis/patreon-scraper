    "summary": "Hey guys. my name is Kirby Downey. For those who know me have seen my work know I have a passion for bringing to life to your favourite weapons and replicas from games and movies. Those who don\u0027t know me, let me tell you a little story. I\u0027m a qualified product designer, I have taken my skills as well as a trusty 3D printer and use them to build awesome replicas and weapons from popular games and movies. I then make videos in Youtube explaining my process and showcasing the model. Now the awesome part is the assets of the work I do is uploaded for free, so you guys can download the files absolutely free and make your own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to bring things to life for the community and making all these awesome replicas. Unfortunately the behind the scenes costs aren\u0027t free. I would like to use this patreon page to help fund my passion so I can continue to bring this awesome content to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is your patronage going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I have set a few goals, each goal has been set to help me invest back into my channel. From the first goal which will fund me just the basic material to the final goal which be able to help me buy a new printer. With more printers I would be able to make more, as well as setting up a store. With a store I will be able to sell my work to those who don\u0027t have access to 3D printers. thus expanding my reach to more and more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not asking you guys tell help me fund my life style of candy and Lego mini figures. I\u0027m asking for some help in funding my passion for 3D printing and prop making. All the content I create will always be free and what ever funds generated will go directly back into my channel and my work so I can continue to create this awesome content for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not compulsory to fund me, but with funding I can strive to bring more and better content more frequently. My videos will always be free and my files will always be uploaded for free regardless to how much is funded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as your Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a short list of rewards. the most basic being a simple mention in a credit role at the end of every video, to getting custom STL files with your name on and also where you will get a custom replica designed for you and only for you. you will also play a hand in the content i create as well as early access to the files I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce the patreon has grown to the point it can allow me to upgrade my internet I will hold live streams for my patreons and tutor you guys through my process in a private stream. This is the biggest way I can give back to you guys for helping me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my page I will give constant updates on what I\u0027m working on and the progress so you guys are not left in the dark. I want to be as transparent with this as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I can do this on a more frequent basis I will generate a road map for few months so you guys can see what I have planned. Those with a higher donation will help in the planning if this road map.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for making it all the way here. if so I can see you believe in me and what I do. Funding me is not compulsory. I will continue to create this content for you guys as long as I can. I\u0027m passionate about this and the community and I still want to bring my bit to the table in any way I can.\u003cbr\u003e"
