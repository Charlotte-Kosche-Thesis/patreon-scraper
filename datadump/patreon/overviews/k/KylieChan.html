    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Kylie Chan, an Australian writer of Fantasy and Science Fiction based on the Gold Coast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy books are successful in my home country of Australia, and\nI\u2019ve been shortlisted many times for awards in my country. Not so\nmuch overseas. This means that although I\u2019m popular and well-known here, I\ndon\u2019t have the same sort of profile (and success) elsewhere. Australia has a\nsmall population (and book-buying market) so this dramatically affects my\nearnings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m making enough to live on as a full-time writer: I\u2019m not\nrich but I\u2019m getting by. (I make \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e\nless than most people think I do. If I worked nine-to-five I\u2019d be bringing in\nminimum wage. This isn\u2019t really relevant, though, because 1. It\u2019s a\nfourteen-hour-day and 2. I don\u2019t really consider it work.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis Patreon is to provide additional income for me to\nimplement two projects:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1. Travel to the places I need to go to bring\nlocations to life. One obvious place I need to go is Uluru (I\u2019ve never been\nthere!). I need to go to Europe and investigate more sites for the Simone\nspinoff. Some extra income will help me to do this!\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e2. Allow me to travel to more conventions. I had an excellent\nrelationship with Oz Comic-Con in the past, but the con was sold to a big corporation, and to date they\nhaven\u2019t spoken to me about continuing with them. They also cancelled Perth and\nAdelaide when they took over. I\u2019d love to continue to do conventions, but it\u2019s not economically feasible (even\nwhen I sell my own books) \u2013 particularly when it\u2019s Perth or Adelaide. This Patreon will give me the ability to choose which conventions I want to do, and maybe even do\nsome cons overseas! If this works out and I do end up at cons, top-tier\nsupporters can come along to the con, sit behind the table with me if you like,\nand spend the day. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nHopefully we can get this Simone spinoff up and running, and\nhave the Emma and John story back in print and, as the Jade Emperor said,\n\u2018follow their antics\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e"
