Are you having a good day? I hope so! My name is Katie and I\u2019ll be your host this evening. Thank you for choosing the Kathryn McCloud Photography Patreon Tour. We know you have your choice of Patreon tours and appreciate your choice to come to ours.\u003cbr\u003eOn your left, you\u2019ll see the goals that I have for this patreon. They include the creation of a sweet diggity photobook, hardcover and everything, very shiny, as well as a couple of other fun things like the unlocking of a lewd tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn your right, you\u2019ll notice the reward tiers. They\u2019re named after image files because I think that I\u2019m incredibly clever. Over here, you can find things like prints, postcards, signed stuff, and vlogs of me being really awkward and not knowing where to put my hands because I\u2019m behind the camera for a reason and the reason is I\u2019m very awkward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all seriousness though, I have been doing photography for 10 years now, and I absolutely love it. It fuels my creativity like nothing else ever has, and I desperately want to make a living at it. Retail sucks guys. If you want to help me out on this journey, I would love to have you along. I\u2019ll send you postcards with weird pictures drawn on them and stories about my dog eating a tube of face primer. I\u2019ll send you snaps of me at shoots and badly describing what I want my models to do but them somehow understanding anyway. Whether you end up becoming a patron or not, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re even reading this far. It\u2019s hard to wade through my weird sometimes. Just know that I love you and appreciate you and I hope that your week is good and that you eat something delicious for dinner tonight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eKatie\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gassyunicorn.com/collections/kathryn-mccloud-print-shop\"\u003ePrint Shop Here!!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
