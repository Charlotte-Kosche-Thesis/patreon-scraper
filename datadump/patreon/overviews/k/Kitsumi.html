    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I am Kitsumi, and I have been creating art centered around the anthropomorphic fandom for pretty much half my life. :) This makes me feel old, oh dear. I have always had a fondness towards animals, especially birds! I adore birds. I attend a few conventions throughout the year; in addition to the income, it always makes me so happy to see my fans enjoy artwork I create for them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince moving to the Pacific North West, I have been freelancing full time on occasional animation projects as they come my way, and lately my staple has been commissions and streaming for the fandom as I continue my online studies in improving my art and design skills. I love watercolor and ink, though I find myself dabbling less and less with traditional media with the demand and convenience of digital work. Oftentimes I dream of getting back into painting and crafting and working with clay, but personal projects unfortunately don\u0027t pay the bills (yet). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help me out, I am hoping to be able to dedicate more time to my personal projects. I worry at times that I will burn out again, I had taken a break from the fandom for a couple years for this reason. I feel strongly that personal work is extremely important to keeping one\u0027s creativity stoked and thriving.\u00a0 I have been hoping to create more work for non profit organizations, such as around topics like environmental conservation, and educating and crafting (and giving away for free) seed packets to help bring back Monarch butterflies to the Pacific North West, and also personal projects such as soap making, comics, and fine art. I would like to cut back on expenses also by making my own fine art prints at home, and acquiring a button maker. And most important to me, getting back into ceramics! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, this patreon is supporting my creativity. Oftentimes the work I and my audience enjoys most is the stuff that is completely spontaneous and unplanned for. But creative work doesn\u0027t come out of thin air either, and my most successful work has always been triggered by inspiration BUT I run with the idea in my own way. This is a good example: In a free sketch stream Joey-poey asked for a Calvin \u0026amp; Hobbes inspired snow scene. I immediately thought of the Wells Fargo commercial where the snowmen (happily) gave up their carrot noses so the horses can make their journey to deliver gifts to the town. Add in some of my warped artistic sensibilities and this is what I came up with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.weasyl.com/static/media/d8/fc/a2/d8fca286e069f80541fbb3b8a49c4f87de6136b3a0eedee0da4078dc404e55e2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a real conundrum - we all need stable finances to survive, unfortunately, when one creates art specifically for money (\"What can I draw that people will want to buy?\") and not for the heart of artwork (No restrictions, anything goes!), it can suffer creatively and fall flat. Supporting my work through patreon and tips lets me not worry about the financial aspects and just focus on the creativity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see some of my anthropomorphic artwork on \u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~kitsumi\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWeasyl\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kitsumi\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFA.\u003c/a\u003e I also stream live my digital drawing processes on \u003ca href=\"https://www.tigerdile.com/stream/kitsumi/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTigerdile\u003c/a\u003e weekly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "This will replenish art supplies I go through often, such as my inking cartridges, paper, and my watercolor pans. I used to love using Pitt Pens, but I would go through ten pens a convention and have to throw them out. Since then I have found a refillable inking pen. What I would love to do however is purchase more watercolor colors to experiment and create new palettes to work with! Meeting this goal will let me get a new watercolor tube or two a month. This will also let me experiment with more quality paper types and colors! Quality \nwatercolor paper can be quite expensive, and this will really help fray \ncosts and not let me worry about conserving my supplies which means more fun experiments! \u003cbr /\u003e",
