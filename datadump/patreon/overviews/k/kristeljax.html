You might know me from \n\u003ca href=\"http://kristeljax.com/therapy.html\"\u003eDrone Therapy\u003c/a\u003e, the Instagram @\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dyingbutfine/\"\u003edyingbutfine\u003c/a\u003e, my noise project\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kristeljax.com/bardont.html\"\u003eBrigitte Bardon\u2019t\u003c/a\u003e, or my writing. Or maybe you just know my mini\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/lanadelsatan_minipug/\"\u003epug\u003c/a\u003e Lana Del Satan. She says hi too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUntil 2016 I was working as a freelance writer, then my skidillionth nervous breakdown made me unable to function/work. Now I\u2019m just a sad goth searching for my recovery narrative from an extreme panic disorder \u0026amp; other accompanying terrifying diagnoses.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nMental health issues are usually best dealt with via a combination of medication and talk therapy, yet the Ontario government will only pay for my medication, not my therapist \u2014 yes, there are options for free / low-cost counseling programs in Toronto, I actually made a pretty extensive list of them\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kristeljax.com/DroneTherapyHandbook.pdf\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, but most are short term and I\u2019ve pretty much exhausted those options. I\u2019ve made progress and have a lot of coping mechanisms now, but the intensity of my symptoms means I\u2019m still struggling to hang on, never mind figure this out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo get my recovery narrative to a place where I\u2019m functional and working full time again, I need to address the root of my trauma. I\u2019ve found a relational psychoanalyst who\u2019s generously offered to lower her rates for me to $40 per session (still inaccessible to me, even though she usually charges $140 per session). If I make $160 per month on Patreon, I can afford to see her every week!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd, keep\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjgbgm/kristel-jax-uses-drone-music-as-therapy-mental-health-canada-stressweek2017\"\u003emaking work about it\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSOME MORE ABOUT MY WORK\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBefore settling permanently in Toronto, I spent nearly a decade riding Greyhounds and sleeping on couches, floors, and above doors. I toured 20 countries as one half of experimental music duo Alpha Couple. In 2010 I co-founded and curated Freud\u0027s Bathhouse \u0026amp; Diner, a DIY art space in Winnipeg. I used to run a micro-press for handmade books \u0026amp; comics. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy work traces the impossibility of a single narrative by channeling the ambiguity of singular experiences and shifting perspectives in the digital era through\u00a0individualized and emotion based story telling. This is a fancy way of saying I\u2019ve turned my emotional labour into an art practice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://kristeljax.com/images/dronetherapy_electriceclectics.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/drone-therapy-podcast/id1322153680?mt=2\"\u003eDrone Therapy Podcast\u003c/a\u003e came out of my struggles to both process the deterioration of my mental health / functionality / life as I knew it and find accessible, affordable therapy: I wanted to share what I was experiencing and learning through music and humour. Humour-ish. Music-ish. The Drone Therapy project started on Youtube and is now an ongoing podcast and occasional live interactive installation. The more therapy I go to, the more Drone Therapy there will be. Currently I\u0027m releasing 1 or 2 podcasts per month. They\u0027re free to stream \u0026amp; download.

We grew our following over time and now people regularly reach out to me (right now it\u2019s just me running the account) for life advice or to say hi, which is super hecking cute. I also draw\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSlxkWzlyEP/?taken-by=dyingbutfine\"\u003ecomics\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy noise project Brigitte Bardon\u2019t started in 2013 after the breakup of my old band, and I\u2019ve shared stages with Laurel Halo, Mykki Blanco, Grimes, Puce Mary, the Nihilist Spasm Band, Drew McDowall (Coil), Anamai, and Egyptrixx, created multimedia installations and performances, and hosted the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kristeljax.com/poolside.html\"\u003eInfinite Poolside\u003c/a\u003e radio show on TRP (Toronto Radio Project) until they shut down Infinite Poolside re-records full albums or mixtapes so that the listener hears them as they would sound in or at a swimming pool. In 2017 I re-cut \u0026amp; poolsided Todd Hayne\u2019s Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story as a multimedia performance (if you bug me I will try to put up some documentation). People ask my why Bardon\u2019t doesn\u2019t tour, and honestly, I love touring and playing but I\u2019m really hecking sick (like literally sick) and it has to be the right time \u0026amp; place. Feel free to ask~\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople also tell me they miss my writing. I miss writing too. Writing currently still makes me really tired, physically and mentally, and the media landscape also freaks me the fuck out right now. How does one work in cultural criticism ethically in 2018? Idk. Maybe on Patreon. Lol. For now if you want to read my writing, I\u2019m doing the occasional thing in Toronto \u0026amp; I\u2019ll be releasing writing to Patreon Infinity Pal subscribers sometimes. And if you\u0027re an editor and want me to write a thing feel free to reach out, it makes me happy \u0026amp; I\u2019ll always see what I can do~\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for being a pal \u0026amp; hanging w/ me \u0026amp; Lana xo \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://instagram.fybz1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b39b35c605938a45b56ffc632e713bc0/5AEB8C50/t51.2885-15/e35/22858103_510983879252141_6013448337502502912_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eillustration:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.blanketpile.com/\"\u003eblanketpile.com\u003c/a\u003e; photo\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/invisiblecity_/\"\u003eInvisible City\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
