I\u0027ve been making indie games for a couple of years as a 2D/3D artist and games designer. I\u0027m also an amateur voice actress in my spare time, known for my apparently soothing voice and quirky Northern English accent.\u003cbr\u003eMy videos make learning the complex field of art and making game assets a bit less intimidating, and if you want to learn that stuff in the chillest way, why not support my Patreon so I can make more of that kind of thing?"
