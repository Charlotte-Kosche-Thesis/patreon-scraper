    "summary": "Hey there! \u00a0I\u0027m Kristen: Khaleesi of the #HugheyCrew, cosplay addict, gamer, pin-up enthusiast, lover of all things Hello Kitty, Super Sonico \u0026amp; Cinderella, and wannabe dork-of-all-trades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my cosplay adventures as a fatally shy, awkward human who just wanted to attend a con to force herself out of her shell, make awesome costumes and meet other gamers (or at least awkwardly stand next to them in real life). \u00a0I had no idea what I was getting myself into. \u00a0Cosplay has changed my life in more ways than I could ever imagine; it has made me grow leaps and bounds as a person, allowed me to connect with the most amazing humans around the world, and has completely rerouted my planned career path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat seems like a lifetime ago, I was pursuing degrees in biology and education, simply because I love to learn and had no idea what I wanted to be if I grew up. \u00a0I attended my first convention in 2012. \u00a0I finally felt so at home that I put every fiber of my being into making costumes, making new friends who enjoyed the same quirky things as I do and sharing those passions and my life on social media daily. \u00a0I don\u0027t exactly know how all of this unfolded, but I now travel the world as a guest at comic/gaming/anime/pop culture conventions almost weekly to meet other like-minded people, judge costume contests, and host panels (I still can\u0027t believe that one) about anything from confidence/acceptance, bullying, cosplay as craft/hobby/business to gaming and anything else that comes to mind during Q\u0026amp;As. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m not traveling non-stop, I live-stream my gaming adventures with my followers on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/kristenhughey\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch TV\u003c/a\u003e, which is probably my favorite thing ever! \u00a0Regardless of travel, I do all sorts of things to keep me able to provide daily content as well: making costumes, doing photoshoots, filming/editing videos, interacting on 5+ social media pages, inventory/signing/packaging/shipping print orders, handling business e-mails, writing contracts, taking care of my at-home life and furbabies, and taking care of myself. \u00a0It\u0027s all a bit of chaos right now and I feel like I can\u0027t give anyone or anything 100% when I do back-to-back...-to-back-to-back-to-back shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where you guys come in.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0I want to streamline my content producing process and create the best possible stuff I can for you guys on a regular basis! \u00a0The best way I can think of doing that is to have you more involved in the creation process. \u00a0That\u0027s why I have started this page: to have a tight-knit, exclusive #HugheyCrew club for everyone who enjoys what I do and wants to be more involved! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI absolutely love what I do and will never stop posting free content on my other social media platforms.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0I just want to do even more... on a balanced/regular schedule. \u00a0With my current convention schedule, I am home for approximately 10 full days out of the month (often times less). \u00a0Most of that time home has to be dedicated to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shopkristenhughey.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy online print/calendar shop\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0I end up losing so much of my time to express my creativity through what started all of this: making costumes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would I do if I was able to dedicate more time to content creation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will be able to level up my skills now that I have time for sewing/leather working/sculpting/etc. classes! \u00a0I want to make bigger, more badass and more well-constructed costumes. \u00a0I miss making new costumes consistently in general. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew costumes + extra time = even more photoshoots! \u00a0I do two guaranteed photoshoots a month in this club, which is where the monthly exclusive print (see tier rewards) and all the monthly content comes from. \u00a0I have two different feeds: the basic feed is mostly a cosplay and life track and the higher tier feed is catered more towards my model type shoots (boudoir, cosplay boudoir, pinup, etc.). \u00a0Of course, the higher tier gets access to both tracks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e#HugheyCrew Twitch streams already made a bit of a comeback thanks to my club members here for a while! \u00a0I do both crafting streams and gaming streams when I have free time, but I\u0027d love to be able to push this to full-time. \u00a0Twitch is definitely one of my happy places in life. \u00a0Come hang out with me \u0026amp; watch the costumes that you are allowing me to create come to life some time!!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI am currently developing a YouTube series dedicated to helping people in the cosplay world. \u00a0I have been working on this for over a year. \u00a0I have a ton of content ready to film and some already filmed! \u00a0I just need a better schedule to be able to film and edit everything. \u00a0Or maybe clones. \u00a0I need clones.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027d probably/definitely snuggle my furbabies all.the.time. \u0026lt;3\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I have no doubt that we can make all of this happen. \u00a0I don\u0027t expect to be able to achieve all of this overnight, but I\u0027m excited to see where this takes us! \u00a0Let\u0027s do the thing together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo,\u003cbr\u003eKristen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you like what I do and want to see even more, I hope you\u00a0consider joining our exclusive #HugheyCrew club!
