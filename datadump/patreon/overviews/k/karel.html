    "summary": "Entertainment is changing. When I started at KFI Los Angeles, hosts were well paid and programming was wonderful. Now, everyone has to work for next to nothing and content sucks. So, we have to take it back. But entertainers need to live as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBe sure to follow the Karel Cast at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.spreaker.com/show/the-karel-cast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpreaker\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been able to keep my content under the old monetizing paradigm, meaning I was paid enough at KFI and KGO to not worry about it because I know times are hard and people are strapped. You see, I want the person on Social Security or State Aid as well as the millionaire to enjoy my show: everyone. So, I felt I had to keep it free.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter KFI was KGO, and again, it helped me keep my other content free. Now that I\u0027m moving online for audio and then to TV as well, it\u0027s going to take the support of you to keep progressive, funny, LGBT-friendly bottom-line entertainment and views coming your way and for all to hear. Progressive radio is all but gone but not here! Enjoy an hour a day of audio, as well as video and other content. That\u0027s 20 hours a month plus of a broadcast like no other. From the biggest newsmakers or celebrities, to fun out-of-studio events, rants on topics of the day or just fun laughs, The Karel Cast has been the place to go for a no-holds-barred uproarious experience. It can stay that for the next with your support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWithout your support ... well, let\u0027s just say a girl\u0027s gotta eat. I need this to work, entertaining you, making you laugh, think, cry, being your friend when you\u0027re alone in your ear or making several of you laugh out loud at once...it\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can see and hear everything at my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.karel.media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, Spreaker, iTunes, TuneIn, Youtube, GCN Satellite, CRN Cable Radio Network, KGOE Eureka, RadioMonterey.com and more. But it will disappear without your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I\u0027m asking you to keep my voice alive in broadcasting, TV, stage and beyond! Let\u0027s keep a fun show that deals with issues in a unique way on the air.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
