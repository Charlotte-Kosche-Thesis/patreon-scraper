    "summary": "Hello friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really excited to be launching this community, and I\u0027m so glad that you\u0027re taking this leap with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past 15 years, I\u0027ve dreamed about what it would feel like to be approached by \u0027industry\u0027 people, and what it would take for me to be willing to sign on with a company, label, or representation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis feeling is a mystery no more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this last year, I\u0027ve built a lot of momentum around my career. Sharing the stage with Pete Seeger opened up the door to more opportunities than I could have ever imagined, and folks have started to take notice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so grateful, and I\u0027m also more aware than ever that my independence is an asset.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an independent artist, the only thing that I answer to is my integrity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is where I\u0027m asking for your trust and partnership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love for you to join my community as I continue to release new songs and projects. What types of projects? I have so many ideas! A sing-along album, a Spanish album, a lullaby album...there are so many things that I want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how do you join in?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, you just pledge to buy what I release. You pledge to trust me. The price that you pay is completely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing approximately a song a month. Some months more, and some months, I might have nothing to put out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it works: You pay what you want per song. On a month where I release two songs, you\u0027ll be charged twice, and on a month where I release one song, you\u0027ll be charged once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSay that I have a super productive month and release 27 songs!?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, that would be amazing, and I would love for that month to happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, you can put a cap on what you spend in a month. This way, you can easily stay within your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReleasing music when I want, to people who want it, is the way that I\u0027ve always done things. Working with this community will allow me to get new music out more quickly and more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it helps me keep my independence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make sure that I remain a grounded and compassionate human. Actually, I need to make sure that I remain a grounded and compassionate human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep teaching music camp on the reservation. I want to keep helping with health clinics in the mountains of Mexico. I want to keep writing songs that matter. And I want to get these songs out to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music business is shifting, and for that I\u0027m grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo longer do I need to look to the gate-keepers so that I can \u0027make it\u0027 as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m making it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in this community I can continue to make it. I\u0027ll make music. I\u0027ll share it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound anything like what we\u0027ve been doing for the last 15 years?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping me make music that matters. Thank you for confirming what I know: you can make music and keep your conscience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to write songs about social justice in the world, and I will continue to spread hope and optimism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being a part of this community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003eKristen\u003cbr\u003e"
