It is going to be a graphic novel written and drawn by Kathryn Silver from Indianapolis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePremise: AU during the cold war in Russia a new artifact had been found. Pens that could produce living drawings were stolen and distributed.\u003cbr\u003eOut of these stolen pens one landed in the hands of Sophie, who\u0027s brother is part of the military trying to recover the pens to gain status. When Sophie uses the stolen pen she creates Dimitri a cat who is the exact opposite of Sophie. Sophie is taken out of her home and placed in an artists colony for safety by her father. This Artists colony is safe haven for artists throughout the country and the only militia free zone. Although Sophie at first blames Dimitri for ripping her out of her home, their connection is unbreakable. But when Hana the first artist to create a drawing comes to ask for help to get her drawing, Alastor, from the bowls of the Russian militia, will Sophie continue to protect Dimitri from being kidnapped like Alastor? Will her sympathy for Hana take over for them to complete a task that is impossible? After all Hana was the former generalissimo\u0027s daughter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that this is going to be a wonderful story that tugs on the heartstrings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy ~Ksilvs\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
