    "summary": "Greetings!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Kevin Cozens. I love Open Source hardware and software. I have worked on, and supported, various hardware and software projects since long before the term Open Source existed. I also like 3D modelling, amateur radio, photography, and playing guitar and mandolin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy Background\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI became interested in electronics and computers in my teen years. They became the basis of my hobbies and my career. By profession I work with electronics, and program computers and microcontrollers. I used to work 9 to 5 until a company I had been working for changed direction and closed the engineering department I was in. Since then I have been working for various clients on a contract basis.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Past\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 1992 I worked on my first project that would be called an Open Source project today. The project was the \n\u003cstrong\u003ePoor Man\u0027s Packet software\u003c/strong\u003e used by the amateur radio community. I fixed a number of bugs in the software, improved existing features, and added some new ones. I also fixed a problem with the modem hardware that was commonly used with the software.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 1994 I learned about Linux from some co-workers. In the Fall of that year I used it for the first time on my home computer. I discovered a world of software that was free and for which the source code was available.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 1998 I made my first contribution to one of the Open Source programs I had discovered. I still contribute to that project to this day. The BlackDuck (a site that has statistics about Open Source projects) shows that I have created, or made changes to, \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.openhub.net/accounts/kcozens/positions\"\u003e15 projects\u003c/a\u003e with over 1,000 commits of code and documentation changes to those projects. The actual number of commits is higher but BlackDuck doesn\u0027t count changes made to branches.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Present\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI support a number of Open Source software projects. The main ones I support are:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGIMP\u003c/strong\u003e: A free and open source image editor\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThis was the first project I worked on and still support. I maintain the Script-Fu plug-in and its associated scripts. I occasionally work on the BABL and GEGL libraries it uses.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOpenSimulator\u003c/strong\u003e: a multi-platform, multi-user, 3D application server\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am a member of the core developer team. I maintain the PHP based search and profile modules. I created a PHP based mutelist module. I also run the weekly developer meetings.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKiCad\u003c/strong\u003e: a cross-platform electronics design automation suite\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI use this suite of programs for my hardware projects. I have found and reported bugs which were soon fixed. I provided one small patch that is now part of the main code base.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTinyScheme\u003c/strong\u003e: a tiny cross-platform Scheme interpreter for embedding in programs.\u003cbr\u003e\nI am the only active maintainer/developer for this project.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the above projects, and others, my areas of support includes: reporting bugs, triaging bug reports, providing patches to fix bugs, documentation, participating in mailing list discussions, and supporting users via the projects IRC channel and/or mailing list. I can be found almost every day in the IRC support channels for the above listed projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of the Open Source related work I have done to date has been \nsoftware related. Since I discovered the Hackaday website I have been \nusing it to publish some of \n\u003ca href=\"https://hackaday.io/projects/hacker/77618\"\u003emy hardware projects\u003c/a\u003e. I have some other hardware projects currently ongoing which I will also publish on Hackaday.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWorking under contract (rather than at a traditional 9 to 5 job) has \nmade it possible for me to support various Open Source projects.\nI really like producing and supporting Open Source projects. I like the variety of the work involved and I get to work with different programming languages.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n If you are using any of the projects I have worked on, or if you just use and love Open Source as I do, your monthly donations will allow me to continue producing and supporting Open Source projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you don\u0027t want to make monthly donations you can:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003emake a \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/edit/%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.paypal.me/KevinCozens\"\u003eone time donation\u003c/a\u003e via\u00a0PayPal\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3V7JHSVX1HS78\"\u003ebuy me something\u003c/a\u003e from my\u00a0Amazon wishlist\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFinal words\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for taking the time to read what I\u0027ve written above. I may have been a bit long-winded (which Patreon suggests is a bad thing) but I want you to know that I\u0027m not some \"here today, gone tomorrow\" person. I\u0027ve been involved in the Open Source community for many years and I expect to continue doing so for many more years to come.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
