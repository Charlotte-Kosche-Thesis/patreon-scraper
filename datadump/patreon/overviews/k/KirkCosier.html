     "about": "Kirk Cosier is a 22 year old producer and DJ hailing from Bridgeport, CT. He has played for crowds for 2,500 plus people in arenas, concert halls and clubs in New York. He has opened for acts like Richard Grey, KDrew, DJ Juicy M, Zaxx, Lookas and more. He is also the host for Nextgen Records weekly podcast. \u003cbr\u003eIt all started at the age of 14 when Kirk picked up his first instrument, a bass guitar. Fueled by amazement and curiosity Kirk sat with his bass guitar in front of the computer learning from players like Victor Wooten, Bootsy, Stanley Clark and Flea. He watched countless hours of solos, tutorials, and taught himself basic music theory. There was no stopping him. All he wanted to do was ingest and learn as much as he could. At the age of 16 Kirk was introduced to his first digital audio workstation, Garageband. Humble beginnings. Just like the bass guitar he taught himself how to work with audio in the digital domain through trial and error. He spent countless hours of tweaking learning and developing. As a junior in high school he found his life calling. He was designed to express himself through music. By the age of 19 He decided to pursue a higher education in the art of recording and enrolled himself at Full Sail University in Orlando, Florida. There he gained the technical skill and knowledge to thrive as an industry professional. He was equipped and ready to take the work by storm. Soon after graduation he started working on perfecting his skills as a DJ.\u003cbr\u003e\u2028\"My main goal with every song I write is to show the world that we can be one as a race. Music is the glue that brings us together,\" said Kirk Cosier. Inspired by the sounds of many by greats such as, Markuz Shulz, Ferry Corsten, Dada Life, He has thrown his own flavor into the music he likes with remixes, and created high energy tracks for the dance floor. in addition he is the host for Nextgen Records\u0027 weekly podcas",
