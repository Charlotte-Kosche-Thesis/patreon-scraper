    "summary": "What is up everybody! We are Kisstory Science Theatre, one of the world\u0027s most popular KISS podcasts. We have been bringing the highs and lows of the hottest band in the world to thousands of you for over five years now, and we do every bit of it out of pocket. We\u0027re three working guys with families who do this thing out of a love for the art of the podcast and a love for KISS, and we\u0027ve got all kinds of ideas for things we want to do with the show, but everything costs money- be it bandwidth, gear, or the dreaded storage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, a few fans have suggested the idea of contributing to the show financially, so we decided to invite you guys to do just that. The show will continue to be %100 free forever (and that is a straight up promise), but if you want, you can kick a little money in every time we do a show. Patreon lets you pay with Paypal or your credit card, and *you* choose how much you want to pay. If only a quarter of you kick in a single dollar for every episode, we could afford new gear to make the show sound better than ever, more storage space so we can bring you even more podcasts without sacrificing audio quality (maybe even pull a couple of the old retired ones out of the closet as a treat, who knows?), and of course, we solemnly promise to spend any leftover funds on beer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the point- we think our show has possibilities we haven\u0027t explored yet, and we\u0027re excited to go to these places. But we won\u0027t be able to get there without a little help! Our show has always had a fantastic, loyal following (some of who have been with us since the Youtube days!), and we want to take you guys on this adventure with us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we want to reward you! Every podcast the KST Network produces will be uploaded here before anywhere else. Right now it\u0027s usually only a couple of hours early, but I want to start getting them on here a day or two in advance for you. We\u0027ll come up with some other stuff for you as we go along, maybe have some of you call in, we\u0027ll see what happens. It all depends on what you want and ask for- so let us know what kind of rewards you\u0027d like to see from us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for reading all this, we really appreciate every single one of you who listens to the show. Having an audience who appreciates what we do is all any of us has ever wanted in life- you guys have made that happen. Who wants to join us in taking the next step?\u003cbr\u003e"
