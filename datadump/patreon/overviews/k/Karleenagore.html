In the best of ways!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am here to inspire, to be a positive influence and tell the world you can make that silly childhood dream a reality!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI struggled in school as a child, I was horriable at math, reading was a challenge and everyone thought I was a.d.d... what child isn\u0027t?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI never knew what I wanted to be... I only knew that I was great at sports and being goofball.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will say that I was a challenging teenager. I ran away from home, drank and hung out with the wrong crowd, had severe depression; which lead to my long stay at boarding school. We were told how to live our lives, how to think..\u003cbr\u003eI always felt that there was something wrong with me? I hated myself and had no understanding of who I was.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I returned home, still feeling lost in life I stumbled upon a modeling gig..It wasn\u0027t JUST a modeling gig it was a HORROR modeling gig and I was hooked.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis was the first thing in years that made me feel alive, helped me feel comfortable in my own skin again. This helped build my confidence, helped me with public speaking, helped get me out of unhealthy relationships and lead to making some life long friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dabbled in college.. but nothing ever stuck, I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that this route is not for me.\u00a0I was a pre-k teacher for 3 years.. it was fun but didn\u0027t bring me that happiness that I was seeking. \u003cbr\u003eDuring this time I preformed in a number of music videos, and discovered the world of stuntwork and pro wrestling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThat was it.. there was no going back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI decided to take a risk and give up my teaching job, take the risk of following my dreams with all of my heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt was the best decision that I have ever made...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot all of it has been easy, there have been financial ups and downs, injuries, periods with no work and sometimes the fact of being a woman in a male dominated industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBeing in both industries has helped me be able to confidently take charge of my life and inspire others to follow their hearts. I hope to continue to be a inspiration especially to the females out there who might be \"too\" tiny, a little socially awkward, scared to take that leap, a misfit. Often WE are the ones who take the world by storm! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy future plans are to teach others how to be comfortable in their own skin, use their strengths, follow their own paths and that can be a force to be reckoned with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDo everything out of love and not fear.
