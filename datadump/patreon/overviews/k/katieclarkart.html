I\u0027m Katie, and I paint things that make me happy! A large amount of my art is based on video games I have loved since I was 5 years old. Nintendo is heavily represented in my work - it was my dream since I was very little to work there, and I \u003cem\u003emade that dream come true\u003c/em\u003e! I worked as an artist for Nintendo for 6 years, and am proud to have my name on video games and apps in some of my favorite series - \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario, Metroid, Kirby, Donkey Kong, \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eAnimal Crossing\u003c/em\u003e!

I work crazy long hours (even more than I worked in an industry that is known for insane overtime!), but I \u003cem\u003eLOVE \u003c/em\u003ewhat I do. The financial support from Patreon helps me to continue to paint things that make people smile and laugh; I believe it is good for the world, as silly as that might sound! I want to be an example of doing what you love, and creating a happy and successful life through it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKatie \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u2665\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
