    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing aims to capture the ways that music reminds us of our own humanity, keeps us engaged and invested in the world, and moves us through our lives. I\u0027ve been writing about music since 2013, because I love to do it. It makes my heart feel like a cozy animal. My early articles can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://withabuzz.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e. My most recent can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@karljsnyder\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.frontrunnermagazine.com/author/karl-snyder/\"\u003eFrontrunner Magazine\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, I created this Patreon page as a way of shifting the role of writing in my life. Rather than writing \"when I have time\" or \"on the side\", I am now writing more consistently, more seriously, and even--dare I say--professionally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis shift is exciting, and in some ways it is a relief. The most exciting prospect is that I will have more ownership over the ways I spend my time and what I think about on a daily basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, this shift also requires a period of\u00a0financial sacrifice. Making connections and improving my writing takes time, and some of that time will be borrowed from time I could be earning money at an office job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps in multiple ways:\u003cbr\u003e1) In order to do my best thinking and writing, I need to vary my environment. I especially need to leave my house in order to do so. Your support helps me buy coffee and baked goods in locally owned writing environments where it would be rude not to.\u003cbr\u003e2) Some days the faceless, massive cloud of societal pressure and self-doubt that tells me to give up on pursuing a career in freelance feels especially strong. On those days, your support reminds me that I have a powerful network of thoughtful, passionate individuals who believe in me.\u003cbr\u003e3) During the journey towards developing stable, trusting relationships with paying editors, I will sometimes write without pay when necessary. Your support helps bolster my income during those times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for everything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*****\u003cbr\u003eOne additional logistical note: none of the images that I post on this page belong to me. I use images with the intention of promoting the artists I write about.\u003cbr\u003e"
