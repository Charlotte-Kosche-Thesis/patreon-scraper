I\u0027m a library assistant, knitting designer, and, most importantly here, a writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, I know, you\u0027ve probably never heard of me. Hopefully that will change soon, but you can see some of my poetry and short fiction over on my website, \u003ca href=\"http://katriddellwrites.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write mostly poetry, some short fiction, and I\u0027m working on a novel. I\u0027ve been writing poetry obsessively since high school, when my English teacher handed me a collection by Rita Dove.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because I want more time to write and think about writing. I am chronically ill- I have Type 1 Diabetes, assorted autoimmune issues, and anxiety and depression, which adds a certain urgency to financial worries. Having your support means that all that time and energy can be redirected into writing more stuff, which I would love to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get here? You\u0027ll get exclusive access to works in progress, early access to poems, and whatever other cool tidbits I can share with you all. All patrons will get access to at least one poem every month, as well as general progress updates from me and notifications when my work gets published elsewhere."
