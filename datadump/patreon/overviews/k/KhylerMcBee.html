    "summary": "Ever since I first got my hands on my parents camcorder as a kid, I\u0027ve been in love with making films. The internet has given me an amazing opportunity to share my life and the stories I\u0027ve experienced through out it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 2016 a game on my phone captivated me in a way that no other game has.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I met so many interesting people and explored new places I\u0027ve never been to. I spent entire nights running around town with strangers catching invisible monsters on my phone. Later, I discovered a community of creators who express themselves and have found friendship through this game. I found a way to combine my love for making films and my love for the community of this game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u003cstrong\u003en 2018, I\u0027m ready to take this passion to a new level\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve played this game and created videos around my travels through out the Northwest and even made it all the way down to Mexico. These were amazing opportunities but these travels are only just the start. Pokemon GO is a global game and I want to bring the global experience of this game to your screen. Regional exclusive Pokemon are great incentive to travel alone but I want to also share the culture and stories from where those Pokemon come from. In a daily adventure show based around Pokemon GO, I want to show you the world and provide an interesting trainer experience. Anyone can spoof to Merida Mexico and catch a Corsola, but traveling there myself and catching one while exploring the ruins of an ancient Mayan Civilization is the kind of experience I want, and have brought, to my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patreon, you help make this whole thing possible. Creating consistent higher quality content for my channel would not be possible with out your support. With your support, I\u0027m able to create and share meaningful, cultural based, travel incentivized content for my channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatching the videos I create means a lot to me alone. Thank you for taking the time, I hope you enjoy them. Becoming a Patreon doesn\u0027t just help me make high quality content, You also will be a larger part of the production. In the side bar you can see the full list of perks, some of these include private discord servers where you can discuss ideas directly with me along with naming one of my Pokemon, so you\u0027re contribution will always be on my on my team. Thank you!"
