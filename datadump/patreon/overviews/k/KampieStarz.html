I am currently cleaning up for the rebranding of my Patreon. The Reward Tiers right now will better reflect what you will see here and what the rewards are. Sorry for any confusion as rebuilding is taking longer than I thought. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am 38 years old, from the great state of West Virginia. I have been doodling and drawing as far back as I can remember, loving colors especially. I worked at the Walt DisneyWorld resort for 10 years and at that point, my body was showing signs of chronic illness and after a breakdown, I moved back to where I grew up hoping to be someone with a purpose. I really feel that helping others be motivated with their dreams and enjoy their own little worlds as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI love to draw original characters for others. The fun of creating something from nothing excites me. Recently I have been working on a coloring journal and fan art. I can\u0027t help it I love ninja turtles. I am working on getting a coloring book out there for a Kickstarter to hopefully fund more of my motivational paper products. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen you join at the $5 tier and above you will receive a mini welcome gift with your first payment. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe discord server is where all works in progress will be going as well as discussions about my works. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI guess that is all for now. Please feel free to follow if you can\u0027t subscribe just yet. \u003cbr\u003eThis is a rebuilding effort that I hope to have updated by the end of April! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/f9e7ce589192c5b034e95068e2277440/tumblr_p7ejc46jiu1stq9kao1_1280.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 200;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/b361ca6be34bbfca5a22c01043ace54e/tumblr_p7ejc46jiu1stq9kao2_400.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 200;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/a0b4b4544f13749343870fc089825664/tumblr_p7ejc46jiu1stq9kao3_400.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 200;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/f18e7fc366a905d6b93a116ee9c63274/tumblr_p7ejc46jiu1stq9kao4_400.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 200;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrints I currently have for sale, 10$ for one and 30 for set!
