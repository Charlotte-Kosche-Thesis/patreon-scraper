Kesha Niya (Sorani Kurdish for \"No Problem\") \nwas founded in march 2016, after \u0027La Liniere\u0027 Camp in Grande Synthe had \nbeen opened in response to the inhumane living conditions in the Grande \nSynthe jungle. We strongly believe current\n borders stand in the way of freedom, safety and human rights for all. \nBorders lead not only to further racism, xenophobia and hatred, but \nalso force people into a position where they\u0027re at incredible risk of \npersecution and often death. We believe that human rights should not \ndepend on where you are born or live and that all people should be \noffered the same opportunities.\u003cbr\u003e A unique characteristic of Kesha Niya is to put emphasis on collaborating and involving refugees in the organisation, aiming for a solidarity action rather than a charity action.\u003cbr\u003e These days we provide food daily for people in the Italian city of Ventimiglia, right in front of the French border, and support with blankets, clothes, and such basic necessities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.keshaniya.org/\"\u003ekeshaniya.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep updated via the facebook page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KeshaNiyaProject/\"\u003efacebook.com/keshaniyaproject\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mashab.weebly.com/uploads/1/6/4/2/16421954/lrm-export-20180227-161617_1_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the current situation\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the French-Italian border, in the town of \nVentimiglia, a fluctuating number of refugees are sleeping rough in a space under a highway bridge. They mean to attempt the rough \nmountain climb into Europe, often getting immediately deported back to Italy again and again. As local government shows no interest in \nproviding basic human facilities, independent volunteers come to \nmeet them in their journey to provide as many people as possible with \nnecessary food and resources.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAn accurate and enlightening report on Ventimiglia from July 2017:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/07/refugees-pass-death-italy-france-170726055256553.html\"\u003eRefugees on the Pass of Death between Italy and France\u003c/a\u003e, Al Jazeera\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/edit/about#situation\"\u003eAlso relevant is \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://drawingthetimes.com/story/ventimiglia/\"\u003ethis 20-page comic report\u003c/a\u003e\n about Kesha Niya\u0027s work in Ventimiglia.
