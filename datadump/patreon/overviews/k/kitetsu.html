XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are the best!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo anyone who wants to support me, you have my eternal gratitude. The support everyone has given me on my YouTube Channel has been phenomenal and overwhelming! If any of you want to support me further, as little as $1 a month could make all the difference to me and my channel. I want to keep making the videos that I love making, and I want to keep putting out good content for all of you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support is optional!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not something you should feel you have to do, it is totally optional and I am super happy with what ever support you may give me. Even if it\u0027s just the likes you give me on my video. That being said, making these videos is hard work. I do a full time job and then come home to make these videos until very late at night. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe money will help me improve my channel and give back to you guys!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have anything to offer you at the moment for your support apart from the knowledge that you will put a massive smile on my face, and the knowledge that you are helping me to keep going with this whole YouTube adventure. My channel needs a lot of things that I would love to do but currently can\u0027t due to financial reasons. I rarely film stuff with a camera because the quality is so bad, but I would love to do more camera work to film painting sessions and maybe show you new products as they are released. I also love doing giveaways on my channel, and wish I could do more but they cost too much for me to do many of at the moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for who I am? My name is Will (but you may know me as Kitetsu). I\u0027m a hard working guy from England, who loves Warhammer Age of Sigmar, and loves talking about it on my Channel. I love talking about the Tactics of the game, the latest News, Theories and Rumours, the Lore and much much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks so much!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you took the time to read any of this, you are amazing. If you support me on Patreon, you are making a real, positive change to my life :)"
