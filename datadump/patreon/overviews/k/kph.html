Thank you all so much - these last two years on Patreon have exceeded my wildest dreams!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you believe in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/new-music-monday/kayley-pruitt-hamm\"\u003ewhat I do\u003c/a\u003e (including organizing uplifting shows with my new band\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/manybestband/\"\u003e\"Manybest\"\u003c/a\u003e)? If you become a patron by pledging a dollar or more per song (I post one song per month), you will be allowing me to keep my body upright enough to play music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy medical treatment is not fully covered by insurance (big surprise) and thus is costing several thousand dollars per month for me to afford medicine that helps me be able to sit upright in a chair and use my fingers to write and play instruments. \u003cstrong\u003eI believe that everyone deserves a fair shot at safe housing, medicine to make them better, clean water to drink and air to breathe, and a feeling of safety.\u003c/strong\u003e I believe we can build a a world in which not just the rich can have those things, but in order to continue making songs and aiding in the movement for that world, I need a foundation of support from you all. Since I\u0027m not able to work a desk job while going through treatment, Patreon is a major way that I am able to pay for my pricey medical bills. So pledge a few bucks and you\u0027ll support\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.meaction.net/2017/04/01/musician-with-me-produces-ep-from-her-bed/\"\u003emy work in the world\u003c/a\u003e, and as a thank you I will give you\u00a0access to scores of all of my music videos, lyrics, and protest songs. Think of Patreon as \u201cpeople\u2019s insurance\u201d - insuring we have a future with art, love, and justice for all. Important: if you become a patron, you are not \"purchasing\" access to exclusive content, you are simply donating monthly to support my medical treatment and the music and events made possible by my getting that treatment. You will get songs and updates on the work you\u0027ve made possible, as any sponsor of a person\u0027s medical treatment might get!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow my projects on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kphmusic/\"\u003eFacebook\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eand Instagram\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kphmusic/\"\u003e@KPHMusic\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story: Why Does Kaeley Need Thousands of $ Per Month?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summer 2014 I moved from Seattle to Washington, DC to start my dream job training youth in advocacy on national policy issues and was LOVING IT. Getting paid to do something you love that feeds to a more just world - pretty, sweet, right? I also was pursuing my dream of being a musician in a more committed way than ever and life felt like a dream. I got a bug bite while camping in WV, though, and suddenly, my plans were thwarted. Mid-action, I ran out of steam and my body started shutting down. It took the doctors a while to figure out what was going on and why my body was fizzling, but finally I was diagnosed with an illness affecting my heart, brain, and joints. It\u0027s called late-stage Lyme disease.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-parish/lyme-the-infectious-disea_b_9243460.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYou can read more about the disease here\u003c/a\u003e and sexism and racism in healthcare exacerbating chronic illness epidemics\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/health-fitness/a26741/doctors-treat-women-like-men/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Insurance isn\u0027t covering my medical bills. Pesky illness! Pesky medical issues! Getting in the way of my plans to make a career out of social justice work and music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy medical treatment has so far been successful and I\u0027m making progress, but I\u0027ve still got a long ways to go. I\u0027m trying to raise enough money that I can count on every month from lovely, generous people like you, in exchange for me continuing doing something that may be valuable to society that I can also do from bed as I heal:\u00a0creating and facilitating tunes that people can listen to, sing along to, chant in the streets with, and generally use to process this wounded world we\u0027re living in as we work for a better, more just one. The money I get from you all won\u0027t go to fancy guitar distortion pedals or microphones; I\u0027m a fan of a lo-fi production process anyway and record most of my songs on Garageband from bed, with donated work from recording producers and collaborating musicians. Instead, I desperately need that money for life-giving medicine that I would not be able to do hardly anything without.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQs from Patrons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a \"patron\" of my music on Patreon, it means you are pledging to sustain my work with a certain amount of money that will charge automatically to your account every time I post a song on this site for \"patrons only.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I only want to support you at $1 per month but you post two songs that month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will try to post about 1-2 songs/videos per month, but you can set a maximum limit per month according to what your income allows by checking a little box that says \"Set Monthly Max.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the \"rewards\" listed on the tiers of levels of support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSongs I write may cover topics ranging from climate justice to income inequity, feminism to war. And\u00a0if you donate $50 or more per song, I will write songs at your request! Need a song for your next food justice rally? Or want a song with which to serenade your sweetie? I got you. Oh, and I might write some songs that aren\u0027t explicitly about social justice, too. They might be about my own personal journey (and yet the personal is political, right?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support! And even if you can\u0027t give money - please keep in touch and enjoy the music for free! The most helpful thing you can still do is to share this page and spread the word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou can\u0027t help it. An artist\u0027s duty, as far as I\u0027m concerned, is to reflect the times.\u201d - Nina Simone\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"If there\u0027s a world here in a 100 years, one of the main reasons will be music. It can leap over barriers of politics...religion...and race...and people who never thought they\u0027d be doing things together will be listening in and joining on the same song.\" - Pete Seeger\u003cbr\u003e"

Activist who plans actions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGrew up in rural Eastern WA where goats and Republicans roam, learned a lot from them (both the goats and people). Roamed the earth a bit learning about what happens when your own country\u0027s policy is to take and hurt without regard for human and environmental consequences. Wrote songs about it. Did some activism in Seattle against corporate ownership of what should belong to the people - healthcare, water, education, etc. Moved to the belly of the beast for a while (Washington DC) to try to do what I could to stop it, and realized what the world might really need is a little harmony. Got diagnosed with a late-stage disseminated disease and that gave me the wake up call and financial crisis I needed to inspire me to start this project on Patreon.",

My medical treatment costs about $2000-3000 per month, minimum. This would allow to not only achieve being able to manage symptoms temporarily but it would allow me to pursue sustainable solutions for my health that don\u0027t mean fizzling out in 5 years after remission.",

     "description": "In order to keep my body upright and my fingers oiled enough to play music, like the tin man, I need many tune-ups! My medical treatment for chronic infections costs several thousand dollars per month, but the very basic \"maintenance\" medical treatment keeping my pancreas from failing and my head upright long enough to play music will cost $2,000 per month - so I\u0027m hoping to count on $1,000 per song! This treatment will be eradicating an infection and help me be well enough to perform in crowds again without too much light or sound senstivity! Remember I post 2 songs per month, so if you pledge $1 per song, unless you specify a monthly maximum, you\u0027ll be charged $2/month.",
