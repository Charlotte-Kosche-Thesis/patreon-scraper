It reveals the beauty of the desert, unfolds the glaciated expanses of the Sierra Nevada, travels deep forests, and provides commanding vistas of volcanic peaks in the Cascade Range. Reaching this goal would allow me to thru-hike the PCT in 2019, and share my experiences with everyone in the form of blogs, art, and comics. These funds would help pay for gear, food, and bills back home.",
