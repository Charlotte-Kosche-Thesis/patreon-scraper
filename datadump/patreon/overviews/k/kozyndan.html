They are obsessed with the ocean and being underwater and hope to \nsomeday come to rest at the bottom of the sea and slowly be devoured by \ndeep creatures over many years. But we have to make some awesome artwork for our solo exhibition before we die in the scuba diving accident. The art show will be at Gregorio Escalante Gallery in Chinatown LA, September 2017\u003cbr\u003e"
