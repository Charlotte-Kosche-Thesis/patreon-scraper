    "summary": "THANK YOU so much for supporting the work that I do. I\u0027ve been a writer for the better part of two decades and what I\u0027ve learned in that time is that what I love most is applying my writing and research skills to helping others. I do this primarily through authentically sharing my own story and helping others to uncover and share their own. The newsletters and creative support available to my Patreon followers are about offering my skills as gifts to help inspire more creativity, more personal growth, more mental health awareness, and more community connection. Below you can check out what I\u0027m about, what you get when you support me, and why I hope you\u0027ll decide to do so. See the \"rewards\" page of Patreon for even more about what\u0027s in it for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than that, I hope that you\u0027ll see that when we donate to independent writers and artists, we are improving the world.\u00a0People who put their heart into their work are\nbetter for this world than people who are doing things rotely. People who\ncreate are bringing new life into our communities. Patreon is a way to give to\nthose people, to say that you support independent art, that you want to see\nindie writers thrive, that you believe in the creative process even more than\nthe products it results in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI commit to using my skills / experience in writing, crafting and therapeutic creativity to assist others in understanding, exploring and achieving their creative dreams, honoring their artistic selves and healing their inner and outer worlds.

This is an outgrowth of my book Hook to Heal, all about using creativity to improve our lives.\u00a0People at higher funding levels can also access my creative support services via both newsletters and personal interaction. This is where I put my psychology education and creative experience to use in helping individuals who want to work on personal growth through crafting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaders can choose the $30 / month option to receive all of my books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNEW: Starting in 2018, I have launched an exciting new newsletter about creative collaboration, which people can access at just a slightly higher funding level. This will share interviews, stories, research and resources about people working creatively together in all kinds of business but with attention to art / craft / making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn more from the \"rewards\" section of Patreon.

I have struggled with depression for most of my life, and I\u00a0have\u00a0worked hard to find a way to remain a creative, productive individual who contributes to my society. Creative, community-building writing is how I do that.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027re supporting the wider craft community by allowing me to continue sharing and supporting their work across social media and in my writing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m no fly-by-night writer. Sometimes you don\u0027t know if you should fund someone independent because you don\u0027t know if they\u0027ll really keep creating. I\u0027ve been self-employed as a writer for the better part of two decades, and my body of work continues growing and developing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll play an important role in taking my writing work to the next level. Less time focused on raising funds means more time devoted to the true art of writing and connecting community together.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll be helping me to help others. As we reach milestones in this community, I donate my work to others.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow The Money Helps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funding allows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreative and emotional space to be able to take the work to the next level. I continually work to take my writing to the next level. My work has included books that I hope have helped others (\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.com/1478190450/?tag=moho-20\"\u003eCrochet Saved My Life\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.com/B018BBHCJQ/?tag=moho-20\"\u003eHook to Heal\u003c/a\u003e), the \u003ca href=\"http://mandalasformarinke.kathrynvercillo.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMandalas for Marinke\u003c/a\u003e depression awareness project (\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2iFx7fo\"\u003enow a book\u003c/a\u003e!). Thanks to the support here, I have been able to \u00a0to offering workshops and online creativity support services. Doing this kind of intensive creative work requires some time to just create. Chasing money to pay the bills each month inhibits this work. Funding directly supports its creation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTime to delve deeper into research to bring you fresh, new, interesting interviews and information about the health benefits of crafting and how to access those benefits. - and in 2018 also about creative collaboration and how to benefit from it whether you work with someone or on your own.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreation of new content that is shared in the monthly Patreon newsletters and beyond. I also write for several websites and magazines and usually have a book project in the works; your funding helps make those things happen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinued self-care and mental health care; this allows me to create and also to give my best self to others to support them in their craft work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNote that you can see in my \"goals\" what the money goes in terms of my specific spending. At each goal level, I also offer donations of my books to charity (generally to mental health organizations) and at higher goals I also offer scholarships to my creativity support program.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArtistic Tithing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things that I\u0027ve written about in my book Hook to Heal is the concept of \"artistic tithing\" which I got from someone else and it resonated with me immediately. It\u0027s the idea that you commit a certain amount of your money to support the art and artists that you love. You might use it to buy indie dyed yarn. You might use it to order handcrafted items from crafters who work in a different medium than you. You might spend it all on gifts at a local craft fair. Or you might choose to spend it supporting work like mine! Please know that I\u0027ll work hard to pay it forward with heartfelt, community-supportive work. Any bit you can offer is so thoroughly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
