Well, that is what I\u0027m here to tell you. Many of you have followed me from the start, and know that my first real adventure with Patreon was for my sweet 13yr old Poodle, Okami. He is in our Cover photo. Sadly, he passed away and one week later his little brother, Momiji the American Eskimo passed. I strayed away from Patreon because it was hard to really continue working without them. I thank you all for your support during that time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have started on a new adventure that I believe they would be proud of. I am starting a training and informational Blog, along with fun photos and exercises you can do with your pup to get them more focused and reliable in their commands! There will be free weekly content of photos, possible videos, and a training tip each week. My goal is to have this as a secondary income to spoil both personal and client pups with. I will be working with clients, and hopefully a shelter as well in order to help pets get adopted out. I look forward to taking this journey with you and thank you for your continued support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
