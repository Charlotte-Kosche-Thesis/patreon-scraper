It\u0027s simple:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith more money, i could actually pay custom-skin-creators for their awesome work \u00a0! (yeah, they do it for free)\u00a0That way we can collaborate and make more funny videos. Also, with current copyright system on YT (oh god it\u0027s awful), i could buy and use better music.\u003cbr\u003eIf i had additional help, then i will have time for improving quality, RP giveaways and making longer episodes !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all help guys :) !\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how do I help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Patreon allows fans to become direct supporters of content they love. \u00a0Its kind of like a kickstarter, but in smaller numbers and on a consistent basis. \u00a0Once you have made an account, you can choose to support me through a donation of your liking. \u00a0It can be as little as 1 dollar or as big as you want. \u00a0This \u0027tip\u0027 or support is applied with each new episode I release, but is not charged until the end of the month. \u00a0There are also bonuses for contributing. \u00a0 If you decide its not worth it anymore or change your mind later, you can cancel at any time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon now accepts PayPal!\u003cbr\u003eIf for some reason you wish to donate through PayPal without using Patreon, you will also receive the same perks over email:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/XJIH9Z\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/XJIH9Z\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that by signing up, you will NOT be charged for other videos than \"VERY SERIOUS MONTAGES\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if i didn\u0027t invite you/give proper rewards, please notice me on my mail/twitter (find easly on yt)\u003cbr\u003e"
