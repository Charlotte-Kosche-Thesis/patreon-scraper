Thank you so much for\nstopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kai, or better known as KageNoTora in\nthe interweb community. As you may know, I\u2019m an aspiring artist and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMsAYcuX-Q5GacNZru4LgPg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e content creator.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFrom the moment I was able to hold a crayon and put it to\npaper, I was fascinated with drawing and have been endeavoring to express\nmyself through art. However, my stick figures and discombobulated heads didn\u2019t\ndevelop into actual fleshy beings until a good friend introduced me to the\nworld of anime and manga in middle school. Fascinated by the style and\ncharacters, I committed many hours to doodling original anime inspired\ncharacters in comics that I would share with him. In every respect, this friend\nwas my very first and true patron to say the least. He supported me with praise\nand plenty of encouragement and for my thirteenth birthday, he gifted me\nmy very first sketch book. It\u2019s unbelievable how this small, but profound,\ngesture has encouraged me to continue to love, enjoy and pursue art\ntoday.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo, the big reason I started a Patreon page is to invite you\nall to enjoy my craft and support and inspire me to continue to do what I love\njust as my friend had. It\u0027s unbelievable that Patreon offers this incredible\npossibility. You can pledge as little as 10\u00a2 per Kai Creation to\nsupport me in creating the things you and I love.  You will only be\ncharged once each month the amount you pledge times the number of Kai Creations\nI post each month.  I will limit my monthly Kai Creation posts to 10 and\nand you may cap your monthly pledge at any amount you wish, so that you will\nnot be inadvertently overcharged.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAs a high school student, balancing classes, homework, exams\nand extracurricular activities; devoting time to my craft is already a\nsignificant challenge.  Therefore, it is nearly impossible to take on\na part-time job to help pay for art supplies, digital art essentials, computer\nprograms, computer equipment and other essential expenses.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYour investment will help immensely with better supplies and\nequipment, which will allow me to continue to develop and improve my craft.\n In addition, it will help alleviate some of my living expenses as well.\n And, perhaps I might get enough support to even be able to start putting\nfunds aside to help with the cost of college.  But most importantly, your\nsupport will be helping me construct steps toward my dream.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to continue to pursue art in college. The notion\nthat job prospects in the industry are few sounds extremely gloomy and raises a\nlot of doubts. But that\u0027s no reason for me to give up on my dream because your\nsupport is reassurance enough that things will be okay!  So when YOU\nbecome a Patron, you\u0027re not just getting to see loads of art, you\u0027re validating\nmy dream and investing in my future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever much you decide to invest, I will never be able to\nthank you enough!  Your generous gesture, big or small, equates to\npriceless love, support and encouragement for me!  For that alone, I will\nbe forever grateful!
