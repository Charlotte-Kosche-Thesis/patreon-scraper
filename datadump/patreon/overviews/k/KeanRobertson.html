    "summary": "The first piece of art I remember making is a glue and sand painting of a bull. I was excited and proud. Compelled to pursue making images, I have continued to create art my entire life. Unfortunately, bills want paying and I was forced to have a grown-up job that takes up a good portion of my time. I spend time every weekend working on art and I look forward to sharing that experience with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon after the recommendation of a good friend. I had been looking for a platform to display my work and process. Patreon allows monthly subscription donations and embodies the \"patron of the arts\" concept, where those who enjoy an artist\u0027s work can directly support their craft and allow them to focus on the art rather than monetization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be delighted if this page could create a self-sustaining income for my need to create. But even without that, I am excited to continue to grow and learn and share more of my work with all of you. Your interest warms my cold, dead Scottish heart.\u003cbr\u003e"
