Follow the stories of Asher Copeland and Colby Anders, two one-time lovers on the path of discovery of what they want; whether that ends up being each other or something else entirely is up to you and the decisions you make! While this Visual Novel serves as a continuation of the first chapter of the comic, it\u0027s not necessary to read it before jumping right in, but the comic is still available on \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/12463117/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e, for those curious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFour-Letter Word\u003c/strong\u003e started out as my take on a romance story. All too often, these stories only focused on two people meeting, quickly falling in love, and culminating in the start of a relationship that we are left to assume ended happily ever after. But, how often do \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e relationships end this way? \u003cstrong\u003eFour-Letter Word\u003c/strong\u003e wanted to examine a relationship where \"the honeymoon is over\"; where most romance stories would have long been over, this one begins. In an attempt to make both characters more sympathetic, what was supposed to be defined relationship turned into an ambiguous \"what are we to each other?\" situation which ended badly because of the most common problem in any relationship; miscommunication. What it aims to be now is an exploration of how love means so many different things to so many different people, and Asher and Colby\u0027s journey towards finding out what it means to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Ty5Bdk3.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eCreating a Visual Novel\u003c/span\u003e is a lot of work\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027m just one man!
