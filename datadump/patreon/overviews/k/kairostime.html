Insecurity, sadness and an overwhelming drowning feeling of inadequacy kept me just beneath the surface of the water in life\u0027s ocean. Sure I\u0027d manage to kick my legs beneath me just enough to push me up and have my lips break the surface and capture best gulp of air I could before sinking below sea-level again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt one point the weight attached to your feet becomes too much to bare and Scotty locks on to you and beams you up. In this moment it may have looked like I died but in this moment I knew - I knew how to breath underwater with ease.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Andy Kairos. This moment. This moment now. This moment right now - feels right. Everything is falling into place. Do you feel the same?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I can\u0027t tell you how to proverbially breath under water and no - I can\u0027t tell you how to actually breath underwater either. All I can promise to provide is when you see yourself there - I\u0027ll be there to help you find yourself here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do and would like to support me and the other creators like me I shine light on, please contribute. Your reward begins with my sincere thanks - and blossoms from there. Please take a look around and message me a hello. Tell me a little about who you are and your story all about how your life got flipped, turned upside-down. Go ahead. Take a minute. I\u0027ll be right here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA.O.K.\u003cbr\u003e"
