I am Kura, the author and artist for the webcomic\u0027s Raven Wolf and No Future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrawing and writing comic series takes up a lot of time, work and money. More often than not real life demands and obligations threaten to put an end to this investment. There is a lot of pressure on me to stop releasing my comic series for free, which I hesitate to do because I want it to remain available to whoever may be interested in it. Donations from dedicated fans would not only help support me and continue release, it would also keep my comics free and available to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, depending on my health, I produce 4 full colour comic pages a month for Raven Wolf, and 1 black and white page a day for No Future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of my health I unfortunately can not really offer anything extra for pledges at this point in time. Creating comics already takes up my time and health and I can no longer dedicate more time that I already do into drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo take a look at my current big projects check it out at \u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/354\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRaven Wolf\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/NoFuture\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNo Future\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
