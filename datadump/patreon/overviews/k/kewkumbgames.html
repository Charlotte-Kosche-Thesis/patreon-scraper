Thank you to everyone who stands by the little guys with big dreams, and empty pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kim Corson, I was born in 1996. Art has always been a big passion of mine, from my great grandmother, to my grandfather, my father and sister. I love drawing and painting, as well as computer art. I discovered my love for 3D art when I began using some version of Maya on our xp computer. Since high school, a developed passion for the special effects, 3D animation, worlds, and game development began.\u003cbr\u003eI started working at Best Buy in sales, then I worked in Geek Squad, and now as a preschool teacher.\u003cbr\u003eI work only 15 hours a week at my job and my career a good amount more. Everyday my life is\u00a0 making games and learning code! I will do whatever it takes to make it happen, I will never stop making video games. Your support means more to me than you know :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do not want to become a patron, that is no problem! But please, might I recommend following my page of Facebook, my account on Twitter, and Twitch, where I will post non exclusive updates and possibly stream as I create!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
