    "summary": "Hiya! I\u0027m Godson, the creator of KekBot. And I\u0027d like to talk abo\u2014\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, w\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehat is KekBot?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, KekBot is a Discord bot, with the goal being to be a multi-purpose, open source, community based bot, written in Java. From having basic admin tools like purging, mass kick and bans, to dishing out some dank memes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you mean by \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ecommunity based\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike the majority of Discord bots I\u0027ve seen, KekBot is meant to be made \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0communities, \u003cem\u003eby\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0our own community in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/3nbqavE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKekBot\u0027s Chamber\u003c/a\u003e. From features added and requested by our community, to memes sent by the community, to other things that will be made later down the line to allow the community more control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWon\u0027t that get a little out of control?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know how people on the internet can be, and without moderation, this would become abused to the point where \u003cem\u003eno one\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0will want to have KekBot in their server. At the moment, I\u0027m the only one working on KekBot, so any features requested by the community have to be looked over by me, and coded by me. But as more people begin to notice KekBot, and become a part of our community, I will have a team of reviewers to look through requests and help filter out all the...\u003cem\u003ebad\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0requests from the good ones. And if the community continues to grow, I hope that people can volunteer to help in adding progress to KekBot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why are you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI alone can\u0027t keep KekBot up and running. While I am still constantly pushing out new updates and such whenever I can. I\u0027m also dealing with some problems outside of KekBot, such as college, and other things. Even then, keeping KekBot up and running would become more and more expensive as it becomes more popular, so the support would definitely help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s KekBot\u0027s source code, then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Godson777/KekBot\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRight here.\u003c/a\u003e But be warned, I \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0say I was an amateur. So there\u0027s probably a better way of doing things that I\u0027ve done. But that\u0027s just another thing that makes KekBot more unique.\u003cbr\u003e"
