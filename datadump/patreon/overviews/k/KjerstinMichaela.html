    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome! :-D\u003cbr\u003eHi, guys! Thanks for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003eI\u00b4m Kjerstin Michaela. I\u00b4m Norwegian and a Singer- songwriter.My songs might be surprisingly honest and personal. I kind of get an urge to express my feelings and thoughts and I tend to feel pretty strongly about things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u00b4t landed on a specific genre yet. I kind of don\u00b4t want to either, cause I feel that the best songs comes from an unrestricted starting point. I have many songs lying in my desk drawer and when I can afford to, I will go to a local professional studio and record one. In the meantime, I\u00b4m working on my mixing skills. I love it. I realize more and more that I wanna be a soundengineer too. But, it takes time to learn and grow, and not least it requires income. I\u00b4ve been taking a few jobs on the side, to be able to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of late I\u00b4ve been recording a few songs in the studio of DJ Drew Moyo. I\u00b4ve been so lucky to meet him and get to work with him on my songs. I feel like I get a shot now at going in the music direction I\u00b4 ve wanted since I was a kid. Even though I havent decided to do just one thing yet, I am happy to now be creating R\u0026amp;B and Pop/Disco, and it\u00b4ll be exciting to see what comes next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I haven\u00b4 t had the most exciting music videos. This is something which I hope to change during 2017. This is however taking it to a whole new level, not just quality-wise, but also economically. I have no idea if I\u00b4m gonna be able to pull it off this year, but who knows? Hopefully I\u00b4ll set off a spark in many of you, getting you excited for this too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are wondering what your funds go to, I\u00b4m more than happy to give you some examples. Much of my work is being done on the computer I\u00b4m typing on right now. I bought it for work. The same goes for my sound equipment and video camera. Every now and then, this equipment, along with my electric piano, needs reparing and upgrades. I use photoshop now to work on future music videos. Along with many other companies, Adobe is now charging a monthly subscription fee. \u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I use my income for piano lessons, recordings in professional studios, and in 2017 I\u00b4m attending mixing and sound engineering lessons as well. I think you get the picture now. ;-) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my spare time, I volunteer in and run my own helping project, integrating immigrants faster and better here. There is a growing gap between natives and immigrants. My belief is that we are facing big problems in the near future if we don\u00b4t succeed at reversing this. Also, I can\u00b4t stand watching loneliness and I like meeting new people, whatever background they\u00b4ve got. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Why am I sitting in the starting pit of this run, being 32 and all. Wouldn\u00b4t I have come further by now? Well, I had high hopes to, when I was young, but that\u00b4s not how my story went. I\u00b4ve been held up, struggling with health issues for many years. I still have a lot of the same challenges today, but now I have had time and help to learn to cope. I\u00b4m stoked to finally be able to say that I\u00b4m not gonna quit on my dreams! :-D Not everyone gets to do that and I\u00b4m so grateful for my blessings! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your time! I hope it was worth the while and that you want to stick around for this journey. Being a Patron, you get first row seats to the show.

     "about": "I work from home, composing songs, and then processing them in Garageband. Til now this has been for demo`s, cause I`ve hired producers and musicians to play midi instruments and some live instruments and make the finished product. I dream about doing the whole prosess on my own, as I believe I\u00b4ve got what it takes. I hope to be able to educate my self more, somehow, so that I can achieve this goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn upper secondary school I studied music. My plan was to reach for the stars as a singer. I struggled a lot with school and other things, but eventually managed to finish. and not by completing the course I started, but by studying different subjects until I got what I needed to be accepted into Norwegian universities. I spent 6 years completing this!\u003cbr\u003eHigher education proved to become difficult too, due to personal reasons. I still haven\u0027t been able to study more. I was pretty bummed out, feeling that I had something to contribute with, just not being able to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to worry!:-D Life doesn`t have only tiring uphills in store, but lovely, relaxing downhills too. (Bike-wise thinking) \u003cbr\u003eI have managed to get back on track when it comes to doing what I originally wanted to do with my life. Find love, and sing my soul out.  It doesn`t have to happen in a specific way. Every opportunity is a gift. I`m truly blessed!\u003cbr\u003eI might not become the biggest Idol, or the richest artist out there, but I know I feel rich and free like a fish in the sea, doing what I love and have talent for. I don`t need to be an idol, but if I inspire anyone and give someone comfort, hope, joy, a sense of self worth, or a feeling of  not being alone, I know I feel that I\u00b4ve succeeded. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther stuff that interests me:\u003cbr\u003eExercise, both strength workouts and running outside. I`m so into it that I wish I was a personal trainer, sometimes. I read a lot about the subject, watch youtube videos and such. I`ve even recorded my own workout routines with instructions, spiced up with peptalks and fun, upbeat songs, to push my self to get going and give it my best. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConversations, especially meta communication. Also existential and society related discussions.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHanging out with friends and family, my church and of course my husband. \u003cbr\u003eHiking, in our beautiful nature, barbecue on bonfire, bathing in lakes, playing basketball, table tennis, board games, bowling, biking... I think maybe the list is endless. ;-)    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEating! ;-) I love eating. My husband says I`m like a Hobbit: \u003cbr\u003e7:00am \u2013 Breakfast\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e9:00am \u2013 Second Breakfast\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e11:00am \u2013 Elevenses\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1:00pm \u2013 Luncheon\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4:00pm \u2013 Afternoon Tea\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e6:00pm \u2013 Dinner\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e8:00pm \u2013 Supper \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eEven if my list is not exactly like this, its not far from it. And just as Hobbits I don`t always manage to get every meal. \u003cbr\u003eI often fill up my time too much and don`t have the time for it. So I almost always eat standing, driving my car, or while working.\u003cbr\u003eBut, taking the night off, eating my favorite foods and watching series with my husband is awesome!:-D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI`m almost a lacto ovo vegetarian. Almost sugar free, and  I dont drink or smoke. \u003cbr\u003eQuite the health freak, one might say. Except for eating so much, that is. But I think it`s healthy to enjoy food, and other Endorphin inducing things. So, chocolate amongst other things is a must. Sugar free, of course.  \u003cbr\u003eNutrition is a given interest, I guess. I often wish I was a nutrition specialist as well, and I sure talk a lot about the subject either way. \u003cbr\u003eI would like to write a book some day. I have some ideas in mind.  I figure it`ll have to be at a later point in life. Right now my main focus is\u2026\u003cbr\u003emusic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

I`ve mostly just made the melody, decided which chords I want played, in what order, and let others handle the instruments, or make me a playback. I\u00b4ve also bought iTunes Instrumentals when covering songs. Hopefully I will be able to accompany my singing nicely with time.",
