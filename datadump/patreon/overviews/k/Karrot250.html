    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eMy name is John Navarro, an ardent writer, avid artist, and gamer enthusiast. I am quite possibly the quietest guy you\u0027ll ever know, but also the most annoying guy you\u0027ll get to know... If you let my inner geek out, that is. For the past five years, and perhaps a bit of some school years as a child, I have had a very active imagination, so far that I... I never detached myself from my imaginary friend for \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhew\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0who even knows. In any case, as a quiet person I acknowledge my awkwardness and overactive imagination as fuel for my creative writing. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI, unfortunately, have walked upon the scorching surface, on the coils of the writhing snake\u0027s underbelly, past this volcano known as Maladaptive Daydreaming, an odd form of depression in which an individual purposefully creates imaginary worlds in their heads, lives in them, and gains an emotional attachment to them as a way to escape the harsh realities of this world...\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYeesh\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. In a sense, I use this trivial form of depression like a secret ingredient, you don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on in there but it sure does make it better!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qvwb2ok.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCredit to my good friend that goes by the name of\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eTeh Ercany\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003efor drawing this character based on\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dragon of the Abyss\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003ea story I wrote for\u003c/em\u003e NaNoWrimo 2016!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eBesides creating content for others, I\u0027ve been working on a very rough \u0027script\u0027 for an idea I had based on one of my Maladaptive Daydreaming... daydreams that has been a part of my life for the past 5 years. With each passing day I slowly begin to not forget the characters and everything that makes it what it is, but I\u0027ve begun to move on.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis \u0027script\u0027 has seen many changes, and up until now it has slowly transformed itself into an odd pseudo script/book... thing. This \u0027thing\u0027 is to become a comic in the end, the only reason why it\u0027s in the state that it currently is is because during its early days, during the time I was still in school, I was suffering with depression and I wanted to find the easiest way to \u0027put it down\u0027 for me to \u0027pick up\u0027 and go over it someday. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eWhat I strive for, my very reason to write and illustrate (or at least learning to illustrate) is so that I can form together the perfect story, capture and compose someone else\u0027s vivid imaginations and its tellings for them and others to read. I am here to seize opportunities, make a living out of it, and ultimately create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JyXkEOW.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJanuary 2017\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-----------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/A4pkUVR.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Dragon of the Abyss\u003c/strong\u003e - This is an ongoing story about a knight that sought to slay a dragon that endlessly spew a deep fog of madness upon the world, but ultimately failed. When the dragon was slain, the blood that coated the heroic knight hardened and encased him in stone, petrifying him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0--\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eExistence falls apart; centuries of madness plague the world, exhausting what little left is of life.

A good chunk of the story remains, and as of November 2016, I participated in NaNoWrimo, November being its month in which an individual has until the end of said month to write a 50,000 worded novel, and finished at 51k word within the last week! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis 50k worded novel is actually an entire arc based on the knight\u0027s travel to The Edge of the World, a place detached from the madness and the world itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be sharing that arc here for those who pledge 3$ or more, and 1$ for the main thing that\u0027s currently going under heavy revision. But don\u0027t worry, even if you\u0027re not pledged, you can still see the tid-bits that I share about the story and where the knight will encounter/go against next. The lore itself will also be free, so expect some of that!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
