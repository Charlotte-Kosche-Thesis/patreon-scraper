I am so grateful to have the privilege of lifting up a voice of progressive faith against the dark arts of willful ignorance, dangerous vitriol and general asshattery of those who teach the faithless lie that LGBT people are not of sacred worth. I really don\u0027t know any other way to be in the world than to share the amazing, extravagant, radical truth that nothing, nothing, nothing can separate us from the love of God.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thankful beyond measure for\u00a0everyone who has told me how deeply moved you\u0027ve been by the meditations of my dark heart and the words of my (frequently foul) mouth. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis season of Advent I am preparing my heart and mind for a new year of writing at the intersection of being queer and Christian in the American south. I am sorting out a few new projects and hoping to bring aboard some fresh new voices with whom I can be in dialogue over the coming year. Yep, I am either a glutton for punishment or really think that talking with people rather than about them can open hearts and minds. We shall see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are the kind of person who gives (or considers giving) to public media or working artists because you want to support content you care about, I hope you will consider becoming a patron of my efforts in defense against the dark arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eKimberly"
