It\u0027s something I really enjoy doing, but unfortunately can\u0027t give as much time as I\u0027d like to this.. let\u0027s call it an \"internship.\" That\u0027s where you lovely people come in. By selecting one of the rewards I have offered and spending your hard earned cash for some incredibly thoughtful, miracle of a reason, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eyou will be helping me be able to spend more time creating videos AND you get some pretty neat stuff out of it\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. As of right now, I do one video a week, but with you\u0027re help, I\u0027d like to make this a full-time job with multiple videos a week (doing tutorials, and other fun things I have planned). \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d also really like to start making my own music, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003ebut unfortunately, this takes time and money... things that aren\u0027t really on my side at the moment.. but hopefully could be someday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me end by saying, you absolutely \u003cstrong\u003edo not\u003c/strong\u003e have to fund me. My videos will \u003cstrong\u003eALWAYS\u003c/strong\u003e be free to watch and any support you give me is more than enough (even just viewing my video every week). For those of you who are skeptical: I know that sometimes Youtube can be seen as a hobby and not a job, but \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do put in every ounce of my soul and free time into making my videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. If you feel like you enjoy this content and want to support me in making more of it, please see the list of rewards on the side :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far, thank you for sticking around and being a part of my life (even to those of you who just close the page and carry on with your lives).\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e If you\u0027ve chosen to support me, I thank you from the bottom of my heart\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.
