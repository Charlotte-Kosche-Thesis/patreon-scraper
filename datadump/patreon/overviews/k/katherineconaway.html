I haven\u0027t been anywhere for longer than 5 weeks, and I often move much more frequently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a year in 2016-17, I was a member of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/RemoteYearEssays\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRemote Year 2\u003c/a\u003e (Battuta). Remote Year is a program that organizes year-long travel for groups of 75 people to live + work remotely in 12 cities/countries (each for a month).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work as a freelancer - I have a couple of regular clients plus additional short-term projects doing consulting or writing work. My main client now is a men\u2019s travel clothing company (Bluffworks), and I do strategy, PR, and partnerships work with them. For 2.5 years, I was the head of production for Public Persona, a small branding studio (yes, while on the road).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStorytelling is one of my passions\u003c/h3\u003eStorytelling can encompass so much, and I love when it can be both education and entertainment. The curiosity that drives me to explore the world non-stop is really a desire to learn and hear more stories, and then I feel very compelled to document, synthesize, and share them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only do I want to share my story, I want to facilitate the interesting, passionate, adventurous people around me share their stories. I also want to help educate people who are curious about other people\u0027s lifestyle, work, and experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://modernworkpodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eModern Work podcast\u003c/a\u003e is conversations I have with people about the work they do \u0026amp; how they got there. Episodes feature in-depth 1:1 interviews and the show notes will include each person\u0027s bio, links, and notes from our conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI regularly write on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@katherinerc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e, and in an effort to record my experience on Remote Year for friends \u0026amp; family, prospective RY applicants, fellow travelers, and remote workers, I wrote essays in my publication, \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/ARemoteYear\"\u003eA Remote Year\u003c/a\u003e (which is public + free to read).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCreative work takes time \u0026amp; resources, and support is critical to success\u003c/h3\u003eIt takes me several hours to interview someone + edit the audio + set up my podcast, and continue learning best practices. Each essay takes at least 2 hours for me to write and publish, often more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an Art History major, I studied incredible objects and images \u0026amp; the people who made them, and one key takeaway for me was that creators often did (and do) depend on the support of patrons, friends, and family.\u00a0I learned about Patreon a while ago, and I thought it sounded like a great way to support people making things on a regular basis - at whatever level makes sense.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started pledging a little bit each month to a few artists I follow elsewhere on social media and their websites: I enjoy their work, and I know that both the financial and emotional support makes a big difference in their ability to continue to devote time to content creation. Plus, I find it really rewarding to be part of this community \u0026amp; know that I\u0027m helping enable the artists of my time to make things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027ve started proving to myself that I have something to share with the world, I decided to create a Patreon page so that the audience, friends, and family could help support this podcast and my writing projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a freelancer, my time is literally my money, and I am working to treat my projects with the same dedication to research, execution, and developing + implementing best practices as I would for a paying client.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThank you so much for following along (for free) and pledging if you can!\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eI really can\u0027t convey how much every word, gesture, and (yes) dollar of support means to me. I save kind notes from friends and strangers, and every meal I\u0027ve been treated to or home I\u0027ve been hosted at has made a difference in my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe $1 is all you have available, and I very much understand and respect that. I live on a budget, too, and I really appreciate you being a sponsor \u0026amp; staying engaged with my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps you want to think of your $5 pledge as buying me a cup of coffee once a month, and you can pretend that I\u0027m telling you a story over an email or phone call while you read or listen to my recent essays and episodes. I probably had at least one coffee while working, and I\u0027ll be thinking of you while I drink it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge more than that, then \u003cem\u003ewow\u003c/em\u003e \u0026amp; a tremendous thank you. Please let me know how I can continue to create things of value to you \u0026amp; maintain a special relationship moving forward. Being a patron of the arts is an incredible gift to the artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCongratulations! You\u0027ve read it all :) Thank you for your time \u0026amp; support.\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eI consider myself incredibly fortunate to know so many generous and kind people, and I can\u0027t wait to get to know you, too.
