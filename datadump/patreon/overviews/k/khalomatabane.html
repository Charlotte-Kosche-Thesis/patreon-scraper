    "summary": "At the age of 14, I moved from a village in the North of South\nAfrica to the city of Johannesburg. One of my classmates introduced me to\nmovies, and we watched them every weekend at an old cinema in downtown\nJohannesburg. The cinema screened martial arts and action films; and right\nthere my love affair with cinema began and I never looked back. South Africa\nhad just had its first democratic elections in 1994. I decided to make films\nabout memory and history. I chose cinema as the best artistic tool to express\ndreams and nightmares. I started off by making 5 minutes pieces for television\nand then got my first break when I did a half hour docudrama on homeless kids for\nthe German Embassy. I decided this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my\nlife. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince then my films, TV dramas and documentaries have been\nscreened at film festivals and venues such as Toronto International Film\nFestival, Sydney Film Festival, Durban International Film Festival, New York\nAfrican Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival and International\nDocumentary Film Festival of Amsterdam (IDFA) and Hotdocs in Toronto. My work\nhas been screened on BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), Arte (Germany/France),\nNHK (Japan), DR (Denmark), Black Entertainment Television (BET), SABC (South\nAfrican Broadcasting Corporation) and YLE (Finland). Examples of my works are\n\u2018\u2019When we were Black\u2019\u2019, a four part TV drama series about a young boy who wants\nto lose his virginity against the backdrop of the 1976 student uprisings,\n\u2018\u2019Conversations on a Sunday Afternoon\u2019\u2019 about a writer who is searching for a\nrefugee from Somalia, \u2018\u2019Nelson Mandela the Myth and Me, \u2019\u2019  a feature documentary that unpacks the myth\nof Nelson Mandela, and \u2018\u2019The Number,\u2019\u2019 a prison movie about a gang leader\nsearching for redemption. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDeveloping and writing a screenplay takes a long time and requires funding. Writing\na screenplay is the foundation for making a great film. It takes me an average\nof 5-7 years to make a film. This timeline is creatively frustrating and\nfinancially unsustainable for my business.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am currently developing a new feature film about Che Guevara\nin Africa. The plot follows the true story of Che\u2019s attempt to start a\nrevolution in the Congo; and how he soon came to the realization that he was an\nuninvited guest. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am going to use the money to do research and write the\nscript for a period of a year starting in January 2018 to January 2019 and also\nto pay the script editor. In return for your support you will gain access to my\ncreative world as I meet people who knew Che as both friends and enemies during\nthe research phase. I would like you to experience my creative world by giving\nyou access to my apartment \u2013 my creative space where I write until the early\nhours of the morning. You will experience the joys and frustrations of writing\na screenplay. This experience includes my regular meetings with the script\neditor, casting directors, actors, producers and distributors. This will give\nyou a complete picture of the negotiations, the debates and ultimate creative\ndecisions that I grapple with leading up to the production of the film. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eREWARDS\u003cbr\u003e$3 Access to my page and video postings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$5\u00a0Access to my page, video postings and an acknowledgement on social media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$10 Access to my page,\nweekly video postings,\u00a0an acknowledgement on social media and my private email to write directly to me.\u003cbr\u003e$25 Access to my page,\nweekly video postings, an acknowledgement on social media my private email to write directly to me and a signed\nposter of the film.\u003cbr\u003e$50\u00a0Access to my page,\nweekly video postings, an acknowledgement on social media, my private email to write directly to me, a signed\nposter of the film, signed photos from the film set and a T-Shirt. \u003cbr\u003e$100\u00a0Access to my page,\nweekly video postings, an acknowledgement on social media, my private email to write directly to me, a signed poster\nof the film, signed photos from the film set, access to the link of the film at\nthe same time as when it is released in cinemas, an invite to the film premiere\n(travel would be at your own cost) plus a 10 minutes Skype call once a month\nand a T-Shirt and a cap.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eADDITIONAL REWARDS FOR SUPPORTERS \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will give away 10 signed copies of the film script to the \u003cem\u003efirst 10 people\u003c/em\u003e to support my project\nregardless of amount. I will give away another 10 signed copies, plus a DVD\ncopy of the award winning  documentary I\ndirected \u0027\u0027Nelson Mandela the Myth and Me\u2019\u2019 to supporters who donate the most\namount of money together with an invite to the film set to watch the Che film\nin production(travel at your own cost). Supporters who spend $5000 per annum\nand more will receive a link of the film after it is completed before it is\nreleased in cinemas. Supporters who spend $10 000 per annum and more will\nreceive co-producers credit.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nKhalo Matabane\u003cbr\u003e"
