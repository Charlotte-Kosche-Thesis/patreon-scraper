I\u0027m Kalila, I make dance in Philadelphia, and I\u0027m SO happy you made it here!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made a New Year\u0027s resolution to increase my focus on choreography and to make work and perform it (informally or otherwise) at least once per month. This has been my way of building my creative habit, and making sure that choreography doesn\u0027t exist on the periphery of my work life but at the center of it. (This is a challenge that all self-motivated artists know very well.) So far, I have successfully performed once per month, but I am finding it challenging to keep up with the task as new demands are placed on my energies (I just started grad school!) I\u0027ve come to Patreon in order to stay engaged with my supporters, to keep myself to task, to continue seeing patterns in how people interact with each other, to continue exchanging ideas and collaborating with other artists, and to keep asking how dance and choreography intersects with the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in! As patrons, I hope to engage you in my process of creation, to ask questions, and even to outsource ideas and inspirations. So much of my work emerges from a collaborative spirit, because I do not exist alone in my work--even when I am alone in the studio, I have an audience in mind as I craft my dance. So if you are a person who has ideas, share them and I will take the ball and roll with it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a firm believer in making work that is accessible (online) and affordable (when live). So your dollars will help keep my work available, especially to those of you who aren\u0027t based in Philly. I\u0027d like to increase my range and offer content that is accessible to all of you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still emerging and managing all production operations by myself, which often limits me making smaller informal works. However, your contributions will help me to grow my vision and to work with more collaborators: groups of dancers, live musicians, videographers, lighting designers, costume designers, and visual artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you thank you thank you for making my work possible! I hope you find it as enjoyable as I do!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eKalila\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Please keep in mind that this platform is not like other crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter, GoFundMe, Hatchfund etc. Instead Patreon is more like a \u0027pledge\u0027 or a \u0027subscription\u0027 -- it functions through recurring \u003cstrong\u003emonthly\u003c/strong\u003e payments. If you want to make a one-time donation, simply cancel your subscription after the first month!)\u003cbr\u003e"
