    "summary": "Hi future friends. There comes a time in each writers life when they have to lie, cheat, beg and steal to earn a living. I\u0027m at the beg stage. Like every creative person, I lost my shame a long time ago in a bid to attract attention from potential publishers, so this feels right to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to all the support for this page, I\u0027m currently working on my new podcast \u003cstrong\u003eLittle Tiny\u003c/strong\u003e, birthing new episodes early 2018 like the vagina goddess I am. It\u0027s a history podcast about small things that have changed the world, and I\u0027ve managed to circumnavigate doing an episode about my ex\u0027s dick, so I\u0027m very proud.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently in the development stages of a new podcast tentatively titled \u003cstrong\u003eFor Bad People\u003c/strong\u003e, an interview series about ethics and a how to guide to becoming a \u0027good\u0027 person, whatever the fuck that means. Your support is paying for transport, equipment, the mental anguish of reading Kant while not high, the stress of chatting to people who are better than me at \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e, and (hopefully, eventually) the wages of someone who can help me produce this beast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@karaschlegl/if-youre-going-to-write-about-feminism-do-your-fucking-research-397cf06bc62f\"\u003ewrite essays on Medium\u003c/a\u003e, because no one has told me to stop yet. And I plan to invest time, energy and hopefully your money into producing other podcasts that don\u0027t involve a group of dudes laughing about dicks for 2 hours. Don\u0027t get me wrong, love the D, but it\u0027s time we start making podcasts in this bloody country that aren\u0027t just thinly veiled homo-eroticism. ...Actually, I take that back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, if you chuck me a dollar I\u0027ll be extremely grateful. I know none of us have a lot of money to throw around, and if we do, we prefer to throw it at each other playfully at our money parties or burn it to light novelty sized cigars, \u003cem\u003eam I right rich people\u003c/em\u003e? But I will endeavour to use each dollar with the sound mindfulness of a yogi - Yogi Berra, the greatest baseball player of all time, to be more specific. Fuck you, Babe Ruth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me? I\u0027m just a small town girl living in the dungeon of a house that is falling apart, because that\u0027s what it\u0027s like to live in the Sydney housing bubble now. I\u0027m a freelance writer and producer, I wrote features for the gone but never forgotten SBS Comedy, and I\u0027ve produced various web series and online content that have a comedy bent in a bid to prove my ex wrong when he said \u0027I just don\u0027t think you\u0027re that funny\u0027 - to my fucking face.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will update this Patreon with what I\u0027m doing and where I\u0027m going, especially if it\u0027s worth bragging about. I treat my Patreon supporters like the private setting on a Livejournal, be warned. I will also let you know exactly where your money has gone and why. (IMPORTANT: can I buy my dog a cute sweater if this directly impacts my mental health which will help me \"create\"?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease have\u00a0a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@karaschlegl\"\u003eread of my stuff\u003c/a\u003e, and if you like it, throw a dollar at me brusquely like you\u0027re an important business person and I\u0027m hassling you on the street. Thank you. xxoo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
