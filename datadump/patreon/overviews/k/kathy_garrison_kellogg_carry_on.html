The characters are all drawn from facets of my personality, or are based on people I know and admire.  Over the years, I\u0027ve progressed from simple black and white drawings in ballpoint pen on typing paper, to more complex, multiple-layer images processed in Photoshop (although I still start with an ink pen on typing paper--it\u0027s\u003cem\u003e archival\u003c/em\u003e ink, now!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main character, Kathy Grrsn, debuted in my husband Scott Kellogg\u0027s strip\u003ca href=\"http://techfox.comicgenesis.com/\"\u003e \"21st Century Fox\"\u003c/a\u003e as a wedding guest, and shortly got her own spinoff series, which evolved into the comic strip I draw today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI draw\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hirezfox.com/km/co/index.html\"\u003e\"Carry On\"\u003c/a\u003e for my own enjoyment, but also in the hopes of making other people laugh.  I like getting feedback from the readers, letting me know how the characters and situations have affected them, and it pleases me to know that my strip is read by people from around the world.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to grow my audience.  My comic strip is a humorous adventure/romance, with a touch of the absurd, and just enough peril to keep things exciting.  I\u0027m not into \"dark\" storytelling, so you can be pretty sure that everything will work out all right in the end.  I\u0027m also not into diatribes, although I do try to make a few not-so-subtle points about cultural differences in the societies I\u0027ve created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hirezfox.com/km/co/index.html\"\u003e\"Carry On\"\u003c/a\u003e has been nominated several times for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ursamajorawards.org/\"\u003eUrsa Major Award\u00a0\u003c/a\u003efor \"Best Comic Strip,\" which is always an honor.  I\u0027m hoping to someday win the category.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always trying to improve the strip, both in the artwork and in the storytelling.  It\u0027s a fun challenge to figure out a new technique to create a visual or a texture--recently I\u0027ve been experimenting with how to depict the four elements, with landscapes, clouds, fire, and moving water, along with the lighting effects for time of day and weather conditions.  I\u0027ve been doing research into African landscapes, animals, and architecture to try to get the \"look\" of the backgrounds right.  I\u0027ve also been studying hyenas in order to incorporate their body language into the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heroes are spotted hyenas--not usually a species seen as particularly heroic.  The research I\u0027ve done on hyenas has made me a huge fan of \u003cem\u003eCrocuta crocuta\u003c/em\u003e--their intelligence, their social structure, their bizarre biology, and their personalities amaze and fascinate me.  I\u0027ll admit that when I started out, I knew almost nothing about spotted hyenas, but now I hope to share my admiration of the species with others, because they really are incredible animals.  And they make great cartoon characters--in fact, spotted hyenas are pretty much God\u0027s gift to cartoonists.  The jokes write themselves!  I guess that\u0027s why they\u0027re called \"laughing hyenas.\"\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "What I\u0027m hoping to do by getting a Patreon account, is to \"get back what I give to the world.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to use my comic strip to help contribute to the family finances.  I can\u0027t say that I\u0027d \"be able to quit my day job and work full time on the comic strip\" because I don\u0027t have a conventional \"day job;\" I\u0027m a farmer, I raise sheep, and running the farm precludes being able to go get even a part-time job, as I never know from one day to the next what emergency will crop up, requiring my attention.  In one way, I have a lot of free time--just not in any predictable amount.  And my \"paycheck\" comes only once a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy comic strip is my hobby, and one that I spend almost all my available free time on, between the writing and the artwork.  It would be nice to be able to get compensated for that time.  I have an aversion to selling ad space on my web page because I kind of loathe ads, so I\u0027d like to try to avoid having to go that route. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo I guess my immediate goal is to be able to help pay the household bills, and to start saving for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA further-off goal I\u0027d like to acheive is to be able to do a book print run of the comic strip, in color. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnother goal is to create 3D printed statuettes of the main characters, to be available for sale to fans.\u003cbr\u003e",
