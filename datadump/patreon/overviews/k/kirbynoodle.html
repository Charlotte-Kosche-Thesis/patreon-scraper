He started his first YouTube channel back in 2005 before YouTube became a big hit. His videos ranged from school projects to short films and random funny skits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen he started at UC Davis in 2010 he also started vlogging about his daily life in the dorms. In 2012 he decided to revamp his YouTube channel to create more educational and relevant videos on history and current affairs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe first started with teaching Baybayin to high school and college students. He was surprised how little the Fil-Am youth knew about the history and culture of the Philippines while being very familiar with Filipino pop culture due to The Filipino Channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cMy videos are my way of promoting and preserving our culture, our history, our language, our heritage and identities that are seldom talked about. Knowing that people appreciate and learn a great deal about themselves from my videos is a great source of motivation,\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d said Araullo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides vlogging and work, Araullo leads lectures, sit on panels and facilitate workshops mostly on topics about the Philippines, its history, culture, and people in various high schools and colleges in California. Other topics he has covered include sexual assault awareness, body-positivity, family dynamics, gender and sexuality, health and wellness, cultural identity and creative self-expression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAraullo believes that he is making an impact on young generations of Fil-Ams. He used to have mentees who are now taking on leadership roles within the Filipino American community on and off campus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA proud Filipino with Aeta blood in his veins, Araullo said, \u201cBeing Filipino is not about fitting into the stereotypes of Filipino nationalism. Being Filipino should be about embracing your roots and using it as a source of strength and resilience. It is about honoring the sacrifices of those who have gone before us by working together to help finish what they have started. Being Filipino to me is not just about being able to speak your mother tongue, but also having the ability to embrace your identity, to respect diversity, appreciate its beauty and to learn from its complexities and strength.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead more: \u003ca href=\"http://globalnation.inquirer.net/145620/vlogger-spreads-knowledge-of-filipino-culture-history#ixzz4u75qA5gi\"\u003ehttp://globalnation.inquirer.net/145620/vlogger-spreads-knowledge-of-filipino-culture-history#ixzz4u75qA5gi\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
