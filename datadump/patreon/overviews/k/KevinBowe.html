I have a solid track record of making videos that enlighten, inform and affect change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I want to make and share more life-changing stories through videos and I\u0027m asking for the assistance of patrons like you for help. From mental illness to domestic abuse to inspiring personal stories--there is a wide range of socially relevant issues that do not get told because the people and organizations devoted to these issues don\u0027t have the resources to create professional videos. \u00a0With your assistance, I want to change this equation. \u00a0There are enough already videos about reality stars in Facebook and Twitter feeds. Let\u0027s give needy causes the same tools so that they can spread their stories via social media and other video platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been\u00a0producing videos for twelve years, mostly for government agencies, non-profits and corporate clients. \u00a0The most rewarding projects were personal stories that were part of larger social issues and often had profound impact on others. \u00a0For example, an interview with a beautiful\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/q6JqSOcfmn0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyoung woman who was addicted to heroin\u003c/a\u003e instantly conveyed to a viewer that heroin was no longer found at the bottom rungs of society, but was killing middle-class America. This video has been used in schools and parent forums to educate teens and parents about this horrific epidemic. \u00a0Unfortunately, a paying opportunity to tell stories that have real meaning and can move people into action, are few and far between. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS MY GOAL?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to help needy organizations and causes tell their stories in a way that gets people to act--whether it is one person who seeks help with a problem or thousands who change their perspective about an issue that often stigmatizes people. \u00a0I will write, shoot, edit and upload the videos for free to these worthy organizations. I am seeking your help on tow fronts: not only do I need to build up a community of patrons who will pledge a certain amount of money per video, but I also need to enlist people to be my \"eyes and ears\" for new causes and issues that are not getting the attention they deserve. \u00a0So I am asking for your financial support as well as encouraging patrons to suggest ideas and topics. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have some stories in the pipeline right now: How technology is helping \u00a0parents and their autistic children communicate more effectively, which is opening up many new life possibilities; profiles of people and families dealing with \"substance abuse disorder\", Big Buddy/Little Buddy organization seeking to recruit mentors and the story of an organization helping families survive domestic violence. Past--(and future)--videos have included\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/MxTxn7pXndA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoral histories\u003c/a\u003e of \"regular folks\" who live heroic lives, such as a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/lQR-2Ibv09w\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e82 year old\u003c/a\u003e African American woman growing up in segregation and how she transitioned from being a divorced mother of six receiving welfare to \u00a0a respected community activist with a Master\u0027s Degree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this provides you with an idea of the type of stories I hope to tell. \u00a0since many of these stories are socially relevant, \u003cem\u003eit is reasonable to ask if I have a political agenda and if so, what is it?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 Well, I try to be nonpartisan, but in some cases people will think I do (a political agenda is often in the eyes of the beholder). \u00a0I tend to \"lean left\" and will focus on giving a platform to people without a voice: poor people, minorities, those with mental and physical illness and disabilities. \u00a0I also have a passion for civic engagement and plan on telling stories that encourage people to get involved-not just by voting, but to be more engaged and to hold elected officials accountable for their actions. But I will not be taking partisan positions and ultimately, if you don\u0027t agree with the subjects I deal with, you can stop supporting my efforts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW OFTEN WILL I CREATE VIDEOS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy initial goal is to create one video a month. \u00a0My ultimate goal is to produce about 40 to 45 videos a year, somewhere between three and four videos a month. \u00a0If you are kind enough to support my efforts, please make sure you put a monthly cap on your pledge. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL I DO WITH THE MONEY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompensating my time is the biggest expense for these projects. \u00a0Aside from the research and pre-production, I often do on-site camera shoots, which usually requires a prior site visit so I don\u0027t get any surprises on production day. In addition, I do interview style videos with individuals that often require heavier editing than normal. \u00a0In addition, there is a constant need to upgrade equipment and implement new technologies. \u00a0Currently I need to upgrade my 6 year old editing machine and to secure more back-up capabilities for my growing video library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support allows me to give a voice to the voiceless and to tell important stories. Please click on the donate button on the right, and pledge any amount per video. \u00a0I thank you for you consideration.
