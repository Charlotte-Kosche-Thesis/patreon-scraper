    "summary": "Hi, My name is Sylvain, many of you know me as Kindar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making up stories all my life, and writing for over 35 years now, but only as a hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter all these years, I think it\u0027s time for me to focus on writing, I have a lot, and I mean a LOT of stories to tell, and right now, I keep finding myself without enough time. As a truck driver, I spend 11 to 13 hours a day working, which only leaves a few hours to write. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to change that, I want to be able to write for eight hours a day. I want to have the time to both work on a new story, and edit one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a three samples of stories I\u0027ve written\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/92496845/Samples/Honor.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHonor (short story)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/92496845/Samples/Mystical%20sample.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMystical (sample)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/92496845/Samples/tristan%20Sample.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTristan (sample)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories I tell are about people, usually gay, their lives, their loves, and sometime, even their sex-life. I love telling stories, and I find that writing them is the best way for me to do so, and let other share them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, to be able to write more, it means I need to find a way to change where my income comes from. this is where Patreon comes in. it\u0027s where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pledges will go toward allowing me to switch to full time writing. If I get passed $2500 a month, the extra will go toward getting a professional editor, setting up a professional website. What ever you pledge, you\u0027ll get to read every raw version of the stories I write.\u003cbr\u003e"
