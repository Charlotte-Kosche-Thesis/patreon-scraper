    "summary": "Hello Patrons! Here\u0027s a little ditty about how I got caught up in this Maker/woodworking/blacksmithing/costuming craze. Since I was old enough to use tools, or rather what my father thought was old enough, I was set upon a course that would change my life and set me apart from many people my age. He said to me, \"We will help you with anything that you need. Anything you want, you will either have to get a job and buy or you will have to figure out a way to make it.\" Now that being said, he never really taught me how to do much and never explained how to use most of the tools. In fact, he made me figure most everything out for myself, making sure that I didn\u0027t do anything too dangerous in the process. He also found a way of encouraging me through the simple challenge of saying, \"You can\u0027t do that,\" or, \" There\u0027s no way you can build that.\" So, over the years, I\u0027ve had to do a lot of research into how to do just about everything from basic mechanics to theory. This pursuit has made me seek out professionals from all disciplines, dig through libraries, \u00a0and when we finally got the internet, find every resource I could find on there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter doing this for almost 20 years as a hobby and the last 8 semi-professionally, I want to add my experience to the pool of knowledge that taught me. This is where you come in. Making these videos and running the shop is expensive. I plan on rebuilding my smithy, I need to buy a new computer and software to provide you with plans and to edit videos, I would like to also start working with more exotic materials and finally, I would also like to be able to give free stuff away from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of that being said, any help that you can give me would be greatly appreciated, even if it\u0027s only a single dollar a month. If I can get enough people to donate that single dollar, things would be able to drastically improve and of course that also goes for anyone that can give more. Though, even if you can\u0027t afford to donate, I know that times are tough for us all, I\u0027ll still do my best to provide as much free entertainment and knowledge to you in the hopes that you\u0027ll enjoy it and maybe even learn a thing or two!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out my page and if you\u0027re able, make a monthly donation of any amount that you can reasonably afford and help me create a better world, one kerf at a time!"
