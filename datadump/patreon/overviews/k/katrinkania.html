    "summary": "I\u0027m a textile archaeologist, and I\u0027m specialised in medieval textile crafts - from spinning to gold embroidery, I\u0027ve probably done it. I work as a freelancer with a very wide range of services, such as consultations for museums, concept and manufacture of fabric and clothing reconstructions, demonstrations, presentations and workshops. I also run a small \u003ca href=\"http://www.pallia.net/shop\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eonline shop\u003c/a\u003e for tools and materials for historical textile crafts... and a \u003ca href=\"http://www.pallia.net/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blog has been active since 2008, and I post every weekday (with the occasional break due to a conference or holidays). Contents are varied - you will find posts about writing, archaeology, research, textile techniques (including knitting, my modern-ish textile technique of choice), tools, and links to things that I find interesting.  I would like to post more textile and science-related content on my blog, such as small articles about textile finds, or textile tool finds, or techniques. There is a long list of research projects I would love to tackle, both for the blog and for eventual publication in some academic journal. Biomechanics of spinning with a hand-spindle, for instance. Tests on how to optimise spindle performance by changing whorls as the amount of yarn grows. There\u0027s the experiment about the influence of metal kettle materials on the outcome of dyeing, done in 2012 at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.textileforum.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEuropean Textile Forum\u003c/a\u003e, that would need a re-run. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also love to start doing occasional video tutorials for some of the techniques I love, helping others understand how patterns in tablet weaving work, or how to do filet netting, or how to do brocading, or how to spin with hand-spindle and distaff in the medieval way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll these things, however - researching and writing blog posts, taking a closer look at museum items, developing tutorials, filming and editing them, designing and running archeological experiments and craft-related tests - all these take a lot of time, plus sometimes a chunk of money for materials and travel costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is where you, as patrons, come in. Your support will help me cover my expenses both for the blog (web hosting, software necessary to keep it running) and for my life (to just name one thing: health insurance is mandatory in Germany, and I have to pay close to 300 \u20ac for this alone each month). \u003cbr\u003eThis, in turn, will enable me to spend more time on creating. Creating content for the blog. Doing research. Writing research reports (that you will get to read). Maybe even video tutorials (that would be so cool). Blog posts will continue to appear Monday to Friday, and will be free to read for everyone. But you, as patrons, will get extras as a thank-you for your support - such as a peek at the pictures I took in museums during my travels, a look at my drafts for papers or articles (with the opportunity to ask extra questions and help me make even better research), and the electronic version of the finished articles, reports or what-have-you (knitting patterns might be a what-have-you, for example). Once we get to the milestone where I start doing the video tutorials, you\u0027ll be getting them for free as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... will you lend me a hand to get some fascinating textile-related research done? Your pledge, no matter how small, will make a difference."
