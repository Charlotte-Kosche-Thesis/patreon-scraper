I am the current writer and occasional artist on ONI Press\u0027s comic version of the beloved and incredible Adult Swim cartoon \u003cem\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/em\u003e. My work has appeared multiple times in Marvel\u0027s \u003cem\u003eUnbeatable Squirrel Girl\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0 I even wrote the only dedicated D-Man story in Marvel history!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a bunch of comics, guys. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making comics so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the thing: \u00a0After losing the day job that has supported my wife and two beautiful daughters for the last ten years I\u0027ve decided if there was ever a time to go pro, the time is now. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m can\u0027t do it alone. \u00a0Comics are tough, hard, grueling work and the payoff for most involved is pretty minimal. \u00a0Notably, there\u0027s no insurance, there\u0027s no retirement plan and we all have mortgages to pay. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three books I want to do and I feel like now\u0027s the time, the window is open and I have the slimmest chance of sliding my way into this bonkers career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s what I\u0027m offering. \u00a0An insight into an freelance comic makers process. \u00a0I\u0027ll share pages, process pages, character design, occasional Google Hangouts for my $5 and up supporters, Q and A\u0027s about the industry and the process of trying to make it in the industry. \u00a0I\u0027m pulling back the curtain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport me if you wanted to see someone try, or if you want to be a participant in someone making a crazy dream come true.\u003cbr\u003e"
