    "summary": "My name is Sean CW Korsgaard, writer, journalist, blogger, and with your kind support, perhaps more. More on that in a minute though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a freelance writer and journalist, and a rather capable one if I may say so. Since I began writing back in 2010, I\u0027ve been proud to see a growing number of readers who seem to agree, both on my website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKorsgaard\u0027s Commentary\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/my-work-elsewhere\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe growing number of websites, newspapers, magazines and other outlets my work has been published\u003c/a\u003e over the years. I\u0027ve done everything from film criticism to political commentary, and with your help, I\u0027d like to do a whole lot more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no big secret that for journalism, and print/online journalism especially, the times are changing, and changing quickly, and sadly for many journalists and writers, myself included, nowhere has this been more obvious than in our checking accounts. Journalism and writing have never been the easiest ways to make a living, but with many print outlets on life support, and \"making money on the Internet\" proving much harder than it sounds, making ends meet can be harder than ever in the field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been very lucky that even as young as I am, I have found some small success in my field, both on the web as a columnist and blogger, and in print as an old-school journalist. I love what I do, but I\u0027ve good big plans and bigger goals, and at the end of the day, don\u0027t quite have the funds to do it and pay my bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. This, is where \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom revamping the look and layout of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKorsgaard\u0027s Commentary\u003c/a\u003e, to finally taking the plunge on video blogging, to working more on my fiction, with the help of readers and viewers like you, I\u0027m hoping this Patreon can help make it all possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I hope to make becoming one of my patrons worth your hard earned money. Want me to do a column about a certain topic or issue? To review a certain film or book? To see what I plan to write about ahead of time and talk about it? I\u0027ve always been a big believer in listening to my audience, and now, with your fingers on the purse strings, you can put your money where my mouth is. Metaphorically of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne VERY important caveat though folks: I do work as a reporter, and the integrity of the medium is important to me. So let it be clear that the money here is only covers my columns, commentary and criticism, and will NEVER impact my work as a reporter and as a journalist. You can pay to hear my opinion - you will never buy off my principles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all the readers who keep coming back, and to those of you joining me for the first time, I can\u0027t thank you enough for helping me keep doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e"
