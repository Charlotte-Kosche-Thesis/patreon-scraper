Victoria Chase, and I\u0027m currently living in the UK for a work assignment that\nI\u0027d love to tell you all about, but I can\u0027t. But I can tell you that I am just\none of many individuals who are working to make the world a safer place to\nlive. I expect to be here through the fall of 2018 and this new home has inspired me to create more stories for you to read!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEven though I am a\ntrained law enforcement officer, I\u0027ve loved all things related to storytelling\nand writing since I was a little girl. In 2009, I took the focus plunge and\ncompleted my first novel. Fast forward to 2017, and 12 or maybe 13 are out\nthere and 2 are just waiting to make their debut. Oh yes, there are also maybe half\na dozen or so shorts and novellas bearing my name. When I stop and tally the\ncount I can\u0027t believe it - overall, 19 titles are published and 6 are vying for\nmy attention.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWHAT DO YOU WRITE?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write romance in a variety of subgenres: suspense, paranormal, sweet,\nand historical--something for just about everyone who simply loves a good\nstory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an independent author with a full-time job, but I need more time to write! \u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is to present quality fiction to my readers in shorter periods of time.\u003c/strong\u003e This is where you can help me!

Quality copyediting/proofreading for a 100k+ novel can\nrun  $600-$700. Cover art typically\ncomes in just under $300. Digital and paperback files are usually no more than\n$65-$70 combined. I outsource the above services and then I upload the final\nproduct to all major retailers (Amazon, B\u0026amp;N, Kobo, iTunes, Google,\nSmashwords). Since I\u0027ve already published so many titles, you can imagine how much money I\u0027ve spent to write novels we love.

     "about": "K. Victoria Chase enjoys writing passionate, clean romance novels. She earned degrees in Criminal Justice and Diplomacy and worked as a federal law enforcement officer for several years before deciding to try her hand at writing a complete novel. Today, K. Victoria Chase is the published author of nineteen titles in romantic suspense, contemporary romance, historical romance, and paranormal romance.\u003cbr\u003eK. Victoria Chase was first published in 2012 by a small e-publishing house. In 2013, she independently released her first novel and fell in love with self-publishing. As an \u201cindie\u201d author, K. Victoria Chase has the freedom to work hand-in-hand with vetted industry professionals (cover artists, editors, formatters) to produce a quality product her readers will love. She also has the liberty to experiment with various marketing strategies and selling platforms to reach more readers with timeless romance stories.\u003cbr\u003eWhy interracial romance? K. Victoria Chase grew up reading Christian romance that featured cookie-cutter heroes and heroines. She remembers receiving one novel from her mother with a minority female heroine on the cover; they were just too hard to find on the shelves of local Christian bookstores. The church consists of a variety of individuals who look different, but all experience the same emotions. K. Victoria Chase wanted to feature relatable characters in realistic stories that everyone\u2013not just a small segment of consumers\u2013would enjoy reading.\u003cbr\u003eHer ultimate dream: to have both a robust career in publishing and writing for television/film (hey Hallmark, General Hospital\u2026email me!).\u003cbr\u003eYou can connect with her at books@kvictoriachase.com (soliciting emails will be deleted).\u003cbr\u003e",
