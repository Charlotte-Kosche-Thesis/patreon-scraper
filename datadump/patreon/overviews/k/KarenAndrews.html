    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Karen Andrews. I find writing biographies really difficult because I do a \u003cstrong\u003eLOT\u003c/strong\u003e (hence this Patreon - but more on that in a moment). I think the best description would be something like: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\tI am a multi-genre award-winning writer and author living in Melbourne. Many people first came to know me as a blogger at \t\u003ca href=\"http://www.karenandrews.com.au.\"\u003ewww.karenandrews.com.au.\u003c/a\u003e I\u0027ve been doing that for a long time now - over a decade. Phew, I know! I\u0027ve done lots more behind-the-scenes over the years. I\u0027ve worked in the arts, at many festivals and organisations. There are too many to list here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tI love helping people. I work as a mentor. I teach blogging, and sometimes creativity and poetry. I\u0027m an editor and have been published in publications throughout the country. I have a podcast called \u0027The Creative Life\u0027. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tI\u0027ll stop now.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s the thing about my blogging story over the past three years (2015 - 2018) - I\u0027ve pivoted to pretty much a purely personal/creative focus, leaving behind the \u0027mummy blogging\u0027 days of old. Not that I ever regret them, but I had to make a change. It\u0027s been a period of big transition. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re here, then chances are you know me, and what I do. I would appreciate any kind of support you can give. You\u0027ll potentially be getting rewards, too. Double win!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow YOU will be helping\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSeriously, there is so much I still want to explore and achieve. There is - and always will be - the digital space: my blog, my home. But I am extremely keen to\u00a0relaunch\u00a0my podcast and do more video work. This all takes time, and the demands on my time are increasing. This Patreon support will give me a breathing space to think and not feel as pressured. Honestly, this is partly why the podcast went on hiatus in 2017. Not only will your support be monetary - it\u0027ll be moral support too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e Prizes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWinner - Alan Marshall Short Story Award (local division), 2017\u003cbr\u003e\nHighly Commended - Nillumbik Ekphrasis Poetry Award (local division), 2017\u003cbr\u003e\nHighly Commended - Write Now!
