    "summary": "Two years ago someone gave me the biggest insult I\u0027ve ever received. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You\u0027re not living up to your potential.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was angry.\u003cbr\u003eBecause she was right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI saw two options:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.) Continue \"living\" the way I was. Which wasn\u0027t living at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.) Embrace the unknown and begin making rapid, powerful shifts in the way I was living.\u003cbr\u003eI went with number two. I was tired of living half alive. It wasn\u0027t a life at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd somehow...now, we\u0027re here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m Kyle. This is my Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding platform where people [like you] can support creators [like me] on their creative mission. Your support will empower me to spread a message of hope, inspiration, motivation, peace, and love to a wider, more diverse audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a top-ranked Communication professor (check my RateMyProfessor), writer, and life coach.\u00a0 I\u0027ve done quite a bit in the past two years. I lost 100 pounds, quit smoking (a pack a day), lived in a million dollar home, sold or donated most of my things, been homeless, lived out of a backpack for eight months, went to five music festivals, graduated from the best Master\u0027s program in the country for Communication, lived with a shaman in the Amazon Jungle, hiked Machu Picchu, and have lived to see some of my dreams become a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also been sober for over a year after using drugs and alcohol for nearly every day of my early 20s. I know firsthand what the perils of addiction can do to a person - how they can strip our life of meaning and purpose and lead to a life of isolation and depression. I also know that there are many out there going through the same experience - isolation, addiction, depression, anxiety, purposeless and meaninglessness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many ways into these. There are many ways out. I don\u0027t know them all. But I know what works for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always tried to share as much about my personal life with my students as possible. I feel that we learn best from hearing the stories of others and learning the tools, mindsets, resources, tips, tricks, and whatever else they used on their journey. It\u0027s about empowering others with those things and surrounding them with a positive, supportive community to support them on their own unique, individualized journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can leverage the power of social media and other existing tools for positive change.\u00a0 I\u0027ve got a lot of ideas on how we can support one another on our journeys for improvement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve shared my content at a small scale and have received enthusiastic and positive feedback. In the past year, I\u0027ve written nearly fifty blog posts in the personal development space and am continuing to explore content creation in other areas. Throughout this journey, I\u0027ve learned two things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.) I want to create for a long, long time.\u003c/strong\u003e The beta test is complete. I have readers and my writing helps their growth. I\u0027m passionate to the point of obsession about researching and creating - it\u0027s the most fun I\u0027ve ever had and the most alive I\u0027ve ever felt. It should continue for as long as it continues to help others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.) The content needs to be self-sustaining for it to work, and work well.\u003c/strong\u003e The \"fund writing with income from other jobs\" plan was okay for Phase 1, but it isn\u0027t sustainable. My income is unimpressive and I\u0027m putting in 40+ hours a week to read, research, and create content. If I want to continue to do so and improve, it needs to be self-sustaining.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I create?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent. Stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is to leverage social media platforms to share the ideas and projects I discuss with my classes to a wider, more diverse audience. To create a heart-centered community to support one another on this weird, wacky, wild journey on this planet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionately curious about the power of perception, gratitude, empathy, abundance, reframing limiting beliefs, and exponential  technologies. Other topics I\u2019m obsessed with include flow states, consciousness, nootropics, psychedelic medicines, mindfulness, Eastern and Western philosophies, and personal development.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be sharing on those topics as well as my ongoing journey and struggles with the recovery process, depression, anxiety, and ADHD.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will your money go to?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe.\u003c/strong\u003e Not gonna lie. I\u0027d like to continue to eat and have running water and the lights on while I read and write. I also spend a substantial amount of money on coffee. Like, a lot.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBranding.\u003c/strong\u003e I have been working with an amazing team who have worked with the likes of Jack Canfield (I KNOW!). We will be launching my branding at the beginning of next month. This will include web graphics, business cards, and business consulting to help me take the project to the next level.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing personal development. \u003c/strong\u003eBooks. Classes. Whatever. If I\u0027m being honest, this is for me first and foremost. I love all of this shit. But, it\u0027s for you, too. I do most things - like that whole journey from up there before - with the intention of sharing what I learned to help others.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThat\u0027s the basics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest? I\u0027m still figuring out. I think you could really help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was going to wait until this was perfect to launch it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realized that would never happen. I used to live my life \"someday.\" Now I live it for today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTake care of one another.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
