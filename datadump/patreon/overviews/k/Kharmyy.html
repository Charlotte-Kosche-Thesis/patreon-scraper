Just takes a moment. Thank you so much for your time and for stopping by! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my little corner of the internet!\u003c/strong\u003e So nice of you to stop by. I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eKharmyy \u003c/strong\u003eand I make\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eSims 4\u003c/strong\u003e videos from \u003cstrong\u003eCAS\u003c/strong\u003e, to \u003cstrong\u003eChallenges\u003c/strong\u003e (100 Baby Challenge) \u003cem\u003e(Coming Later this Year\u003c/em\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eFour Immortal Sisters Challenge, Not So Berry Challenge, Drifter Challenge\u003c/strong\u003e ) and I\u0027m starting up a few \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Play Series\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eActual Expansion Pack and Game Pack Series With a Background story / Story Driven LPs\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e)\u00a0 that \u003cstrong\u003ewill be introduced\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003elater this yea\u003c/em\u003er! I\u0027m very excited to share these experiences with you and I\u0027m so happy that you stopped by my page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted a place where I could update my subscribers, supporters, my Dorklings \u2665 As you may know, on youtube, if you\u0027re not a big youtuber, you don\u0027t get a \u0027Community Tab\u0027 where you can talk about things like latest videos, or things to come, or if you have to take a break. You basically have to make a video in order to communicate with your audience to update them on future content, or if things are going to be put on hold for a certain amount of time.\u003cbr\u003eI plan to post open to visitor posts weekly to let you guys know about my plans for my channel and where I\u0027m at as well.. However, for my \u003cstrong\u003esupporters\u003c/strong\u003e here on \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, I will be sharing early ideas, pictures, videos, and you\u0027ll also be able to make suggestions, vote in polls, even help create a Sim for a series, create backgrounds with me, and loads of other stuff if you decide to join one of the tiers here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not use other social media, like Twitter, etc ? \u003c/strong\u003eI do! :) You can follow me on Twitter by going here: \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/Kharmyy\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/Kharmyy\u003c/a\u003e However, the issue with that is not everyone that is subscribed to me on Youtube is following me on Twitter and not everyone on Twitter that follows me is subscribed to me on Youtube. Of course, not all of my Subscribers are subbed to one of these tiers either, but that is because not many people know about my Patreon on page because I\u0027m not exactly \u0027advertising it\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou more \u003cstrong\u003ethan likely\u003c/strong\u003e found this page hidden through a wall of text over on one of my How To Videos on my channel. \u2665 Thanks for stopping by. But it\u0027s so hidden that not many people will see it, or the videos are much older so all my Subscribers that have seen those videos when they were first posted, are not going back to them later on so they don\u0027t even know this Patreon exists!\u00a0 That is because I\u0027m not exactly ready to really advertise it/make a video about it because I\u0027d like to get everything nice and organized and get some tier rewards figured out.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is just easier because I can post updates, delays, screenshots, polls, etc here and you all can comment and discuss with me things and I can get responses quicker; and there\u0027s no hassle of making a video, editing it, editing the voice clip and then rendering and uploading. It\u0027s all just more convenient and also a place where the viewers that want to support my channel can do so by joining a tier, if they choose to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs Patreon something that you should feel obligated to do?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eNo,\u003c/strong\u003e of course not. As I mentioned, there will be public posts for everyone to view soon. But there will also be stuff specifically for  those that join a tier as well. (I eventually will be doing giveaways for Sims packs, but those are at a later date and are not on the tiers listed just yet for the reason that I\u0027m not ready for giveaways yet - there will be giveaways on my channel too, but these will be a bit different from the Patreon giveaways :) ) \u003cbr\u003eIf you stumbled upon my channel and watched a video, you watching it all the way through, liking it, commenting, sharing; that all right there helps me and also helps me learn what you enjoyed about my channel. And I absolutely enjoy getting feedback, or suggestions about things that you guys would love to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eFuture Tier Reward Plans:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI have a lot of things planned for this journey and eventually I want to add into the rewards a thank you card sent to your P.O Boxes, or other small little gifts to show my appreciation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be at a MUCH later time, though because I need to get moved, get settled into my new place, and then I need to start figuring things out for my work situation and things like that. But I promise to have progress posts along the way for when these things will start taking place + updates and pictures of these things as well! :) So you\u0027ll get to see every step of the way my ideas for these gifts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you so very much for making it to the end of this page! I truly appreciate you even just stopping by and looking through it. And if you\u0027re not sure and you just want to look around that is okay too! :) I appreciate any kind of support you want to give and it is truly up to you if you want to join a tier, or if you just whether subscribe and support me that way, or if you want to leave and just come back another time. Either way, thank you so much for listening to my story! and I hope you all have a fantastic day! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
