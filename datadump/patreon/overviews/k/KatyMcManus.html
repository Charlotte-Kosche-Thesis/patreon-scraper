Painting abstract mixed media pieces has been a passion of mine since 1991. After college I stopped creating art and I did not find inspiration again until 2014. While locked in a corporate job, that I had an aptitude for but did not love, a family friend introduced me to a painting technique that once again ignited my passion for art. The ideas just started pouring out, at 34 I changed everything I was doing; I began managing a Tattoo and Art Gallery \u0026amp; I quickly began learning everything I could again about love, life, and art. In rediscovering my love for the world of art I found that I became calmer and more intuitive, and closer to my main goal of fully embracing Inn Saei. Two years later,  I began Artistry Approach to inspire others to use their imaginations to their fullest potential too.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for exploring my artistic journey, K\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u0026lt;figure\u0026gt;\u003ca href=\"https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=origxorig:format=jpg/path/s9a153612994d9f62/image/i8d1d2bb1f3d8ea14/version/1488970217/image.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=505x10000:format=jpg/path/s9a153612994d9f62/image/i8d1d2bb1f3d8ea14/version/1488970217/image.jpg\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2\u003eInspiration\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a specific style \u0026amp; I\u0027m always trying new things.
