    "summary": "Greetings fellow enthusiasts of drumming, video games, music, and drumming in\nvideo game music,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am King Brhaegar. I make videos of myself drumming to video games and other awesome tunes. This is my Patreon site, where fans can help support my hard work. Thanks for checking it out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who haven\u0027t seen my videos, please check out my youtube page at \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/kingbrhaegar.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/kingbrhaegar.\u003c/a\u003e My\nfirst video is what I fancy to be an \"accurate\" drum cover of the\nsoundtrack to the Big Blue stages in F-zero X for Nintendo 64.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat do I mean by accurate? Just my human attempt to honor and recreate the\namazing aural and visual experience of gaming as close as I can, using acoustic\ndrums, emulators, and a USB game controller, and limited only by my extremely\nlow budget, time constraints, and the annoyingly small number of hands and feet\nI have. I transpose the music by ear, and practice every note until it sounds identical to the original part. My Big Blue video was recorded solely on my iPhone 5, and the software I\u00a0used was all free. I tied my phone to a tripod with a shoestring for the\nstills, and my brother, the president of the drums, filmed the 2 action shots.\nIt\u0027s the first video I\u0027ve ever filmed, directed, or edited, and it\u0027s been fun teaching\nmyself how to do all this with the help of the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWill the goal of all my videos in the future be accuracy? At this early stage\nin the project, it\u0027s hard to know what inspirations may or may not come. Right\nnow, and for most of my life, I\u0027ve believed that when an artist creates an\namazing part to an amazing song, that part should be honored and played the way\nthe artist envisioned. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong not to do this, but for me personally,\nIt\u0027s more fun to get inside the drummer\u0027s head so-to-speak, especially if the\noriginal drummer was a drum machine programmed\u00a0by a creative genius who may\nhave never intended the part to be played by human hands. That being said,\nthere are many songs to games I love that don\u0027t have drum tracks, as well as soundtracks for certain TV shows, and I would\nlove to put my own beats to some of them. A lot of it depends on the success of this Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will your donations help? Aside from contributing to the promotion of great video game music and drum videos, they will directly influence the quality of the videos, and keep me making them! Every dollar donated here will be re-invested into the project. My first milestone goal is to purchase a video recorder so I don\u0027t have to use my iPhone for everything. I set up rewards for donating as little as one dollar per video, but to add incentive, anyone who donates 10 dollars per video will learn my true identity and have access to all my other videos! Also, I am a professional\u00a0drum instructor; if a patron donates $50 or more per video, I\u0027ll give him/her a free 30-minute drum lesson through Skype, face-time, or in person if the patron is in the San Francisco Bay Area!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for the interest and support!\u003cbr\u003e"
