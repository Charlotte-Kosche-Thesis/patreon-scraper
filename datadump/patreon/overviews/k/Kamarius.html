No labels (I publish my music under my own independent label), no publishing companies, no intermediaries. \nEvery dollar you pledge gives me the freedom and ability to maintain my \nindependence and make the art that I want to make, so I really \nappreciate the support! \u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in supporting me, you should check out my different reward tiers, but\u003cem\u003e please\u003c/em\u003e\n do not feel obliged to give me money. My videos are and will always be\n free, and it\u0027s my pleasure to make them for you. If you have a couple dollars to spare each month, and want to become a bonafide patron of Kamarius, that\u0027s wonderful and I\u0027m SO GRATEFUL. But either way, I feel \nblessed to have you as a friend and fan.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eAlso, you might be asking, \"how often do you release videos?\"\u00a0  So, on \naverage, let\u0027s say just about a video (or maximum two) per month.  Sometimes \nmore, sometimes less, but it\u0027s about one a month.  If you\u0027re concerned \nabout going over your budget, there\u0027s an easy way to set a monthly \nmaximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment info.\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   For Music Licensing and Custom\n Music (for Media, TV, Films, Video Games, etc ) please contact me via \nmy website.
