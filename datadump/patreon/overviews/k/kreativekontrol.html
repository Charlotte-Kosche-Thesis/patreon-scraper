I\u0027ve spoken to amazing people and this show has been featured in some of the world\u0027s most prominent music and general interest media outlets. I\u0027ve had some great conversations with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vishkhanna.com/kreative-kontrol/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea long list of guests\u003c/a\u003e and, in many cases, they\u0027ve made some real revelations about themselves and their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis entire time, I\u0027ve been posting two episodes a week (mostly) for free and haven\u0027t made any money doing the show unless I can flip an interview into a modestly-paying print piece. I do get free pizza and gift certificates from a local bookstore/movie theatre, which is something. Sort of. I mean, it\u0027s good. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, working this way is not sustainable but I clearly have a need to do this and people keep agreeing or asking to be on the show. Also, every time I\u0027ve tried to quit, I get a nice message from someone about a recent episode and I\u0027m pulled back in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think this can be a pretty good show and a number of people agree. Sometimes I stumble but most times I don\u0027t. I seem to have a unique rapport with my guests, I do my research, and I listen well. There aren\u0027t too many shows like this one so, if you appreciate it, I hope you\u0027ll support it with whatever you can afford to pay on a monthly basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
