If you find yourself here, my guess is that you have read my blog at Patheos.com (The Pangea Blog), listen to my podcast (The Paulcast), or are part of my email community (Theology Curator). I\u0027m honored that you find value in the content I curate. Patreon is one way to support the many hours I put into creating content.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheology Curator\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eTC began in Kurt\u2019s imagination. He started dreaming about what it would be like to take \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Paulcast: A Podcast All About the Apostle Paul\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(see below) to the next level. Then, the idea of starting a podcast network was born. That led to this full-blown website, which houses a growing network of podcasts, but also contains a growing library of articles filled with theological, spiritual, and practical content. The goal of Theology Curator is to resource an intelligent and humanizing conversation on faith and scholarship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Paulcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-paulcast/id1097125755\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-paulcast/id1097125755\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56f0cf8e59827e39fce79a4b/t/56f9aba91bbee05d1f618796/1466229357058/?format=500w\" style=\"width: 171px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nLook, I get it. Not everyone has the time and energy to dig into ancient texts and try to make meaning out of them for today. But I\u0027ve got you covered. I want curate an experience for you where I bring together the best thinkers, books, and ideas on all things pertaining to the Apostle Paul. Let me help you nerd out a bit. How else would you want to spend your commute? Help me help others rethink everything they\u0027ve thought about Paul. I hope \"the Apostle Paul\" and \"mind blown\" will become two joint phrases in your regular conversations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ePatreon works sort of like Kickstarter or Indiegogo - but instead of backing one large project, like an album, invention, or music video, here on Patreon, you help support a bunch of ongoing smaller projects. Think of this as \u003cstrong\u003ea virtual tip jar\u003c/strong\u003e, where you are contributing to the production of quality resources you love: on St. Paul and other theological issues.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003eI am a pastor, theology nerd, and student of Paul. I like long walks on the beach and warm hugs. Oh, and my name is Kurt Willems, the curator of The Paulcast: A Podcast All About the Apostle Paul.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u003c/strong\u003e: I started a Patreon account to support my blogging and podcast. The Paulcast, with its quick dose of popularity, is the primary part of my ministry I\u0027m seeking financial backers for. I also want to re-engage my blog (The Pangea Blog) and produce written resources like books and ebooks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy me?\u003c/strong\u003e: I don\u0027t (yet) have a Ph.D. But I do love studying Paul in his historical and theological context. I have an M.Div. from Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary and am finishing work for an M.A. in Comparative Religion (Christianity and Classics). In my current program, I focus almost exclusively on Paul within second temple Judaism and the Roman Empire.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you?\u003c/strong\u003e: After a successful launch of The Paulcast, I realized that it was both financially unsustainable (for a quality show) and that I struggled to justify the time it took to prep episodes in light of having \"bills to pay.\" Yet, tons of folks have been asking \"When are you going to bring back the Paulcast?\" Well, if it is going to be with any consistency, I need some help. I need a community of Paul-nerds who can fund my dream to make this podcast a humanizing and thoughtful resource for anyone wanting to understand Christian faith in Paul\u0027s day, and in our own.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
