    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Karen Poirier-Brode, your host at A Creative Approach Podcast. I\u0027m excited to have your support as we explore creative approaches in the conversations I have with ACAP\u0027s guests. Here is a place where patrons of the show can meet each other and leave comments.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to make a monthly on-going contributions to support the show. You set the monthly limit.\u003cbr\u003eWhat these pledges cover:\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, the costs of the show. Yes A Creative Approach Podcast does cost money to produce. There are the fees of the web page and podcast hosting services. Mail Chimp and Facebook post boosts are on-going expenses. The folk who edit my shows and write the show notes, my marketing consultant and my web page designer do insist on being paid.\u003cbr\u003eNext, upgrades to equipment cost money; and, as I can afford it, I\u0027d like to upgrade to provide you with the best quality listening experience possible.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also note from the levels of sponsorship that I have a serious dependency on coffee. It\u0027s always nice to support that habit.\u003cbr\u003eIt really would be wonderful if this podcast could be self-supporting. Your funding the show really means a lot to me."
