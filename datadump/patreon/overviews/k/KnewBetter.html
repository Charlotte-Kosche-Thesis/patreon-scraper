But when, fully knowing the consequences,\u00a0you go ahead and do the same thing... is that still a mistake? We don\u0027t really know, but we DO know that bad decisions make the best stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.knewbetter.com\"\u003eKnew Better; Did It Anyway\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ecomes in. We host live events where we collect the stories of people\u0027s worst choices in conversational bar room interviews. We livecast our events online and then release individual stories later as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/farwestfm/kbdia1-to-let-you-in-on-a-little-gayness\"\u003ebite-size podcasts\u003c/a\u003e (check the link for an example).\u00a0The stories are as varied and diverse as our Oakland, CA audiences. They might be funny, tragic, poignant or pointless - sometimes all at once! Just like life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut don\u0027t mistake our intent; we\u0027re not seeking some greater truth or helping people learn from their mistakes. We don\u0027t want your regrets, and you don\u0027t want our advice (clearly). Stupidity is a common thread wending its way through the tapestry of human history, even among the smartest of us. Willful disregard for common sense is our birthright, and perhaps the best we can hope for is living to tell the tale.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.farwest.fm/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDavid Brooksher\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.irritain.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDan Abbott\u003c/a\u003e, longtime Oaklanders who bonded over their common interests in writing, storytelling, martial arts, and whiskey-based tomfoolery.
