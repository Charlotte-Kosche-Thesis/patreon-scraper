    "summary": "Kahu Gill, 25 and from T\u0101maki Makau-rau, Aotearoa\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my portfolio on\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kahu_gill/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Instagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis city defines my life and the lives of my whanau. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I know I\u0027m lucky to be here, its just not that easy living here, with such high living costs. I feel like everyone I know here is struggling, and I hear all their stories. That is what makes handpoke tattooing so precious to me. I spend hours, often regularly with people talking about everything. talking about their lives and helping them express their journey in such a powerful way - painfully, mindfully, permanently. Tattoos and other body modification always played a part in rituals and rites of passage because of its magic. I want the stories to flow through my ink and to help people heal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I\u0027ve been setting up the \u003cstrong\u003eThick And Broke Collective \u003c/strong\u003ewith some friends. Its for struggling artists to teach each other the skills they need to support themselves with their art, and to support each other out of poverty. I haven\u0027t worked out the kinks yet, but I\u0027ve got a good thing started having 3 other artists regularly at the studio. In the last year I\u0027ve seen it become a little unofficial hub for our community, but it could be so much more if I could be financially stable enough to give it the attention it deserves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been no picnic getting to this stretch of my journey.\u00a0I never learned to do things the easy way but I\u0027m proud I\u0027ve made it this far. I\u0027m making plans to get back into study, keep the collective going, and eventually setting up my \u0027arts in nature\u0027 mental health retreat on Great Barrier Island (\u003cem\u003ebut calm down thats like the 10 year plan\u003c/em\u003e). Any help would mean a huge difference to me, not just to help me survive living this freelance dream/nightmare, but to help me and my community grow and maybe you could help me out in other ways, always looking for business, financial, artistic, or life advice!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, if you could be my patreon, it would go to these things: buying tattoo and art supplies for Thick And Broke Collective; printing artwork and merch, expanding the collective to help more people, making sure I don\u0027t become homeless \u003cem\u003e(thanks Auckland -.-)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
