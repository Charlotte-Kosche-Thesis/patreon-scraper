Our joint collaborative studio is named Kitsune Illusions, and we live in the wasteland of Midland, TX. Drawing inspiration from the beauty of nature, we strive to create stunning realism and ferocious monstrosities. Our main goals are quality workmanship and breathtaking detail, and we go to incredible lengths to achieve this in our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lqUhuRf.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo say I work on these costumes full time is a massive understatement. Building these beasts has become my whole life, and I devote countless hours to innovating my techniques, adding details so fine I doubt anyone but me will ever know they\u0027re there, painstakingly researching each species I create, and trying to refine my artistic style to my ideal of perfection. Meanwhile, Kyousuke spends a great deal of his free time helping me research new techniques and materials, mold making and casting to lessen my load, developing designs for advanced costuming tech such as stilts, animatronics, PCM devices, and so much more I can barely keep up! This is in addition to the blood, sweat, and tears that go into simply creating these works of wearable art from liquid plastic, silicone, and sheets of faux fur. Realism doesn\u0027t come easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4mZwyVd.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of all of this, I also make a point to share my knowledge with the world in the form of tutorials. I didn\u0027t learn how to build these fantastic creatures all on my own, and I don\u0027t see why anyone else should have to either. I consider it a great privilege to be able to inspire fellow artists to try new techniques and materials!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WkHMyaT.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Patreon offers a unique opportunity for fans to enter our world and help us grow as artists. Pledges help offset some of the time and expenses involved with experimenting and innovating, helps ensure our operating expenses are covered every month, and in general make our lives as artists easier. We share an insider\u0027s look with our Patrons to show our gratitude, including in-progress photos we otherwise only show our clients, previews of photos and videos before they\u0027re released to the public, and exclusive shots that provide a look behind-the-scenes at how these creatures come to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xKoxqfb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAre you aware of our Indiegogo funded project, \u003ca href=\"http://igg.me/at/mordrudesmonstermanual\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMordrude\u0027s Monster Manual\u003c/a\u003e?\u00a0Production on the three costumes from that project -and all of the tutorials that go along with them- is underway!
