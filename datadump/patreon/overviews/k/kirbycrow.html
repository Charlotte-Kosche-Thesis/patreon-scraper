    "summary": "Hey folks!\u00a0 \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u00a0 I\u0027m Kirby Crow and I write romance novels about men in love. I\u0027ve written gay and M/M contemporary HEA romance, M/M fantasy romance, paranormal, and a few erotic historicals. I write these romances because I\u0027ve felt compelled to write them since I learned how to spell (no lie!). These books and the romance genre are truly the great passions in my life, and that will never change. As with any devotion, I believe that my participation in this genre must be done with respect to the readers, generosity to my fellow authors, and kindness to everyone. I hope that my work has and always will reflect that belief.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy readers say there\u0027s too much time between my book launches, that I need to write faster and more and they\u0027re \u003cem\u003eabsolutely right.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to do that! This Patreon is to help me reach my goal of phasing out my freelance art gigs and dedicate my days \u0026amp; nights to writing full-time.\u00a0Every penny of this Patreon will go toward my ultimate dream of being a full-time writer, as well as my long, LONG-held goal of a dedicated writing space (yes, I am STILL perched in the noisy dining room, wedged between the pantry and the dishes). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, it\u0027s necessary for me to divide my available working hours between writing and making art, but my art jobs actually take up \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e time than writing does. If you become my patron, you will literally be making it possible for me to write. The modest goal I\u0027ve set for now will help immensely, but when I reach my ultimate Patreon goal, I\u0027ll also be able to afford professional editing and ebook formatting for my novels (jobs I usually do myself), so that I can devote 100% of my working hours solely to writing the words, and pay another to make them all pretty in print. This is how publishing keeps churning, for authors, editors, and artists alike.\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read about me on my \u003ca href=\"http://KirbyCrow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, and you can find my gay and M/M romance novels at any book retailer online, including \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kirby-Crow/e/B002BM8VLU/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Kirby%20Crow%22?Ntk=P_key_Contributor_List\u0026amp;Ns=P_Sales_Rank\u0026amp;Ntx=mode+matchall\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBarnes and Noble\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/kirby-crow/id442533254?mt=11\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple iTunes\u003c/a\u003e.
