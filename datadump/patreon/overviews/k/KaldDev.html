Previous experience is rather broad, which makes me a jack of all trades. On the flip side this means that I\u0027m highly flexible which grants me quite a lot of freedom while creating games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlot:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePoor Chan will revolve around the player suddenly being stricken with poverty, but hope is not yet lost. You\u0027ve almost managed to graduate, all that is left is to pay the semester fee and ace the final exam! That way you\u0027re sure to get you a good job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuckily there will be some time to earn money and study up for the exam, but time is a double edged blade. Get ready to brace for the nights outside as you\u00a0will have to do your best in order to survive the ordeals of poverty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSetting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe game takes place during the modern age, with some fantasy and super-science elements granting unique opportunities and experiences. Which will be detailed further in the fetish section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGameplay:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay will revolve around the player managing their resources in order to achieve three specific goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSurvive\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay the semester fee\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePass the exam\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn order to achieve this the player will have to navigate the world in third-person looking for opportunities that will further these goals. Will you focus the money you gain on your own well being, or will you neglect your own health in order to pay off the fee as fast as possible? Then what about your studies? Will you spend time on improving, or will you find \"other\" ways?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may end up realising that you have a 4th goal in mind too, as you the player strive to customize Poor Chan to your liking. Maybe using that extra money on some striped Thigh-high stockings is worth it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently there is also some mod support with more planned in the future. As of now you can use your own custom textures for the eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFetishes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m not personally opposed to many fetishes so you can expect a great variety for content in the future, even things not mentioned here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWill you accept a contract to test some new super science drugs? Possibly having wildly transformative effects!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaybe you will find a succubus in hiding, where you can buy buffs or accept curses for some sort of compensation? Maybe that buff of health is worth gathering 3 ejaculations for?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFrom one of those previously mentioned you might find a new world of possibilities open as you find yourself fitted with a new dick.(futa)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWill you accept humiliating trials while succumbing to someone in your school?
