I\u0027m trying to create new worlds where every \u003cstrong\u003ewlw\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0lady can find herself in, where lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer aren\u0027t taboo or nsfw terms and where readers can find a safe, loving space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs stories usually do, this one starts with a young girl as well, the young girl being me, clearly. It starts around the time when I was about two and I started singing (mostly in baby gibberish), which later on developed further. I started realizing that I had a great need to express myself in some creative way and even though I had music, and I finished music school, that just wouldn\u0027t cut it. Luckily, there is a wonderful lady who happened to be my substitute English teacher that introduced me amazing literature which actually sparked something in my mind and my writer\u0027s creative juices finally began flowing, some time around the tender age of sixteen. The first stories I wrote were my first original fiction, a fantasy world filled with magical and supernatural creatures, with a romance between a young human girl and an older vampire lady, a world of mysteries and intrigue that I\u0027ve only recently (around May 2017.) picked up again and have slowly been shaping into something meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write quite a lot of things, but main themes that you will often find in my writing are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eladies loving ladies\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003estrong, independent female characters\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003egender inclusive stories that promote sex-positivism\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003epositive representation (poc, lgbtqia) and diversity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a student of English literature I found myself reading fiction more often than not, especially when I became aware of the fact that it was a wonderful tool to expand my vocabulary. Being a non-native English speaker has also always been a part of who I am and as I use the language on a daily basis, I am proud to say I learn something new every day. With my new study, Information and Communication Sciences, I tend to dabble more and more into media, searching and seldom finding what we so dearly miss - representation. It\u0027s, with my dream to share ideas and write, another reason for initially getting into writing and eventually starting this page. Writing is what I truly love doing and what inspires me, it\u0027s been a lifelong dream and hopefully some day I\u0027ll get to enjoy the moment of stumbling upon my own book in a random bookstore. If that day ever does come, I can then say I\u0027ve had all or at least most of dreams fulfilled. That\u0027s a little something on me, my motivation and my writing and if you\u0027re interested in getting to know me more, you will certainly be able to do that on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kittymannequin.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to my writing, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much more I can say about it. Those who\u0027ve read my stories, who have been following me and my updates, probably know everything there is to know about it, and those who don\u0027t well - \u003cem\u003eI believe my writing speaks for itself.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ll always find something that needs editing, something that should be rewritten, something I could have written better and that\u0027s what one should always do - learn more, learn new things, better old things.
