To communicate the simultaneous nature of unity and duality, I utilize unconventional combinations of everyday materials to enhance the details of my form. With my art, I enable my audience to access the power of their own consciousness as it exists within their own bodies as well as body of the universe. After all, awareness of life is life itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey! Welcome to my page and reading my technical but magical Artist Statement above!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a muse, artist, creator, lover and fighter. I\u0027m Kate Marie Cofsky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a full time model in Atlanta and the Southeastern United States since 2013, my focus has been on artistic nude figure, thus I spend a lot of time collaborating for life painting, drawing and sculpture classes. With classical figurative art as my jumping off point I ventured into the bizarre and beautiful world of body painting, donning other creative costumes while posing for photography to capture the precision and poise of my figure. As an artist myself, I attended the Savannah College of Art and Design for painting and sculpture. Thus, I don\u0027t stay on the sidelines as artists prepare to work with me\u2014I thoroughly enjoy playing a key role in the collaborative process, lending my ideas, tools, materials and soul to the building of each masterpiece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA portion of this Patreon page will be in support of others who are taking up the mantle of becoming a model\u2014hopefully to be inspiring enough to be considered a \"muse\" to other artists. Anyone can stand in front of a camera while it clicks and flashes or be seated in a chair for a portrait painting. That doesn\u0027t make anyone a model. Being published or having people sell their work of you doesn\u0027t quite elevate you from a model to a muse. It\u0027s the gusto, grace and grit that you bring to the table. Bare your soul, be brave and bring your best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been told many times that I should train other models because I have the professional experiences not just of managing my own schedule, booking gigs and negotiating pay, but because I bring a presence to a room that uplifts and transforms it into a totally different experience. People call me a muse. I take that term to heart. I aim to bring those powers to every gig and hope that those who hire me recognize my creative abilities and tap into them at every opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor this reason, I\u0027ll be offering over the phone and in person conversations to consult those daring women and men to become a beacon for the art community by pursuing the ever-elusive title of \"muse.\" You don\u0027t even have to get naked. You may even be the inspiration for a character in a novel. Or you may want to bare it all. Who knows? You decide. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in you. I did it\u2014I decided to be the muse.\u003cbr\u003e"
