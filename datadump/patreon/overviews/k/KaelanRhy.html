I don\u0027t want to give it up, especially before I have a chance to be successful at it. I\u0027m assured my writing is strong by editors and agents, so it\u0027s a matter of time... time that I just don\u0027t have without the help of patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have books in the query trenches, short stories out on submission, photographs out for consideration for inclusion into publication...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut none of that puts food on the table. If I have to try (again) to work in a \u0027real\u0027 job, all of my creativity will be lost.

If I had more help than that? I could invest in my art and produce even more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. What would you get for that? My current patron receives a new story *usually a sexy one* or screen shots from my current *WIP \u00a0once a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that we can do patron-only posts, I\u0027ll do those with information about intersectional diversity, spinning, gardening, my photography and my digital artwork for you as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe dreamers, creatives, gods-touched, we broken and beautiful, we need your patronage. All throughout history, many of the greatest artists have usually had patrons. It\u0027s a time honored tradition to keep creativity in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d really like you to be mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore on me can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://kaelanrhywiol.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website:\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://kaelanrhywiol.wix.com/erotica-author\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
