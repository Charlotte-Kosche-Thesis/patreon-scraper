It \nis of course my choice though to do this as I would rather work really hard on my \nown projects for little to no money than work a \"normal\" soul destroying\n job for a little extra cash.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been toying with the idea of setting up this page for a while but was worried I wasn\u0027t producing enough entertainment for you to justify it.\u00a0 However, thinking this way is a sort of Catch-22 as I have lots of ideas and I\u0027d love to do more but as a creative I have very little money to make it happen. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTherefore I\u0027ve decided to set up this page to give you guys an opportunity to support me so I can do more for you in return.\u00a0 Hopefully it\u0027s a win win situation. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t---------------\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nOnce I have a more stable regular income I\u0027ll be able to worry less about how\u00a0 I\u0027m going to pay my next bill and can concentrate so much more on keeping in touch with you all more and keeping you better informed about what I\u0027m up to.\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t---------------\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\n\t\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a bit of a \u0027Jack of all trades\u0027 to be honest.\u00a0 I do acting, directing, producing, writing, supporting artist work, \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/katemadison\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egaming, twitch streaming\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTlZqePFIh2y3yK8cUYP7WIFPRNX_Kiil\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evlogging\u003c/a\u003e, a bit of art, puppet making and various other stuff.\u00a0 I\u0027m most known for making a Lord of the Rings prequel fan film feature called Born of Hope which has over 40 million views on YouTube!\u00a0 I\u0027ve also made another hugely ambitious short-form fantasy series called \u003ca href=\"http://rentheseries.com/\"\u003eRen: The Girl with the Mark\u003c/a\u003e which is also on YouTube and for which I set up the company Mythica Entertainment.\u00a0 I plan to do more with this show and the world it\u0027s set in plus I have loads of great plans for other shows for Mythica to produce, but this Patreon isn\u0027t really for that stuff, as Mythica may well get it\u0027s own Patreon very soon. :-) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is to help support myself and all of the things I do. Some activities require more money than others. So to start off with I\u0027ll be focusing on \nvlogging, game streaming, keeping up with social media posts first.  Once there\u0027s enough money per month I \ncan look at making some larger productions like short films, sketches and shows.
