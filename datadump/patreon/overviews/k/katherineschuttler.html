My goal is to\nmake life more magic via creation in both physical media and writing. I strive\nto always improve my inclusion of minority of all genders, sexualities, and\nskin colors in my fiction. Every month, I post a chapter of a story or a stand-alone short story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNew World\nMagi-Fanfiction is based in the magical world of the Magimundi and the\nLEARN LARP creation by Ben Morrow and Maury Brown. This story centers on\nKatherine Fosso\u2019s LARP character, Lilith Radcliffe-Forsythe, and other students\nof New World Magischola. This Patreon supports my writing, and helps me pay the\nbills. Patreons have access to my rough drafts, character sketches, and\nassociated materials. Patreons at higher levels can have the ability to\ninfluence the story via polls, and work with me to include their own LARP and\nfan-characters in this fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnspeakable Monstersmut (title is WIP)\nis a work of original fiction based on the fictional Ophelia Balles novel of\nthe NWMS world with the same title. This is not based in the NWMS world, and is\na work of complete original fiction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt and Props\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not able to keep the creativity to one medium, and often make LARP props and other forms of Art. I also make most, if not all, of the props for my Husband\u0027s LARP characters. Most of my Art is based on supernatural subject matter. My current long-term project is a zine about Goetic Demons. It\u0027s called \u0027The Arts Goetia.\u0027\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAvailable Fiction Preview\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSolaris province was living hell. It was already September, but the temperature was pushing one hundred degrees outside, to say nothing of the humidity. Tree branches hung low with wilted leaves. The Chancellor had placed a temporary ban on deducting house points from students not wearing their robes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the time Lilith made it to her dormitory building, her white button-down shirt was translucent with sweat against her back. Her thighs kept sticking to each other, making peeling noises as she walked first into the building, up the stairs, and to room 209. Thank goodness the dorms were cool on the inside, she thought. She brushed a moist strand of dark hair from her forehead and pressed the flat runic key against room 209\u2019s lock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe lock was solid stone, with a flat surface raised off the wooden door. With Lilith\u2019s key, the runic lock pulsed green once, and then the stone lock\u2019s surface shifted and presented twelve runes. Lilith pressed in her passcode, and then the lock shifted to a solid, bright green. She rushed into the room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInside, the suite was dark. All the lights were off. A dead moth lay on the ground. The locked door opened into a hall barely wide enough for two school trunks to fit through. The middle inner door lead to half of a bathroom, with sinks lined up against the mirrored wall on one side and a door into the rest of the bathroom on the other. To both sides of the bathroom, doors lay cracked open into the suite\u2019s bedrooms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter wheeling in her trunks into the suite\u2019s hallway, Lilith began unbuttoning her shirt. Had she brought enough clothing? At this rate, she\u2019d be changing shirts several times a day, just to avoid turning into a person-shaped swamp. The laundry rooms were all going to be full every day until the heat went down, too. Unless Lilith started doing some washing in the sink in the evening, she was going to run out of shirts before the weekend was over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe door to 209A swung inward with a creek. Another student rolled into gaze from the dark bedroom. They had a slim build, and curly brown hair with both sides of their head shaved. Their eyes were partially obscured by a pair of pince-nez glasses with dark green lenses.\u003cbr\u003eLilith turned her head, then jumped back and pulled the sides of her shirt back together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSorry! I didn\u2019t think anyone else was here, yet!\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe quiet student put up a hand next to their face. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDo not worry. Breasts can no longer harm me,\u201d they said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOh. That\u2019s good to know,\" A pause, then, \"Are you Zell Masyga?\u201d Lilith asked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYes. I assume you are Miss Radcliffe-Forsythe? I received a letter earlier this year stating that we would be roommates,\u201d Zell said, extending their hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheir voice was smooth, almost lilting. When Lilith accepted the offered handshake, she noted that Zell\u2019s hand was just as small as hers. That was a new one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou may wish to shower before dinner. I have already done so,\u201d Zell said, then turned back into their shared room. They paused. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThen again, that will probably prove to be a futile effort in the long run,\u201d Zell added. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI just want to not smell disgusting for a few hours,\u201d Lilith said, letting the front of her shirt fall open as she hauled her luggage into the room she shared with Zell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStudents at Imperial Magischola would have gasped at how small and sparse the dormitories were at New World in comparison to theirs. Two twin sized beds, dressers, and desks were the only furniture inside the room. All of the furniture was identical and plain, which meant it was all cheap to make and easy to replace from damage caused by students antics. It also made them easy to repair. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne trunk lay under the lofted bed on Zell\u2019s side of the room. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLilith picked the other side, and wheeled her trunks underneath the second bed. \u003cbr\u003eZell returned to arranging items on their desk. Their pale hands had quick movements, long and slender like spider legs. Several mundane pens resided next to what Lilith thought might be a calculator and a pile of loose paper. There were two boxes on the desk--labeled with messy, angled handwriting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLilith unlatched one trunk, shuffling through clothes, books, and stationery supplies before pulling a decorative box out. The Mage put that to her side, then pulled out a grey towel from between several heavy books and slung the towel over her forearm. Then, picking up the box, Lilith retreated into the bathroom."
