I mean like not even meeting the minimum needed in\n addition from all other sources.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e  To a moderate degree, my projects are geared towards the preferences of supporters \u0026amp; the ratios contributed. This means I still spend a moderate amount of time doing random promising projects plus random requests also.\u003cbr\u003e*This isn\u0027t a new Patreon specific condition, this is always how I\u0027ve done it, this merely means I can spend more time doing this stuff rather than wasting time with poverty problems.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m not intentionally trying to keep people out (except for say rude people), I am initially unsure of all of Patreons functions. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0So it\u0027s possible you may need to at least register to comment or such, though I don\u0027t see why that\u0027s necessary, items will be posted to their best suited sites.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNOTE: Initially I need to do a lot of repairs \u0026amp; equipment replacements, so posting rate will likely start slow before accelerating to normal.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
