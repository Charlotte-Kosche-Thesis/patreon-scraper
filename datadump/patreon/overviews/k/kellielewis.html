We called it The Naked Hotdog as it was about a hotdog without condiments. We laughed about it \u0027till tears ran down our cheeks. I still can\u0027t really explain why we found it sooooo funny. Even though I\u0027m a traditional and clay animation veteran, (with Disney, Dreamworks and others) illustrated children\u0027s books,\u00a0designed digital toy interfaces and more, I am happiest when I am creating and sharing my own comics and art so that I can experience the laughter and reactions of my audience. I think I like the immediate feedback aspect and how people embrace the comics as their own and share it across social media. I\u0027ve even had several cartoons go viral. I truly find it to be the most rewarding work I\u0027ve ever done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport from you\u003c/strong\u003e, the Patron, means that I can dedicate time to creating comics and art, share my process as well as create a community who enjoys the same type of humor that I do. Who knows, perhaps you will learn something by my journey and be inspired to embark on yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral times a month, I will share my \u003cstrong\u003eart, comics, projects,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0as well as my experiences along the way. I will talk about strips I\u0027ve had in the past, the one I have now, and the one I am resurrecting. I do other art as well and will share that as we go along.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to do it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePick a perk you like and be a monthly Patron! Patreon is much like Kickstarter but instead of donating on a project by project basis, you become an ongoing Patron of the artist(s) you love; in this case, hopefully, me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
