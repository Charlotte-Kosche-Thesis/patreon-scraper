I\u0027m the translator for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.webnovel.com/book/7141972006000105\"\u003eSoaring the Heavens (\u98de\u5929)\u003c/a\u003e, which is currently \u00a0hosted at Qidian International.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo since you\u0027re here, I supposed you would very much like to support me and my team members in the goal to complete and provide faster (of course, quality) release for the novel. As you know, translation is no easy task and with the full time job I currently have at hand, I usually work through the nights to get the chapters out, just so that I can share this wonderful story with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuality translations and edits are incredibly taxing, and both the translators and the editors have to work closely with each other which makes up about six to eight hours per chapter! (Shout out to my editors for doing really awesome jobs!) Please do take note that although the current STH chapters are quite short, they will soon grow to 3.5k - 4k+ characters per chap after chapter 160.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we have a standard release of \u003cstrong\u003e5 chapters\u003c/strong\u003e per week. By pledging, you\u0027ll be able to have access to X(?) chapters in advance as well as bonus chapters (and whatever incentives I can think of aha)! But as goals are reached, I\u0027ll try to provide better incentives!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much and any amount of pledge is greatly appreciated!

In our case, it would be privileged rights to early releases of the chapters, exclusive content for Patrons, and other rewards like creating your own ability, character, etc within the story. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I need to pledge to read Soaring the Heavens?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo. It is completely optional, and only meant as a way to show your support to us and the story. The chapters of Soaring the Heavens will always be free and open for all to read. The pledges are just a way to offer continued support if you are able to do so. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I change my pledge amount?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes, you can.
