    "summary": "I have a deep passion for human rights, natural cycles, artistic expression, cannabis, entheogens, mental health, alternative education and spiritual agnosticism. In my world, these\u00a0topics overlap a good bit, and I often find myself using my voice and creative vision to inspire action and remove stigma. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessionally, I have spent the past several years as an entrepreneur managing the steel percussion company \u003ca href=\"http://http//www.terratonz.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTerraTonz LLC \u003c/a\u003e, which I own with my husband.\u00a0 Meanwhile, my academic background is in journalism, language arts\u00a0and education. True to this, I\u0027ve published narrative writing in many places, including \u003cem\u003eThe Humanist\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRebelle Society\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Good Men Project\u003c/em\u003e, as well as my personal site \u003ca href=\"http://www.bugsbooksbeauty.blogspot.com \" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBugs, Books \u0026amp; Beauty\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe year 2017 inspired me to become more involved in activism, and\u00a0my experience of the Women\u0027s March on Washington re-ignited my long-standing respect for the power of poetry. First,\u00a0I was attending a poetry reading in Atlanta, Georgia, when I was inspired to attend the march. Second, activist and actress Ashley\u0027s Judd\u0027s performance of Nina Donovan\u0027s poem \"Nasty Woman\u00a0\" at the march is one of my most powerful memories of the day. As of February 2018, I\u0027m using Patreon to power the bi-monthly creation of poetry collections to be released via Amazon. My poetry will be driven by my passions and hopefully will inspire desired change--at times within the minds and heart of readers, at times on a broader social scale. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery time one of my poetry collections is released, I will make a video about it and share this with you via what Patreon calls a \"Paid Post.\" Meanwhile, the others posts I make here are simply updates, offered at no cost to anyone, about my adventures in writing. Thank you for your support! \u003cbr\u003e"
