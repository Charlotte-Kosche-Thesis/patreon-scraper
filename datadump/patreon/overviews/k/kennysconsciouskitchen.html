    "summary": "Hello world! My name is Kenny Palurintano; I\u0027m a traveling chef, healer, community organizer, music promoter, life optimization facilitator, and dedicated agent of change. When I started traveling, I had no plans to share my stories with anyone but friends, who I was sending a monthly email update to. The feedback I received from my emails brought me to tears on multiple occasions, from the way it brightened people\u0027s days, to the way others related with my trials \u0026amp; tribulations, my growth \u0026amp; healing. Over the course of about 6 months, it became increasingly clear that I should create a website to share my experiences, projects, writings, and research with a wider audience. So, Kenny\u0027s Conscious Kitchen was born. Kenny\u0027s Conscious Kitchen refers to the intention \u0026amp; energy I bring into every kitchen I set foot in, as well as my \u003ca href=\"http://www.kennysconsciouskitchen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe intention of my travels is to let the Universe take me wherever there is the greatest opportunity for growth, healing, and stepping into my highest potential. I strongly believe that the most powerful and effective way to change the world is by changing yourself. My vision for the world is one of individual freedom, strong communities, and clear communication, a world where people share their gifts freely, live mindfully, and treat each other like the family that we all are. Rather than complaining about any lack of these things or trying to convince others why this view of the world would play out better than another, I have dedicated my life to embodying these ideas fully. To put it another way, every day I strive to be the kind of person who would live in the world I want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my journey, I have experienced the greatest transformation, healing, and feeling of alignment in situations where I am being of service to others. When I initially left Portland heading for the National Rainbow Gathering in South Dakota to start traveling, I knew that I was going to spend a lot of time cooking, but had no idea the variety of ways I could serve that would present themselves. Since that time, I have continued finding more gifts I didn\u0027t know I had, and sharing them with as many people as possible. I\u0027ve spent the last 9 months traveling Turtle Island, visiting world-changing people, communities, and events; connecting with some of the most powerful, loving, revolutionary people alive today. Whether I\u0027m staying with someone at their home, or attending an event with thousands of people, I try to stay present, to be mindful of everything going on around me, and to make myself of service in whatever way I feel most called in that situation. A such, the ways that I serve are greatly varied and ever-expanding, but here are some of the most common things that I do: creating food medicine (both as a personal chef and for events), being a networking hub, life optimization, massage, energy healing, building \u0026amp; repairing computers, active listening \u0026amp; counseling, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt conferences, gatherings, and festivals I always try to get myself into the support staff for the event, often running a/the kitchen, helping create highly intentional spaces, and bringing people to the event who carry similar intentions. At the \u003ca href=\"http://www.welcomehome.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNational Rainbow Gathering\u003c/a\u003e I am one of the chefs at Instant Soup, a 24-hour vegan kitchen; I co-created, and held space in, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/newearthvisionportal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew Earth Vision Portal\u003c/a\u003e at the 2015 \u003ca href=\"http://tribalvisionfest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTribal Vision\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"http://arisefestival.com/2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eARISE\u003c/a\u003e festivals; I was a chef at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.theblackhillsarenotforsale.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Hills Unity Concert\u003c/a\u003e in 2015, and this year I\u0027m helping focalize the kitchen; at this year\u0027s \u003ca href=\"http://porcfest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePorcfest\u003c/a\u003e I\u0027ll be taking part in the \u003ca href=\"http://porcfestonepotcookoff.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eannual cook-off\u003c/a\u003e, speaking at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AltExpo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlt-Expo\u003c/a\u003e (an event that is put on every year during PF), and of course volunteering for the event itself; at \u003ca href=\"http://anarchapulco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnarchapulco\u003c/a\u003e this year I offered vegan meals, made 100s of raw chocolate cookie-balls, catered an after-party, and had the pleasure of focalizing \u003ca href=\"http://www.alaisclay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlais Clay\u003c/a\u003e coming to Acapulco as the headliner for the event\u0027s concert.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point in my journey, besides my standard goals of self-discovery/evolution/healing \u0026amp; service to others, I am focusing heavily on creating content for my website, compiling a list of recipes to start releasing recipe books, starting to lead workshops \u0026amp; retreats, starting to post episodes of my cooking show, and crystallizing the vision of the festival I am focalizing (June 21-24, 2018, I\u0027ll be releasing more info this summer).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the ideas of people eating healing foods, a world where communities care for each other and facilitate each person pursuing their passions, a world of living in harmony and co-creation with nature, then supporting Kenny\u0027s Conscious Kitchen is a great way to help that shift occur. Since I live out of a backpack and have no bills, I am able to dedicate all my energy, and all the energy others send me, directly to the work that I am most passionate about, where I feel I can have the most effect on the world.
