    "summary": "Art is a lifelong passion of mine. I love animals and they have always been my favorite drawing subjects be it cartoony drawings of them or realistic portraits. I also love creating fantasy art particularly of dragons. My media of choice varies from pencil, ballpoint pen, colored pencil and digital art created with Open Canvas 1.1 and Paint Shop Pro 9. Ever since I was young, I wanted to make art my career and still do\u00a0 and with your pledges that could become possible! Besides drawing, I would also like to learn how to sculpt and support from my patrons could help me afford the materials to learn how plus keep me stocked in materials for my usual artwork of choice so that I can keep creating drawings for you to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a happily married proud lifelong Kentuckian with two beautiful cats and the best husband in the world. I am a born-again Christian.\u00a0 I have two great passions in life: my artwork and my faith in God who was kind enough to bestow artistic talent upon me in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am mostly self taught but when I was in highschool, I went to Baker Hunt in Covington, KY for art classes once a week. When I was 14, I was chosen out of everyone else in my Baker Hunt class to meet political cartoonist for the Cincinnati Enquirer and Zits co-creator, Jim Borgman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, when I was 14, I volunteered in the Art Department at Answers in Genesis and met many wonderful artists there, notably Dan Lietha, who does the After Eden cartoons for Answers in Genesis. I looked up to him\u00a0 especially as a fellow artist and this experience and the one above are ones I will never forget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2004 or 2005, I started attending art classes once a week with nationally acclaimed artist, Cyndi Mendell who became a great friend and role model for me always praising my art and giving me tips now and then on how to make it even better.\u00a0 I applied for and won a scholarship at the Art Institute of Cincinnati which is half owned by Cyndi one year. I was unable to attend, however, due to impending life changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, I draw when inspiration strikes between work and taking care of my dear husband and crazy kitties. Ever since I was little, I dreamed of art becoming my career and I still hold hope of attaining that dream which is why I\u0027m here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am willing to do special projects like t-shirt designs. Just let me know. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
