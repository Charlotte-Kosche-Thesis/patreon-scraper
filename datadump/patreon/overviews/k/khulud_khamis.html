I live in Haifa, and my writing is based on the daily reality of living in a conflict zone, thus - fictionalized realities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first novel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22907085-haifa-fragments\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHaifa Fragments\u003c/a\u003e, was published by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.spinifexpress.com.au/Bookstore/book/id=272/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpinifex Press\u003c/a\u003e (AUS),\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://newint.org/books/fiction/haifa-fragments-book/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew Internationalist\u003c/a\u003e (UK), and translated into Italian, (\u003ca href=\"http://www.fila37.it/catalogo/frammenti-di-haifa/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFrammenti di Haifa\u003c/a\u003e, Fila 37) and forthcoming in Turkish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote Haifa Fragments while working two jobs, caring for a disabled mother, and raising a daughter on my own. Last year, and following the publication of Haifa Fragments and serious health crises of two first-degree relatives, I decided that if I want to continue writing and stay sane, I need to slow down a little, and so I decided to withdraw all my savings and step down to a part-time position.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWorking less has enabled me to dedicate more time to my writing. For the past year, I\u0027ve been working on my second novel, \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eTaboos in Arabic. \u003c/i\u003eAlongside of working on the novel, I\u0027m\u00a0working on a series of short stories, which are also based on our daily reality here. The first short story is already completed and was accepted for publication by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.consequencemagazine.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eConsequence Literary Magazine\u003c/a\u003e - it will be out in the 2016 Spring issue. The story, called \"Conflict Zone Date,\" is based on an incident that happened in 2012 in Jerusalem, where a group of young Jewish men physically attacked a young Palestinian man only because he is Palestinian. It is a fictionalized reality of that violent incident. If you\u0027d like to read more about how I came to write about this, please visit my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://haifafieldnotes.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/on-the-art-of-writing-short-stories/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHaifa Fieldnotes\u003c/a\u003e blog. Currently, I have ideas and some initial notes for three additional short stories, aiming ultimately to have around 10-12 stories and published as a collection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write to bring forth marginalized voices to the forefront. I write to make women\u0027s voices heard. I write because there are stories that want to be written, and voices that want to be heard. I deal with various themes in my writings, such as racism, violence against women, militarization of civil society, identity, belonging, individual history vs. collective history. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://haifafieldnotes.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHaifa Fieldnotes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eblog, I post poetry, opinion articles, pieces on the process of writing, and self-contained fragments from my novel-in-progress.

Writing is a form of art, but it is also a form of work. I am currently not making enough money from my novel to be able to live a dignified life. I hope that within several years, and with the publication of my second novel, I will be earning enough money from my novels to be able to continue dedicating most of my time to writing. Until then, I hope you will find my writing worth supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease contact me if you have any questions: \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e/*  */\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Living through love, words, photography, poetry, art, gardening, solitude, and feminist activism.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a Palestinian feminist writer, born to a Slovak mother and a Palestinian father. Growing up in two countries and between two cultures, my identity is composed of both, and my multicultural background affects my writing. I write fiction, poetry and non-fiction fragments. My first novel, \u201cHaifa Fragments,\u201d was published in 2015 by Spinifex Press (Australia), New Internationalist (UK), and translated into Italian and Turkish. I hold a Master\u2019s degree in English Literature from the University of Haifa. In my fiction, poetry, as well as non-fiction, I deal with political and social issues such as identity, belonging, racism and discrimination, art as political resistance, hard-core social taboos in the Palestinian society, women with disabilities, and issues affecting women, all from a feminist perspective. I\u2019m a member of the radical feminist collective Isha L\u2019Isha \u2013 Haifa Feminist Center, where I also currently work as Development Coordinator. I live with my daughter in Haifa.",
