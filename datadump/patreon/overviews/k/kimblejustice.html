    "summary": "Hi!\u00a0 I\u0027m Kim Justice!\u00a0 I\u0027ve been making really long YouTube videos about games for five years now.\u00a0 In particular, I look at the history of old video game series, and gaming companies, mostly from a European perspective and usually taking the form of long documentaries - I like to document the rise and fall of a company, or to go behind the scenes and see just what forces brought a game into existence.\u00a0 Some of my recent work includes documentaries on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvYlxnHOY-Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePsygnosis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHfjANn5J04\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMirrorsoft and Robert Maxwell\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kswSNF8gsHY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNet Yaroze\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgHD66FzjyA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eU.S. Gold\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCpfjwcOVjs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZX Spectrum Magazine Covertape Wars\u003c/a\u003e - alongside series retrospectives and in-depth looks at the likes of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeOTWOAH9nM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAltered Beast\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4udiQq5gpY\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRise of the Robots\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opb7j0dna6U\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEternal Champions\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I also did a four part series on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAuvaAGnqQw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRise and Fall of Peter Molyneux\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I suppose I could just leave it at that, but there\u0027s a lot more to the vids than just me sitting in a room and talking about graphics or what have you. \u00a0I like my videos to be as thorough and extensive as they can possibly be, and I like to examine how video games and other forms of media, particularly film or music, tend to work with each other. \u00a0This isn\u0027t just about landfill license games and the like, but usually about what games have taken from films, or whatever part that game played in shaping the world as it was then, or how they deal with occasionally quite sensitive subjects.\u00a0 I don\u0027t just like to talk about the game, I like to talk about the game and the world it existed in. \u00a0Not that I\u0027m totally serious - I like to have a bit of fun! \u00a0While the odd swearword comes with the territory (I\u0027ll have you know that no less a figure than Dominik Diamond said that my Gamesmaster video contained \"top swears\"), I\u0027m not your usual angry or sarky reviewer - I can certainly put things down, but I\u0027m a lot more comfortable when I\u0027m talking about things that I like, or that I\u0027m interested in. \u00a0And I like to think there\u0027s something for everyone in my videos! \u00a0Either you come out of them thoroughly entertained, or you curse that high-pitched lispy voice or whatever - that\u0027s up to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the four years that I\u0027ve been making vids on YouTube, I\u0027ve gone in all sorts of directions in that time - games in a developing continent, queer/trans representation, and issues based around violence and the like - my videos are inclusive of everybody, but for the most part it\u0027s just me doing my own thing, which is kind of where Patreon comes in. \u00a0The channel continues to grow, but it is a passion of mine, it\u0027s what I do and already it\u0027s bigger than I\u0027d ever hoped it could have been. \u00a0But there\u0027s still limits to what I can do that I can break with your support. \u00a0Your support will not only give me more security, and more time to make the videos that you, as fans, love to see - but it will give me the ability to make them bigger and better than ever. \u00a0Your money, whether you give for that reason or simply to say \"thank you\", will be paid forward into better equipment and better, more complex videos.. \u00a0You will also give me more opportunities to interact with you, whether it be through Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s or increased Twitch streams. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short - if you wish\u00a0to help the channel grow, or just to say \"thank you\", you will receive my eternal appreciation and you will contribute to me continuing to produce the best videos I can possibly can for you, ideally once every week.\u00a0 Whatever you can give is a treasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Kim x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
