    "summary": "In late November, 2016, a mystic, a heathen, a hedge witch, a shaman and a seeker got together to weave the threads of music and magick, and Kindred Crow was born. We are a Pagan Folk project featuring Irene Glasse (Cassandra Syndrome, Imbolc Fire, Revel Moon), Chris Kackley (Cassandra Syndrome, Imbolc Fire), singer songwriter Kat Gray (Kat Savery, Twelve Days Dry) percussionist Rachel Elizabeth, and didgeridoo player Jake Hackney. Kindred Crow is an acoustic journey through mystery, magic, myth, and mirth: a little bit Celtic, a little bit Tribal, and a ton of fun. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been an incredible ride - we\u0027ve had so much fun playing music for \nyou! We have an EP coming soon, fantastic shows on the books, and \nlots of plans for merriment, music, magick, and mischief. We are so \ngrateful for our time together, and for the love and company of the \nflock! Without you, we would still just be a kernel of an idea about a \n\"simple folk project\" and not this amazing, larger-than-us family which \nwe have become.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank YOU for joining our \"murder\" ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon?\u00a0 No one in the band is independently wealthy - the truth of the matter is that we all live paycheck to paycheck, some of us with more stability than others, but none of us have a lot of disposable income.  As a result, we make do.  As most small bands do.  We\u0027re using a mish-mash of equipment left over from a very different musical project.  We need quite a few things - more microphones, cables, mic stands (ours are held together with prayer), another snake (a device that allows us to have a hub where a bunch of different feeds come together at a different location than the board itself), etc, etc. To just get Kindred Crow to the point where we could provide amplification at a live show, we\u0027ve sunk quite a lot of money into the system. We\u0027re still paying off the mixer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that doesn\u0027t even get into what we WANT to be able to offer you: Merch - we know you want tshirts/tank tops/hoodies not to mention other fun swag, a full length studio album (which will be free for download, as will the EP coming out soon), music videos, shows that involve some travel for the band....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin our exclusive community for members-only access to some of our sillier moments, first-to-know announcements about upcoming events, the inside track on our recording progress and amazing personalized gifts from the Crows. You can choose how much or little you\u0027d like to pledge, and don\u0027t worry - we\u0027ll still love you even if you aren\u0027t in a position to do more than show up and cheer when we\u0027re in your neck of the woods.\u003cbr\u003e"
