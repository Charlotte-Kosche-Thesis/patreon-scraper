This creates a lack of stability and reliability in terms of revenue. Sometimes ads pay more, sometimes less. You never really know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe content that I create for YouTube is, and will always be free. Patreon is certainly not a requirement to watch my videos. It\u0027s just a platform (similar to a tip jar)to give donations if you so choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the perks that I would like to provide are exclusive information and feedback (to be announced later.) \u00a0As I begin and continue with working you and Paetron I would be open to any ideas and feedback for various goals and perks that people might want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain thank you for time and support for over six years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks\u003cbr\u003ePete"
