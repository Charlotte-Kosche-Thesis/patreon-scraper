    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eHey There Good lookin\u0027!\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Kristen Ford, I am a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and one woman looping band. If you have ever seen me live in concert, you know I have a lot of energy! Over the past two years I\u0027ve been making music and touring full time. These adventures have brought me through 48 states and as far as Europe and South America. Recently I have settled in Music City, Nashville, Tennessee. As much as I love to travel, I also have a veracious appetite for writing songs, sharpening my skills on guitar, drums, or the ole loop pedal and having the chance to work some studio magic. That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon idea is big- really big!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u00a0I have supported myself by touring and playing shows. Lots and lots of shows. In order to make the space I so desire to create new tunes, put together a Nashville band, and blow some minds doing looping cover songs, I\u0027m going to lay off the touring over the next year. Instead you can expect new content from here here every month. A recording of a brand new song idea, a video of a basement band jam or collaboration, a reworked and looped version of a song from the top 40 charts, a \"travel song\" acoustic album, and unreleased recordings from the KFO archives are all underway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"So why should I pay for this?\"\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhelp\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ebecause you can be part of the creative process and help keep me on track. I often have a million ideas buzzing in my head, especially on those long, midwest highway drives! Chipping in for a Patreon project and leaving your comments will not only inspire me to keep content going you\u0027ll enjoy, but makes it possible for me to spend more time on my craft, less time driving, less time working a side job; time is priceless. For those who can\u0027t chip in here, it\u0027s all good! I will be getting my greasy paws all over the internet. You\u0027ll have access to lots of cool stuff! However, there will be Patreon exclusives and all new music will drop here first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, thank you! I\u0027m so excited for all that\u0027s to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eKristen\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
