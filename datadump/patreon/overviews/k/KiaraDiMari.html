    "summary": "My name is Kiara DiMari.\u00a0 \u00a0I would like to take this moment to thank you for stopping by my Patreon page and checking out what I have to offer. I am a wife and mother of 3 daughters who enjoys writing YA (young adult)\u00a0 fantasy/fiction, poetry, and creating digital artwork and graphic designs.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne series, in particular, has been one that has been near and dear to me since I was in the 6th grade many, many years ago.\u00a0 In 2007, I saw the first book through publication.\u00a0 Published under my married name at the time, Spellbound: Dawn of Destiny, hit the Amazon sales pages through BookSurge Publishing (now known as CreateSpace).\u00a0 However, the second book in the series never made it to publication as my laptop and external and all notes were destroyed in 2009 during something I cannot really get into here.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI gave up my dream.\u00a0 I was broken, crushed... I had nothing left in me to write again.\u00a0 But in 2012, I started feeling that spark again.\u00a0 I found myself doodling and generating characters and designs and plots again.\u00a0 I realized I wanted to write again.\u00a0 Unfortunately, as much as I would like to make writing my only life\u0027s work, as a wife and a mother of three daughters, my family comes first and I won\u0027t take from them.\u00a0 So again, my writing took a pause.\u00a0 Even if I was to get a book ready again, I knew the cost of promotion and editing and everything I needed to have\u00a0done was something I couldn\u0027t afford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s why I am here.\u00a0 I need to work an outside job in order to help keep our house and family running.\u00a0 I can\u0027t leave both jobs I have in order to just write full time.\u00a0 But I would still like to be known and give my new series \"The Eudorian Chronicles\" a chance to have life breathed into it.\u00a0 But I come to you not just as a writer, but as a graphic artist as well.\u00a0 \u00a0I design images and posters for benefits and just for fun.\u00a0 So this means I have even more to offer for anyone who chooses to follow and be a patron of mine.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to those who can pledge, thank you and welcome to this journey of seeing my dream come to life once again and do what I wasn\u0027t able to finish before.\u00a0 To those who can\u0027t, it\u0027s okay.\u00a0 I hope that you are still able to follow along on my journey as well.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for letting me ramble, see you on the Feed!"
