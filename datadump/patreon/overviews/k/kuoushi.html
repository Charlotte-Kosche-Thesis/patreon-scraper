    "summary": "Hello, my name is Kuoushi. That\u0027s not really my name but it\u0027s what I like to be called.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been streaming video games almost every night for over 5 years now at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kuoushi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy site\u003c/a\u003e and have built a small following of friends doing so. I am not exactly good at games, but I have always enjoyed JRPGs and only now realized that I have never experienced any game in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SaGa_(series)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSaGa\u003c/a\u003e series. Kind of weird considering SNES era JRPGs are all I played as a kid before I joined the silly PC Master Race.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy SaGa? Well, like I stated above I\u0027ve never played it. But also, I realize not everyone has had the chance to experience the SaGa series either because it has had a rough release in the English speaking world. The first three games were released on Gameboy as The Final Fantasy Legend I, II, \u0026amp; III. The second trilogy of games (Romancing SaGa I, II, \u0026amp; III) never saw an English release aside from the first, which was re-released on the PS2. SaGa Frontier I \u0026amp; II, as well as the much maligned Unlimited SaGa, actually saw western releases. Kind of a bumpy ride for the series here in the states, so they might not be as popular as other sets of games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the plan. I\u0027m going to stream at least one hour a night Monday through Friday for the entirety of 2015, only moving on to the next game once I\u0027ve finished the previous one. I\u0027ve done some basic calculations and that\u0027s about how long it will take for me to get through all 9 of these games. I will be playing the versions of the games that are probably a bit more rare in the Western world. Here\u0027s a quick list of the order I will be playing the games in, as well as what systems they will be played on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMakai Toushi SaGa (Wonderswan Color)\u003cbr\u003eSaGa 2: Hihou Densetsu (Nintendo DS)\u003cbr\u003eSaGa 3: Jikuu no Hasha (Nintendo DS)\u003cbr\u003eRomancing SaGa (Playstation 2)\u003cbr\u003eRomancing SaGa 2 (SNES)*\u003cbr\u003eRomancing SaGa 3 (SNES)\u003cbr\u003eSaGa Frontier (PSX)\u003cbr\u003eSaGa Frontier 2 (PSX)\u003cbr\u003eUnlimited SaGa (PS2)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e* Will be playing the original Japanese-only version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eQuite a few games to get through, no? Here\u0027s where Patreon comes in. It doesn\u0027t. You don\u0027t have to donate anything at all. If you\u0027ve watched a couple of streams and feel like the content is worth donating some money to, please feel free. If the content isn\u0027t worth anything to you and you don\u0027t want to watch it, please feel free to not do that. If the content is worthless to you and you want to continue watching it, well, okay. I\u0027m not stopping you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, the streams will happen regardless of how much I receive in donations, but it would be nice to know that the content is worth something. Any donations would go towards paying for the site hosting or possibly a new computer for better quality streams. Or for booze for our Saturday night drunk streams which won\u0027t have much to do with SaGa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStreams will take place at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kuoushi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.kuoushi.com\u003c/a\u003e (or if that\u0027s down,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hitbox.tv/kuoushi\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehitbox.tv/kuoushi\u003c/a\u003e). Archives will be uploaded to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/kuoushiable\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e and placed in a SaGa playlist."
