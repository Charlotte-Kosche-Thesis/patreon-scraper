    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHey guys, gals and everyone in between. My name is Ky Nicole. I make reactions and reviews to my favorite TV shows on YouTube. I work full time at an Entertainment Center so YouTube is a hobby and passion of mine on the side. Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to be part of the entertainment industry. I had an obsession with all things film whether it be TV shows, movies, acting or directing. I was always self conscious of being on camera until I finally pushed myself to start off by making YouTube videos that I assumed no one would ever watch. Boy was I wrong. I never expected to have people actually watch me and be interested in what I had to say, hanging on my every word and opinion, leaving their own responses to what I had said, cheering me on, disagreeing with me, all of the above. It\u0027s such a surreal feeling to know people care enough to take 10+ minutes out of their day to share with me. I quickly realized that YouTube wasn\u0027t just a hobby for me to share my opinions on my favorite shows, but it was a dream. Unfortunately, YouTube can\u0027t be all that I put my energy into. I have bills to pay and a job to tend to. When meeting some of the other passionate viewers of my favorite shows, I quickly realized I wanted nothing more than to share as much content with you guys as I could. I figured this would be the best place to do that and to also help further along the process to eventually put all my eggs in one basket and continue YouTube full time. Here I could give more exclusive content to my viewers and also have those willing, to support my channel in return. Please, don\u0027t feel compelled to do so if you don\u0027t have the means. Watching my videos on YouTube is more than enough. :)\u003cbr\u003eThank you for everything and all that you guys do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKy Nicole\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
