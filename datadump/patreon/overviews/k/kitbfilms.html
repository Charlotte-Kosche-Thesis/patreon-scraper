    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi Everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kevin Do Hyun Kim, but most of you know me under my alias as KKim Films. A few years ago I decided to leave my professional career as a civil engineer to pursue my childhood passion of filmmaking. In 2016, I began documenting my other life passion of street dance within the Toronto community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZMLBB__0oY?list=PLvNniH5mAHy9yw9NRZwcKrrKujU147y2t\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I initially started to practice my technical ability and develop my portfolio, KKim Films has become my biggest passion project. In addition to event coverage, I have been able to create dynamic recap videos of events, music videos of talented artists in the scene, as well as interviews showcased in entertaining ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I have decided to re-brand myself as \u003cstrong\u003eKit B Films\u003c/strong\u003e while honing my craft and providing quality content for the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy priority with Kit B Films is not to make any money. I\u0027ve poured everything I have into paying for equipment rentals, professional editing software, and constantly buying more hard drives as I film more events (I\u0027ve recently had the opportunity to increase the production value of my shoots, but that inherently means that I need to buy a ridiculous number of hard drives).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancially, I am simply being reckless. Although I have been a YouTube partner since 2007, trying to make money by monetizing videos with ads is not a fruitful venture. On top of very low margins per view, YouTube will also revoke your earnings for having copyrighted content (which is almost impossible to avoid at events spinning music), and a large portion of people use ad blockers preventing any possible monetization. Ever since starting this platform, I have accepted that YouTube simply will not sustain me as a professional. However, street dance is and will remain a huge passion and influence in my life and I wish to push my filmmaking to the next level while providing high quality content for the street dance community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMxiaYlVjVA?list=PLvNniH5mAHy_npuAyUJn3grDFncastIZ_\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I continue my venture with Kit B Films while working at my \"real job\" as a motion picture editor. By donating as a Footage Supporter, you are allowing me to allocate more of my time and resources to the community. It also gives me the time to work on my true passion projects showcasing Canadian talent in unique and interesting videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, as a Footage Hoarder I will provide you with a private Dropbox link with all your battles in HD for easy downloading.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of finances, I will continue to pursue Kit B Films with the same vigor and passion as I have over the past year in order to provide consistent and quality content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support. It means the world to me, and it drives me every day to continue doing my part for the scene.\u003c/strong\u003e"
