     "about": "On Lands of Intrigue, we are devoted to adapting published Forgotten Realms source material for enjoyment in the Neverwinter Nights Game. Our love of traditional pen and paper D\u0026amp;D guides us as we embark upon a creative quest to place our players in the spotlight in one of those most densely written about areas of the campaign, the Lands of Intrigue. Encompassing suspense and conflicts centered around political struggles of Tethyr, the threats from always-encroaching Amn, and treasures and culture from nearby Calimshan, the Lands of Intrigue have much to offer players exploring any role in the setting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe besieged, poverty-struck, constantly burdened countryside of Tethyr is a fertile ground for challenging clashes with classic foes such as Cyricists, Zhentarim, and Drow. The advantage of arcane magic is costly and regulated heavily in nearby Amn. Dragons battle for supremacy while demanding tribute from all. Knights form their own bands to try and bring stability to the land, and even lay claim to estates. One among them may claim the title of Count, if a dagger doesn\u0027t find their back first...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMystery and suspense are our greatest tools. Our creativity is focused upon serving the spirit of the setting and making it fun, challenging, and thereby a worthy pursuit for players seeking high quality, hardcore, fantasy role play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Lands of Intrigue.",
