I\u2019ve been writing, recording, producing, performing, and touring for over 10 years, engaging in as many opportunities as I can nationally and internationally. In those years I\u0027ve been spending my time searching and learning a lot about myself as a musician and a songwriter and I\u0027m ready to embrace the one thing I absolutely love doing - music. With this Patreon, I\u0027m changing my approach as to how I\u0027ve pursued a musical career. I\u0027ve spent thousands of practices, hundreds of shows, months in studios, and years of writing to hopefully find a start in this. Now I\u0027m hoping to flip my thinking on it\u0027s head.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery single song I write and every journey I experience will be shared with you directly in new ways. No more waiting on labels, management, booking agents, venues, studios, etc. to communicate and promote. As a patron to K and The Lows, you get to see inside my head at all times. I\u0027m on track to writing multiple albums, producing more, and experiencing music in communities and ways I\u0027ve never experienced. In supporting me, you\u0027ll find a lot of developments come to fruition along the way. With podcasts planned for the future, gear features and highlights, my personal public diary (patron-exclusive), live concerts, and with endless amounts of songs and stories to be written, I\u0027m hoping to have you with me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSincerely,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\ud83c\udf3a\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eK\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo learn more about how Patreon works and what becoming a patron means, click\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/about\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
