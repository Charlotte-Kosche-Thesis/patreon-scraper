    "summary": "I am a writer and what I do is write. I love challenges when it comes to writing and I plan on keeping the flow of my stories pretty consistent. As with journalism, I have an audience I am writing to. I am a storyteller and I always have been, even before I could remember. Before I could write, I told stories orally. In elementary school, I got my entire class to believe the school was built on an Indian burial ground because I poured so much detail into my stories. In 3rd grade, I got my class to believe leprechauns were hopping around during St. Patrick\u0027s Day and it went as far as setting up a \"leprechaun hotel\" in the classroom with a bowl of Rice Crispies inside (I made them believe this is what leprechauns ate). In 5th grade, I made up a story about a boy being murdered in the creek near the school and we went and investigated the area to contact his spirit. With my stories, I got people involved emotionally and that\u0027s what I like to do with my writing. A reader who is emotionally involved, whether it be from anger or disgust or sadness, is a success for me. When I play video games, it is the story I focus on. Can the story tug at my emotions? If so, then it usually becomes one of my favorite games. This is my ultimate goal in writing and this is what I plan to bring to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease feel free to send me challenges as well. I love interacting with my readers. Send me pictures or artwork and have me write a story from them. Ask me to do flash fiction. I love being pushed to do better and more creative things with my writing. Even I\u0027ll challenge myself every now and then if I don\u0027t get any challenges for awhile. It keeps things interesting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything specific you want me to write about? Send it to me! I\u0027ll weave a tale a best as I can and you can see your idea come to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you come to enjoy my writing as so many others have. I live to tell stories and I want to try making this work on Patreon. I haven\u0027t included rewards or goals yet because I don\u0027t know what I can yet offer in rewards other than my writing and my goal is to just listen to you guys as readers first and then go from there. Really, with more amounts pledged, I will be writing more frequently. It\u0027s the one and only goal: to tell the stories.\u00a0"

     "about": "Ever since I learned how to read, I wanted to write. I started out writing horror stories for my grandfather for $5 a piece at a young age. I was completely enthralled with everything horror and supernatural and I spent days researching and reading and writing my own stories. I kept a case file of all the haunted places I could find online because they fueled my desire to write scary stories. At 15, I was first published in TeenInk Magazine for a short story (oddly not horror) about an experience I had saving a dragonfly\u0027s life. From there, things escalated. I attended the Iowa Young Writer\u0027s Studio at the University of Iowa the summer after my freshman year of high school and from then I wanted to go to college; I was so over high school. My sophomore year of high school, I fell into journalism and ended up managing my high school newspaper. In college, I joined the newspaper and after only a semester on staff, became Editor-in-Chief. Being a technical school, I quickly learned I needed to have my own motivation in furthering my writing, so I began freelancing for multiple publications around the country, sometimes at the same time. I\u0027ve written for WHOA Magazine, CHAOS Magazine, Pink and Black Magazine, and more. I interviewed the band, Night Riots, back when they had just changed their name from PK and a couple weeks ago I heard them on XM Radio\u0027s Alt Nation Top 18 Countdown! It\u0027s stuff like that that propels me to keep writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I graduated college, I interned at Game Informer Magazine where I truly found my love for video gaming and storytelling. If you read my stuff on the website, you can tell I cared more for the feature articles than I did for the news articles. In the feature articles, I could tell a story and be creative. I believe Game Informer is what pushed me in the direction I am going in today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was hired on as a Creative Writer for NCSoft, the video game company that brought you Lineage and Guild Wars and am working on an unannounced Triple A title. This change from journalism to the video game world got me thinking: I want to start writing creatively again, and I may be inching towards writing stories for video games. It is the job with NCSoft that has opened this door for me and I think I want to take the opportunity. And that means I have to get back into writing, A LOT.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m known to all of my friends as the one who dreams in great detail. I sometimes have premonitions in my dream and I get \"messages\" in my dreams sometimes. I also dream of great stories where everything is mapped out in an epic adventure. My dreams are extremely important to me as they guide me, I guess I\u0027m one of THOSE people, you could say.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love tattoos, but I only have two due to recently moving cross country to California from Michigan and spending my entire savings in doing so. I have a dreamcatcher on my foot to symbolize the importance of my dreams and a horror tree on my shoulder with the words \"It was a dark and stormy night...\" to signify where I got my start in writing (writing horror stories).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for what I do and I am ready to take the challenge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
