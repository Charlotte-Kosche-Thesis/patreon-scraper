    "summary": "I\u0027m Kris Overstreet, and among other things, I write stuff. Over the years I\u0027ve written a good bit of fan fiction, scripted some adults-only comics, and made a beginning (though not yet an ending) on various novel projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve wanted to make writing fiction my living for quite some time, but I\u0027ve generally been too distracted by making a living (to say nothing of other time-wasting activities) to commit to it full-time. I run a small company which began as a small-press publisher, which over the years has mutated into a general-purpose convention merchant\u0027s booth. Running that company, and the travel involved, eat up a TON of my time and energy, and over the past few years my writing output has dropped to a trickle as a result. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in. If I have money coming in from writing, I can slow down the pace on the convention circuit, pick and choose my cons instead of going to as many as possible and hoping things will end up all right. That will leave me more relaxed and with more free time to focus on writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEXAMPLES OF CURRENT PROJECTS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWEBCOMICS- I script the webcomic \u003cem\u003ePeter is the Wolf\u003c/em\u003e, which has top priority on my creative efforts. I\u0027ve also begun a text side story, PitW-20, about the parents of the main PitW cast. I also want to see the adults-only webcomic \u003cem\u003eChocolate Milkmaid\u003c/em\u003e finished, but my lack of energy has slowed production on that to nothing in the past year except a few script pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOVEL PROJECTS- I have two novels about halfway written. \u003cem\u003eLee Goes North\u003c/em\u003e is an alternate-history novel about what might have happened had Colonel Robert E. Lee not been relieved of command of the United States Army in Texas during the secession crisis. \u003cem\u003eSafeharbor\u003c/em\u003e is a science-fiction story about a woman who inherits an entire solar system... only to find out that it\u0027s not all she dreamed of, and having and keeping it are entirely different things, especially in the middle of an interstellar civil war. I\u0027ve tinkered with both a little now and again, but my lack of energy for writing has left them stalled for about two years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSHORT STORIES- I began an interlinked adults-only story collection several years ago, \u003cem\u003eMu Beta Epsilon\u003c/em\u003e, focusing on breast expansion and transformation themes. My production has suffered, and so have donations for it. I\u0027ve returned to working on this a bit since beginning this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFANFICTION- Sometimes inspiration just won\u0027t let me be. I\u0027ve written quite a bit of fan fiction in the past, some of it X-rated. My most recent work has been in My Little Pony fandom (nothing X-rated written using that!), particularly the project I used to jump-start my writing muse in May 2016, \u003cem\u003e\"Changeling Space Program\"\u003c/em\u003e (merging MLP with the computer game Kerbal Space Program). My fanfiction is looser than my other prose, usually first-draft and post, since I\u0027m usually doing it for my own entertainment rather than as commercial work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all things I lean towards comedy, adventure, and optimism. I don\u0027t do dark or tragic tales. For my adult material I will not write serious explicit non-consensual material; I want to keep my work sex-positive as much as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople who fund my Patreon will not only help me write more, but by telling me what they want to see they\u0027ll guide my creativity, telling me where to focus my efforts. Of course the muse, when it bites me, has veto power over what gets written... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who want to read my released works, check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.wlpcomics.com/writing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis webpage\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
