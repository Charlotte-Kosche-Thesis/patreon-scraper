I recently graduated with a BFA in Illustration from Brigham Young University out in the mountains of Utah. I currently work as an professional illustrator in the gaming and animation industry. I\u0027m very passionate about creating artwork for everyone to enjoy.  That is the main reason I decided to create this Patreon!  I\u2019ve enjoyed making this passion project on the side and I\u2019d like to expand and share this amazing story with everyone!  I especially love to design characters and concept stories and ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhen I\u0027m not at work, I\u0027m either working on my own stuff at home or catching up on video games. I\u0027m also a huge animal enthusiast and have my own pet snakes, whom I love dearly. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8IUl3R3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat is King and Lionheart?\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInspired by the song by Of Monsters and Men, \"King and Lionheart\" is a side project that I developed during my free time.  It is now a large passion project and I do it completely out of love for my characters and the band that first inspired this world! The story is centered around two best friends who come from two very different worlds. Reyez is the crown prince and is destined to lead his Kingdom, while Noel is a citizen from the lowest class and has a deep seeded desire to seek vengeance against the royal family.  After becoming the unlikeliest of friends, their friendship is put to the test when their worlds collide and both have to decide where their loyalties lie.  Choices that may result in the destruction of the kingdom itself! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Pledge to Your Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThis is a very good question and one that I have put a lot of thought into over the past few months before I finally decided to create a Patreon.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating a comic and updating it regularly is hard work.  It requires time and dedication to create characters and environments, develop the world they live in, and write a compelling story that is driven by characters and emotion.  Due to my immense love for this world, I desire to spend as much time as I can, outside of work, building and expanding this universe.  It is my goal to finish the first volume of King and Lionheart this year.  A comic which my patrons will be able to see first!  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe money you donate to this Patreon, apart from receiving super cool rewards, will go toward the benefit of the King and Lionheart project.  This money will help supplement the income that I used to make by offering my time on making commissions for others.  Now that King and Lionheart is developed, I would much rather use that time to show my own project to the world.  You can be a HUGE part of making that happen! \n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Does This Work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIt\u2019s very simple!  Throughout the month I\u2019ll be posting the free content as I complete it.  This includes, but may not be entirely limited to, the full pages of the comic itself.  If you do not have the money to support me, feel free to enjoy my comic in its most pure form and spread the word to your friends and family.  Every new person who reads my comic is another person who gets to immerse themselves into the world I created!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPledgers, however, will receive unlimited access to the secret vaults hidden underneath Reyez\u2019 castle.  The vaults contain amazing material and content such as original concept art, funny side comics that focus on character interactions (that may or may not be canon), and the many ideas that I have that build their character development!  That and more amazing rewards await those who pledge money to the King\u2019s Cause!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs soon as you pledge, you\u0027ll be charged up front and then be charged at the start of every month following. So if you\u0027re considering pledging, then I\u0027d recommend that you pledge at the beginning of the month to avoid be charged twice closely together!  If that doesn\u2019t bother you, though, I like all the help I can get.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for taking the time to check out my Patreon!
