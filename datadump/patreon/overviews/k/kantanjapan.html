    "summary": "When I began my quest to conquer the Japanese language, I had no idea in which direction I was travelling. I spent many hours every day reading anything I could possibly find on the language and how to better study it. This was the origin of Kantan Japan. A channel in which I attempt to help aid people starting their own Japanese journeys. Naturally, as my obsession with the language grew, I couldn\u0027t help but get absorbed by the fascinating culture of Japan too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo come and join me, for an incredible journey of language discovery and cultural immersion. There\u0027ll be all kinds of videos focused on the less talked about aspects of Japanese. I\u0027ll also be travelling to all sorts of locations across the country to uncover some of it\u0027s best kept secrets to share with you.\u00a0There will be Patreon-only polls to help guide the future of this channel and I\u0027ll be hosting (fairly) regular Google Hang-outs once our budget will allow me to set-up a space to do so (and the community is big enough to warranty doing so!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor what you can expect to see from Kantan Japan in the future, there are mainly 3 types of video that I would like to make and alternate between.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJapanese culture (documentary style) -\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Il8mFaiMtSY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJapanese language study advice and vlogs -\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5t7pmVB8ixo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRandom format, covering the many oddities than can be found in Japan -\u00a0\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eohz16jhV1Y\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll these videos will be uploaded on Kantan Japan\u0027s Youtube channel, free to watch, when ever and where ever you please. If you wish to take your Kantan Japan experience to the next level, you can become a supporter here on Patreon for as little as $1/\u00a31 a month and have exclusive access to the following content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrent Patreon content:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eIf available, all of Kantan Japan\u0027s Instagram photos will be uploaded to the Patreon page in full resolution, for a much better viewing experience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePolls to help steer me in the right direction.
