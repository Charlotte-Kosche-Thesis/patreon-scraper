I don\u0027t have all the details worked out just yet, but I hope to start making short little story things so that you guys can get to know the girls a little better. I have no real length for each one in mind.\u003cbr\u003eFor all I know, they could range from 3 panels to a full, ongoing story. Hard to say just yet.",
