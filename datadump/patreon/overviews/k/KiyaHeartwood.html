Thriving artists who can make a basic living can focus on making better art. More community oriented, online, LBGT and feminist oriented projects will wither on the vine without a group of far seeing supporters who want to back this work. Patreon offers a new way to build strong community between artists and patrons where both can mutually benefit.\u003cbr\u003e"
