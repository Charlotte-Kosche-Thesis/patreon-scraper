    "summary": "My blog follows my journey as I do my best to live a healthy, balanced life. I am a freelance writer, newlywed, runner, and fan of clean eating. I enjoy following a mostly healthy diet and indulging in well-timed yummy treats. I love sharing healthy recipes, DIY tutorials, running and half marathon training tips, and stories from my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy blog will include a few ongoing, regular components:\u003cbr\u003e1.) My husband Mike and I have been experimenting in our kitchen for a long time and we finally have the confidence to start developing and sharing our own recipes. I\u0027m so excited to combine our backgrounds (I\u0027m been a vegetarian for over 20 years and thrive on plant-based food; Mike is a Belgian-born carnivore with a vast knowledge of international cuisine and bold flavors) with our shared passion for making healthy, yummy food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.) Each week I will share a DIY Day to show how to make natural, homemade versions of beauty and cleaning products. From shampoos and soaps to glass and counter cleaners I\u0027ll show you how to make products that are cheaper and safer than the ones you buy in a store.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest of my blog will be devoted to a variety of rotating topics, depending on what I feel most passionate about at the time \u2014 and what\u0027s requested by my patrons. Examples of these types of posts include:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022On Finding Your Inner Athlete\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Anatomy of a Binge\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Making Your Own Mojo\u003cbr\u003e\u2022I\u0027m Happier Being Happy\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Twelve Months, Twelve Races and a Lifetime of Lessons\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Let\u0027s Talk About Running Apps\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Mastery is Boring\u003cbr\u003e\u2022For Those Who Don\u0027t DIY: A List of Resources\u003cbr\u003e\u2022How To Make Healthy Meals Without a Recipe\u003cbr\u003e\u202211 Ways To Be Nice To Yourself Today\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it will work. Every week on my blog (kristenforbes.net/blog), I will post three times. ONCE a week, I will make a Patreon-specific posting that is only accessible to my Patreon patrons. \u003cstrong\u003eThis post only costs $1 unless you choose to donate more. Since I\u0027m posting once a week, it will work out to $4 a month. \u003c/strong\u003eIn exchange for donating $4 a month to my healthy lifestyle blog, you will receive access to the Patreon-only posts. You will also be able to ask questions, propose topic ideas, and request recipes for me to share on the blog. I will also be adding some fun new perks in the coming months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
