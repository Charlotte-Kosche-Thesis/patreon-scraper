    "summary": "I\u0027ve become so close to you guys with all the intimate and emotional subjects covered in my films, that now when you leave comments on my videos, I really feel like you\u0027re family. I\u0027ve been working on this dream for nine years and often I\u0027ve felt like giving up. But then I see you\u0027ve subscribed to my work or left me a super personal comment saying you also believe in beauty and kindness and creativity, and it\u0027s these little messages in a (digital) bottle that have pushed me to keep going year after year. I\u0027ve produced, hosted, filmed and edited travel shows that air in 70 countries, becoming one of the only people in the world to make TV shows solo without a film crew or production company. I\u0027ve studied Spanish, Italian and Japanese. I\u0027ve interviewed thousands of people around the world on topics of empathy, love, motivation and happiness. I can feel that a community of likeminded dreamers is forming over on my YouTube channel and with your support I could continue to bring you weekly episodes on subjects you and I both love. TV networks just want travel cliches with no soul. Brands just want to promote their product. But with a little help, I can keep producing short films, epic travel adventures, interviews, poetry and my Touch the Sky series where I share what\u0027s kept my stamina, creativity and self-belief going for a decade of living (and chasing) my dreams."

     "description": "It\u0027s currently impossible to edit on my laptop because of the cracked LCD screen, which blacks out a third of the screen. :( It would also be such a relief to be able to work on a laptop with enough space and memory so that I could render and export videos faster and be able to execute special effects in After Effects. So after those smaller expenses listed in my previous goals, reaching this would allow me to purchase my main tool for making these videos!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e",

     "description": "I DREAM of external hard drives! I\u0027ve run out of storage space and after purchasing music this would be my next goal and allow me to buy two 2TB LaCie Rugged external hard drives, which cost $260 each. These are essential when I\u0027m out filming for days on end and need something light robust and portable. I always carry one hard drive out with me filming and store a backup with copies of each day\u0027s files back at my accommodation to be sure I don\u0027t lose anything.",

     "description": "After purchasing music and external hard drives, at this level of funding the next priority would be my broken cameras. Both my GH4s, which are my go-to cameras, are currently faulty - whenever I press record there\u0027s a five second delay and the same for when I stop recording. This doesn\u0027t sound like much but it is so frustrating when trying to grab quick spontaneous moments or when I\u0027m part way through an interview and the recording stops, I lose part of the scene because there\u0027s the delay when I press record again. Last time I got these cameras repaired it cost over a thousand dollars so it would be incredible to film with a whole new camera body in the GH5.",
