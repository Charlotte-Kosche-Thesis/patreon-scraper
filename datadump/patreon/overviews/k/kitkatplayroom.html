We know from experience that most neo-natal kittens can thrive under the right conditions and environment. Unfortunately, thousands of newborn kittens find themselves in shelters every year. Their lack of immune system means they are extremely susceptible to illness and disease in overcrowded shelters, where they are surrounded by other cats and handled by multiple people. Kitkat Playroom rescues these kittens and their moms from these high-risk situations and raises them in a sterile, safe, and loving home until they are ready for adoption by a forever family. All of our rescues are spayed/neutered, microchipped, dewormed, and receive all the veterinary care they need before they graduate from foster care.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0O u r \u00a0 S t o r y \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tMy name is Jenny Mack and I founded\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eKitkat Playroom as an official nonprofit rescue in October 2016. It was no surprise to anyone that I started my own kitten rescue. The question people ask me now is, \"Are you going to grow? When will you rescue goats??\" Maybe one day!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve been fostering families of kittens and broadcasting them live since 2014, but my rescue days started 35 years ago. My dad would take my little sister and me to the local live animal auction about once a month, and we\u0027d inevitably come home with a rescued bunny or chicken. We had a small micro-farm in the huge backyard of our suburban home that I\u0027m sure was completely illegal but the neighbors didn\u0027t complain. My dad would bring home turtles who had been run over, glue up their shells, and return them after they healed. He was good friends with\u00a0Betty Woodford, who founded Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge in Medford, NJ.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tI think my family realized that my heart was dedicated to saving ALL THE ANIMALS when I was about 3 years old. I was sitting on the porch outside, with my back to the house, hunched over -- sobbing -- and diligently trying to do something. My grandmother came out to see why I was so upset. I had a worm in my hands. I told her that I\u0027d accidentally broken him in half, and I was desperately trying to tie him back together with my itty bitty fingers. It wasn\u0027t working and I was devastated. She reassured me that she would take care of it, and got me back in the house. Of course, my grandmother just threw the worm (worms?) back in the yard. But she says she had never seen a child care about the life of a little worm so much and she knew I\u0027d be saving animals forever.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tIt took me a while to get here... I work full-time as a software developer, so I split my time between Kitkat Playroom and supporting my life.
