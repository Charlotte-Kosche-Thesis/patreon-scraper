The game will be full of content that will pretty much consume a large amount of time between myself and my supporters on this project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I would like to eventually purchase \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRPG Maker MV\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003cem\u003eupgrade\u003c/em\u003e the game into a better and more powerful program, as well as getting the funding for a new \u003cem\u003elaptop\u003c/em\u003e as my current one is well used and is slowing down greatly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am happy to share what I am doing towards maps and what I am doing with the game plotwise. Also I will be sharing small tidbits here and there such as classes, activities and select characters. It is completely up to you if you wish to help fund me as I am not begging you but it would help nonetheless. The game will be completely free to play to anyone once it is finished but I will flat out say that this game will likely take me \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eover a year to complete\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e with all the content being added into it such as \u003cstrong\u003eanimated cutscenes\u003c/strong\u003e to editing scripts to my needs. I thank you for your support and hope to hear from you if you wish to help!"

I\u0027ve always had a more artistic and creative flair to life though as you can tell with my hobbies of music creation and game and story development. I love fantasy and mystical worlds its so easy to get lost in them and I\u0027d love to share that view with everyone around me.",
