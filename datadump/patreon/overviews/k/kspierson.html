    "summary": "My name is Ken Pierson, and for as long as I can remember, I have been in love with movies and the wonderful film scores that bring them to life and capture the hearts and minds of audiences. The deep emotion, dramatic tension, and sparkling magic that a quality score provides can truly elevate an already well made piece of film to new heights, and, in the tradition of great film composers such as John Williams, Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith, and Danny Elfman, I seek to provide\u00a0original custom-tailored music of the highest caliber for film, as well as television and video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, more recently than many people think, classical composers were often supported by patrons, allowing them to work with less to no financial burden--which in some cases led to the creation of some of the most well-known and loved pieces of classical music. It is with this in mind that I reach out for support from those are lovers of great film music and who wish to continue to hear well-written, detailed, and moving music accompanying new films for years to come, in hopes of providing that music myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, I was awarded first place in the inaugural Marvin Hamlisch Film Scoring Contest held by\u00a0CINE (Council on International Non-Theatrical Events), and shortly after I scored my first independent feature film \u003cem\u003eDetached\u003c/em\u003e, directed by young and extremely talented director Stephen French. Since then, I have been actively searching for new projects to work on, and have recently begun to score a short film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePresently I am completing my Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies in Film Scoring at James Madison University under the mentorship of Dr. David Cottrell, and will graduate in May 2017; I have also previously studied music composition with Dr. John Hilliard and music theory with Dr. J. Randall Wheaton.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am terrible at writing about myself, but I appreciate you reading and listening. Please let me know your thoughts and I am greatful for any and all support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
