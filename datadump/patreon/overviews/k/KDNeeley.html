I\u0027m a gallery owner, visual artist, and writer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m making the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://neeleyarts.com/index.php/life-with-art/wet-stuff\"\u003e Wet Stuff Podcast\u003c/a\u003e. Wet Stuff: The Art of Painting a Business is a podcast for creative minds that want to learn more about the business side of pursuing a creative endeavor. This podcast is my way of sharing my own journey as an independent visual artist, there\u0027s always something new to learn and Albuquerque is filled with brilliant creatives ready to share their knowledge. In the Wet Stuff Podcast, I interview fellow visual artists, gallery owners, entrepreneurs and other creatives on their business practices and how they apply their own creative thinking to generating revenue doing what they love. As a Patron, you\u0027ll have early access to the latest podcast episodes as well as a chance to give me feedback on episodes you\u0027d like created, I hope you enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write\u00a0the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://neeleyarts.com/index.php/life-with-art/creative-encounters\"\u003e Creative Encounters Blog\u003c/a\u003e. In Creative Encounters, I share conversations I have with some of the Creative artists and thinkers I get to meet every day. Albuquerque is bursting with artists and I\u0027m always coming across a new person to talk with about their life. I love writing about these conversations and sharing their work with others who may enjoy what they do and how they think. Give it a gander and let me know what you think about the articles. Which ones are your favorites?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Art Gallery and Event Center is located in the heart of downtown Albuquerque, just down the street from the Albuquerque Convention Center. In this space, I host events and art exhibitions to inspire and support myself and fellow creatives. My primary goal is to host fund raisers and bring together art exhibitions with acts of change that can have a positive impact on our community. I hope you get a chance to visit. It\u0027s located at 104 4th St NW, Albuquerque NM 87102. I\u0027m open Tuesday - Saturday from 1pm-5pm (at least). If you knock on the windows and I\u0027m in the studio working I\u0027ll let you in to see the show, I love visitors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, of course, I make visual art :) You can collect my works of art right from my website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://neeleyarts.com\"\u003ewww.NeeleyArts.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
