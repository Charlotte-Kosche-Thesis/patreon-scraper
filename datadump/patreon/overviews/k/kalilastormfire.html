And why aren\u0027t you Kalila Stormfire? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eHi! I\u0027m just your average Cuban-Canadian-American bruja who loves storytelling and the occult. Preferably together. Hence, my new podcast \u003cem\u003eKalila Stormfire\u0027s Economical Magick Services\u003c/em\u003e, a limited fiction podcast about a witch\u0027s documentation of her clients and how she deals with a mysterious saboteur who is trying to destroy her magick business.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho would want to listen to a story like that?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u2019re a fan of stories dealing with shapeshifting dogs, love spells gone wrong, astral projection, angry dead rich dudes, and morally ambiguous witches...this podcast might pique your interest. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will the podcast premiere? How long is it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThere will be 13 episodes, around 20-25 minutes each. Episodes will be posted on the 1st and 15th every month starting February 2018. I have written all episodes as well as all bonus material for patrons. Because some of the bonus material includes spoilers, they will only be released once the related episode is released. My aim is to complete the series by the end of August 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I find/subscribe to the podcast?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe official website is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kalilastormfire.com\"\u003ekalilastormfire.com\u003c/a\u003e. The latest episodes are already publicly posted for your ears here on Patreon and a page out of Kal\u2019s grimoire is posted in the patron-only feed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe podcast is currently available to subscribe to on\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://kalilastormfire.libsyn.com/website\"\u003eLibsyn\u003c/a\u003e, iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, Pocket Casts, and Stitcher.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy produce this story?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe idea for this story came about because yes, I--like Kalila--am a brown, queer witch. While many of the practices, potions, and spells are entirely fictional, they are based in some version of the truth. I\u2019ve picked up plenty of juicy, witchy, storytelling-worthy notes in my years studying and practicing witchcraft, mysticism, the occult, and folk religions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love creating new stories and this story is the product equivalent of enthusiastically diving off a cliff without a parachute. I fell in love with the audio drama format recently; \n\u003cem\u003eWelcome to Night Vale\u003c/em\u003e enlivened my idea of storytelling mediums. Like every creative person, my core hope is that someone will look at my story and think \"Hey, this is a pretty cool thing, I think I know a few other folks who might like the thing\". \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you be doing with any Patreon support?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIf you like the podcast, I would be honored if you help support me as I record, perform, edit, and publish each episode! I also have a few more stories in the pipeline and I would love to bring those stories to life. My goal is to use any extra funds to support future work. I plan to invest in better audio editing/equipment and bring on paid actors. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ePodcast Budget:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLibsyn for RSS hosting/distribution: $15 per month\u003cbr\u003eWebsite on Squarespace: $16 per month\u003cbr\u003eDomain: $20 per year\u003cbr\u003eScript consultants (3): $400 total\u003cbr\u003eActor: $200 (one full episode and 2-3 features)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eTOTAL = $620 set expenses + $31 monthly\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally, I would like to pay myself for my work. I put around 8-10 hours of editing, sound design, and acting per episode. I also work as the sole marketer, from pushing merch to engaging with folks on social media about 5 hours per week. In total, that\u0027s about 15 hours per episode or 30 hours per month. According to where I live, in the DC-area, living wage would be about $17 per hour. Just paying myself would add up to $510 per month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, I have a full time job and I can afford take some of the above out of pocket. The reason I am breaking this down is so people can know how much work audio drama creators--even amateur ones--actually put into getting a podcast up. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe in paying creators and artists fair wages. That is why I would not \"pay myself\" because I am more invested in bringing on paid actors/editors. That means, depending on where they live, I will pay them a living wage per working hour.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eFiction podcasts are an incredibly exciting art form and I am thrilled to join the ranks of other creators.
