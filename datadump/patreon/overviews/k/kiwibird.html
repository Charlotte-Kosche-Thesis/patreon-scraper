    "summary": "Hello friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet it be known that this is, first and foremost, a page for comedy. I will have dark humor because I have seen dark things in my time, but I also just cope with my troubles with humor. I like making you smile. Yes, you. You there with the great smile, that\u0027s you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may know me from my time at Trion Worlds, Riot customer service, or Kingdom Games most recently. I am working to pay off medical debt that has been caused by severe abuse. Please do not be sad for me, unless that makes you more likely to donate, because I do desperately need donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so happy to be alive. I almost killed myself before, a year ago, a week after November 9. A coworker I will not name made a \"Live fast, die young\" joke in reference to myself and my father. On that day, November 9, 2015, he had been dead for 5 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is sad, but I have known such joy. You have seen it. It is possible that I have already made you laugh before, or shown you kindness, because I try to do that with everyone I meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy subscribing to me, you will hear my story. I am trusting that you will be kind and respectful towards me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not, you can have your money back, because I do not need it enough to be abused more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will make beautiful and wondrous creations for you all. I hope you will support me, as I have been a part of support for a long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also need funds for my lawsuit against the hospital that mistreated me so strongly that my poor mother had to listen to me cry for food and she was unable to help me. This is an unfortunate truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am medicated and in my family\u0027s care now. I needed another anti-anxiety medication. Because I was unable to afford it before, I was unable to afford the care that I needed. I am moderately autistic, though I do not seem like I am most of the time. It only shows under great stress and emotional duress. Did I just rhyme? Whoops.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you remember the #KiwiCall? I am using it now. I need help to get better, and I will work so very hard for you, as you have always known me to.\u003cbr\u003e"
