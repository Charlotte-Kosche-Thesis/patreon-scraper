    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello everyone and thanks for checking out my patreon! I\u0027m eager to explain what lies ahead however let me give you a bit of personal background information some of you might not know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWho am I?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Austin, however most of you know me as Killjoy. I\u0027ve been modding Arma 3 for a little over two years now and I am also the former lead design artist for the widely popular Arma 3 map Chernarus Redux. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community\u0027s feedback on Chernarus Redux was excellent and I truly appreciate every single subscriber we have received. Myself and the rest of the team literally poured sweat and tears into that map, whether it was skipping school, calling out of work, or dealing with real life circumstances. At the beginning of this year it was especially difficult for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Janurary 1st of this year, I had to drop everything I was doing to fly out and see my father, who at the time was very ill with pneumonia. The doctors had said he needed to get his family affairs in order and say his final goodbyes. After visiting with him and going through a very emotional time, he recovered. Which was pretty astonishing considering he\u0027s been sick the last 4 years recovering from tongue cancer, half a removed jaw, and onset anorexia. He was one tough guy and received a decent enough pass to be sent back home after recovering from the pneumonia. Shortly after he was home, I packed things back up and flew back home as I was required back at work soon. Another short 2 months went by and on February 22nd of this year he passed away during the day. I was in the middle of working arma 3 related map things when I received the call from my mother. I got to say a quick goodbye to him over the phone. I rushed back home as soon as I could and paid my respects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn light of what happened, I\u0027ve used my time since then to mourn his death through focusing on the terrain creation and other development related design which is why every single of one you that has supported Chernarus Redux thus far means the world to me. With that being said, let me try to better explain why you are here. Through my endeavors of modding Arma 3, I\u0027ve visited the possibility of working on a second map while I\u0027ve had downtime in between working on Chernarus Redux and moving back and forth. However I\u0027ve been tied down financially, having to borrow money and work multiple jobs to pay debts back due to flying so much I haven\u0027t had the time to do this. Which brings me to why you are here. I\u0027ve heard the majority speak about a map they wish to be remade/redone in Arma 3. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhy you are here, more importantly.\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaviana holds so many memories for me and to you as well which is why I want to bring a version of this map to Arma 3. What do this mean? No one person besides the original author will ever be able to bring the original map from the grave to be playable on Arma 3. I don\u0027t say this to be pessimistic but this is a sad truth, however........ With my skill set and a bit of magic I can make what some of you REALLY want. An improved Russian-esque map that roughly resembles Taviana, done better than the original. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat does this mean for our map?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e A city/town to village ratio that matches Taviana. A map layout with 3 main islands and a \"sector\" island. New Russian themed structures including but not limited to; bridges, bunkers, houses, signs, hospitals, various office buildings, apartment complexes, and etc. Complex river system through some islands that varies in size and length to match the scenery. Varying altitudes and multiple mountain ranges for plenty of exploration. Did I mention \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ebunkers\u003c/i\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhere is my money going?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout interrupting the dream here, as much as I want to make this happen right away. A wise man once said time equals money which applies to me especially. In order to make this map happen, I\u0027d like to work on it full time so a playable version can distributed to my supporters as soon as possible. However with my situation this is not possible at this very moment which is where your support will be needed to fund this maps creation and the new models which will be required to fit the atmosphere that you guys want. Below is an excellent spread chart of where exactly your pledged money will be going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/a/qNJnu\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YW4hwBJ.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eNever worry about a DMCA.\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting my campaign is not required to play the map as I will make this very clear, \u003cstrong\u003eTHIS MAP WILL BE FREE TO PLAY FOR EVERYONE AND WILL BE RELEASED AS APL-SA. EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO HOST THE MAP FREELY AND BE ABLE TO MONETIZE OFF OF IT.\u003c/strong\u003e This will stay like that forever. You guys will have earned it for supporting me and my time. Rewards are a work in progress as I want to gain more feedback on what you guys desire in the map.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eETA and Roadmap\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current ETA for a playable version of the map will be based upon how quickly the funding goes however more importantly I appreciate you reading this wall of text and from the bottom of my heart, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
