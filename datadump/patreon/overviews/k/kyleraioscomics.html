I published my first comic when I was 19, but then I decided to focus more on college and then eventually graduate school in something wholly academic. That was fun, and after years of academia, I\u0027ve gone out into the world one hell of a bartender. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now I\u0027m back to my first love - comics, and writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got some awesome projects in the works - seriously good stuff I firmly believe you\u0027ll come to love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s the purpose of this Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell - I\u0027m behind the bar, quite a bit. And I do that so I can pay very talented people to make my super cool stories into a super cool reality. Now, like a lot of creators, I\u0027ve got many ideas, and little monies. And I want to turn those ideas into reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the beginning of 2016, I\u0027ve been making the first of my projects, PRIMAL INSTINCT, the epic dinosaurs in space saga that you can find on comixology today (You can find more on this project at the included Facebook link to your left, including a pathway to Comixology). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, as I\u0027m writing and working with an art team to finish the first arc of that story, I\u0027m moving forward on several other projects, including the launching of my own personal website that will feature my coming webcomics.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can absolutely, postively, 100% guarantee is that every single dollar from this will go towards the creation of my comics and the paying of my artists, and I\u0027ll be matching each and every dollar myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me on this journey of dinosaurs in space, a divorced and villainous father, gods and superheroes, dwarfs and Egyptian kings, and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo take a look around the page, see what we\u0027re getting into. I\u0027ve got some crazy ideas. And in a crazy world, why not just steer into the skid?\u003cbr\u003e"
