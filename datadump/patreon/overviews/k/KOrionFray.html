    "summary": "Greeting and salutations! Welcome to the Patreon room of the Hunting Grounds, my personal little portion of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to have a big long story of how I ended up here, but here\u0027s the tl;dr version: In February of 2015, I had a complete depressive collapse, lost my job, and had to contend with a brand new lease on an apartment in a city I\u0027d only barely lived in. It was a struggle for a long while to get back on my feet, and that\u0027s when I first stepped into Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the job I have currently, but I also know that it saps me of a lot of the creative energy I have--just because it\u0027s a job, it\u0027s out of my house, and I have to be around other people. It\u0027s always been my dream to work from home, and just because I can\u0027t yet doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ve stopped dreaming. So here I am, looking for a way to get my writing career out and about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like telling stories: the ones I make up, the ones I live, the ones I see. I live in a pretty interesting city, and neat stuff is always happening. I want to be able to share all that with you, as well as the characters who set up residence in my brain years ago and refuse to leave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than just writing, you\u0027ll probably see a lot of other random stuff from me: I\u0027m a freeland audiobook narrator, a photographer, a guitarist, jewelry maker, singer, cosplayer, tea and wine junkie, gamer...the list goes on. I\u0027ve got a lot to share, and I\u0027m looking forward to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a fortune from a cookie sitting on my desk for a while now (though I\u0027m not sure where it went in the latest move) and it\u0027s been a good motto for me: \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eYou can have anything you want if you want it desperately enough. \u003c/i\u003e\u00a0I want to freelance my career. I want to make art for all of you for a living. But I can\u0027t do that without help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me, Internet. You\u0027re my only hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/korionfray\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/KOrionFray\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/KOrionFrayAuthor\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.korionfray.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
