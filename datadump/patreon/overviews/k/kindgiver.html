My name is Maude and I am a \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maude_alta/\"\u003epaper carving artist\u003c/a\u003e living in the Hudson Valley in New York State. I live with my cat Francie and my plants Enid, Frieda and Harold on the second floor of an old house.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was twelve I was diagnosed with OCD and an anxiety disorder. In my teens I was in cognitive behavioral therapy and learned to understand, if not always suppress my OCD and anxiety. Today, I still get anxious and I have a very structured life that revolves around obsessive behaviors.\u003cbr\u003eI tell you this because I believe in complete transparency and truth when talking about emotional health. I don\u2019t ever want you to feel ashamed of yourself for feeling a certain way. Your feelings and struggles are valid, valued and worthy of attention and respect. You have my support.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a great believer in art as healer. When I cut paper I feel an immense relief and peace. You see, I\u2019ve found a way to use my obsessive compulsive nature. But not only that \u2013 I think it is important for all of us to have something in our lives that we can create and control with our hands.\u003cbr\u003eI want to spread love and kindness. I hope that through this site I can do so. I want to connect with you and share stories and strategies to feel safe and loved in this world. I hope that we can lighten each other and support each other when help is needed.\u003cbr\u003eI may not know you. I may never hear your voice. Despite this, I believe that using this online world we can touch each other and share love and gentleness and kindness.\u003cbr\u003eSending you that love,\u003cbr\u003eMaude\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
