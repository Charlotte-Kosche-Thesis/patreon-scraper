My name is Evan, and I have been creating gaming videos through my YouTube alias of Innocent Kristoph Gavin since late 2015. Gaming is one of my passions, and I have always been inspired to take a deeper look at the qualities of gaming. My ways of critiquing games comes in the form of reviews and countdowns. These are what I consider my main content and what I love to do most here. Occasionally I do live streams and let\u0027s plays as well. In addition, I\u0027m well known for my SUPER long and detailed Ace Attorney reviews that sport the made-up word \"analyzation\". I have realized over the years is that everyone wants to have their opinion heard in their own way and/or style. YouTube has been the perfect outlet for me to be analytical about games I want to review, in addition to sitting down with a countdown list trying to order entries around one or a few elements. I love what I do on Innocent Kristoph Gavin!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to make it clear that Patreon is an \u003cem\u003eextra\u003c/em\u003e outlet for me to have support in continuing my YouTube channel and is not completely essential for me to continue onward. No one should feel obligated or pressured to donate to me. For this reason, no content will ever be Patreon exclusive beyond rewards posted. However, I chose Patreon as an extra outlet for a few reasons. I sometimes struggle with motivational support, even if I think I am passionate to make my next big video. Financial support will help motivate me, but most importantly is how donations can allow me to potentially make YouTube a part time job for me, which would benefit my lifestyle as well as the content itself. Potentially, I could raise the funds to by superior hardware and recording software, and even a new video editor. The possibilities could be endless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t Feel Pressured...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI do not want anyone to feel pressured about my Patreon. Any donation regardless of size helps, it really does. If you cannot donate, that is 100% okay! Patreon will help my channel, but it will not hurt the channel if I don\u0027t receive many donations, so please, do not feel pressured about it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or recommendations in relation to my Patreon, please feel free to message me on Twitter, Discord, or email! Thanks everyone!!"
