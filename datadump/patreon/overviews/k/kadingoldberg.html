After graduating from the University of Montana, Missoula with a B.A. in Psychology, I decided to pursue my childhood passion of art. I studied portrait and figure drawing at the Angel Academy of Art in Florence, Italy and continued my studies at Angela Cunningham\u2019s Fine Art Studio in North Carolina. \u00a0After being subjected to light deprivation (aka working in controlled light in the studio for\u00a0months\u00a0;) ) I decided it was time to take what I had learned and apply it to the infinite world that we all live in. \u00a0It did take some getting used to, but I have found over the last 4 years that landscape painting really is a true passion of mine and certainly will continue to be for the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have only just begun\u00a0entering competitions\u00a0throughout the U.S. and have already won fist place at the Rocky Mountain Regional Juried Exhibit in Red Lodge, MT, two awards of excellence at the Paso Robles Artsfest Invitational event, in Paso Robles, CA and an Honorable Mention as well as Peoples Choice Award at the Driggs Digs Plein Air event in Driggs, Idaho.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/GrRSsq.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT YOU GET\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are welcome to pledge any amount you choose and you will receive various rewards (listed to the right) depending on the amount you pledge. \u00a0Each pledge is a monthly fee that will automatically be deducted from your account but may be cancelled at any time. \u00a0While many of the tiers will require you to subscribe for a year before receiving your reward (original paintings), all of the tiers will give you instant access to my patron-only content.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Shipping is not included for patrons outside the U.S.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/60wubV.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWHAT I GET:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a Patron your support will help me pay for art materials, frames, studio rent and maybe one day even contribute to a life spent traveling and painting.

     "about": "Born in 1985 in the Santa Cruz mountains of California, Kadin primarily paints the landscape in oil and captures our world in a style known as impressionistic realism. At a very young age he moved with his Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister and 140 pound black lab into their 16 foot travel trailer and proceeded to travel the western United States for a full year. Spending a year in campgrounds and being outdoors every day was where he first found his true passion for nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Kadin was 8 years old he moved to Red Lodge, MT where he spent the next 10 years of his life exploring the mountains, drawing, snowboarding and playing music. After moving to Missoula, MT with a plan to study painting at the University of Montana, he quickly realized that the program had very little focus on representational art and so he decided to switch majors. In 2007 he graduated top of his classes with a B.A. in Psychology, a degree which ultimately has been incredibly influential in his career as a landscape painter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter learning that innate talent is nothing but a myth, or at least convincing himself of such, Kadin decided to throw himself into the world of representational art. He moved to Florence, Italy where he studied over 40 hours a week learning traditional drawing methods of the masters at Angel Academy of Art. Longing for access to the outdoors and small town living, Kadin then move to Marshall, NC where he would continue his studies with renowned portrait and figurative artist, Angela Cunningham. After gaining a strong understanding of form and becoming confident in his technical abilities, Kadin decided it was time to take his painting outdoors and learn directly from nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince going outdoors to paint, Kadin has found a new appreciation for the world in which we live. He mostly paints outdoors but often brings these outdoor studies into the studio where he completes more finished and refined paintings from them. His goal is to bring attention to the beauty of our natural world, capture the feeling of a specific place and ultimately help protect that place through awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKadin\u0027s influences include: Dennis Miller Bunker, Edgar Payne, Edward Harrison Compton, Nicolai Fechin, Bill Anton, William Herbert Dunton, Clyde Aspevig, T Allen Lawson, Richard Schmid as well as countless others.\u003cbr\u003e",
