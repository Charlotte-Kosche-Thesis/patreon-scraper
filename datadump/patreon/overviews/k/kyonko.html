    "summary": "Simply put, the extra money would help a lot. I work part time and can only afford so much after paying all my bills. I pay the team, then they produce the content. Easy, but partially crippling on my finances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/bu7Y6fv\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bu7Y6fv.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Warrior Princess?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWarrior Princess is an erotic RPG that will be made using the RPG Maker MV engine. You will take on the roll of one of four characters and go on an adventure. How erotic this adventure gets is completely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGameplay:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGameplay is divided into two categories, the overworld and the battles. In the overworld the player will solve puzzles, complete quests for experience and items, and level up their character\u0027s skill tree with the skill points they have accrued.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBattle is where I want Warrior Princess to really stand out. The first thing I noticed when I started using RPG Maker was that everything is dreadfully vanilla and boring. Firstly, armor and weapons will all have special capabilities. Instead of finding a slightly better set of armor in a chest at the end of a dungeon, you\u0027ll have armor with special capabilities that can be upgraded at the blacksmith. For example, one piece of armor protects you from magic very well, but might have weaker defense than others. Weapons will be the same way, with perks and abilities the player can pick and choose from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring battle, the player has three types of regular attacks they can use with Lyra. Slash, Bash, and Pierce. Bash will weaken armor and allow slash to do more damage. Pierce will interrupt spells and distract magic based monsters and enemies. The other characters will all have attacks much like this, except with their own choice of weaponry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut watch out, the enemy is strong too. If an orc or a minotaur knocks you down, you will be stunned and take a lot more damage. Make sure your feet are firmly planted when fighting larger enemies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe four player characters are divided up into classes. Lyra herself is the Warrior, then there is Elle the Mage, Euria the Rogue, and Cassandra the Paladin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisual examples will be added as the project\u0027s demos are released and production moves along. As a result this area will be much less text heavy. Why tell when you can show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdult Content:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/SYdDkGt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/SYdDkGt.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe player is capable of having many adult encounters with many NPCs during the course of their adventure. This can include romantic encounters, but if the player so chooses they can also work at a brothel, bribe NPCs with their body, and maybe have some fun with the guards of the town.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe careful, though, if you step into the wrong place you could even be captured and put into lewd situations! Terrible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the player character takes damage in battle, their armor will take visual damage as well. If you don\u0027t keep a repair jewel handy, or don\u0027t run back to the town to fetch the blacksmith, that tentacle monster you just ran into might have a surprise for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLyra and the other player characters are very open minded, so such a surprise is more than welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo follow development more closely, you can check out the development blog here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://warprincessdev.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://warprincessdev.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo follow it even CLOSER, you can become a patron.
