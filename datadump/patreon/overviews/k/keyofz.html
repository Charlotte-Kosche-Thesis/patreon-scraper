    "summary": "I am a self-taught pianist composer looking to promote my music far and wide. My stylistic specialty is focused on combining advanced jazz chord voicings and polyrhythms with impressionistic and neo-romantic motifs within recognizable yet uniquely theoretical impromptus. My aspiration is to become a memorable improviser and established composer with works that are recognizable for film, radio and concert halls alike. Your ongoing support will help make possible professional quality album releases, ongoing video installments, live recordings at venues, and eventually an \"Opus 1\" full-scope premier with an orchestra of a piano concerto in f# minor that has been in the works for some time. Help support classical music not just for what it has meant for art and culture but what it can continue to mean to new generations of listeners!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eZ.D.Davidson"

The support and encouragement of my medleys, improvisations and thematic explorations fosters a consistent desire to share my musical contributions more widely and enthusiastically. It is my belief that those who become familiar with my music will assist in the manifestation of exciting future works including but not limited to: a full scale feature length piano concerto, pieces set to choreographed dance as well as digital musical releases, fully mastered recordings requestable on theclassicalstation.org and local radio, label sponsored albums, multi-instrumentalist collaborations and live performances as well. Every contribution is very much appreciated and will be routinely acknowledged. Subscribers are crucial to my continual ability to produce and share new works. Ongoing fiduciary beneficience will be granted exclusive musical rewards specific to the level of routine patronage!\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, attention and interest. I hope to build a sense of creative comradery with my patrons; do feel free to reach out, comment, share, lovingly disseminate and provide feedback.
