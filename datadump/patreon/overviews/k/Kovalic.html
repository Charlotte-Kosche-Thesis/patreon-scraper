IT MUST BE MINE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I realized that Dork Tower had become a hobby, to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween my illustration gigs, and becoming a dad, and some Big Things life threw at us, I stopped publishing the comic books and collections ten years ago, to spend more time with my family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe magazines that had once run the strips have also since died off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd - slowly, almost unnoticeably - over the years, the comic strip that had once been a job was now something I only got around to, when I had a few spare moments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith Dork Tower\u0027s 20th anniversary, I want to turn that around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comics have been appearing more-or-less weekly at dorktower.com. Sometimes more, sometimes less. So have the blogs. And while I\u0027d love to post five strips a week, even getting two up, on a regular basis, would be a great start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means giving up some of the other work. \u003cem\u003eNO, NOT \"\u003cstrong\u003eMUNCHKIN\u003c/strong\u003e.\"\u003c/em\u003e What? Do I \u003cem\u003elook\u003c/em\u003e like a silly person? But I would love to get Dork Tower back to the point where I\u0027m giving it as much time as I do Munchkin, where it was ten years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals of the Dork Tower Patreon\nare:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eAllowing me\n     the time to create and post comics on a regular basis.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eAllowing me\n     the time to create a backlog of strips.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003ePaying guest\n     artists, those times when I do need a break, so there\u0027s no interruption in the schedule. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAllowing me the time to finally collect the web strips into more volumes, and even creating all-new long-form Dork Tower stories and trade paperbacks.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eLetting me drop some other gigs, and give Dork Tower equal time to Munchkin, again.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, my readers are AMAZING, and I feel incredibly privileged. You don\u0027t have to do a darn thing to keep me feeling that way about you all. I realize money is tight all around, and I do appreciate anything and everything you guys do to help, even if it\u0027s simply some kind words every now and then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith Patreon\u0027s new fees, I bumped up all pledge levels to the next one\u0027s planned reward, to try and offset the cost. Hence, what you\u0027re getting at the $1 level was planned for the $2 level, and so on. Also, I added some stuff to the top ($20) level.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Also, because it\u0027s been asked, the physical rewards at the top levels cover worldwide shipping.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thanks to the help of fulfillment guru David Michael, he of \"Insane Charity Bike Ride Goodies\" fame, I\u0027ve structured the levels so to a point where I hope there are some sweet rewards for those kind and able enough to back this venture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to check this all out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd THANK YOU for being awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make some comics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eROLL THE DICE!
