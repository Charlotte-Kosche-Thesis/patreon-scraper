    "summary": "I simply cannot stop telling stories and helping other people learn how to better develop their own narratives. In three different careers (Social Work, Education and Digital Marketing), on stages and in workshops, I am elevating stories to center empathy, inclusion and truth. I\u0027ve told over twenty five true stories from my life on various stages in Nashville and am a Teaching Artist at abrasiveMedia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon because I am plotting a story revolution and want to give my audiences a way to support my ongoing work. In 2017, I am teaching workshops around various aspects of personal storytelling, workshops for businesses interested in more effectively creating a culture of story and consulting on these topics. In addition, I\u0027m creating storytelling events (True Stories Let Loose), in which I\u0027m curating the stories of others, coaching them to the stage and giving space to many communities I believe we need to hear more from. Currently on the event calendar: stories from working artists, stories by and for women audiences, stories to illuminate the lives immigrants and refugees, stories from the LGBTQ community and the African-American community in Nashville.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories make us better humans and connect us more deeply to one another. Stories give context to our lives and communities. I am in a unique position to amplify the stories of others and teach people how to utilize a lenses of storytelling in their projects. I perform my own stories, poetry and do comedy. When you support me, you make it possible for me to bring my unique skill set to a wide array of audiences. Becoming a patron means you believe in me as an artist and as a community builder. I am hoping to create online webinars of my workshops so that those who are not able to make it to Nashville can also get this critical information.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s change the world through stories.\u00a0"

     "about": "Storytelling is as ancient as our species and although it\nconsistently helps us understand one another, the ways in which we tell stories\nabout our world has evolved way beyond the fire pit. When we can learn to\ncontextualize and listen, our empathy and authentic engagement grows. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve been telling and\ncultivating stories in three different careers. I began as a Social Worker and\nlater spent a decade teaching in college classrooms.  I then made the leap into digital marketing,\nhelping organizations better communicate with digital and social media content.\nBack in 2013, I was asked to tell a true story on stage and fell in love.\nTwenty four stories and many stages later, I have found my niche. In 2016, I\nbegan teaching workshops about storytelling and am a Teaching Artist at\nabrasiveMedia for 2017. I am a performer, an educator and an evangelist for all\nthings story.",
