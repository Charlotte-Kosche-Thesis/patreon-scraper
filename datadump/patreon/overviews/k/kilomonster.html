Now that my enlistment is complete, I am finally pursuing my lifelong goal of creating stories for a living, both through the sequential art of comics, as well as animation storyboards. Storytelling and media is a passion of mine, something I believe connects humanity with each other in meaningful ways. I want to share my stories with anyone who will listen in the short-time I\u0027m here, and hopefully help others feel as though they are not alone in their experiences. In order to do that, however, I\u0027ll need the support from fans like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eAbout Monster\u0027s Garden\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMonster\u0027s Garden is the story of an outcast turned heavyweight champion known as the Kilo Monster, who maintains a flower garden in his spare time. Much of his life was spent alone, until one day, out of the kindness of his heart, he helps a comic-loving robot girl named NIKA reunite with her human family in the city. Unfortunately for the Kilo Monster, this act of kindness gets him involved in a bigger problem than he ever bargained for. A problem he can\u0027t overcome without the help of his newly found family.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhy create Monster\u0027s Garden?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI have always been a storyteller. I have fond memories of stapling together illustrated stories from binder paper and reading any book I got my hands on about being a writer and a cartoonist. Monster\u0027s Garden is the kind of story that I would have loved to see as a teenager, and addresses some of my issues with current trends and tropes in media by questioning ideas on masculinity, celebrating ideas of femininity, showing a fantasy world full of peoples of all kinds, and confronting anxieties that come from societal pressures and personal traumas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eHow often does Monster\u0027s Garden update?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMonster\u0027s Garden updates \u003cstrong\u003ea page every Thursday\u003c/strong\u003e at the moment, I would like to up that to Tuesdays and Thursdays, and maybe even Saturday for extra comics.

I would create Monster\u0027s Garden even if no one else would read it. It\u0027s a project near and dear to my heart that I want to share with as many folks as I can. The donations only help the comic grow beyond what I am currently capable of.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat are pledges going towards?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eNow that I have completed my service to the Navy, until I get freelance or studio work, the comic is my full time job. So that\u0027s keeping me fed and housed and healthy to make comic pages and commissions. Supplies, printing fees, convention tables are other expenses I foresee in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate anything you can spare. Even the smallest pledges help long term! Monster\u0027s Garden is a story I\u0027ve wanted to tell for two decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
