    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my page! I write indie folk-pop songs and sing them and I\u0027ve done Indiegogo before to fund projects and that support has been wonderful and crucial in allowing me to produce those recordings. \u00a0In order to keep making more music and have the ability to get it out to a wider audience, I need something more sustainable and thats where you come in and why I\u0027ve turned to Patreon! You\u0027ve probably heard of and/or been asked to support your local theatre or a dance company for example. Those are private arts organizations that are able to keep performing and making bigger and better things for you and the community with donations. This is like that! If you like what I\u0027m doing and you want to help me continue doing it and at a higher level, then you can become a patron - or an \"Angel\" because my last name is Angelis...get it? :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited about this too because it will motivate me to write and create more music to share with you and you\u0027ll get to hear BRAND NEW songs way before I go into the studio to record them and you\u0027ll be the first to hear the produced versions before I release them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd its exponential! Your $1 or $5 or $10 is so much more than that! Its the potential and spring board for a bigger audience that will support me along with you, my foundation! \u00a0And the cool thing about how this is set up is that you only pay when I post something like a new song that I wrote or a video of me performing a new cover or maybe even tutorials of how to play my songs! I\u0027m open to hearing what you would like! So you are just signing up to get everything I put out AND you get the special benefits that go along with your patronage which are to the right!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to devote more time to writing new songs and I\u0027ll have the funds to record them with great producers and then PROMOTE them properly which is HUGE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eRIGHT NOW, it will make a big difference in the release and promotion of my \"Heartbreak Is Contagious\" EP!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI will use these funds to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Pay for the publicity campaign to get the EP, singles, and videos reviewed and featured on websites and blogs ($2400)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Make a MUSIC VIDEO for the KEVIN BACON song (possibly with him in it! Money will probably make a big difference there!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo pull up a nice fluffy cloud and join the choir!
