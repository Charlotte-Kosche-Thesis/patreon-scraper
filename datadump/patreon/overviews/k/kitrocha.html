Things like write that super dirty vignette about what happens when Jared and Cruz beat each other up with staffs. Or record a video podcast of us trying to plot out where 12 hands go during an orgy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are, on Patreon, giving it a whirl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have lots of fun things planned. Chats! Videos! Hangouts! Super secret behind-the-scenes updates and outtakes, glimpses at our worldbuilding and the funny things we research while we\u2019re writing books. Even new and sexy stories that you guys get to vote on. We want to give you guys some say in the stories we tell next about the O\u2019Kanes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Sectors.
