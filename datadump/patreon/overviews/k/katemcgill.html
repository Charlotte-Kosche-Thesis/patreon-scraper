    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eIf you\u0027ve found yourself on this page... let me bow down at your feet. And then let me kiss them. Please. Thank you for even getting this far. \u003cem\u003eYou\u0027re the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk... so it\u0027s no secret that being a creative and a musician comes with its financial struggles. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to be a part of this world in some way or another since I was 17 years old. A fucking long time ago, come to think of it. And since then, I have found ways to make ends meet from month to month. It\u0027s been amazing to see the Universe provide for me at every turn, but 10 years on... I\u0027d really love for things to become a bit steadier. The idea that there\u0027s no middle-man (kind of) and you can upload your creations and get paid for it \u003cem\u003ealmost immediately\u003c/em\u003e by the people that love and support you, is \u003cstrong\u003eINCREDIBLE\u003c/strong\u003e. What a time to be alive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeadowlark is still my \u003cem\u003enumber 1 priority\u003c/em\u003e. (If you\u0027ve been living under a rock for the past 4 years, go and check out our music on Spotify! Maybe you\u0027ll like it!) I am so happy and grateful to be in this band with Dan and make the music that we do. But unfortunately, our advance is no longer enough for us to live off... and this is where I awkwardly ask you guys to get involved. \u003cem\u003eWith your help, I\u0027ll be able to focus my time and energy on Meadowlark when it comes to touring and recording our second record in 2018 - and then create create create for you guys in the meantime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have thought about what my dream life looks like \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e in the last few months. I really want to work towards a future I know I can find true happiness within. And I really believe this to be it. I\u0027ve struggled a lot this year with sadness, insecurities, a lack of confidence and feeling out of my depth constantly... but this excites me. This really excites me. And this idea alone has kept me going creatively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI picked the 5 love languages as my tiers because I love the idea of finding out how people best receive and give love. And I\u0027ll feel immense amounts of the stuff if I get a patron for every single language!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... the boring nitty gritty:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will endeavour to give you \u003cstrong\u003eTWO\u003c/strong\u003e creations per month (cover videos, new original songs, free mp3s etc). You\u0027ll be charged your pledge amount \u003cstrong\u003eTWICE\u003c/strong\u003e a month. You can also set a maximum monthly limit of what you\u0027d like to be charged so it never goes over! Just click \u0027set a monthly max\u0027 when you check-out. You can also cancel or amend your pledge at any time you wish!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmail me at katelauramcgill@gmail.com if you have any more questions or just fancy saying hello! I\u0027m all ears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does that sound? Are you still reading this? Are you incredible? Yes. The answer\u0027s yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you guys will join my little journey! If you do, thank you thank you thank you. And if you don\u0027t? Have a wonderful life!\u003cbr\u003ekate XXx x x\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
