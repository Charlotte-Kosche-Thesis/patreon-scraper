    "summary": "Greetings! Welcome to my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an internet platform that helps creative people get paid for their work. As a Patron, you\u0027ll pay a small, recurring fee to support my work and receive exclusive rewards like weekly astrology updates, monthly horoscopes, and exclusive articles. \u003cbr\u003eWho Am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Chad Woodward, and I\u0027m an evolutionary astrologer. The astrologer title is one of many (I\u0027m also a massage therapist, craniosacral therapist, herbalist, writer, and student). This Patreon page is dedicated solely to my astrological work, but it also supports me in my other passions and endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOkay, so here\u0027s the deal: I\u0027ve been writing astrology blogs for about nine years. My articles have been floating around the internet and various astrology (or dare I say, \"New Age\") communities for quite some time. You may have seen my work on Mystic Mamma, Astrology.Answers.com, or About.com. You may have stumbled upon some of my small pieces on Instagram. I\u0027ve interned for Planet Waves (where I did some environmental journalism), and I\u0027m a certified Steven Forrest trained astrologer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been offering my blogs (mainly New and Full Moon readings) for free. I love that part of writing my blogs, gifting astrological and spiritual guidance openly to the community. But you might not know that I write more than blogs. I write weekly astrology forecasts on a small platform I call Kosmic Horizon. These emails go out every week (typically up to three times). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write rising sign forecasts (they\u0027re like horoscopes). I started a membership platform on my website last year, but it didn\u0027t work out as I had anticipated. I have a Squarespace site, and if you know anything about that, you\u0027ll understand that it\u0027s somewhat difficult to run a membership platform on Squarespace. So, this is why I\u0027m now on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is going to serve as my new membership platform, and I\u0027m setting up two simple tiers (for now) for my fans to support my work. I like to keep things simple because, as you probably know, this \"civilized\" world is complicated enough. \u003cbr\u003e"
