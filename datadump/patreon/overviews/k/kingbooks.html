I\u0027ve been creating YouTube videos for over three years now, but I\u0027ve been an editor for almost six.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve lived thousands of lives through stories. Harry Potter was my first true love. Then came Star Wars, The Hunger Games, Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Supernatural, Hamilton and many, many more. My fandoms have shaped me. As an only child living with anxiety, life got pretty lonely for me. I had few friends, and little motivation to put myself out there so that I could make more. The stories that I read, watched, and loved became my world. This still remains true to this day. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do without my fandoms, especially Supernatural, which has opened me up to more opportunities that I could have ever expected.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout middle school and high school, I was put down for my love of fandoms. People viewed me as silly or childish because I wore Harry Potter shirts to school, always had my nose buried in a book, and cosplayed at comic cons. If I talked too much about a TV show I loved, I was made to feel like I was being annoying. I hated going to school for this reason: I felt like (and was) an outcast. No one understood, so I took to the internet to find other people who would get it. I used my love of filmmaking to start a YouTube channel, originally focused on books, that would soon branch out into a general appreciation of all things fandom. My main goal with my YouTube channel is to spread fandom positivity and love. After my own experiences with being put down for talking about the stories that I love, I never wanted anyone else to feel the way I did. My videos are a space for people to geek out with me. I want everyone to feel welcome and accepted while watching them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eAs a full time student, it\u0027s hard to balance school, a job, what little social life that I do have, and YouTube all at once. In fact, most of my free time goes directly to creating content for my YouTube channel. This results in many late nights for me, as well as long hours of editing that could be spent with friends and family. I wouldn\u0027t be doing this unless I truly loved it, and I do. I try to post a video every other day because I enjoy interacting with my audience, but posting so frequently can wear on a person. Making videos is a long, time consuming, expensive process. It\u0027s a journey that I\u0027ve embarked on by myself for a long time now, and I\u0027ve finally realized that I might need some help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe money that my audience pledges to me on here will all go back into my videos and to you, the viewers. \u003c/strong\u003eWhether that be through the purchase of equipment to enhance video quality, camera repairs, props/costumes, books to review, or helping me attend more conventions so I can vlog and cover the events as well as interview more creators - your support will help me create better content day in and day out. My budget for YouTube videos right now is almost non-existent. Every little bit will help me create more quality content. I have so many ideas for DIY projects, sketch videos, collabs, cosplays, vlogs and more, but I can\u0027t create them without your help. I am also currently working on a web series called \"Fandom Queens\", which will need funding as it gets further into development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADgLFk6jSLw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhCk3RYyWUA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nd9IpdCqLs0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjqcW42S50I\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eCan\u0027t pledge money?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI know that many of you won\u0027t be able to pledge money, and I want you to know that it\u0027s completely okay.
