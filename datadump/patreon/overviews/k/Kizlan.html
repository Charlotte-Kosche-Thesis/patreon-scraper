    "summary": "Hello , Everyone. My name is Kizlan, and I have been translating hentai manga and doujinshi since about October of 2009, with my current site hosted by the good people at \u003ca href=\"http://Fakku.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFakku\u003c/a\u003e at \u003ca href=\"http://kizlan.fakku.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKizlan.fakku.io\u003c/a\u003e. At first, I was translating as an \nattempt to learn more Japanese (particularly kanji) and to see the books\n I wanted to see translated get done, but over time it has become more \nrecreational. I started off with almost constant use of a kanji dictionary, a \nJapanese to English dictionary, and a loose understanding of Japanese \ngrammar, which resulted in a few releases that not only took me forever \nto finish, but weren\u0027t very good. However, after several months of \npersistent effort I grew more confident and my releases got much better.\n Now, after almost 6 years, I\u0027ve come a long way in both phrasing and \nediting (especially editing). I actually find editing calming now... :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI continue\n to translate now because I enjoy it, and stay with hentai for much the \nsame reason. My personal favorite genres are tentacles, monsters, mind \nbreak, and other such things along those lines, but I can enjoy even the\n most vanilla stories as long as they have good art and characters. \nOccasionally I think about doing something non-H as well, but there are \nso many good untranslated hentai books out there that I just haven\u0027t \nfound the time yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to provide fans of hentai with high quality releases into a community which far too often lacks in that regard, both in translation and editing quality. Any support will go a long way in both motivating me toward the often massive amount of work required to fully translate and edit a book.\u003cbr\u003e"
