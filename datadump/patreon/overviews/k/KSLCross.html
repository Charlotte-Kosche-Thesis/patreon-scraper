It\u0027s a doozy, it\u0027s comedic, the lore (while developing) is deep, and is branched firmly away from every Gamer fic ever (MAGE MAGE MAGE I SPAM SPELLZ LULZ) as far as character build goes (and the way stats are built are different in this world as a whole, although it is heavily Gamer inspired NOTE inspired, not the original The Gamer system)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Hero Academia CROSSOVER w/ Fate/StayNight (Grand Order)\u003cbr\u003eTitle: My Amazing Hero Quirk is Ruining My Gender Identity!\u003cbr\u003eDescription: From the little preschool lot where a cute chibi Deku and Kacchan were raised, they had a third friend named Chiba Hinata. When Kacchan first gets his Quirk, there is a terrible accident where a stray explosion takes Deku\u0027s eye. But do not fear for our hero Hinata\u0027s Quirk turns out to be none other than a Quirk that connects to the legendary, etheral Throne of Heroes! The problem is resolved and- wait. There\u0027s still a problem? What\u0027s that? I fixed this dammit, I\u0027m the author, that\u0027s my job. Oh? All of the Heroic Spirits are female? What\u0027s that? Quirks affect and change the body to better suit their Quirks? Hinata grew up to look like a Yamato Nadeshiko?! Oh dear! How will this change affect the world of My Hero Academia? Read to find out now!"
