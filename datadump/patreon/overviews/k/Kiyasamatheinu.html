I didn\u2019t really have many friends, despite really wanting them. One day, I came across a girl that had a handful of drawings. Amazed, I quickly asked a number of questions and found out that she was writing a fan comic with some of her friends. I inquired more and found out that she got the idea for this by watching an anime called Inuyasha that played late at night on adult swim. That night I stayed up and watched the show. I was sucked in. I found myself drawn to the story and the art style, and ever since that day I had the dream that I wanted to write my own comic one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that inspiration, I looked into all sorts of animes and a variety of art books to persue this passion that had burned so bright in me. I\u2019m very proud to say that I am predominately a self taught artist, and despite my family\u2019s misgivings on my dream, I will stop at nothing to see my stories out there one day in the hands of the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZooming forward to 2014, I ended up getting in touch with an old schoolmate of mine whom needed some help selling at a convention. We reconnected, and she told me her story. I found myself impressed by her, and loved that she was making money on things that she made herself. After some time, she convinced me to start selling at conventions. The following year in April I sold at my very first convention. It wasn\u2019t something very big, but seeing people enjoy and take home my creations made my heart swell. There have been ups, and there have been downs, but I\u2019m still here pursuing that dream I had made so long ago!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**All rewards will be given after payment had be processed**\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
