I am a professional furry artist, which means I draw anthropomorphic cartoon animals for a living! I also love fantasy art, painting, horror, and video games. This space is where I post all of my exclusive secret art, video timelapses, works-in-progress, as well as all the public art I do several days in advance. Mostly it will be the work I do for a living, but there is lots of other content too! I pretty much post everything here, while the public only gets the finished pieces every now and then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is really very straight-forward: you are welcome to show me support monetarily! Every dollar helps me create better and more art for you as my Patrons, as well as helping me realize my personal and professional goals. I have several rewards available, including exclusive monthly sketches, as a sincere thanks to you for choosing to donate to make my life better (and therefore my work).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading, sharing, and especially for pledging!
