    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Magic Dream-Manifesting Workshop!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name is Keram (pronounce CARE-uhm). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 30+ years I have been making music, films, building virtual worlds and real communities. I have always been independent, and I have always maintained close contact with my supporters - whether it was the Sky Pirates, or the Freedom boards (long before Facebook), or my current friends on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have released over half a dozen commercial\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/All/Keramsongs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecords\u003c/a\u003e, various short films, and over 2 dozen blogs, a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://keramcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e, am currently completing a documentary about the surrealist pop art movement and therapeutic Virtual Reality and Immersive 360 videos to help people with anxiety, depression and insomnia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much more to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons of the arts are often the only way for innately risk-taking creative types to have a platform to stand on. Risk-taking in a creative spectrum can lead to truly magical experiences, but the world is often reticent, interested in only what it already knows. \u00a0So \u003cstrong\u003eit requires courageous types - like you - to foster\u00a0trailblazing initiatives that push the boundaries and unleash new creations and experiences.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we could spend 1/10th less time every month worrying about funding, our creative output would increase substantially. Moreover, if\u00a0we could spend less time creating methods to monetize the content, then we could take greater risks with it, and send it to you in a more pure fashion, without requiring marketing tactics and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe and my collaborators never stop making things; the sole focus of my life is to make those projects come to life. 12 hours a day, every day is spent producing music, narrative and non-fiction films and videos, games and interactive experiences, literature, think tanks and communities that challenge me and my colleagues and supporters, and are inspired by them in kind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe overall body of work all connects in many secret and sometimes overt ways too. So rather than a discombobulated output, you get a constantly emerging holographic narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been slow to take on Patreon because I am such a DIYer, but I realize now, that this, in fact, is exactly what people like me require and that I am exactly in the right place for something like Patreon, our digital Medici - comprised of forward thinking dreamers like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO, HOW DOES IT WORK?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimple! I have set it to a monthly campaign with special rewards at $5, $10, $25 and $100. BUT that doesn\u0027t mean you have to pay those amounts. \u003cstrong\u003eIf you want, you can contribute only 10 cents a month\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eOr you can put $150 a month into the production pool. It\u0027s up to you\u003c/strong\u003e, and you can cancel at any time. You are essentially helping me to create more incredible content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will take your contributions and, like an experienced farmer, sow seeds that will produce extraordinary bounty - not just from me, but from all those whose talents I draw into the process, and keep it honest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I GET AS A PATRON?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to improving the platform for me to create more and stronger content, at $5 and above, you will get access to my exclusive \"Patrons Only\" stream where I post free music downloads, rare demos no one\u0027s ever heard, behind the scenes pics \u0026amp; info, music tutorials from me \u0026amp; lots more stuff you won\u0027t find anywhere else but here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you will get updates and be a part of my community where you can share your ideas, feedback and discuss my projects with me. \u003cstrong\u003eYou will be the first with whom\u00a0I share my thoughts, special projects and ideas.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, always\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ex,\u003cbr\u003ek (and team)"
