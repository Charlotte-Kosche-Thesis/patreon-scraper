    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Kimberley Long-Ewing. My short stories and comics have appeared in many places. My work focuses on diversity in fantastical settings.\u00a0I am working on my next novels which range from steampunk to fantasy to far-futures science fiction. Then there is all the short fiction in my head just shouting to be let out. Let\u0027s not forget the random acts of poetry I occasionally commit. You can visit my \u003ca href=\"http://kim.mysticsheepstudios.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e for a full list of previously published works and follow my works in progress. I have a book coming out in mid-2016 called Curse of the Goblin Travelers from Spencer Hill Press. I\u0027ll be keeping you posted about that and giving you sneak previews between now and then.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 So why am I setting out a Patreon tip jar? Because I\u0027m doing an experiment this year and would love to have your support. Instead of sending my short fiction off to various magazines to be published, I\u0027ve decided to bring it directly to you on my website. For free. I am also working on video and audio recordings of my work. No talking heads - I\u0027m going to incorporate my love of photography. It should be fun and interesting. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The tip jar is just that - a place for you to drop a few coins if you like what this humble busker is doing. I\u0027m currently using the monthly model - drop a dollar or more in the jar each month and receive extras as my way of saying thank-you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 What can you expect from me? I will continue to release original short fiction and poetry to you on a weekly basis. The stories are serialized on my website. I\u0027ve organized the site to allow you to easily pick and choose which story you want to read from the archives and follow the serialized posts without tripping over splattered words. I do try to keep the strays from getting underfoot. There will also be the usual blog stuff - updates on appearances, release and publication news, and musings about the hows and whys of my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 I\u0027m excited about this project and look forward to seeing what we can create together."
