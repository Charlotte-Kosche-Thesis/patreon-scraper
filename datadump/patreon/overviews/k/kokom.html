There were no such thing as in-house electricity, water nor toilets back then. I was born physically different than others. I got very light skin, light brown eyes and brown hair. Some people and most kids saw me different not in a good way. My eyes and hair color was progressively getting darker as I grow older. When I was 15, I left my village looking for work in Jakarta. Long story short, I ended up working as\u00a0a server/referee in a pool house, you know, where the pool hustlers make their livings. This is where I met him! I thought \"Hey, my life is just like other normal people! I went to school as a kid, started working as a teenager, and met someone when you just barely adult... Good!\" Little did I know...\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(221, 217, 195);\"\u003e-- many years later --\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eNow I live in Tangerang City as an independent contractor (it\u0027s a fancy name for a freelancer :D) raising a teenage daughter and making videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can take a look on my only YouTube channel to get a better idea what I\u0027ve been doing by clicking the YouTube icon on the left profile panel, or click the link below to see all the video contents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTFGFjG02FcHT1bh0_1ZPFA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlease visit our YouTube channel and subscribe if you like it\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eWho Involved in the Projects?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eMost of my contents are made by me and my partner from the ground up. But we divide responsibilities since we have different schedules, We usually brainstorming what we want to create then we decided who\u0027s doing whats. At this point, I\u0027m the one who usually appear on the videos, since it\u0027s made for my YouTube channel and then he helps me on post-production process. After uploaded to YouTube, it will then back in my control what to do with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eWhat Kind of Videos We\u0027re Making?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eOur main focus right now is the \u003cstrong\u003eMust See Videos\u003c/strong\u003e channel on YouTube. Its a YouTube videos compilation about random stuff. But sometimes, these videos are classified as \"Awesome\", \"Epic Fails\", \"Fights\", \"Random Stuff\" or something like that. The idea why we\u0027re making this channel is for convenience. You see, we like to watch something unusual on YouTube, but over time, we mostly forget where we watched the video. Even worse, sometimes those videos are gone forever for some reasons. We can do some search on YouTube to find what we want but then the search result isn\u0027t always give what we want.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gaming live stream videos is still on planning. We did some test run for few months now, but we still don\u0027t have the capacity to stream HD, let alone full HD. Just for the fun of it, we still sometimes live streaming in 360p, which looks quite scrambled. Full HD live streaming will have to wait until we got the support we need to upgrade our main internet connection. In Indonesia, internet connection is relatively more expensive than in the US. We currently pay about the same amount the americans pay for 15-30 mbps upload. And we still only have less than 1 mbps upload speed. There are services available if you want faster upload speed but unfortunately, we are stuck with our current ISP right now because the cable network we\u0027re using for the internet belongs to the house developer which also runs the ISP, and they don\u0027t allow other ISP in our neighborhood. We\u0027re considering 4G LTE connection for some times now and we\u0027ll see about this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe still, in the future, plan to move all MMA related videos into a dedicated MMA channel hosted by me or my partner.\u00a0We both\u00a0have a unique perspective on MMA. We often disagree with what we heard regarding of MMA.\u00a0Some people don\u0027t have proper knowledge and understanding about the fighting but they have big names and popular channels. Just riding the mainstream wave only for views and revenues. But making MMA videos are not as easy as it looks. It consumes the most time so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eSo Why Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eYouTube has its own revenue system for its content creators, which is potentially lucrative for not only us but for anybody. But, a channel cannot support itself when it\u0027s still small and not making any revenue. Apart from a potential income, my partner and I see this whole YouTube thing as a learning opportunity because we can learn from the feedbacks to be more effective on delivering the messages. We think about it as attending a \"real life university\". We\u0027re still learning and need your support. Without you, we\u0027re not going to \"graduate\" smoothly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, basically if you want to support content creators like us, you can use a platform like this Patreon website. But remember, the donation is not one-time-only. It\u0027s monthly occurrence in my case. Of course you can cancel anytime you want but please be aware of that. On top of that, Patreon allows you to get some kind of rewards for your donations depending on the amount and depending on the artists. In my case, you can see at the \"REWARDS\" panel, there you can see my current pledges. I will add more pledges in the future with better rewards but these are what I have for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating videos is fun but it takes a lot of time. I think sometimes it takes more hours than a regular jobs depending on the type of videos we are creating. Especially information based video, like documentary, science, or even tutorials, they required proper researches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eWe Don\u0027t Know We Like It Before We Try It\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI uploaded my first YouTube video about a year ago while I still train myself to get used to talking to a camera. It was not good but I planned to keep making and upload more videos so I can learn and see the progress that I made during my journey. My partner saw the progress and quite happy with the potential and decided to help me on the technical side so I can have more time improving myself and learn other things especially the editing. We both basically like making videos, especially my partner, he was an amateur photographer and a film making enthusiast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot in a million years, I thought I want to be a YouTuber. I don\u0027t have problems with photography but I seriously am not confident in front of video cameras. It reveals more than I wanted to. Just think about making a video call to a stranger, it\u0027s a bit more uncomfortable. But after getting some threats... uh, I mean some encouragements from my partner, I started to make videos. I didn\u0027t like them because I thought they were terrible. But... there are some progress! This still not enough for me to like it but it\u0027s encouraging. To be perfectly honest with you and to myself, when making my first video, I started to really like making videos after seeing the finished products. After they are edited, soundtracked, and arranged. You know, just like normal YouTube videos. Even though they\u0027re still far from perfect but they look much much better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eThank You for Vsiting My Patreon Page.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
