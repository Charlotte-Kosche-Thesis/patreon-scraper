I discovered the Keto lifestyle about a year ago and have not looked back! I have lost over 100 lbs and it continues to drop off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLot\u0027s of people ask me what I\u0027m doing, what food I\u0027m eating, where I get my recipes, how to start the keto lifestyle etc so I decided to share my journey with anyone who is interested in losing weight, feeling more energetic, clear headed and also lose weight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Keto: Basically Keto is a way of eating (not a starvation diet) where you teach your body to burn fat instead of sugar/carbs. There is a lot more to it that you can learn about here\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere do you find your recipes: I actually have a background in culinary and baking and used to have my own bakery so I will usually invent recipes myself based on just regular foods I love to eat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have to exercise? Only if you want to. Believe it or not losing weight is all about what you eat, not the calories you burn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs there a vegetarian/vegan/paleo/dairy free etc option: Keto is very flexible and you can incorporate any type of food restriction. Just keep in mind that it will be more work because foods that are high in fat are plant/animal based. I actually follow a version that is mostly vegetarian without red meat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you eat fruit? The short answer is no. Fruit is actually packed full of sugar and not so great to eat in large amounts. You can eat some berries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you drink? Main answer is WATER and lots of it! Rough estimate is half your body weight in oz per day which is important for digestion when you\u0027re eating high fat foods. You can also drink other things with stevia as a sweetner like La Croix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
