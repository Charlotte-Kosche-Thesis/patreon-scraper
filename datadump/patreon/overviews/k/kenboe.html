Because it trains the imagination differently. It breaks the fantasy of reality, which is narrative based. The fantasy of reality always wants a smooth illusion in the form of a linear story. Modern poetry is evolving into a kind of work that can help us reach a higher consciousness where we are mindful that reality, as we can know it, is a fantastical labyrinth. By breaking open the linguistic inter-worlds and other devices of that fantasy world we call reality, we can start to perceive reality at other levels of imagination. Of course, poetry has other functions than just simply this, but we may find they all add to this important value of reality-busting.\" \u003c/em\u003eRead more of the Manifest in Posts after a minimum pledge of 1 dollar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKen Boe lives and works in the incredible art town of Bisbee, Arizona. Previous to that, in Arizona, he\u0027s lived at Thought Crime in Phoenix, The Grand Canyon, and Miami Art Works in Miami Arizona (SEE ABOVE VIDEO), where he was a founding member of the \u003cem\u003eopen source-like\u003c/em\u003e Miami Loco Arts Festival. He\u0027s also worked in Yellowstone National Park for over 20 seasons. Originally from Evanston Illinois, with one of the best public school arts programs in the country, he then attended the School Of The Art Institute of Chicago on scholarship, later graduating from SIUC. He\u0027s also attended Columbia\u00a0College, UIC, and audited coursework at Reed\u00a0College. Ken Boe is an accomplished experimental painter, poet, and playwright. (SEE BELOW)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027ve been anticipating my work\u0027s \u003cem\u003eevolution\u003c/em\u003e for several decades, developing various ideas,\u00a0methodologies, material-consciousness, and\u00a0distinct series of works toward which I am readying myself to hybrid together into an ultimate meta-series of new large works on panel. The current stage consists of exhausting what I call the \u003cem\u003eimage-ontology\u003c/em\u003e of the various series I am offering to you at right. This also includes a series of large canvases not part of the fundraising effort.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eThrough this creative crowdfunding effort\u003c/em\u003e, I look forward to being able to establish a more sustainable\u00a0routine and practice as a\u00a0full-time artist, poet, and playwright. And there\u0027s all that theory and research that I\u0027m working on, so essential to my process. The process of interacting with my sponsors and collaborators will also be energizing as I weave the projects and my commitments through the series of works, ideas, and creative infrastructure I\u0027ve set up at home, for my life\u0027s work, in Bisbee. I\u0027ve tested myself to my satisfaction through an experimental fundraising effort asking people to sponsor poems, collaborative. A new version of that program you can now subscribe to in my second Patreon category of giving, top right below Chuck Alton\u0027s photo of me while recording the recent podcast \"Getting Poetry\" In Bisbee. (See link to that below) Contact me anytime, and please look forward to your inbox for my Ken Boe Poetry and Arts Manifest\u00a0email.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Here at my art compound, over looking Mexico, I\u0027ve over a ton of art supplies of various natures that I work from. I\u0027m engaged in what I call \"Counter-Realism\" which is kind of a spin on the term counter-intelligence. I see that we are constantly barraged with a lie, often called realism, in all facets of the modern consumer and aesthetic life. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI deconstruct the techniques of common art practice, and digest them in my own ways. For instance, what is content? On a can of soup, it\u0027s the ingredients. In the arts, it\u0027s often assumed to be story. But story is just one ingredient. All the media, such as oil paint versa acrylic paint, are sentient content as much as \"subject\", though only the most experienced art collectors, curators, or artists consciously notice this. Unconsciously we probably all notice this. And then there are all the other techniques of an artist, as small as a particular way of holding the brush, or how I paint with a whip on occasion; these things, too, are part of a work\u0027s content. So how one approaches our societal myths of realism really give you away at this level of being an artist.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"I have several art studios and places for writing poetry around my property. Like seasons, they have their own weather. Their own moods, their own materials, their own content. While it\u0027s all a bit of a mess, maybe that\u0027s the ambiguity that glues it all together. For instance, here are a couple of inter-relating ideas:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Hang tight, sharp, perfectionist artwork on a rough crooked wall, such as an old brick wall. Hang rough chaotic artwork on a smooth wall, such as a new wall neatly drywalled and painted in an organized home or office.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Artwork should not be redundant with its environment. Do not have paintings of food at a restaurant, for instance. Artwork provides a kind of subconscious extension to the consciousness of an environment. It is an expansiveness, at least for bright people who will engage each other in that environment intellectually, emotionally, imaginatively. It is the synchronic vocabulary of our time together as the environment we share is the language we share.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Over the last 30 years or so I\u0027ve developed various original techniques, or techniques morphed out of various traditions, ideas, uses of materials, and processes. Some of these are series of works, you could say, in the natural pattern to focus within certain perimeters. Each of these has to go through its own evolution. The long view of this is that only after many years of these explorations will the higher level of evolution take place which I am entering now. That is the level of hybridizing all my previous techniques and materials projects, languages, and experimentation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the Shadow-effigy and Manual Kind series I am building into permanent frames into a combination of plasters, sometimes experimental frescos, with found objects, shadow work, waxes and tree resins, and oil paints. I am not trying to tell the viewer what to see but create a portal for your own imagination. In this work it was interesting to witness much of the audience seeing a vagina, while others seeing a path or a portal.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Concerning the large canvas,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMysterium Tremendum, \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003etop right, I\u0027m using my whip painting technique, which often gives a sense of \"abstract-expressionism\". Technically, I liken the whip painting as \"action print making.\" Often done with oil paints, in this variation I actually whipped the canvas with a gluey \"gesso-grosso\" or plaster. Over this I applied a clear bees wax, and over that oil paint, which then is moved around with heat. The rest of the work is oil paint and graffiti marker. It is a hybridization of techniques on the way to where I am going as an artist, yet a significant work in its own right.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eArtist, critic, and my former gallerist Jim Coates, concerning this process:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://kenboe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jim-Coates-on-Ken-Boe.jpg\"\u003ehttp://kenboe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jim-C...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe \"Getting Poetry\" In Bisbee Roundtable Discussion with Ken Boe, and nationally known poets Dick Bakken, and Michael Gregory.
