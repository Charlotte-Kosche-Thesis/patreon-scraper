This includes primarily group shots of the main characters in scenes from the story, group shots of multiple minor characters as a dramatis personae image, and example art like an image of what all the slave uniforms for the different Calypso departments look like. When I don\u0027t have group shots to commission, I\u0027ll be able to commission full body single image shots more often, which means every episode will probably have a full color, full body art piece to head it, even when I\u0027m writing at capacity (dear God please let my work stabilize so I can start doing that again, I miss it).\u003cbr\u003e",
