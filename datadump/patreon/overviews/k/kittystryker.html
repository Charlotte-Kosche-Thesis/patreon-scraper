    "summary": "I\u0027m Kitty Stryker, a feminist writer, an anarchist activist, a Juggalo anthropologist, and an authority on consent culture. I recently put out an anthology, \"Ask: Building Consent Culture\", that succeeded in signalboosting marginalized voices within consent discussions. \"Ask\" is up for two Book of the Year awards at Foreword Reviews, as well as being used in multiple universities to teach the complexities of consent in a culture that rewards entitlement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on two new books, one that will discuss how to be an activist with healthy relationships (not just romantic!) and one that will put into print my deep dive into Juggalo culture. Patreon is the only way I can spend time writing these books, because the smaller publishers I tend to work with also tend to not much have advance money! Every $5 donation keeps me in coffee and my cats in kibble.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am incredibly grateful to my patrons, who subsidize me doing vital community work for marginalized people with their donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunding my Patreon means funding my writing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-about consent\u003cbr\u003e-about sex work\u003cbr\u003e-about transmisogyny\u003cbr\u003e-about sex education\u003cbr\u003e-about pop culture\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"ASK: Building Consent Culture\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve wanted to do an anthology about consent culture ever since I started speaking out about abuse within alternative sexuality. Having it span consent dynamics outside of the exclusively sexual ones was a concept I settled on after speaking in the UK at a consent panel - talking with people in law, politics, academia and activism made me realize the number of areas consent culture needed to be discussed. While talking about consent and sex is very important, I hope that expanding the ways people think about consent to other interactions like hugging or gaming will help us realize that boundaries and negotiation matter all the time. The anthology came out October 27th, 2017, and features the diverse voices of both published and unpublished writers.\u00a0I am pleased to say that at least 11 of my authors identify as Black, brown, and/or people of color - and at least 8 identify as nonbinary and/or transgender. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStruggalo Circus\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eServing as a street medic, I co-created \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/StruggaloCircus\"\u003eStruggalo Circus \u003c/a\u003ewith my boyfriend, a second generation Juggalo, and our friend, another long time Juggalo, in order to create a space for a working coalition between antiracist, anti-classist Juggalos and activists all over the spectrum - libertarian, socialist, communist, anarchist, liberal, even the odd conservative. Do no harm but take no shit. I remain active with the group as a medic.

It also means I can justify crossposting my work with places that don\u0027t pay but will signal boost my opinions to a larger audience. It\u0027s like you\u0027re giving me a megaphone through which I can talk to the wider internet. As it seems likely that our media will be less and less able to speak truth to power, I hope to do it as long as I can, and while capitalism is awful, every dollar helps me help others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has helped me go from struggling to make ends meet to being able to safely pay rent. It\u0027s a great example of how $5 from individuals doesn\u0027t seem like a lot but when there\u0027s 50 people giving $5 it can make a huge difference.
