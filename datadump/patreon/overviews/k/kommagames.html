My name is Kevin, and I am Komma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a tiny game developer situated in northeast Georgia. My goal is to help you fill those moments of silence, anxiety, and boredom in your life with games to make you calm, engaged, and curious. Along the way I\u0027ll be sharing what I learn about technology, design, the world around us, and the people in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I can\u0027t do this without your help! That\u0027s why I\u0027m here on Patreon. Right now my development effort is split between contract work and my personal projects. This is difficult for me because freelance programming is sporadic and offers me limited creative opportunity to make the kind of games I want to make. With your help, I can devote myself to projects of my own design and enrich the world in some tiny way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you working on now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kommagames.com/misc/cyberjump_gameplay.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m making CyberJump, a hybrid of a dice game and a role-playing adventure. It\u0027s set in an aqueous computer world, a near-future with fantastic technological regression, where political figureheads get kidnapped, viruses can make a desktop explode, and safety on the information superhighway only happens through the union of keyboard mercenaries. Presently this consists of a playable prototype showing off the combat system (the core of the game). Once this is smooth and satisfying, I plan to work on giving the game more structure, progression, and narrative--in other words, to turn a strategic dice game into a proper adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBattles in CyberJump are a matter of wits and planning. Instead of picking moves from a menu, you plan your turn by rolling a pool of dice and assigning them to actions like attacking, defending, or using each character\u0027s unique special abilities. Bigger values make an action more likely to succeed. Good luck can give you the opportunity to reverse the tide of battle, but beware: if you can\u0027t predict what your enemies want to do, you\u0027ll waste your most valuable dice and be struck in your weak points!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals with CyberJump is to create a diverse cast of likable characters, drawing from my experience in different online communities. In game, we see them through the cyberspace avatars they\u0027ve chosen for themselves. You\u0027ll get to meet characters like...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRicky, a wealthy intellectual who can\u0027t figure out why his dance remixes get so few plays.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLeonor, an old Floridian woman who spends her retirement role-playing as a dread skeleton warrior.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOrlando, a former airline pilot battling a trance-like addiction to mindless viral videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMedina, a stubborn coder who butts heads with the hackers she grew up admiring. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eADA, an AI created for librarian services who has begun to question their own purpose and identity.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e...and so many more!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCyberJump runs on Windows and Linux, and is programmed in C++ using the Allegro library. Curious how it works? I do my best to stay approachable and answer technical questions to the best of my ability. Sometimes I even do live programming streams!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(A Mac version is feasible, it just doesn\u0027t work yet!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I\u0027ve been funding the development of this project from my own savings account and the generosity of supportive family members. Without support I will periodically need to take time off for paid contract work, which can make it difficult to maintain momentum. The money I raise here helps me pay my living expenses, so it leads directly toward more features, fixes, and general improvement for the game. When you pledge, you are literally making my life better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not do a Kickstarter? Kickstarters are fun, and a good fit for some kinds of projects, but they require a lot of effort to organize, run, and fulfill. They ask patrons to commit a lot of money at once to a game they\u0027re not sure they will like after it\u0027s finished up. As a supporter you usually have to wait a year--often longer!--before you see any results. They can also commit a developer to lofty stretch goals that may not seem as feasible or valuable later on in development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has some awesome benefits:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou aren\u0027t \"buying a game\", you\u0027re becoming part of a community!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get to see the game\u0027s progress every month (or every week)!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf your financial situation changes, or you aren\u0027t satisfied with the work for any reason, you can withdraw your pledge at any time.
