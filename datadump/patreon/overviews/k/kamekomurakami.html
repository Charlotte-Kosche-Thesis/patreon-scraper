    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eOnce, when I was twenty, I fell asleep for five years in the back seat \nof an abandoned \u002747 Chevy, and spiders came out of the air vents \nand wrapped me inside a cocoon of spider silk. They\u2019d never seen a human\n inside the car within their lifetimes and they had no idea what I was, \nbut they all agreed that it was a rare and precious event and that I \nshould be preserved like a work of art for future generations of spiders\n to look upon and rejoice in the majesty of the universe. The silk kept \nme protected from time and entropy, and when I woke and tore myself \nfree, I was as young as I had been on the day I\u2019d fallen asleep.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe spiders want you to support me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis dress is made of butterflies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThey fly out of my closet by the hundreds, fluttering in seemingly \nrandom patterns around the bedroom before they begin to settle, one by \none, onto my bare skin. I can feel their tiny feet sticking to me as \nthey land and position themselves, a swallowtail here, a mourning \ncloak there, a monarch on my hip. Their proboscises reach out and taste \nme, countless little tongues caressing me. The dust from their wings \nbrushes off onto me and makes me sparkle in the light coming in from the\n window.\u003cbr\u003e\nI twirl in place like a princess at a ball, and the butterflies lift \ntheir wings to catch the air, raising me several inches from the floor, \nsetting me down again when my dervish moment passes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeightlessness is \nintoxicating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSatisfied, I hold my arms out from my sides and the butterflies \nlaunch off of me like a dust devil of blues and reds and blacks, \nspinning off on a thousand whispering wings, making one last pass \nthrough the bedroom before returning to their home in the closet. The \nghost memory of their wings brushing like silk against my skin lingers \nfor a few moments, leaving me quiet and pleased.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m so glad to see the dress still fits.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe butterflies want you to support me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere is a tiger in my house, stalking through the halls. He is thick\n and terrible and the color of snow on ice.  He smells of spice, hot \nspice that stings the eyes and burns the back of the throat. He crawled \nout of my bathtub two nights ago, dripping water all across the small \nblack and white tiles which cover the floor. He has taken up residence \nin the darker corner of the hallway, below the picture of Katya and \nJarek in Bulgaria. At night I can hear him licking his chops, waiting to\n make a meal of something.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBez hasn\u2019t seen him, but Juteau said she heard something snuffling \naround the crack of her bedroom door last night. She thought that she\u2019d \nbeen dreaming, but I know that she was not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger is here for something.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe tiger wants you to support me. He may also want to eat me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach evening, I have to tell the tiger a story, and sing it to sleep with tales of lands across the sea, of doorways behind portraits, of treasures lost and found and lost again. He is fond of stories wherein people are eaten, obviously, but also enjoys fables about the wisdom of spectral ancestors, or old women who divine the future by reading the curls and spirals of clouds. His favorite stories are those which involve mathematics, because as everyone knows, tigers excel at the poetry of numbers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger sleeps much better than I do. It takes gallons of coffee to keep me awake, aware and functioning. To fall asleep before imagining a story to tell the tiger would be a dangerous thing indeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCaffeine is expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger wants you to help me buy coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWon\u0027t you please help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger suggests I put a link to my website here, for your reading enjoyment: \u003ca href=\"http://www.kamekomurakami.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKamekoMurakami.com\u003c/a\u003e. He also thinks I should mention that you can find some of my previously published work at my author\u0027s page at \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kameko-Murakami/e/B008MPPO6K/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1395045228\u0026amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmazon.com\u003c/a\u003e, and that if you enjoy tales of dark fantasy or science fiction, stories with whispered voices from behind curtains or creatures under the bed, and sometimes a few occurrences of love overcoming dangerous odds, then I am your girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s always a wise idea to pay attention to what the tiger has to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn important bit of information for you lovely people: you\u0027ll be looking at roughly a story every two months or so, as I\u0027m working on a novel and various other web-only projects, so you\u0027re not going to be washed away in a flood of 1,000 word short shorts. Quality over quantity, friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your attention. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ve got a tiger to tame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
