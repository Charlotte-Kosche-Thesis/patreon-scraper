But here I am, a girl standing in front of her crowdfunding platform,\u00a0asking\u00a0yew to believe in me. Here we go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of yew know I have been shouting my personal stories (the bad and the good) via the Social Networks and Blogs for 8 years and counting. Many of yew don\u0027t know that your words have saved my life, or kept me going in times when I was very alone. What I never expected was the outpouring of support from you, from strangers. \u00a0You send me your own stories. You tell me my humor helps you go on. You say words that live on forever in my heart. Thank you for allowing me into your struggle. \u00a0I do not take your trust lightly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing was a gift from my trauma, is my therapy and the tool through which I make sense of my own shit. \u00a0As a crazy empath, this is the only way forward for me, and by supporting me, you are participating in my healing. I am humbled by all of your support so far, and for the new folks who will join my search for the truth while documenting my stories to inspire others who can not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Your donation supports:\u00a0my writing, activism, community building in the areas of Mental Illness, Endometriosis, Chronic Illness, Emotional and Financial Abuse, Infertility, Miscarriage, Ghosting, Equality, STEM, Survivor Support, Living Intentionally and Mindfully....yew get it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Due to the unfortunate circumstances of having an ex-partner stealing my money, I am not able to cover the costs surrounding Chronic Illness. Your dolla bills will go tew my Medical Bills, Medical Appointments and Prescriptions. But more importantly it allows me the gift of healing my body. \u00a0I am not able to be \"out there\" like a normal human yet, but I am getting better every day, and less stress is more healing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) New life new branding and online/social media tewls. \u00a0Malibewddha is coming tew life y\u0027all!

This will help me get Malibewddha up and running :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not least, there are millions of\u00a0people\u00a0suffering from\u00a0addiction\u00a0from the\u00a0over -prescription of\u00a0opiates in america and I feel I am ready to share my personal struggle with both. After years of hearing your stories in the DM\u0027s and PM\u0027s of the internet, have a responsibility to share my stories for the benefit of others. I know it is my life\u0027s purpose and no and what I am doing to elevate the voices of those who do not have one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"One year ago I left rehab...\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be able to write this story with your support.
