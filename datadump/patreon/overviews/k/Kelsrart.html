    "summary": "The art world is a cruel place these days, especially for the artists themselves. The life for an artist is not glamorous and not always fun, but filled with a struggle to\u003cbr\u003ecreate and free yourself as well as just trying to survive everyday. It may be hard, but I never take it for granted, nor would I give it up for anything in the whole world. To create is to exist for me, without it, I am nothing, just a hollow shell of a person with no way to express themself. I have fought very hard to survive in my life, survive my struggles with mental health, as well as to deal with the people around me. I am astounded by the overwhelming negativity I receive everyday and I fight hopeless feelings every moment. My art is more than an image, it is a challenge to the viewer. The main challenge being to see through the darkness and pain to find the beauty within. Isn\u2019t that what most of us do in our daily life anyways?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I have always drawn and painted, starting as a child. In middle school I went through the start of my relentless depression that tainted my life until well after high school. At this point however, I began to try my hand at writing and found it to be the best way to express my insane feelings. I attended a charter high school for the arts and academics that really challenged my abilities. There, I started a book my freshman year that I still hope to write one day, even though all of it was stolen in a borrowed backpack. It followed the tale of Albert Fish, a famous geriatric serial killer, and how he had kidnapped, killed, and eaten a girl of 12 years old. The book was written in first person from the view of almost every person involved with the crime and I hoped to tell more true crime stories with that model. That year I fell back into my art, slowly at first then more and more. I was selected in a local art museum exhibit for students and won an art contest at my high school my senior year. After I graduated in 2012, I threw my first solo art show three years later at the deli where I worked. There was not a huge turnout, but I sold $600 worth of paintings (mainly to my brother in Texas but still). I started working with the local visual artists group and did about five shows with them in a year and sold around $300 of paintings and prints. I also started working with raw that year, and since then I have done 7 shows from Milwaukee to Chicago to Detroit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0So far, reaching out has been a journey on my path in the art world. I have traveled in the Midwest and have met so many other artists through the group raw artists. I have tried to work with people in my hometown of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, but my style just does not fit here. I dream of living off of my artwork and be able to sell it all around the world, let it take me on this crazy journey. All I ask for is support and hope, because I feel like I would lose my mind without it. I hope you enjoy my work, and allow yourself to be open minded and see the beauties hidden within. As I always say, take a peek into my nightmares."
