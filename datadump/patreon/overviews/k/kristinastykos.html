I work\nfull time and then some as a recording engineer \u0026amp; as a landscaper. This\npays my bills, just barely. I\u2019m here on Patreon to help fund my personal music\nprojects and other creative work including photography, poetry, video and\npodcasts. I am trying to find new ways to free up more of my time so that I can\nfinish albums, books, web portfolios and other media enterprises.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have fans all over the world who I\u0027ve been able to connect with, thanks to social media and music networks outside the US.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I am incredibly grateful for their support and encouragement! They have kept me going through the dark times. I come late to the party, having taken time off to raise three children as a single mom. Ironically, when I was finally ready to re-enter my career, I found that my voice had been compromised by years of struggle and strife. The loss of my singing ability made me rethink my approach to self expression and led me to get training in recording engineering so that I could work in private to reclaim of my voice - whatever that might mean - literally and as a writer. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt has been a hardship to be so challenged by the loss of a gift.\u003c/strong\u003e I have cried many tears in the face of being cut off from a very visceral and powerful form of communication, because blasting love \u0026amp; understanding is what I\u0027m all about. I\u0027ve had to work hard to find new ways to express myself, using a multitude of instruments and mediums. The good news is that I\u0027m making great strides, despite this handicap.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u2019re reading this as a potential patron\u003c/strong\u003e, you probably already appreciate the unwieldy, magical,\nsometimes revolutionary thinking of artists. That\u0027s why you stopped here. You believe in the power of words\nand songs and imagery; you believe in the kind of artistic expression that has\ntouched you \u0026amp; taught you something about yourself. Stories that have gestured\ntowards right living without dogma or pretense. Moments that have moved you and\nmade you whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\ncreate and perform artistic works because for me art brings empathy \u0026amp; where\nthere is empathy the world is becoming a better place.\u003c/strong\u003e As\nhumans, our wiring remembers the pathways to relationships of integrity.\nArtistic endeavors help strengthen our neural navigational systems. Great beauty\nand inspiration lurk in every corner of every ordinary thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour\nsupport for me is a statement that you support the vital work of artists who\nstill believe in humanity despite the suffering we see all around us.\u003c/strong\u003e The\ncreativity that drives us is as much that of dreamers following visions as\nrealists reimagining what can be done or can\u2019t be done. Successful artists see beauty\nas a fierce, unstoppable weapon of choice and aren\u2019t afraid to use it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiving on a back road in Vermont gives me a dynamic\ncorner window into the vitality of the natural world, a vitality that is\u00a0innately\u00a0ours.\u003c/strong\u003e Whether I\u0027m leaning on my shovel scanning the clouds, or sitting on the tailgate of my truck\nsharpening garden shears, or skiing old trails by abandoned apple orchards, what is happening outdoors becomes the foundation of my artistic work; the path is short from rain-soaked rose petals to a camera lens, a guitar or a haiku. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere\n\u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e a secret door at the back of the\nwardrobe.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m honored that you\u2019ll consider walking through it\nwith me.
