My name is Janna Jade, but most of you know me as Kiwi or Kiwi92524. First off, THANK YOU for stumbling across my Patreon page. You rock! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically\u00a0I am a model, cosplayer,\u00a0gamer, and all around nerd. During the day I am a scientist but I frequently attend photo-shoots and cons to meet all \u00a0of you awesome people \u00a0(I seriously love this amazing community). I live and work \u00a0in the New York / New Jersey area. I mostly dabble in comics and video games, but hey, I don\u0027t discriminate fandoms and I love to be introduced to new things, especially shows, books, and general awesomeness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, why not! I am hoping to use Patreon so you all can get to know me a little better than conventional social media allows, because here is where I will be posting some behind the scenes from my shoots, ask you guys questions on what cosplays I should be doing next, have some raffles, and other fun goodies. I will potentially start posting vlogs and other such things. Essentially, I want to help give back to all of you that support me and what I do! Every month, you can contribute what you want, and get exclusive access to prints that will only be featured on Patreon. Your contributions will be used to halt crime in Gotham! Or, you know, help fund photo-shoots, new cosplans (why are materials so expensive??) and help me with some out of state convention expenses so I can hopefully meet all of you nerds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the greatest things about this community is how much we support each other. I know I am a rather new cosplayer, but I couldn\u0027t do any of this without your help. I love all of your feedback. I want to continue to create these awesome things together. So, reach out, talk to me, offer advice and critiques, ask questions, whatever! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Let me also add, and I want this to be clear, you don\u0027t need to spend money to support me! All of you following my journey on social media have my eternal gratitude already. Patreon is just a way to get some exciting rewards every month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thank you all again so, so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
