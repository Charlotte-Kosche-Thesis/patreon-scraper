It\u2019s a time when our perceptions play tricks\non us and we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s real, a time of natural confusion to our normal\nway of orienting ourselves. \u00a0We\nare living at the end of an epoch or cosmic cycle -- a long age of conflict,\nquarrels and unchecked patriarchy.  The insanity we have become normalized\nto (from nonstop war to daily shootings to collapsing economies) is the\nlogical out picturing of an era winding down. \u00a0This Global Blue Hour is a collective liminal\nspace. \u00a0\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA new day\nis upon us, but the sun has not yet risen.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe spiritual and esoteric traditions say that at the end of this era,\nhumanity will have plunged to the depths of darkness, madness and maximum materialism. \u00a0In sum, I see that we are collectively suffering from a Sacred Deficit Disorder (SDD). \u00a0Life desacralized becomes existentially meaningless, an aimless rat race: in short,\u00a0depressing. \u00a0And by sacred I don\u2019t mean anything exotic, dogmatic or inaccessible.  I mean looking into the eyes of the cashier\nas she rings up your items. \u00a0I mean the feeling of a\nfather and daughter walking hand in hand on the sidewalk. \u00a0I mean the sound of rain drumming on the rooftop. \u00a0I\u0027m talking the everyday sacred, \n\u003cem\u003ethe re-enchantment of the ordinary\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0I mean experiencing every breath and each footstep as a miracle and as ceremony. \u00a0This Global Blue Hour is a gateway moment, an opening to remembering our Sacred Selves and reclaiming our rightful place and role as creator beings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe live in an astonishing era of breakdown and breakthrough. As systems collapse under the weight of evolution and their own time-released obsolescence, new foundations are being laid for a new way of being, living, organizing and exchanging. Social innovation is unleashing new horizons and networked communities are open-sourcing new realities into existence. The democratization of information has become a portal for emergence.\u00a0The last few decades have seen an explosion of new knowledge across all fields of human knowing, from physics and biology to pre-ancient history and archeology. In aggregate, a new narrative for humanity is being collectively sculpted  ~ by necessity and the evolutionary impulse of our times ~ because solutions to the complex challenges facing the world today will not come from the prevailing worldview of materialism and separation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003eThe language we use and the stories we tell matter.
