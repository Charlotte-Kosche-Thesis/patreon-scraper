    "summary": "We are Dennis and Pia Kammeborn and we live on Gotland, a Swedish island in the Baltic sea. We produce the Kammebornia podcast on Youtube and it is about life in general and knitting in particular. We release 12 new episodes each year since 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Kammebornia?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKammebornia is our own fairytale kingdom that we started as an art project when we got married in 2011 after diseases and misfortunes. There is so much beauty in life and we want to inspire people to discover the magic that can be found in everyday life. It is after all within the smallest and the simplest of things that we find the greatest joy. Like having coffee with someone you love, knitting a pair of warm and beautiful socks, hearing the birds sing, baking a bread, getting warm from the sun.\u003cbr\u003eWe wish for a warm and kind world where there is room for everyone. That\u0027s why we started Kammebornia, which is about our wish that everyone can be the king or the queen in their own life and that we all can live in our own fairytales in this thing we call reality.\u003cbr\u003eWe are so happy to have followers all over the world and to hear that we make a difference in the world by spreading inspiration, love and thoughtfulness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a secure and established platform for fans to economically support creators\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon we can reach out to you and ask for help to continue and develop the work we are doing. And we can share even more with you! You can become our Patron and support os on a monthly basis and we can continue to give you the things you like and also give you extra treats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou decide how much you want to contribute every month and you can change the amount or stop your support at any time.The Patreon platform is an easy, safe and efficient way to support us and make it possible for us to keep up the work with our podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe podcast is free to watch!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Kammebornia podcast is free to watch on Youtube for everyone and we enjoy working on it and spreading love, thoughtfulness and inspiration. However, it takes a lot of time and effort to produce and we need to buy food, pay bills and so on as well as develop our work by buying new equipment. That is why we ask for your help, if you have the possibility to be a Patron and support us economically on a monthly basis. We know the feeling of not being able to afford things and we want everyone to feel welcome to watch the Kammebornia podcast. Therefore, it will continue to be free. So becoming a Patron is of course optional and if you can not afford it - we still love to hear from you and you are always welcome to watch our podcast anyway.\u003cbr\u003eIf you can and want to become a Patron, we are ever so thankful and you will get rewards and extra treats through our Patreon-page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find us on Instagram as @kammebornia and @kingofkammebornia as well as on our blog kammebornia.se and on Youtube as Kammebornia podcast."
