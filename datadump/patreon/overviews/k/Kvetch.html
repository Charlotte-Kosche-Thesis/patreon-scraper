    "summary": "The world of publishing has outpaced my ability to keep up, but I\u0027m adapting! You, my readers and friends, showed me I should stay home and write more stories. For \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e, specifically. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m going to let you remind me what my number one job is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking stories happen\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks don\u0027t just grow like mushrooms. Every one of my projects starts with the base concept, then grows to include characters, histories, structure and plot twists. Every single one involves research, some more extensive than others, some downright crazy or silly. There\u0027s a lot of stuff you never see that goes into making the stories and novels - from my thought process and talking things out with patient friends to writing scenes and essays that never make it into the tales. I have conversations with characters that never appear on the page. I collect pictures and links, reference books and guides.\u00a0 I read other work for inspiration - both good and bad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may already follow me on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/laura.antoniou\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LAntoniou\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e or even look at my \u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/lantoniou/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePinterest\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://lauraantoniou.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e pages. (Shamefully under-utilized, really.) But the limits of those media don\u0027t support doing things like posting excerpts, thoughts on the process of writing, or the more detailed, true-fan-only sort of geeky Q\u0026amp;A stuff that only comes out when I\u0027m with people who \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e know my work. Or want to know it better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping this will turn out to be a way to interact with those of you who do \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to know the behind-the-scenes details, who will ask more than, \"When\u0027s the next book out?\" A place where I can put excerpts from a work in progress, or cut scenes from an older one. Outlines and ideas for new books and stories. Resources I\u0027ve used, in case you really want to know what\u0027s on my shelves. I\u0027m not sure what else. My Stannis Baratheon fan fiction? Letters from characters? Adventures in baking, certainly. I\u0027ll figure it out as we go along. With your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I am hoping what happens is a few of you decide to toss some filthy lucre, some loose change, a tip, or a patronage my way. Supporting me by buying books is \u003cem\u003efantastic\u003c/em\u003e. If you review or recommend them, especially to people who may have never heard of me, that\u0027s even \u003cem\u003ebetter\u003c/em\u003e. But if you do those things \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e make it possible for me to buy coffee and cat food in that between-books time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eThen we can be \u003cem\u003ebest\u003c/em\u003e friends. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no secret I am completely willing to be bought. I believe with even a little steady interest, I can be pushed to making something new on a more consistent basis. And if it\u0027s not new, I can share older proposals and ideas with you and see if you like them. Maybe your interest will get me to write that Evil Gay Werebear book. Or perhaps what you really want is more background profiles and side-stories about existing characters in published books. The continuing adventures of Earl, Slave Bitsy and the Boys Jack. Or some recipes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to know. And this is where you can tell me.\u003cbr\u003e"
