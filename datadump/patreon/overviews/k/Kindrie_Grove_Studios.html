The initial bones of the tale came through incredibly quickly with characters so powerfully real for me that I lived and breathed with them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen began the slow task of turning the telling of the story into a well written adventure that could be shared with the world. From then on, the work on the manuscript happened in short moments snatched from a busy family life and career as a professional artist. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I neared the end of the incremental editing process, the images and spirit of the characters began to arrive as sculptures and paintings. Thus was born the \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.thestoneguardians.com/the-legend-collection\"\u003eLegend Collection\u003c/a\u003e \u00ad\u2013 works of art that explore the archetypal essence of my books as well as other mythologies. This series of works is on-going as is the writing now of the second book of The Stone Guardians series: \u003ca href=\"http://www.thestoneguardians.com/books\"\u003eRemembering\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is my hope that you enjoy the characters and story as much as I have enjoyed writing it!
