My name is Ken Hess and I am the owner of the blog and youtube channel Ken\u0027s Kreations since 2012! What started off as a simple craft blog to showcase my projects, turned into a\u00a0love affair of making videos and reviewing products to help you with your buying decisions! With so many crafting tools on the market it is hard to know what tools you need and what sources are giving you the best information. We all know the drill! All we do is quickly check our email, and the next thing we know we are being \"enabled\" to purchase the newest craft tool on the market! Well, my day came soon enough when I saw the Silhouette Cameo, and I just knew I had to have it! But wait! What is this a NEW Cricut Explore! Well, now what? What machine should I buy? Which one is better? \u00a0I know, I will head to YouTube to fine my answer. NOPE, nothing there. At that exact moment, I knew that this was a real struggle for many crafters. The ability to see non-biased reviews of your favorite craft tools! This was the start of Ken\u0027s Kreations video reviews. My videos are of high quality production and reviews that focus on the product, features, benefits and of course the bottom line. Do you really need it?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY IS KEN\u0027S USING PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince 2012, I have had the amazing privilege of meeting and growing a family of crafters from my YouTube channel and social media outlets. Many of you have asked how you could support me and up to this point, I have not had an official way, besides affiliate links. Now, with patreon, I have the ability to give the option to people who want to donate and support Ken\u0027s Kreations, with a safe and secure way of doing this. If you enjoy Ken\u0027s Kreations, my video reviews and my blog. I would welcome any support through patreon. \u00a0Plus with the support of all of you I will be able to bring you:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMORE \u003c/strong\u003evideo reviews (2-3 Per Week)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGIVEAWAYS \u003c/strong\u003eof the items I am reviewing and \u003cstrong\u003eHUGE\u003c/strong\u003e shopping hauls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDEDICATED\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0time spent helping and supporting all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFILES \u003c/strong\u003e(SVG images, Design Space or Cricut Craft Room files)\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eto use with your cutting machines\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSEE OTHER REWARDS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO DONATE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDonations are always welcomed at any level.

Based on the pledge amount, I will give you access to that reward\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ABOUT YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEOS/BLOG?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my videos and post will still be 100% free on YouTube and on my Blog. This is just an option for people to earn rewards while supporting Ken\u0027s Kreations. The main goal is to be able to get enough support to concentrate all of \u00a0my time on Ken\u0027s Kreations and brining you full time content year round as a full time job for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON NOW?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know many of you might be asking yourself, WHY NOW? And you have a very valid question. Patreon has been around for a couple of years and I have many friends who use this amazing service. Well, to be honest I actually need the support to continue Ken\u0027s Kreations. You see, for the most part, I buy all of the items I review to give you an unbiased review. These cost include supplies, video equipment, audio equipment, editing software, computer programs and the actual product I am reviewing. As you can imagine these can add up very quickly for each video and I usually do about 2 videos a month. Due to circumstance out of our control, our household has been reduced to one income and now I am limited to funds at my disposal, in order to create these videos for you. After reviewing my options I had many of my friends, family and a few amazing crafty group members recommend Patreon. I\u00a0love making video reviews and tutorials that help everyone in our crafting community! With your Patreon support, I will be able to do even more for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

I have had many people reach out to me to ask how they can support me so I can bring more great review content to you.
