    "summary": "Karibu is an entertainment journalism website with the aim of changing the face of millennial media through ethical, reliable, non-partisan news coverage, as well as world-class \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal content\u003c/strong\u003e covering the areas of music, film, TV, and games. As excited as we are about our original multimedia content, such as our live video band sessions and weekly podcasts, we need your help to produce it, particularly while we\u0027re still getting on our feet as a company.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started Karibu because I was sick of millennial-oriented entertainment sites indulging in stale, predictable grievance-mongering and dreary identity politics, rather than talking about the content itself. I wanted to start a site that will celebrate the best in popular culture, as well as actively participating in that culture through formidable original content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA great deal of this content has already been produced, at our own expense. At the time of writing, our video content costs has cost far more to create than it brings us through income. We think this is a price worth paying, because the content is so good that we\u0027re hugely proud to put our name to it. Still, we can\u0027t operate like this indefinitely - none of us come from wealthy backgrounds, and, like everyone else, we have bills to pay - as do our writers, camera crew, and backroom staff. We would love to be in a position where our content is financially supported by our beautiful followers, without the need for more traditional means such as sponsorship. We need your help to get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds raised through Patreon will go towards the ongoing upkeep of Karibu, whether that\u0027s paying our contributors, the tech staff who produce our original content, or simply to keep an office roof over our heads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be posting Patreon updates on a regular basis, including sneak previews of some of our original video content, to give you a better idea of what we\u0027re all about and keep you all updated as to where we are on our journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, we want to be up there with the big hitters of millennial entertainment media, bringing passion, integrity, and reason to the debate.\u00a0This is the very start of our journey, but we have a long way to go. We hope that you\u0027ll help to get us there. Thank you."
