    "summary": "I am going to re-work this section at some point \"relatively soon\", to accommodate a few changes in plan and approach. The existing text below still holds true, except for the bit I added a strikethrough on, since I\u0027m moving that specific sort of thing to some other service that allows me to take and manage commissions a lot easier and more comfortably than I could here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA huge amount of my new approach will be extremely community-oriented, because there\u0027s a lot that I want to do and provide for WAN, and I\u0027m going to use this Patreon as a method for me to help people in the community to contribute toward new stuff to \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e in the community. Game servers, bot hosting, development platforms, tools, content utilities, even things like event prizes on occasion!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil I get around to the full editing effort, I\u0027ll leave the prior text below and intact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for everything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is gonna be pretty bare and basic for now since I\u0027m very hesitant to try this whole thing out - it\u0027s hard for me to ask for help, and even harder for me to dare venture that my work is worth getting paid for, so when I\u0027m a little more confident in how Patreon functions, I\u0027ll invest into the page with some nice graphics and such!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of things, like some sort of overpowered Jack-Of-All-Trades, so I\u0027ll offer a few of them for now and go from there. Or you can join my Discord community and ask some questions there, too~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/KrTMPWg\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/KrTMPWg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003ePerhaps the most readily-available thing I can offer any lovely souls who can spare a bit to help someone like me... is \u003cem\u003eartsy things\u003c/em\u003e! I do \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003echaracter sketches in both traditional and digital\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, though my drawing tablet has recently died and I am unable to offer digital sketches at this time. I\u0027m actually making this page out of a hope that I might be able to earn enough money to buy a new tablet so I can offer such things again! As for what happens after that, I\u0027ll think more about that if I get that far, y\u0027know?\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working really hard on a \u003cstrong\u003efan-made sequel to the wonderful story of \u003ca href=\"http://www.oneshot-game.com/\"\u003eOneShot\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, too, called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eOneShot: Fragments of Providence\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! The end result will be provided for free, but it will require you to have previously played \u003cem\u003eOneShot\u003c/em\u003e itself and completed it before it will function - and just like its predecessor, it knows you exist, and knows if you\u0027re trying to trick it with copied files from your friends~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am planning to offer some special rewards relating to \u003cem\u003eFragments of Providence\u003c/em\u003e and its development, though I will need to think about this a little more and discuss it with some related people, first. I don\u0027t wanna step on the toes of the dev team for original \u003cem\u003eOneShot\u003c/em\u003e, nor my own team for \u003cem\u003eFragments of Providence\u003c/em\u003e, y\u0027know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I could probably mention that I also do small crafts and cosplay accessories, but I do this infrequently due to lack of materials, and could probably present this best via an Etsy storefront or something at a later time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to hear of some of my long-term goals, I am working toward setting up a full blacksmithing workshop where I intend to hand-make \u003cstrong\u003eMechamusume/musuko inspired cosplay armor and accessories\u003c/strong\u003e out of \u003cem\u003ereal metals\u003c/em\u003e and other fittings. Products made from such a shop would be entirely on-commission, and I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m going to do customs or not, but we\u0027ll see when I get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, while I am definitely a creative sort of person and intending to use my skills in this regard to provide fun and interesting products to people, I actually have a career goal of moving to Ikaruga, Japan - where I hope to teach English in nearby places such as Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, and Sakai. I hope to also help people and businesses with translation efforts, and continue providing neat products on the side. When I am closer to this goal, I\u0027m actually planning to \u003cstrong\u003evlog my preparations, trip, and experiences,\u003c/strong\u003e so I will also be needing to prepare equipment and video editing software beforehand. Once I have moved, I intend to settled down for the long-term and really establish the sorts of things I intend to offer on a permanent basis.\u003cbr\u003e"
