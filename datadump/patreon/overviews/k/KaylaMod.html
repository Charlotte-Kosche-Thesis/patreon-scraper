Since then I have upgraded to Clip Paint Studio EX and a Wacom Cintiq 13HD. Most of my art are anthropomorphic animals, relating to the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry_fandom\"\u003eFurry Fandom\u003c/a\u003e, which I have been apart of since late 2009.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is for everything I do basically, from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kaylamod.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy furry drawings\u003c/a\u003e that are my main interest as of right now, and even my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DarkenAnimations\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eanimated\u003c/a\u003e youtube where I post the occasional video, all the way to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Fursuit\"\u003eFursuit\u003c/a\u003e making. Aside from those three I always have something being planned or a side project being worked on. Theses\u00a0projects can be anything such as my upcoming HAL series, an animatic video series that follows an alien dog that is learning how to fit in the anthropomorphic world, but has some iffy role-models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I said above, I\u0027m a college student, putting a basic understand that I am poor. Along with that, drawing seems to be the only talent I can harness and use for profit. I attempted to be an Arts major, but my college quickly dashed my dreams, making me do are fully as a hobby and on the internet. But with Patreon, this makes it much easier for me to continue my dream of being paid to do what I love! Especially since without a car, I am pretty much stuck where I am in my dorm most of the time, and local jobs are very far and few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is the money going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMoney from patreon goes to a few things, food is a big one, I love to cook and patron money goes to helping me support that love! Another common place this money will go to fursuit making supplies.\u003cbr\u003e"
