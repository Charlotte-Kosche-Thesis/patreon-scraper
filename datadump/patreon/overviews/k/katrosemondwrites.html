I have wanted to be a published writer since I was ten years old. \u00a0It was only after my 31st birthday that I decided to stop talking and start doing. \u00a0Any donation is appreciated by your continued support means my words can reach the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
