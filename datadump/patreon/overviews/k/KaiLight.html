I used black and white photography years ago and I\u0027ve worked with pinhole photography, too. I am eager to use this new digital camera to better record and preserve my art, and to make better prints. I am ready to make more artistic videos, print HD digital photography on canvas, and include multimedia adding paint and collage to the prints. I need a better camera to accomplish this!",
