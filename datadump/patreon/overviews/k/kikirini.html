I started my first and current comic,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kuroshouri.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKuro Shouri\u003c/a\u003e, in 2005 when I was in high school. Nearly 10 years later, it\u0027s amassed over 900 pages and 3 books (so far!).\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://casing-comic.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCasing\u003c/a\u003e, my newest ongoing comic, has only just begun - but it\u0027s expected to be an ongoing project as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Kuro Shouri?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a heavily anime-inspired webcomic about two teenagers fighting against demonic forces. Its main characters are Hisaki, a mysterious guy who wields a sword, and Yasha, a girl with serious anger problems and a strange entity within her that she can\u0027t control. It\u0027s an ongoing comic with many chapters yet to come. Perfect for the anime lover!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Casing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCasing is my newest webcomic project. It is intended to be more American in style and storytelling, and tells the story of Alex Kayden, a local bodyguard with a sarcastic streak and a drinking problem, Angel, his technophile co-worker, and the various clients they take on in their business. This comic has just started and is currently still in its first chapter. Like a more grounded, character-focused story? This might be your cup of tea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does becoming a patron support these comics?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I mentioned, I started Kuro Shouri when I was in high school, and back then, I had loads of time to draw. Now, as an adult, my husband and I have bills to pay and kitties to feed. Usually this means 40+ hours at work and commissions on the side, which eats into our comic-making time. Even a little support will help us to have the time to get comic pages out, without those kitties going hungry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you update?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, Kuro Shouri and Casing each are updated at least once per month (barring unforeseen circumstances). As stated earlier, I have a large workload in addition to the comic in order to make ends meet. Patreon will only charge per completed page, so if our planned 2 pages per month doesn\u0027t happen, you won\u0027t be charged for work that wasn\u0027t done. That being said, our goal is to hopefully update each comic once a week - and perhaps more if we can reach our funding goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have to pay to read your comics?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNope! Both comics are still free-to-read over at their respective sites, and they always will be. Patreon simply allows us to pay our bills AND have time for comic-making - and allows you, if you desire, to support us and enable faster updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI only want to support one of your comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCool, thank you! Patreon has a nifty feature that allows you to cap the amount you pledge each month. If you want to stay in budget, or just support one comic/update, you can do that!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! :D\u003cbr\u003e"
