    "summary": "Now publishing on \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@kevinadair\"\u003emedium.com/@kevinadair.\u003c/a\u003e Please visit and see the documents, which patrons have supported, shared with all the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\n\u003cem\u003eall \u003c/em\u003ewant to find solutions to the world\u0027s terrible problems.\nBut, too often, our idealistic dreams just end up repeating other\npeople\u0027s mistakes, and can even make things worse. We can do better.\nThrowing money at the problems has not solved them. But solutions are\navailable, if we are ready to first listen to what is really wrong,\nand then provide the crucial leadership to address the problem. That\nis the model that can stop the cycle of wasting money generation\nafter generation. It is also the model that can lead to the real\nimprovements that good-hearted people have been seeking all along.\nEven better: The lessons that we learn through stopping the waste of\nmoney internationally, can bring benefit back home to the more\ntechnologically developed countries who are providing the money. It\u0027s\ntime to make a change to a new policy: Listen. Lead. Listen Again. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s\ntime to stop wasting time and money. It\u0027s time to take these lessons\nand improve lives in the US as well as every international location\nyou can name. It\u0027s time to follow a path that can actually work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nhave been living and working in developing countries for 12 years. I\nhave seen what works and what is just a waste of money. A major\nproblem is that new people come every year, ignore what does work,\nand instead make the same mistakes again and again. What can really\nmake an impact? Jobs. Permanent, long-term employment. Not paying\npeople to sit and do nothing, but paying people to do actual work,\nthat earns actual income. Real jobs make money \u2013 not just for the\nemployee, but for the employer as well. Real jobs mean firing people\nwho are repeatedly not working, and giving raises to people who\nactually help their employer. Countries around the world have huge,\nuntapped local resources that can be peacefully engaged to lead to\nmore prosperity for all. It can work, but we need to stop repeating\nthe same mistakes. We can do it. It can even be fun.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTraditional\nindustry and traditional charity have made some improvements, but\nthey have not solved the problems. We can do better, and I would love\nto share with you exactly how.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eName,\nan example of an intractable problem, such as: starvation, malnutrition,\ncurable-diseases, clean-water shortages, pollution, lack of housing,\nfuel shortages, deforestation, or gender inequalities. Any of these\nissues can be gradually addressed and gradually improved.\nStep-by-step. Crucially, we don\u0027t have to end up with empty pockets\nin order to yield the best results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nlay it out in detail in my book: \u003cem\u003eListen. Lead. Listen Again\u003c/em\u003e.\nBe my Patron and you can be one of the first people in the world to\nread the detailed solutions that can break through the mistakes of\nthe past to make real improvement for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInternational\ndevelopment has been limited by implementers not listening to what\nthe recipients of their \"aid\" actually need and want. After\n12 years working in ecological and social development in Haiti and\nthe Dominican Republic, I have discovered a method that is not only a\npreferable model for international development, but also an excellent\ntool for all forms of interpersonal communication: \u003cem\u003eListen. Lead.\nListen Again.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRead\nthe book as it is presented, in serial form \u2013 chapter by chapter,\nhere on Patreon. If you are so inspired, you can even come to Haiti\nto join our quest. See what we do and the verifiable impact we are\nhaving.  Have ideas of how to help? Let me know. I am listening. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf\nyou would like to support our project through a tax-deductible\ndonation, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.elfuegodelsol.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.elfuegodelsol.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can instantly become my friend on Facebook by becoming one of my Patrons.

     "description": "That\u0027s right. Here is your backstage pass to the Rock and Roll world of international development. At this level of support, you are welcome to spend a week working with us in Haiti or the Dominican Republic. Learn first hand why we do what we do. We also have other volunteering, ecotourism and internship options in various different price ranges, but if you really want to make an impact with your Patreon support, you are welcome to see personally where your money is going. You cover the airfare to get to PaP Haiti or Santo Domingo, DR, and the rest of the one-week experience is on us. Only basic accommodations: room, board and transportation are included. You can stay with us at our facility at no additional cost to you. You could also spring to stay at a nearby hotel, and have the developmental experience with us during the day, and more conventional comfort at night. That\u0027s up to you, but only our onsite accommodations are included. So, make your pledge. Make your money count. And join us for a week of work that you won\u0027t forget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to all of these awards, we also coordinate Fair Trade Coffee, Chocolate, and Banana tours. An exploration of the history of the Sugar Industry on the island, and medical missions. If you want to have similar perks by supporting our organization through our non-profit work, you can support FdS in Haiti or the Dominican Republic through our fiscal sponsor: Omprakash.org.",
