So many great adventures await us, and I can\u0027t wait to see them through with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the time I am at home in a small 29ft travel trailer with Doberman and two cats. My husband works as an EMT in the ER of a Level 1 trauma center, so you can imagine he\u0027s quite resourceful when I have questions about injuries for my story. Aside from writing daily, I mentor upcoming writers and helping them to publish their books. I also seek creative ways to promote fellow authors, so we can all help one another and add to the writing community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the author of the fantasy/sci-fi series, The Chronicles of Lorrek. It is a series about sorcerer prince, Lorrek, who has been missing for ten years and thought to be dead until he suddenly resurfaces. Upon his return, he learns his name has been tarnished as it was claimed that the reason he disappeared was because he committed crimes and didn\u0027t want to face the punishment. No one knows what to think, but he has his secrets, and no one trusts him. He is determined to clear his name of these accusations, but he realizes that in order to do this, he must become the very dark man everyone claims he is, and he doesn\u0027t know if he can come back from that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI offer exclusives about my books here on Patreon. These will only be offered here and nowhere else. More things will be added to each tier as I add to my program.\u00a0I will be launching my YouTube channel shortly, and I have great plans for that. It will be fun to see how it unfolds!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e It is very exciting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to sign up for my newsletter for weekly short stories in my story universe that aren\u0027t found anywhere else, not even here! You can sign up at my website: www.kellannetta.com. If you have any trouble subscribing, let me know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGOAL: $100/month\u003cbr\u003eIf I reach this goal, I have a surprise announcement for all my patrons! Can\u0027t wait!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting me!"
