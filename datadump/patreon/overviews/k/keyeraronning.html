For a long time I was something of a jack-of-all-trades, trying to figure out just what I wanted to do with my art and how I could best connect with my audience. I\u0027ve finally figured it out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m living with my fiance in a teeny tiny home. The living conditions aren\u0027t the best, especially with her health, but we\u0027re making the most of it, and we have enough space for ourselves and a small studio for me. That\u0027s where SNC comes to life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Spider\u0027s Nest Creations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpider\u0027s Nest Creations, or SNC, started in 2015 while I was still attending school at Savannah College of Art and Design. Since then, things have been up and down, but with help from my fiance, things are finally smoothing out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/0bbf760b876ac519c33567e7837dd726/tumblr_org982Nodz1wqeoj0o1_500.png\" style=\"width: 384px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSNC is a crafts and art studio run out of our small home in Florida. The crafts are all made by hand, and I create my paintings on a wide variety of surfaces and materials. The finished projects are usually made available for sale on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.etsy.com/shop/SpidersNestcreations\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Etsy shop\u003c/a\u003e, but Patrons can sometimes win them for free in raffles and other events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find SNC at various conventions and craft shows around the US, and we\u0027ll keep you up to date whenever a new one crops up, so you can visit us if you\u0027ll be around!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m Doing\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m making art and crafts that I\u0027m passionate about. Inspired by popular media like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, the Elder Scrolls, and Neverwinter Nights, but also various myths and lore around the world, my art focuses on fantasy and mythology, particularly creatures like dragons, mermaids, and the like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You\u0027re Making Possible\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause I\u0027m working on getting a part-time job, and the rest of my time is spent taking care of my fiance on her bad days, I don\u0027t often have time to pursue the art that I love, and my Etsy shop suffers as well. When you make the choice to support me and my work, you\u0027re making it possible for me to focus on more creative ventures, and build up a beautiful, sprawling portfolio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy process is constantly changing and evolving, as long time followers of my work may have noticed. Patreon allows me to not only explore and experiment with my favorite media, but also allows me to make mistakes and try out more risky projects without completely losing out on a client or a sale. So taking all of you along on the journey is just a small way for me to say thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, I\u0027m also able to share with fellow artists - whether brand new to art or long time professionals - insight into my materials and techniques, along with such things as my brainstorming process and how I approach a new project before I even start. So as further gratitude for your support, I\u0027m making parts of my process, tutorials, and detailed reviews, along with other behind the scenes material, available to my Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patron\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can pledge as much or as little as you want. My page is currently set up for monthly payments, and this means that you may get more or less for your money from month to month. Some months, I may post more content than others, but some months I may be working on a long term project, and you would only see a few posts in each tier, though I strive to provide a higher than normal quality for those months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of what I\u0027m working on for the month, I make it my goal to post at least once every week in each tier, so that everyone gets to see something new.\u003cbr\u003e"
