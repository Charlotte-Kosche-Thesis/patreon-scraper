    "summary": "For ten years or more, I\u0027ve been illustrating football kits (that\u0027s soccer uniforms, for any American friends) and uploading the resulting graphics to my \u003ca href=\"http://www.kitbliss.co.nz/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKitbliss\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e website. Kitbliss is my attempt to provide a place on the web to showcase as many different football kit designs from around the world as possible - an online gallery, if you will, to celebrate the history of the football kit itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you\u0027ll see if you visit the Kitbliss website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.kitbliss.co.nz/\"\u003ewww.kitbliss.co.nz\u003c/a\u003e), many teams - both clubs and countries - are featured, as well as a section on football kit templates and a wide range of \u0027fantasy\u0027 kits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how can you help? It\u0027s easy. By donating as little as $1 per month, you\u0027ll be helping me to buy books and other reference material which is vital to help me illustrate football kits accurately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait a minute, I hear you cry - \u0027surely everything\u0027s on the internet now?\u0027\u00a0 Well, no, to put it bluntly. Though there\u0027s lots of imagery and video footage, much of which has helped me out thus far, there\u0027s still a huge number of kits that have not been recorded visually and uploaded to the web. Fortunately, they have appeared in print and are waiting to be discovered by me... but being someone of minuscule disposable income, I can\u0027t currently afford to buy the publications they appear in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in. Your donations will allow me to buy more books, match-day programmes, magazines and other material to help me illustrate more kits in all the detail you crave. As well as that, you\u0027ll also be providing valuable help as I pay off the annual fees for web space and the Kitbliss domain name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please support me and Kitbliss on Patreon. Your generosity means Kitbliss will grow and grow and become the wonderful resource I always intended it to be in the future. Thanks in advance for whatever you can donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest wishes,\u003cbr\u003eChris.\u003cbr\u003e"
