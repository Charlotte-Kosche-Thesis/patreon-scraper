     "about": "Kyle Thiermann, born 1990, is a professional surfer, podcaster, and filmmaker from Santa Cruz, CA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen he\u0027s not chasing building-sized waves around the globe he works with Discovery Digital Networks as an on-camera correspondent and producer. He also works closely with his main sponsor, Patagonia to beat up products and help implement solutions to the environmental crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom ages 18-25 Kyle created and hosted the YouTube series Surfing For Change. While traveling to the best waves around the world, Thiermann created gonzo-style mini-documentaries about current environmental issues happening in the regions. In the series, Thiermann focused on the power people have to create a better world through everyday decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis first YouTube video in the series details how money kept in multinational banks can be used to finance destructive projects all over the world. This video inspired people to move over $360 million dollars of lending power out of centralized banks and into local banks and credit unions, and reached people throughout North America, South America, Africa and much of Europe.\u003cbr\u003eKyle has covered controversial stories all over the world. These stories have included the Indonesian trash epidemic, GMO protests in Hawaii, working conditions in Sri Lanka, nuclear power in South Africa, and the adverse effects of surf tourism in Nicaragua.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe graduated from Gaia University with a Bachelors of Science in Green Business with a focus in Media. His surfing skills earned him a spot among an elite group of athletes on the teams of Patagonia and Sector 9.\u003cbr\u003eKyle frequently appears on the pages of publications such as Surfer Magazine, Outside Magazine, and is a contributing writer for The Inertia and Santa Cruz Waves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKyle Speaks at Universities throughout the country and in 2011 gave a TEDx Talk in his wetsuit. Kyle\u2019s surfing and filmmaking successes have earned him the Brower Youth Award, American Clean Skies Award, Blue Vision Youth Award, and Surfrider\u2019s Pro Surfer Environmental Achievement Award.\u003cbr\u003e",
