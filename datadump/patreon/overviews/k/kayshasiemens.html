     "about": "Kaysha Siemens was born in the cold of Canada in 1984. Her very earliest memory (she was two) is of making art, and as she grew older and it showed no signs of ceasing to be her default activity, she figured she may as well give it a go as a career. Her favorite things to draw have always been characters from stories, so the jump to illustration was a pretty logical one. She has been making an adventurous living doing freelance illustration and appearing at conventions across the United States since 2006. She lives and toils in lovely Black Mountain, NC under the benevolent tyranny of her tailless cat Bobby.",
