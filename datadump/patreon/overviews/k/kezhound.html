It\u0027s a long-form (story) comic that follows one rough and ready \u0027gal named Colbey, as she hunts through a post-apocalyptic world looking for a guy named Peter Wolfe. Instead of zombie-outbreak, think science-conspiracy.

For example, I often offer extra updates, downloadable content, or wallpapers. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://warofwinds.com/what-it-takes/images/cast/snatch.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://warofwinds.com/what-it-takes/images/cast/arthur.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://warofwinds.com/what-it-takes/images/cast/toshiro.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027d like to do [with this Patreon]:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile it\u0027s nice to make a bit of money doing extra work atop unpaid work, it\u0027s \n\u003cem\u003eeven better\u003c/em\u003e to get paid to do the original work. And, well, comics are work. I make content that you hopefully enjoy. And if you enjoy it enough, and are financially secure enough, and are generous enough, it would be \u003cem\u003ereally awesome\u003c/em\u003e of you to send a dollar or two my way. In return, I will keep doing what I\u0027ve been doing for the past ten years, and finish up \u003cem\u003eWhat it Takes\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eEverything earned with this Patreon will be saved to help print the comic upon completion.\u003c/strong\u003e Previously it was a 50/50 split, with half the proceeds used to help treat my precious dog for cancer, but as it the case with hemangiosarcoma, Indy went fast.\u00a0 Fuck cancer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe recommended amount per person to donate is $2.
