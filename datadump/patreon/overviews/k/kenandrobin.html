    "summary": "We\u2019re writers and game designers Robin D. Laws and Kenneth Hite. Since 2012 we\u2019ve been releasing weekly episodes of our two-time ENnie award winning podcast,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kenandrobintalkaboutstuff.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKen and Robin Talk About Stuff\u003c/a\u003e. We\u2019ve always taken donations to support the show. Or rather, to prevent us from ever doing the math that shows how much time we spend on it compared to the many other items on our respective pressing schedules. We love doing the show and want it to go on for as long as you want to keep listening. So now in response to popular demand we\u2019ve brought our donation bucket over here to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould you rain your estimable patronage upon us in sufficient numbers, we\u2019ll be able to do some other cool stuff, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we hit $500 per month, we\u2019ll embark on a supplementary project, Ken and Robin Consume Media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhenever either of us finishes a movie, book, or TV season, we\u2019ll write a capsule review in that new, cutting edge medium, text, and post it where only our generous Patreon patrons can see it.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon subscribers can then vote for the items they want to hear us expand upon in a new occasional podcast segment entitled Tell Me More.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $3900 comes our most highly requested feature of all: our punchy but meager blog entries for each episode will become fully realized show notes, written by Ken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the crazy $5000 milestone, we can afford to have each episode transcribed for easy searching and/or posterity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the upper stratosphere of our Patreon dreams lurks a milestone we dare only call Ken Buys a Crazy Book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterspersed with these goals you\u2019ll find much-needed pay upgrades for our intrepid audio editor, Rob Borges. If he suddenly started questioning the generously discounted rate he now charges us, the show would grind to an immediate halt. Prevent that tragic event by helping us convey to him your gratitude in its edible form: money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to this new stage of our audio adventures and hope you\u2019ll keep us doing this show as we have for over three years, releasing a new episode every Friday morning, 50 weeks a year."
