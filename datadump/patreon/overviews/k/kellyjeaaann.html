My name is Kelly Jean, if you didn\u0027t already know that I think you got lost in a weird place on the internet, it happens to the best of us. At least you\u0027re not deep on wikipedia looking at the different varieties of spiders. ANYWAY I wear a lot of hats but mostly this Patreon is to support future cosplay and photoshoot projects (though I might expand it into other things I do in the future like art, singing :D and maybe Twitch stuff!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be three shoots a month with one full cosplay and one either boudoir/lingerie/swimwear/pin-up etc. The other varying on the theme of the month (eg. launch is Valentines theme!). There is some crossover though (sometimes the Cosplay IS swimwear so.. uh??) and some months have more cosplay lewdery than others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO NUDES SOZ putting that disclaimer there so I don\u0027t disappoint anyone lmfao.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect anyone to stay at the higher tiers every month. They\u0027re there for people who really like the content of the month and want physical rewards for them. Or really want me to make a cosplay/themed shoot. :D I fully encourage going up/down the tiers depending on how much you love that months content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those that might be concerned my health issues make me running a patreon unreliable, I have 3+ months of backlog content saved before I launched for that reason. Unlike Twitch streams I can save extra content for later. :\u0027) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m new to patreon content goes up on the 5th of the month as everyone is charged on the 1st of the month. So don\u0027t panic if you sign up and there is nothing there. :D The first couple of months will be a LOT of experimenting so pls feel free to give me feedback on what you like/hate on Discord. \u003cbr\u003e"
