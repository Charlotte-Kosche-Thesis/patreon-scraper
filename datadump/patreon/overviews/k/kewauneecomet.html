    "summary": "There\u2019s a classic scene in the great movie about journalism \u003cem\u003eCitizen Kane\u003c/em\u003e.\n Charles Foster Kane has just purchased the great New York Inquirer and \nscribbles a Declaration of Principles that appears on the front page of \nthe first edition under his watch:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cI will provide the people of this city with a daily \npaper that will tell all the news honestly. I will also provide them \nwith a fighting and tireless champion of their rights as citizens and as\n human beings.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course the film is about how he didn\u2019t live up to those \nprinciples. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone who could. But they represent a\n noble ideal to pursue.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eKewaunee County is in need of a news outlet that will tell all the \nnews honestly and accurately. It\u2019s a big job, but that\u2019s the goal here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere is no agenda on this website except, as the witness oath says, to \ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me \nGod.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI recently looked at something I\u2019d written a year ago, about what a \nTV newscast might look like if the goal wasn\u2019t to chronicle every \nconflict and bad thing that had happened in the world in the last 24 \nhours, and a phrase came to my mind:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am looking for a journalism that isn\u2019t trying to present the worst possible light.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI can\u2019t change modern journalism all by myself. But I can be that journalist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere is conflict in Kewaunee County, although people are coming \ntogether as people do when there\u2019s a community challenge. The biggest \nchallenge is about groundwater contamination, where it came from and how\n to fix it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen I sat down and talked with John Pagel in his office, all I \nsensed was a guy who wanted to run the best dairy operation he could \nmuster. When I sat down on Lynn Utesch\u2019s porch, all I sensed was a guy \nwho wanted the same. I didn\u2019t see heroes or villains. I saw men who love\n their homes and want to do right by them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you see a hero or a villain in my news stories, I didn\u2019t set out \nto declare anyone as such. If the truth, the whole truth, and nothing \nbut the truth leads you to conclude one thing or another, well, that\u2019s \nwhat journalism is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut my goal here is to present each person\u2019s viewpoint in the best \nand most accurate light possible. The rest is up to you as a reader and a\n citizen. I\u2019m just the witness.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMost of the time, though, this is a community working together, and that\u2019s also what this page is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Kewaunee County Comet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patreon supporters will get regular exclusive previews of what\u2019s coming up in the Comet via patron-only posts, along with \u201cState of the Comet\u201d reports to keep you apprised of the progress of your local news outlet\u2019s growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMany Patreon creators offer incentives to people who pledge in larger amounts \u2013 extra goodies and exclusive content. I\u2019ll be honest, I haven\u2019t figured out what to offer people who pledge $5 or $10 a month as opposed to $2 a month \u2013 other than you\u2019ll give me a greater incentive to work as hard as I can to keep you up to date on what\u2019s happening in Kewaunee County. For now, those extra gifts are \u201cto be announced.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission is to tell the story of Kewaunee County \u2013 to share its \nvoices and celebrate its heritage, its challenges, its solutions, its \ncherished past and its brightest future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWarren Bluhm\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eEditor \u0026amp; publisher\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
