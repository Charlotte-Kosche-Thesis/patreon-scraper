I am also featured on awesome sites like Tee Fury and the RIPT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am from a small town in Massachusetts just north of Boston called Nahant. I went to Ringling School of Art and Design and graduated with a BFA in Illustration. Up until a few years ago, I was an elementary school art teacher. Now I am working full-time as an artist. \u003cbr\u003eI currently live on the Northshore of Massachusetts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of projects that have been keeping me very busy, but have been asked over and over again to put out a coloring book. I thought Patreon might be the easiest way to do that! I am going to start very simply at first, but then add more options and goals after the holidays. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
