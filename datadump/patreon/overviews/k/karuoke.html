Live-streams would be at least once a month (with more prior warning to supporters here so that you know ahead of time if I\u0027m streaming). I will live-stream myself drawing and talk about my process, plus I will answer any questions you might have. Think of it like half of a drawing tutorial, and half of a Q\u0026amp;A session. I might also stream myself playing some games; although that will not be a replacement for the drawing streams.",
