    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Kristi! I create music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic is everything to me. It\u0027s imagination. Moments, stories, ideas and dreams captured. A celebration of the beauty around us. And hope for dark times. I can\u0027t\u003cem\u003e not \u003c/em\u003ecreate music - that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the challenge. I\u0027ve been investing 45-50 hours per week into my Day Job. While I\u0027m grateful for the income, that\u0027s at least 2,340 waking hours per year that I\u0027m not creating music... or anything else. I\u0027m a bit of a polymath - a Renaissance Girl, if you will - so what I create includes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Studio recordings of my original songs\u003cbr\u003e- Live music concerts both \u0027in real life\u0027 and on \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/kristikates\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/kristikates\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Music videos\u003cbr\u003e- Acting in film, animation, and voice projects\u003cbr\u003e- Gaming streams \u0026amp; Let\u0027s Plays (coming soon!)\u003cbr\u003e- Writing fantastical stories and books\u003cbr\u003e- Digital and hand-drawn artwork and illuminations\u003cbr\u003e- An online music \u0026amp; variety show (expected winter 2017)\u003cbr\u003e- Guest podcasting appearances and collaborations\u003cbr\u003e- And other surprises!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to ask if YOU would like to be part of the community I\u0027m building that will allow me to spend more time creating all of the above. Patreon is the perfect place for our headquarters, because it\u0027s a modern-day version of the Renaissance practice of \u003cem\u003epatronage\u003c/em\u003e, where creators are supported via a monthly monetary subscription by those who enjoy their creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a member and friend, you\u0027ll get immediate access to Patreon-only posts; one tier up gets you into our friendly Discord, too. The more you invest, the more fun you\u0027ll get in return! This will include early access to my music, special videos, first looks at other creations in-progress, and extra sneak peeks at what happens behind-the-scenes, plus exclusive digital downloads and IRL thank-you gifts just for Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make all of the plans and dreams above happen sooner rather than later. You can be an important part of that, and I\u0027d be honoured if you would.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWon\u0027t you join me? x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
