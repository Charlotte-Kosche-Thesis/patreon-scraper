    "summary": "We need, now more than ever, inspiring female role models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChildren can find male role models in every history book they crack open, misleading them to believe that being bold and overcoming insurmountable odds are male traits. This is because history is largely the study of impressive and courageous men. Does this mean that impressive and courageous women didn\u0027t exist? No. It means that their stories have been overlooked. For the most part, women are recorded as the wife of \"insert name of important man,\" who had \"x\" number of children. Every person should know that the history of women is just as rich and storied as the history of men. Women were not merely along for the ride; we\u0027ve jumped into the driver\u0027s seat too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs female adults we fight for equal pay and autonomy of our bodies. Our young women fight to prove that they are strong and so much more than pretty or an accessory. To move forward, it is a societal imperative for girls to have a foundation of knowledge and support to ensure their success and for boys and men to see that women are more than child-bearing machines. Recording and, more importantly, sharing the history of impressive and courageous women who were bold and overcame insurmountable odds changes the misconception that these are male only traits. There is a need in our world today, to complete the historical picture to show that women are just as powerful and influential as men.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, who is Kat Michels to take on such a task?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a nutshell, I\u0027m a writer whose specialties are non-fiction pieces about historical women and female-driven historical fiction. I write mini-biographies entitled \"Heroines of History,\" which you can read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.heartofaheroinealliance.com/heroines-of-history\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I tell the stories of American women whose actions were not motivated by fortune or fame. There was no glory and, in many cases, very little recognition for their activities. They simply did what needed to be done, and they did so in an extraordinary way. Despite their courageous deeds, these women have been omitted from the annals of American history simply because of their sex. They roared without making a sound so I tell their stories to lend them a voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all started as a personal interest and then grew into so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile in college, I was asked to write the narrative for a short-form documentary that told the story of the Colorado Governor\u0027s Mansion. Instead, I told the story of the women who owned, cared for, and fought for that mansion. \"Colorado\u0027s Home\" went on to win a Telly Award as well as a regional Emmy award. The following year I wrote and produced a short-form documentary on the women of the Colorado Ballet, winning another Telly Award and regional Emmy Award. These pieces proved to me that there is an audience for stories about women. We just need to tell them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShortly thereafter, I started writing \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.heartofaheroinealliance.com/heroines-of-history\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHeroines of History\u003c/a\u003e.\" While writing these the desire to do more spawned a number of ideas from an historical fiction novel, \u003cem\u003eIn a Time Never Known\u003c/em\u003e, to a series of non-fiction books called \u003cem\u003eThrough Her Eyes\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn a Time Never Known\u003c/em\u003e, takes place during the American Civil War. Much has been written about this disastrous conflict but not much from the female perspective. My two main characters are female spies working to help the Union win the war, despite the fact that they are both married to Confederate officers. I am hoping to be able to announce a publication date for \u003cem\u003eIn a Time Never Known\u003c/em\u003e very soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the work I have done so far has been exciting and fulfilling, I have learned that I need support for future projects which require more research. Specifically the series, \u003cem\u003eThrough Her Eyes\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0The goal of this series is to tell the stories of pivotal periods in American history as seen through the eyes of the women who lived and participated during that time. The first book in the series will focus on the Civil Rights Movement. You can read why I chose that time period\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://katmichels.com/about/through-her-eyes-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. While I have laid the groundwork for this book in my \"Heroines of History\" articles, I still have copious amounts of research to do in order to properly tell the stories of these amazing women in this tumultuous time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish there were more stories of women in our history, this is your chance to help. Consider making a $10 monthly contribution (about the cost of two coffees here in California) to help share their stories and unveil the influential lives of historic American women to you and future generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me on this journey."
