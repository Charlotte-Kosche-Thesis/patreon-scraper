The reason I started this Patreon is because I need a little help to be able to continue to do work for purely creative reasons and that\u0027s what I hope to accomplish with the income from this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are you going to get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can get access to ALL of my old photo sets. All new work will be posted as it is shot. All work posted to Patreon will be completely uncensored.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a dollar helps! It ALL matters at this point. And frankly, just knowing that there\u0027s people out there willing to offer real support is amazingly motivational by itself. So if a dollar doesn\u0027t sound like much to you then why not give it to me:) I promise I\u0027ll do cool shit with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t afford to pledge anything? Just sharing this page would be massively helpful.\u003cbr\u003e"
