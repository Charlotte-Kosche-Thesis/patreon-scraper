    "summary": "If you\u0027re here, you likely know me or follow me online. Recently I made the huge and probably questionable decision to move to New York City. Just me, a suitcase and a backpack.This was a very last minute and monumental life decision, but one that had to be made. I was living in my home town and had gone through a rough patch and found myself in yet another depressive episode I couldn\u0027t shake. I had toyed with the idea of moving to New York to chase a cornucopia of dreams and opportunity but would always psyche myself out of pulling the proverbial trigger. I laid in bed one night at 2am, browsing airline tickets for fun - as I often times did - and had a surge of confidence that was borderline concussive and bought a one way ticket to NYC for 5 days later. I told nobody I was leaving; and I was gone. Life begins out of your comfort zone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am, in NYC trying to put it all together. I already feel transformed by being here, and have made fast friends with many wonderful people. Now, I\u0027m working two jobs to simply exist, leaving me little time to accomplish what I set out here for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003eWhat I\u0027ve Done:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHost, Panelist, Celebrity Interviewer and Emcee for various comic-cons including but not limited to: PAX Prime, E3, PAX East, SDCC, FSC, Animate!

It\u0027s survival of the fittest here in NYC, but the opportunity and friendship it provides is unparalleled; and i\u0027m no stranger to hard work, and still prefer to work a night job to stay afloat. By not having to work a second job you will be gifting me the time and resources to write, record, stream and subsequently interact and work with you. I\u0027d like any willing Patron to be a part of any of my projects, whether it be my streams, contributing to my book or guesting on my podcast.
