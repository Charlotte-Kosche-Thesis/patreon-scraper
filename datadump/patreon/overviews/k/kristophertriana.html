     "about": "Kristopher Triana is an American author. His works include The Ruin Season, Body Art and Growing Dark. His next horror novel, Full Brutal, is scheduled for release in June of 2018 by Grindhouse Press. Other forthcoming titles include The Detained and Hell is Full of Palm Trees. His fiction has appeared in many magazines, anthologies, audio books and on websites, and has been published in multiple languages. His fiction has drawn praise from Publisher\u2019s Weekly, Rue Morgue Magazine, Cemetery Dance and more. While primarily a horror writer, he also writes crime fiction, literary fiction, southern gothic, noir, westerns, and whatever else his brain sets ablaze.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn in New York in 1977, Triana was yanked down to Florida at the age of nine and was forced to grow up there, much to his chagrin. Luckily he had heavy metal music and John Carpenter movies to get by on. Once he was old enough, he escaped all that pesky sunshine, and since then he has lived up and down the east coast, from New England to the rural Carolinas. He is obsessed with all aspects of the horror genre, and has amassed a staggering collection of cult films, horror books, movie memorabilia, busts and Halloween masks. He also has a very strong love of dogs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe lives in Connecticut with his wife.\u003cbr\u003e",
