    "summary": "I\u0027m so happy to see you here. Yes, YOU! I\u0027ve been offering free support, mentoring, and counselling for rainbow and non-monogamous folks since 2015. I help folks like you explore their gender and sexuality, come out to friends and family, navigate trauma and toxic relationships, have better sex, improve their skills, and be successful in the ways that matter most to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support lets me feed and clothe myself so that I can continue to offer these services for free. I believe that my work must always be accessible to everyone regardless of financial situation. If you think you could benefit from what I offer, please do not hesitate to contact me directly through Patreon or Twitter. If you have questions, see my FAQ below or feel free to ask me directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you basically a counselor? \u003c/strong\u003eYes - however,\u00a0I am hesitant to use the term \u0027counselor\u0027 because I\u0027m not a certified clinical counselor, but with your support I\u0027m hoping to change that soon! If everything goes well, I hope to return to school in 2018 and get my master\u0027s in clinical counselling, to better serve my community. Counseling is not a protected profession in Canada, so I am free to describe myself as a counselor, but I don\u0027t want to accidentally mislead my clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, you\u0027re not certified? How can you counsel people without training? \u003c/strong\u003eI base my therapeutic approach in my own lived experience as a trans, queer, neurodivergent, and mentally ill person. I\u0027ve been in various forms of counselling all my life, and these experiences have helped me develop my own approach independent of formal education, which has proven to be quite effective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have a specialty? \u003c/strong\u003eYes! I specialize in gender, sexuality, and relationships. Most of my clients are exploring their gender or sexuality, improving their relationship or leaving abusive ones, coming out to their friends or family, or exploring non-monogamy. I also help folks learn new skills to tolerate distress, reduce suffering, manage their emotions, and navigate difficult life events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there things you aren\u0027t qualified to treat? \u003c/strong\u003eSadly, yes. I do not offer trauma or grief counselling, nor can I provide psychological assessments for work, school, or medical purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you accept suicidal clients? \u003c/strong\u003eYes. I will only refuse to treat you if I\u0027m not qualified to help you, in which case I will help you find someone who is. I also accept clients who are addicted to substances or self-harm -- I do not insist that someone be \"treating\" their addiction in order to see me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work exactly? \u003c/strong\u003eI encourage folks to book one hour or shorter appointments with me on a recurring or as-needed basis; it\u0027s all about what works best for you. I can provide sessions by phone, video call, or instant messenger, and I will come to your home for a face-to-face session if you live in the Greater Vancouver Area. Keep in mind that counseling is more effective when provided directly, face-to-face. Video chat is an effective substitute, but you may not get the most out of the experience if you choose phone or instant messaging appointments. Just like a traditional counselor, I\u0027ll spend our first appointment getting to know you a little bit, learning about your value and goals, and letting you get to know me as well. The best indicator of therapeutic success is a positive client-practitioner relationship, so it\u0027s important that you feel safe and comfortable with me. If I don\u0027t feel the dynamic fosters a healing environment, I may refer you to another practitioner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much does it cost? \u003c/strong\u003eNothing! There is no fee, no suggested donation, and absolutely no pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI belong to a marginalized group, will I be safe with you? \u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately there\u0027s no such thing as a perfectly safe environment, but your safety is my top priority. I operate within an intersectional, anti-oppressive framework. I use a holistic approach which takes into account the institutions of oppression which may impact my clients. However, there are some experiences I simply cannot speak to - particularly, I\u0027m white. I understand if people of color prefer to work with counselors who share their experiences of racism, and I will happily refer anyone to a counselor of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I hear the experiences of your past clients? \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. I plan on adding a sort of \"testimonials\" section soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be easier to just charge people than to start a Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eYes, it would be much easier. I believe that everyone deserves access to mental healthcare, especially those who can\u0027t afford it. I insist on keeping my services free at the point of access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Patreon is a little weird. Why don\u0027t the rewards have anything to do with counselling? \u003c/strong\u003eI firmly believe everyone deserves access to the same quality of care regardless of their ability to pay. For this reason, there are no special privileges for folks who pledge to my Patreon; everything I offer is already free! Folks pledge to me so I can keep doing the work I do -- selfies, greetings, and photos of my birds are just my small way of saying thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow the hell do I pronounce your name? \u003c/strong\u003eYou are not the first to ask. \"KOR-vin\" is close enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t see my question here. \u003c/strong\u003eNot to worry! Please feel free to ask me directly via Patreon or Twitter (@kaurwn). I\u0027ll do my best to keep this FAQ updated with questions folks have asked me.\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m 27, queer, trans (agender, specifically), autistic, and disabled. I went to school for engineering and worked in water treatment for a year, but it kind of killed my soul. These days I\u0027m working on my health and volunqueering as much as I can; I\u0027m not allowed to work yet. I facilitate peer groups, speak on panels about neurodiversity, all that good stuff. I\u0027m passionate about justice and kindness, and I try to be a feminist and anti-racist ally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m enthusiastically, ethically non-monogamous, body positive, sex positive, and generally just positive. I live with my wife Stefanie and our 2 cockatiels, Jynx and Hector. I love touch, selfies, people, video games, bold lipstick, cute skirts, flowing water, lush green, and cool breezes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in Calgary, but I only ever feel homesick for Nova Scotia. When I pull together my sanity and the funds, I plan to go back to school to become a clinical counselor, so I can better help people like me. I\u0027m trying to make mental health care more accessible, holistic, and a whole buttload more queer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully that tells you a little bit about who I am.
