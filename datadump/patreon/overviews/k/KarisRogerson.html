    "summary": "Hey there, I\u0027m Karis, a writer in New York City with big dreams of writing novels and personal essays that totally rock the world. I write a lot about mental health, because I have depression and it\u0027s my passion to see the world eradicated of stigma, and to help people understand what it\u0027s like living with a mental illness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because, well, my depression is pretty severe. I have once-a-week therapy sessions and am about to join a group therapy group that teaches hands-on, concrete emotional management skills. But these things are expensive, and I don\u0027t always pull in enough money freelancing to pay for it. So you, my patrons, can help! Everything brought in through this medium goes straight to pay for therapy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how this will work: I\u0027m asking for patrons to support me per piece. That means you can pledge to give me as much ($5-10!) or as little ($1 is awesome!) as you want per piece that I publish. So, as soon as a piece is approved and published, I\u0027ll charge you guys for it. This will be helpful when I publish somewhere that doesn\u0027t pay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should know: I write and submit a lot, so feel free to keep your pledges small and absolutely do not hesitate to have a maximum amount \u2014 say, you\u0027ll only contribute two or five times per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the sidebar to see what rewards a patronage will get you! And keep your eyes peeled for an intro video, coming soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
