Thank you for taking a look at my Patreon profile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do my best to make sure that my channel is not only family friendly, but also a positive and safe place for anyone to just hang out and have a good time.  I am also one of the earliest members of the Family Friendly group \u0026amp; team that Kuya_SGA created, and I try to do my best to support the other members of the group with raids, hosts, and anything else that can grow the family friendly community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been streaming 9 times a week since January 2nd of 2017, and the amazing community that has gathered around my channel has been such a wonderful part of my life that I actually enjoy getting out of bed in the morning for my morning streams, and looking forward to the evening streams helps me get through my work day, no matter how difficult the day happens to be.  The people that I spend time with every stream have made me want to be able to dedicate even more time and energy into streaming, hopefully even to the point of going full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be thrilled to get to a point where I can make streaming into a sustainable part-time or full-time job, and I would be extremely grateful to be able to earn enough money to be able to cover the cost of computer upgrades, recording equipment, or even just take my wife on a date to show her how much her support is appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
