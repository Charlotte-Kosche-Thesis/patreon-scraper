    "summary": "Greetings! My name is Kellene.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always written, it\u0027s the way I communicate best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing when I was young, authoring my first novel at the age of 11. It was terrible, but me and my best friend had an incredible time writing our stories and reading to each other. When I was older, and working on my degree in theatre, I wrote my first one woman show, with the help and support of a great teacher who really believed in me and my talent. Shortly after that I was privileged to write and perform the first envisioning monologue to be included in my university\u0027s production of Eve Ensler\u0027s Vagina Monologues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life took me in a different direction for a time, like life does, but I never stopped writing. Several years ago I began writing story-lines for an online role playing community. We wrote some amazing and complex stories together, and it was then that I discovered that more than anything, I truly love telling stories and sharing them with others. After many years of this type of interactive storytelling, and with the encouragement of those that I wrote for, I decided to take it further. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that brings me here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? Because putting together something of quality isn\u0027t cheap. Editors want to be paid, and good research isn\u0027t free. I want to be able to write the best possible story I am capable of for the people who want to read it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy interests are the history and lore of ancient Ireland, and the folklore and folkways of the Irish diaspora in Appalachia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on two projects, both works of folklore fiction. One set in Iron Age Ireland, and the other in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky. Since I currently live in Colorado, it is my goal to travel to each of these places to research and learn more about the lore and folkways of these areas that play large in my own heritage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a short story writer and blogger. Patrons will have free access to my short stories and blogs here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just want to say thank you to those who have encouraged me, and to those who choose to join and support me on this journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
