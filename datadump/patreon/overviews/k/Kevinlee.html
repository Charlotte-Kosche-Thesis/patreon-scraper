    "summary": "The best songs I could write are ready to be recorded and marketed to the world.\u003cbr\u003eThe next step in this campaign since I\u0027m doing a little better, thanks to you and the love of my family and friends, is that I will be now concentrating diligently on a solid \"goal\", and that goal runs deep in my blood; always has since I was a kid. I grew up playing music. And listening to classic country and the music of Hank Williams Jr., Waylon Jennings, Willy Nelson and Merle Haggard. The Bakersfield / Outlaw sound is also coming back. With artists like Whitey Morgan, Cody Jinks, Crooks, Chris Stapleton and others. It\u0027s the best time for me right now to release this new album. It will do great!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt around seven years old I began to play drums, but in order to play drums my school band director made me learn guitar. I join my first band in the seventh grade and we played all original music. I played drums but I learned an incredible amount from the two songwriters in the band. This later helped me begin the process of writing my own songs; when I was 14 I wrote my first song. I played in several other bands in my 20s and I was hired by Roy Rogers Junior and went on tour playing cowboy music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI later recorded two studio albums that did very well. Then I ended up getting into an accident and shattering my spine. It\u0027s taken years of recovery and pain beyond belief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sing, wright; I play acoustic/electric guitars as a country music artist. I play drums and I am a performer and a front man. I can honestly say that I have the full package, and I say that humbly, because what I\u0027ve gone through in the last few years has humbled me to the core. I almost most died and I seriously should not even be writing this. As I recovered, I\u0027ve had one thing on my mind and that is to release my third album.\u00a0Please help the stage once again light up with the songs of Kevin Buchanan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBreak down of where your donations are going:\u003cbr\u003eStudio time\u003cbr\u003eEngineer\u003cbr\u003eMusician session costs\u003cbr\u003eMastering\u003cbr\u003eProducer\u003cbr\u003eGraphic design/Artwork\u003cbr\u003eProduction/Duplication"
