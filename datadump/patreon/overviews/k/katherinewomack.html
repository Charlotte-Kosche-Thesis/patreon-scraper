    "summary": "I was born into a family of makers (my parents are both Lotus-trained car upholsterers\u00a0 - mum now sews absolutely anything from horse rugs to bags for the nosecones of formula 3 cars!), and although I have had many, many jobs, designing and making things is the only thing that really keeps me happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of random jobs (bar work, cleaning, washing up, looking after cats, dressing as a cuddly tiger) I went to train to be a blacksmith. I enjoyed forging metal, but during my training I spent a fair bit of time using a plasma cutter and completely fell in love with it. Now I make lots of little plasma cut things, and sometimes quite big things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also crochet and sew. When I have time and money I crochet rugs (from old duvet covers) and clothes, I\u0027m working on a design for a Japanese-style apron to wear for work, and I\u0027d love to be able to do more textile work. I used to dye my own fabric, but I don\u0027t have the space to do it at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I looking for patrons? I do make money from the things I make, but there never seems to be enough to pay the bills AND reinvest in things I need. My husband has something to do with this - he\u0027s decided to retrain as a blacksmith, so he\u0027s not bringing much money in at the moment but is still spending like he\u0027s a full-time builder! I just can\u0027t seem to hammer \u0027frugality\u0027 into him. I\u0027m happy on dry toast and water as long as I can keep the bills paid and keep making. So I can\u0027t always afford to buy steel to work with, or things that would help me do the other crafts I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy husband and I are moving workshops, from our relatively cheap but still not quite affordable current location to a friend\u0027s workshop, which is much cheaper and has passing trade. Doing textiles in a metalwork shop is not a good idea, and I\u0027ve been done out of my own workspace three times this year. But where we\u0027re going I\u0027ll have a tiny little shed for my textile work, and I need to kit it out with a few more bits and bobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for funding per \u0027thing\u0027. I\u0027m not looking for money to be able to create a single project, I\u0027m looking for a little bit of money to help buy the things I need to make lots of things. so that might be a sheet of steel, a roll of fabric, a few balls of wool, a second-hand tailors dummy, that kind of \u0027thing\u0027. Per \u0027thing\u0027 might seem a bit more unpredictable for your bank account, but i\u0027m not expecting anyone to donate a huge sum of money. A pound (or dollar) contribution per \u0027thing\u0027 goes a long way, and I won\u0027t be producing a \u0027thing\u0027 every couple of weeks.\u00a0 Although if anyone wants to donate a larger amount then I\u0027ll work on a suitable reward for you! My \u0027thing\u0027s won\u0027t cost too much, I\u0027m pretty good at finding bargains - I hate spending more money than is absolutely necessary. If I find myself getting busier then I might change over to \u0027per month\u0027, and everyone will get fair warning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy the way, I\u0027m kinda doing this quickly, and once I get my head around this properly stuff is subject to change!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
