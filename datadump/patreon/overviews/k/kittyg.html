I\u0027ve been doing this for the past 4 and a half years now, and I absolutely love it. I\u0027ve grown a community (there\u0027s over 10,000 of you now which is mid-boggling), gathered friends, had major life changes (for the better) and read a whole heap of books over the course of those years. One thing you may not realise, however, is that so much of the positivity I have comes from your support and comments and happiness. You are honestly the best bunch of people I could ever have asked to meet, and you\u0027re all the ones I am so happy to make videos for. I couldn\u0027t do it without you, and I am so happy you\u0027re here to stay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKitty G\u003cbr\u003exxxx\u003cbr\u003e"
