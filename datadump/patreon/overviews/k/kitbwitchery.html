    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page! My name is Kit B, though you may call me Kitty. A little bit about me: I am a trans femme queer working witch currently situated in Southeast Georgia in the US. I am an artist, a writer, a creator, an activist, an empath, a healer, and a seeker of truths. I am also a person living with sensory sensitivities learning to live the spoonie life and do what work I can to support myself.\u003cbr\u003eBefore I get into what I do, I just want to take a moment to express how incredibly grateful I am for all of you for even taking the time to see who I am and to observe my work. I feel most fulfilled when I am doing my work and bringing messages to all from the Universe and Spirit. This is the work I feel called to do because it helps to connect me to a greater number of people within different communities and I believe my work helps to create a ripple effect of spreading positive energy and healing, thus disrupting cycles of intergenerational trauma and pain that brings about repetitive destructive cycles. In short, I do this work because I want to do my part, however small, to heal the world around me. When we heal ourselves, we help to heal the collective.\u003cbr\u003eSo, what do I do?\u003cbr\u003eWell, when I say working witch, I mean working witch. I have been a practicing witch for over six years now and I am very experienced in giving Tarot readings, Aura readings, and cleansings. I also do what I call Energy Paintings, works of magickal art imbued with specific energies to invoke something within whatever room they hang in. I am currently working on a series of small Energy Paintings called the Guardians series, using images of animals and symbols that people may assign duties as protectors and bringers of awareness. I love doing home cleanses here when I can get business, though as some of you may know, Southeast Georgia isn\u0027t the most spiritually open minded space. \u003cbr\u003eWhat I am offering here on Patreon begins with written details of my Tarot Message of the Day, a segment of videos I do on my Instagram @nonbinaryfaeriewitch which is also where I do a lot of my business currently. I love doing these readings of the day because they\u0027re always different and they always bring very potent messages from Spirit about what we all need to keep in mind for each day and moving forward. I like to switch it up sometimes by using different decks, switching between speaking and writing out the translations of the messages received, etc. I will be writing up these readings on here for you all to read and so you can get a bit of deeper insight into the readings (and also because I do not presently have the means to make videos on here directly). \u003cbr\u003eI will also be writing up some posts about magick and how we interact with it here and there in daily life, sort of like blog posts.\u003cbr\u003eI will be offering some fun deals for my patrons, especially those who pour more into my work. Some examples of these may be personal single card readings, a personalized magickal art piece for big spenders, and other readings and services that I deem appropriate. I am going to go ahead and attach a full list of my services and prices below so that you may see them and be aware of them. The best way to contact me is, again, through my Instagram @nonbinaryfaeriewitch or through my email cherrywitch3@gmail.com. \u003cbr\u003eIf you already follow me on Instagram, you will notice that some new services have been added and some changes have been made to prices. So, here they all are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSingle Card Reading - $10\u003cbr\u003eThree Card Reading - $20\u003cbr\u003eStandard Reading (Tarot, Runes, Aura) - $40\u003cbr\u003eLove Life Reading - $50\u003cbr\u003e12-Card 12-Month Reading via email - $80\u003cbr\u003eAura Cleansing - In person $30; Distance $40\u003cbr\u003eMagickal Art (mixed media) - $30\u003cbr\u003eEnergy Paintings - large $25; small Guardians $18\u003cbr\u003eHome Cleansing (in Southeast GA and Northeast FL) - $150 starting price\u003cbr\u003eSpell/Energy Work - $75 starting; negotiable\u003cbr\u003eHandmade Wands (few in stock) - $25\u003cbr\u003ePower Poems - $12\u003cbr\u003eAnd there you have it!

If you ever have any questions about my services or would like to schedule a reading with me, please feel free to send me a dm via Instagram or an email and I will get back to you as soon as I can! And again, thank you all for taking the time to observe me and my work. I look forward to creating great things here and throughout my work.
