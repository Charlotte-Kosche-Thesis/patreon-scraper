Sketches, full paintings, speedarts. I love to do lots of fanart, because I\u0027m a lot of a geek :D I also try to draw some of my own character, but never have enough time to develop this.. I often experiment with my own workflow, as a strive for the most effective and most efficient breakdown of how I work.\u00a0These experiments can be found in .PSD\u0027s and step-by-step process images, that I\u0027m going to be sharing \n\u003cstrong\u003ewith my patrons only.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eabout my Patreon page:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nPatreon is a wonderful opportunity for everyone to get closer to me better and to learn my little secrets.

I loved animals, nature and I loved to draw animals, which still lasts after many-many years. My style is flexible, I don\u0027t like to cage myself within a particular set of characteristics in my art, I would rather call myself an explorer. I like to explore how art can reflect what is happening inside of me. I love designing things and that is why I become an artist. Because true explorations gives about a tonne of details emerging from the deep fantasies.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow I ask for YOUR help to make my dream come true and let me do art full time, to create more awesome stuff for available for you. \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eIf we would reach $2.500 a month\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, I would be able to do art full time, thus producing \u003cstrong\u003etonnes of content\u003c/strong\u003e, which means more perks for my supporters.
