Something I\u0027d accepted as my path since a kid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first year on this platform has been incredible, and nothing short of a miracle for a freelance artist. After much consideration, however, I\u0027ve accepted that until my illustration, story telling and comic book design improve, this campaign is best served showcasing my photography which the majority of my audience knows me for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to share all new edits from some of my favorite shoots with Vintage Vandalizm, Gia Genevieve, Doris Mayday, Masuimi Max, Cherry Dollface, Inkmaster winner Ryan Ashley and some of the biggest named models in the industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your pledges and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram @kommienezuspadt\u003cbr\u003eSnapChat @madeineighty\u003cbr\u003ewww.steemit.com/@kommienezuspadt\u003cbr\u003e"
