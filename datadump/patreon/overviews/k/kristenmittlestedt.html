    "summary": "Yo Friends! I\u0027m Kristen of Kristen Mittlestedt Photography. I graduated with my BFA in Fine Art Photography, from Ball State University in 2012. Come May 2018, I\u0027ll have been in business as a wedding and fine art photographer for 7 years. I\u0027ve been experimenting and exploring photography most of my life, and could not be more excited to have it as a career! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat are my goals here?\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eSimple.

While keeping things funky fresh, I\u0027ll educate you in my style. It may not always be the technically correct way, but it\u0027s how I roll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere are my donations going? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eTruth be told, I\u0027ve been in a massive mental slump the past 2 years, and haven\u0027t created as much art as I\u0027ve wanted. I became a business machine and cranked out edits for clients at a mundane and methodical pace, only occasionally doing personal work. I\u0027ve finally dived back into photography as art, my true passion. Unfortunately, creating personal shoots cost money. Your money is going to support my creations, and ultimately more content here for you to learn and enjoy! \u003cbr\u003e"
