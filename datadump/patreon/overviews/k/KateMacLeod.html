I\u0027ve joined the Patreon site to create a purposeful way of involving more people within the circle of my career and to bring to life music projects that I have in motion. My latest recording, Deep in the Sound of Terra, has been released and is garnering some spectacular reviews, along with some dedicated airplay by DJs across the country. \u003cbr\u003eHere are some of the things being said about this recording...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"One of the most ambitious and unusual fiddle\nalbums of the year.\" \u003cbr\u003eRambles.net\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Folkie, instrumental taken to the max, this is\nas hot as it gets.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eChris Spector, Midwest Record\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work includes a variety of wonderful opportunities to share music with people that include community concerts, music festivals, conferences, libraries, workshops, music lessons, school programs, fundraisers, and playing for nonprofit organizations such as Heart and Soul which brings music to people in hospitals, convalescent centers, senior centers, schools, and rehabilitation centers. The many places that I perform, both stateside and internationally, make it impossible to describe how many wonderful places I\u0027m able to share music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to perform when requested, despite differing performance payment budgets, because I believe that music is good for people, and I attempt to play wherever people invite me. This site can make it possible for me to continue my practice of being generous with the music. That in addition to performing in public venues and events, I can to go places where I have humanitarian effects. I also take extra time in my teaching and mentoring of players, so that my work is beyond an appointment, or a scheduled lesson time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have completed since the start of this patreon page...\u003cbr\u003e--A songbook with music notation and lyrics, 50 of my original songs.\u003cbr\u003e--My full-length violin/fiddle recording, Deep in the Sound of Terra. \u003cbr\u003e--Thanks to the supporters through this page I\u0027ve been able to purchase some equipment I\u0027ve needed for my projects and touring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUpcoming projects in the making are... \u003cbr\u003e--A music book with melody and chords, for the music on Deep in the Sound of Terra. This is planned to be released in 2018 as a follow-up and in support of the recording. Melody instruments, as well as guitarists, will be able to use this book. \u003cbr\u003e\n--A full-length recording of music inspired by the Colorado Plateau and the region of Utah and the West. This project has already begun in the recording studio. \u003cbr\u003e--A full-length recording of peace-motivating and inspirational music composed during my 2018 Artist-in-Residence time at Pendle Hill Quaker Retreat, in Pennsylvania. I will be spending twelve weeks at Pendle Hill, in research and composition time. There will be a concert featuring the music at the end of my residency at both Pendle Hill, and in Salt Lake City, UT. \u003cbr\u003e\n--Performances ARE ONGOING, visit my performance calendar at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.katemacleod.com/tourdates\"\u003ewww.KateMacLeod.com/tourdates\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m a composer, performer and recording artist. \u003cbr\u003eA guitarist, vocalist and violinist/fiddler.\u003cbr\u003eMusic has grown to be my primary focus after years of gaining experience, raising a family, and working for others. Now, I make music full time. \u003cbr\u003eI create music for you, and so I want it to connect with you. \u003cbr\u003eThrough this site I look forward to sharing new pieces of music, my experiences as a working artist, and updates on how projects are coming together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music I create is eclectic in style and form, but fits well within the label of Americana. My songs have been recorded by other artists from California to the Czech Republic, in roots music genres such as Americana, Bluegrass, Folk, Celtic and Instrumental. \u003cbr\u003eIn my compositions I always hope to gather \"us\" ...our stories, our experiences, our relationships with each other and the natural world. \u003cbr\u003eIn addition to songs with lyrics,\u00a0I also compose music for the violin. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to performing my own music, you can find me performing with others in concerts and on recordings, and sometimes lending my hand as a producer for other peoples\u0027 work. I also teach music lessons privately and within workshop formats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMollie O\u0027Brien, one of the most respected vocalists in acoustic music, says...\u003cbr\u003e\"Both Lark in the Morning and Alaska made the cut for my debut, Tell It True. And ever since then I can count on only two hands the number of times I\u0027ve not included them in my performances. They are wonderful songs, great stories, fun to sing, and have become audience favorites as well.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy have I chosen a \u0027monthly\u0027 instead of the \u0027by creation\u0027 plan on this site?\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause as patrons on the monthly plan, you\u0027ll have access to information about what I\u0027m creating, while keeping your support amount easy to remember and keep track of. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of the projects I\u0027m working on require time, technical equipment, musical instrument upkeep and purchases, promotional work, videos, manufacturing and the\u00a0hiring of quality specialists. \u003cbr\u003eMy recordings and 50-song songbook are easily found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.waterbug.com/wordpress/product-category/macleod-kate/\"\u003eWaterbug Records\u003c/a\u003e, in Glen Ellyn, IL. \u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to my work, I recommend \u003cem\u003eAt Ken Sanders Rare Books\u003c/em\u003e, a collection of songs inspired by books, \u003cem\u003eBlooming\u003c/em\u003e, a recording of my songs produced by Grammy-winning Americana musician Tim O\u0027Brien, and my new instrumental CD, \u003cem\u003eDeep in the Sound of Terra\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA great way to learn about me is through my website at \u003ca href=\"https://www.katemacleod.com\"\u003ewww.KateMacLeod.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon funds collected through this site go straight through Paypal to the projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes a village to raise a musician. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHelp keep the music on the move...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
