By pledging to me on patreon, you not only help me through these hard times but you also allow me to continue to create content on youtube as well as giving me the chance, to devote more time towards working on my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to emphasize that I do not want you in anyway, to feel as if you MUST pledge to me if you like my videos. This page is only for those who wish to go the extra mile in supporting just another content creator, amongst the sea of the millions of other online content creators. To all of my viewers reading this, I cannot thank you enough. It is because of your support on youtube, that I can do what I love doing in life while managing to power through my back injury and receive an education. And to those of you who do decide to support me through patreon, my gratitude again, cannot be put into words. Your support will always be appreciated, and again, I can\u0027t thank you enough for your guys\u0027 support, whether if it is through a like, share, or pledge, I am truly grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "One thing that I would love to do is to be able to do a machinima at least once every 2 months rather than every 4-6 months. Machinimas are hilariously fun to make, and I love seeing your guys\u0027 comments/reactions. However, machinimas take so long to do and are rarely ever worth the effort due to the time and effiort devoted to each one. If we meet the goal of $250 per month, then I will upload a machinima once every 2 months, since I can spend less time cranking out regular videos on a normal uploading schedule, and instead, focus on working on a machinima instead.\u00a0",
