     "about": "Born 1957 in Philadelphia, Kevin Roth was a child \nprodigy, playing the pianoby ear from the age of three. At thirteen he \ndiscovered the mountain dulcimer and fell in love with its sound and \npeaceful quality. \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eI first saw the \ndulcimer at a meditation gathering\u2026It was love at first sight. The \nsimplicity of sound, the elegance in the hourglass shape cedar and \nwalnut woods, as well as the heart-shaped sound holes announced itself \nas my musical soul mate.\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough the traditional music of the dulcimer is \nsimple, Kevin\u2019s musical background and interests ranged from Peter, Paul\n and Mary, to jazz,classical, and world music. He followed his calling \nand developed a style of dulcimer playing completely his own. \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eMy\n generation was more rock and roll, but I tended to lean always towards \nthe more thought-provoking \u2018confessional\u2018 type artists. I had played the\n piano by ear since the age of three, and studied voice at about the age\n of twenty. My voice teacher told me at my first lesson \u2018Singing is \nemotional, physical, mental and spiritual.\u2019 She was right. That \nphilosophy and truth stuck with me my entire life.\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nThis unique sound caught the ear of Moses Asch, \nlegendary founder and director of Folkways/Smithsonian Records, who \nsigned Kevin in 1974, to what would become a twelve-album deal. Kevin \nquickly became known around the world as a leading innovative dulcimer \nplayer. \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eThe truth is, I used and still \nuse the dulcimer more like a canvas and never stick to any rule. In fact\n I run from them. I knew of no limits except for a few chromatic notes \nmissing here and there due to the dulcimer being modal. Less was more in\n my book and I searched for meaning within it\u2019s simplicity. My song \nwriting began as a much needed expression and release of how I was \nfeeling and what I was searching for. I tried to find out where the song\n and my feelings lived\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the early eighties, Kevin began to write, record, \nand perform for children. His music career skyrocketed as he produced \naward-winning albums and made numerous television and concert \nappearances. He sang the theme song to the hit PBS/FOX television show, \n\u2018Shining Time Station\u2019, based on the character of Thomas the Tank \nEngine. Kevin has recorded for Sony Music, Random House, National \nGeographic, and the Book-of-the-Month Club, to name a few. \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eThe\n dulcimer was like a small boat to carry me to the other side. Since a \nyoung kid I was always aware of \u2018something bigger\u2019 going on in life \nwhich I could never see, or put my finger on. I was drawn to the \nspiritual, mystical side of thought from about thirteen onward. Like it \nor not, it\u2019s my nature. What I do on the dulcimer now some forty-six \nyears later is constantly search for the muse in the music.\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nHis concert, radio and television appearances along \nwith his recordings have carried him across the country and abroad, \nperforming in solo and symphony concerts, music festivals, and two \nappearances at the White House. His entire Folkways collection is now \npart of the Smithsonian Folkways label. \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eI\n have never practiced a day in my life. Honestly. I always just played. \nNever the same song the same way twice. I have taught students this way \nas well. More a loner, and never into cliques, I follow the muse and \nwatch with curiosity as to what the Cosmos brings my way in answer to \nthe question: Who am I? Both musically, and lyrically\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nKevin joined forces in 2006 with his long-time \nmentor, Noel Paul Stookey of Peter, Paul \u0026amp; Mary, to record a \ncollection of songs based on original artwork.The resulting CD/DVD \ncollaboration, \u2018Between the Notes\u2019, garnered rave reviews and his art \nand music were premiered at the San Diego Museum of Art. Several years \nlater he began work on a new project of mostly original songs revealing \nhis inner-reflection about love, loss, hope and discovery.\u201c\u003cstrong\u003e\u2018Awakenings\u2019\n was the first album of its kind for me in the sense I began to explore \nmy relationship with spirituality on a deeper level musically. Many \nthings had changed during that year. I was still getting over the end of\n a nine year relationship, as well as closing my business, and dealing \nwith the loss of my father who was also my best friend. It was a tough \nyear.\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nOne evening in 2015, around ten thirty at night, \nKevin\u2019s cell phone rang. It was Noel driving home from a concert. He had\n been listening to the early demos from \u2018Awakenings\u2019 and, although \npreviously recorded, Stookey suggested that the songs deserved \nre-recording with a more \u2018supportive ambiance\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\nHe also convinced Kevin that he should write additional material for the\n new album which became titled most appropriately: \u2018Reawakening\u2019. \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eI\n wasn\u2019t overly eager truth to tell, but something said, \u2018give it a try\u2019.\n I was simply amazed at the amount of new material that flowed out of me\n that seemed almost channeled. The songs emerged from deep reflection, \nmeditation and a new awareness that began to unfold that quite honestly I\n didn\u2019t think I was prepared for. But as the saying goes, when the \nstudent is ready, the teacher shows up!\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nStookey then contacted keyboardist/arranger Michael \nMcInnis who, according to Kevin \u201cseemed to crawl into each song, find \nout where it lived and come up with beautiful arrangements\u2026\u201d Working via\n the internet for the better part of a year from their separate \nresidences and studios in California, Maine and Missouri, the album \n\u2018Reawakening\u2019 unfolded in a most beautiful and cosmic way. \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eI\n always wondered why I had such an obsession with Peter, Paul and Mary \nstarting at the age of five. Nearly fifty years later, it would all come\n around full circle, and I now understand what consciousness had in mind\n (so far). Working with Noel\u2019s insights, guidance as a producer, and \nenthusiasm was wonderful. Hearing Michael McInnis\u2019s colorings were \namazing. In a world where the awareness of who we are and what our \nhearts are longing for continues to call to us ever stronger, I hope \nthese songs will reawaken the answer that is within each of us\u003c/strong\u003e.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201c\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cAwakenings\u201d is  a beautiful album. The words. The music. The voice. Jaw droppingly beautiful\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201d \u2013 Noel Paul Stookey  ( Peter, Paul \u0026amp; Mary)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201c\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWas it through the third or fourth encore, you had the audience totally under your spell\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201d \u2013 Grand Opera House, Wilmington DE.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201c\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eKevin has an unbelievable talent that combines melodies and lyrics that sink into your soul\u003c/em\u003e\u201d \u2013 Jake Adams- Big Daddy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201c\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHis music is thought provoking. \nHis mellifluous voice and dulcimer playing is both rare and enchanting. \nHis body of work is proof there\u2019s something magnificent still going on\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201d. \u2013 Phila Inquirer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
