I originally started creating videos as a way to overcome social anxiety I had as a teenager. It has since grown alongside my passion for gaming into a near livable job. I have put great effort into my work. Uploading as much as 5 videos (almost 2 hours of content!) per day. And I have to thank my amazing viewers for this success I have had.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 But now I must tell you why I have started a Patreon and why I am asking for donations. Unfortunately my continued growth and success on Youtube has come at the end of a golden age. Adblock use is on the rise and googles inflexible policies has driven away advertisers and reduced CPM ($ per 1000 views) significantly. I believe that my audience is well educated and that providing information is the best way to handle this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAdblock\u003c/h2\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Adblock use has been on the rise year after year. Seeing the most significant increase this year with 61 MILLION new Adblock users. A 41% increase. People laugh at the idea of an adblock crisis where so many users use Adblock that ad supported models fall apart. Unfortunately the crisis has begun. This is why you have seen so many Youtuber\u0027s go to services like Patreon. If these trends continue we will see many more being forced to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/ac367bb5daabd95050a07e8ff16fa8bc.png\" style=\"width: 583px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Now. Adblocking gets even worse specifically for gaming. On Average through gaming we see a 26.5% adblock rate. These statistics get even more frightening when we start going to sub-cultures of games. While I don\u0027t have statistics available for them all. I would put Strategies and Grand Strategies among the top because of increased tech literacy required to play those kinds of games. Modern Paradox games (Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron 3) Still require clearing map caches among other things. This leads to problems. Currently on my channel the Adblock rate is roughly \u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e41%. \u003c/b\u003eThis has understandable reduced my ability to use solely ad based revenue.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/b2ac92e9de3e5fe1461e0d328707e0f9.png\" style=\"width: 624px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a chart of \u0027views\u0027 vs \u0027ad\u0027s being shown to people\u0027 70% of people on my channel do not view ads for various reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/1e6ebdf303a47de393e9c9a41cba2f6e.png\" style=\"width: 621px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Shortfall Of Google \u0026amp; Youtube\u003c/h1\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 In addition the increased use of adblock. Ad based revenue has run into another problem. Google\u0027s inflexible policies. We often hear of them talked about in relations to copyright and how they affect youtubers. However they also have many the same problem when dealing with advertisers. In particular they prevent larger advertisers from using their own software for view verification and are just kinda expected to trust google on it. Which is unique to google. On almost any other ad service you can run 3rd party verification (To say make sure your ad views are not being counted if the user is adblocking...) This has caused some major scale pullbacks from google ads. Including major brands like Kellogg\u0027s. Here is an article on it if you\u0027d like to read more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/brands-check-publishers-ad-viewability-math/298746/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://adage.com/article/digital/brands-check-publ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0 As Google ads are based on auction style selling. This has created some devastating effects. If you talk to any Youtuber they talk about how bad the CPM ($ per 1000 views) is. But often not how bad it really is. In 2013 the CPM was $2.5-$3. For the first time ever this year the CPM dropped below $1. So not only are fewer people viewing ads. We are getting less per ad. Sometimes as much as a third as we used to. This has caused Youtube to increase their share of the ad revenue. In 2013 it was 40% as of the time of writing. It has increased to 55%.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eIn Conclusion\u003c/h1\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Every issue I have listed here has compounded to create a situation where I have decided to seek a secondary source of funding. Leaving me 2 options. Sponsorship by viewers. Sponsorship by companies. I feel that allowing company\u0027s to sponsor the channel presents significant risk to the health of the channel. As I may be forced into doing less the moral things in order to keep afloat. I get offers on a weekly basis to do things that are downright illegal under the FCC\u0027s guidelines. I think everyone would agree it is better if I don\u0027t have to consider these offers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition. Patreon gives me a hidden benefit of being able to games I previously had to say no to because of copyright issues. Currently the following game series are not featured on my channel due to copyrighted music being featured in them\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTropico\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCivilization\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnno\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAge of Mythology\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 If I am not dependent on ad revenue solely you will get to see more games of such variety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0All in all I hope I have presented an excellent case for my use of Patreon and hope I have convinced you to support me in my continued endeavours into Youtube."
