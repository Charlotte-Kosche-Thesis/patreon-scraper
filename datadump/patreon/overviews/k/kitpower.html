For that reason, in July, the \u0027Talking Robocop with Kit Power\u0027 podcast is launching. Every month, I will release a conversational podcast where a guest and I watch the movie Robocop and chat. This podcast will work either as a commentary track for the movie, or as a stand alone conversation.

This is isn\u0027t a cheap way to get my work - almost everything I\u0027ve ever produced is either free or can be gotten for free, if you\u0027ve a mind to. But this is the ONLY way to get \u003cstrong\u003eearly access\u003c/strong\u003e - to the podcasts, to early drafts of my novels, to my works in progress. If that kind of peak behind the curtain appeals, I think you\u0027re going to like it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first show is in the bag, and I have many brilliant and exciting guests lined up from all over podcasting, the indie horror scene, and elsewhere. If the sound of this project excites you, please consider a small donation to help keep it afloat - rewards start from as little as $1 a month, and include early access to both the podcasts and my monthly My Life In Horror series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest in my work."

I have to say this up front, to cover my ass - what I am saying is that if I use your suggestion , you do NOT get to come back and sue my ass for royalties down the line. By\u00a0making\u00a0this pledge you are confirming\u00a0you understand that, and are promising that you surrender any and all copyright claims on comments you make on my manuscript. If that makes you uncomfortable,\u00a0please\u00a0do not pledge at\u00a0this\u00a0level (and if you want to\u00a0collaborate\u00a0on something, get\u00a0in\u00a0touch - I\u0027m approachable!). Comments may (and, mostly, will) be deleted by me once I\u0027ve read them, regardless of if I act on them or not. If I don\u0027t understand a comment, I may ask for clarification, or I may not. I reserve the right to remove someone from this\u00a0level\u00a0if I deem they are being spammy/abusive (if I do that, I will refund that month\u0027s pledge money). This is an\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to act as a\u00a0beta reader for a work in progress, in other words. I want it to feel\u00a0like\u00a0a cool, fun thing. If it doesn\u0027t feel\u00a0like\u00a0it would be that,\u00a0again,\u00a0please\u00a0don\u0027t pledge. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, on the second bullet point - I anticipate two books\u00a0being\u00a0published this year (a novella collection with The\u00a0Sinister\u00a0Horror\u00a0Company, and a self published short story collection), and two\u00a0next year (My Life In Horror Vol. 1, and the current work in progress). This is not a binding commitment. It may be less. It may,\u00a0just\u00a0conceivably, be more. To state the painfully obvious; this does not represent a cost effective way to subscribe to my print books, even signed copies. It\u0027s\u00a0just\u00a0another way for me to say thank you for supporting me in my work. Also,\u00a0this\u00a0will only apply to books I am the sole\u00a0author of, not anthologies/magazines that I appear in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the third bullet point - schedule permitting, and you\u0027ll have to buy your own copy of the film (I\u0027ll buy my copy for the podcast, if I need to do so).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
