    "summary": "Since I published my first book in 1999, the publishing\nlandscape has gone through upheaval after upheaval. It\u2019s been like one of those\ndisaster movies where giant earthquakes lead to tsunamis that lead to alien\ninvasion that lead to zombies that lead to three-headed squirrel fish and\nnobody knows how to inject the right virus into the alien computer except Will\nSmith, and Will Smith is busy doing Important Message Films and therefore we\u2019re\nall doomed, I tell you, doomed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve had some modest success while all these things were\nhappening, but in the process I\u2019ve set aside project after project that I\nreally wanted to work on in favor of projects I felt were more commercially\nviable. (Not that they necessarily were, but that\u2019s another story.) So I have\nall these ideas jumping around vying for attention I can\u2019t give them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have older stories, newer stories, and stories that\nhaven\u2019t been written yet that I\u2019d love to share with readers. Most if not all\nof these don\u2019t fit into the genres I\u2019ve been publishing in for the last several\nyears. They\u2019re fantasy, science fiction, and urban fantasy. They\u2019re short\nstories, flash fiction, novelettes, novellas, and full-length novels. They\u2019re\nstandalones and ongoing series, all stories that just don\u2019t quite fit. Some of\nthem were actually published, but literally only sold in single digits. (It\nhappens. See unavailability of Will Smith, above.) Think of it as the Island of\nMisfit Stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019d like to invite you to the island (though it looks a lot\nlike a door covered in sticky notes) and share as many of these stories as I\ncan. I\u2019d like to write more of the things that are calling me to be written that\naren\u2019t contemporary/paranormal and/or erotic romance. I\u2019ll start with some free\npieces in the blog area here, so you can get an idea of what you\u2019re signing on\nfor, if you so choose. As the journey continues, I hope to be able to commit to at least a story a month, or even two. There\u0027ll be special edition e-book and paperback collections, and extras like artwork and eventually audio books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m not going to do a monthly-type Patreon, because\nsometimes I get tied up in huge projects that require me to focus for several\nweeks at a time on only those projects. (These usually pay pretty well, so it\u2019s\nworth falling a bit off the grid.) Instead I\u2019ll just go by individual \u201cThing,\u201d\nand I\u2019ll do the Things as often as I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u2019ll be a fun ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you\u2019ll join me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith sincerest gratitude,\u003cbr\u003e\nKatriena Knights\u003cbr\u003e\n\naka KC Myers\u003cbr\u003e\n\naka crazywritinfool\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eP.S. \u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind that Patreon allows you to set an upper limit on how much \nyou spend per month. So if I were to go nuts and write six Things in one\n month, and you\u0027re pledged at $10 per thing, you can top your monthly \nfee at $10 so you don\u0027t all of a sudden get hit with $60. That could be annoying, and the last thing I want anybody to be is annoyed with me as I am a delicate flower. Be sure to \ncheck out this feature before you finalize anything.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
