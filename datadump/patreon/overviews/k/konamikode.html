Eventually I tried my hand at \nfanfiction in high school which I promptly ended up attempting to \ndestroy all traces of when I decided to go back and reread it for \nfunsies in 2014. Coincidentally, this was when I took a shot at \u003cem\u003equesting\u003c/em\u003e and it has become a new labor of love that I spend much of my time on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\n strengths lie in character interaction, WAFF, and a dabbling of smut. \nAlso feelz. I wrote a puppy story once. Many people cried.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d \nfigured with as much time as I spend on writing, I could use this as a \npart-time gig. So whether you are just perusing or thinking about \nbecoming a patron and donating to my liquor/rent fund, welcome to Kona\u0027s\n feelz train where the slice of life is excellent and the heartbreak, \ndawful~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the the fanwork I create is free of charge and Patreon commissions will be available to all after ten days :3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for dropping by whether you\u0027re just here to check things out or if you decide to donate to the Kona fund \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those curious much of my content is on Sufficient Velocity, Questionable Questing, and Space Battles!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a link to my current quest:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/heroes-in-a-half-shell-tmnt-marvel.45575/\"\u003eHeroes In a Half-Shell\u003c/a\u003e: Fifteen years before the alien invasion of New York City and the formation of the Avengers, one Hamato Yoshi immigrated with his family to Manhattan to start a new life.

Lost, alone, and seething with fury, the relatively young rat makes his living in the sewers and streets of Manhattan for several months when he suddenly discovers four baby turtles struggling within a pool of glowing green ooze.
