Way back in the 80s, we used to\n spend as much of our weekends and vacations as we could in our \nbasement, composing and practicing songs for 8-10 hours at a stretch, \nand loving and cherishing every moment of it.  We would write and \npractice new songs dozens of times, time and again, honing the music \ndown to get just the right mood, just the right feeling, just the exact \nsequence of chords and lyrics.  It was our ultimate joy to create, \nshape, and complete songs that expressed exactly what was inside of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129719/files/20150103174215-kats2.jpg?1420335735\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLeft to right, Drummer Rachid Bouzid, Lead Vocalist and Guitarist, Mo Bouzid, and Bassist, Ahmed Bouzid, Madrid, Spain, 1981\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\n never received any formal musical training, never took any classes in \nplaying an instrument, never learned how to read music -- but we loved \nmusic, and, most importantly, loved \u003cstrong\u003ecreating and putting music together\u003c/strong\u003e.
