I enjoy blending multiple genres and tossing in a monster or two for good measure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I do a lot of genre experimentation, you can often find me in the \u0027lab\u0027 on Wattpad as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/user/krazydiamond\"\u003eKrazydiamond.\u003c/a\u003e Wattpad is a free platform for writers and readers. It is a fine place to see what works and what doesn\u0027t, and my quirky style has done well there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince launching my first story on Wattpad, I have been a featured writer twice, received two Watty Awards for excellence in digital story telling, and signed on for the Wattpad Stars Program. Currently I have 23 various works on wattpad, including 4 complete novels in rough draft and numerous short stories. It is a great jumping pad to immerse yourself in my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write off Wattpad and have published several novelettes this year in various anthologies. I am a wife, and a mother of two beautiful boys on the spectrum. Every day is challenging, every day is rewarding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DTDqMCA.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, thank you for your contribution and joining my creative community. \u003cbr\u003eThe monthly goal is set to represent roughly the income I would receive working part time, on top of writing and being a mum. (Skills to pay the bills, and write gloriously, epic tales.) Right now, our bills and living expenses eat up a little more income than we bring in. Our living situation makes it incredibly difficult to maintain a steady secondary income.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEventually, this financial goal may change depending on the success and prospects of other projects but for now its purpose is \u0027living wage\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KK6FMXk.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Wattpad I have three to four major projects going at all times, and several experimental stories/ side projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe current big projects I am working on are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEdgewise\u003c/strong\u003e- A 2016 Watty Award Winning Science Fiction Novel (In Progress)\u003cbr\u003eThe Edgewise exists everywhere and nowhere. A sanctuary to all realms, should you find the door. Managed  by one Macklemore Edgewise, proprietor, guardian of the between places, and barman of mystery. \u003cbr\u003e  If the tavern accepts you, abide by the rules.\u003cbr\u003e  1. Leave all conflicts outside. \u003cbr\u003e  2. No murdering one another. Occasional maiming and righteous wounding exempt.\u003cbr\u003e  3. Never leave the door open.

Magic is feared and reviled, but rooted deep in the bloodlines of families, cropping up once a generation. These individuals are cast out, banished to the Above where humans are far, far down the food chain.\u003cbr\u003eWhen her younger brother is tainted by magic and forced to the surface, Azzy follows, determined to save the only family she has left, no matter what he becomes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eZombies vs Aliens\u003c/strong\u003e- a formerly featured science fiction novel (Completed).

Just ask zombie Li, who wakes up after a quick bite. \u003cbr\u003eThe world is a wasteland, she\u0027s a walking corpse, and her \u0027snack\u0027 melted into a noxious puddle of goo. It\u0027s not her day. Determined to figure out what the hell happened to her world, Li hits the road, seeking others like herself.\u003cbr\u003eThe end of the world brings strange company, and stranger enemies. Struggling to wrap her head around being a zombie and already Li\u0027s existence is in danger thanks to impending alien invasion. It\u0027s going to take more than a handful of quirky zombies to stop them. She\u0027s going to need some serious fire power, like the remnants of the human race.
