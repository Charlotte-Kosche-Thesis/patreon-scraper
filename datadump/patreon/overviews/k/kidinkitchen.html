I write all the episodes, pick the menu and do all the cooking in each episode. \u00a0My dad runs the cameras and does the final edits. With my approval. This year, we want to make more videos and we could use your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HCyv-2EEUEc?feature=player_detailpage\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s573/Johnewilliamson/Kid_in_kitchen/IMG_0846_zpsef3c4bcc.jpg\" style=\"width: 226px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s573/Johnewilliamson/Kid_in_kitchen/IMG_0829_zps910671de.jpg\" style=\"width: 226px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qdgtRcw1zqI?feature=player_detailpage\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is the Money going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe money goes into food, production, charity, and a culinary school tuition fund.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nCulinary School Tuition Fund: \u003c/strong\u003eI want to go to Culinary School when I am old enough. These videos are how I intend help pay for it. Lemonade Stand money only goes so far. Plus my dad tells me I should get a Business Degree first. That is a lot of books and knives to buy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nProduction:\u003c/strong\u003e My dad has some equipment, but some pieces we need to borrow for each episode. Some funds for a new lens and additional light would improve the look of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nFood for the videos:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 We try not to waste. Much of the time, but not always, we do try to eat the food I cook for dinner. But sometimes a new recipe doesn\u0027t work out. \u00a0Funds from Patreon will help me be able to experiment with more creative recipes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiving: \u003c/strong\u003eI never forgot one of the key lessons of Kindergarten: Sharing. We already give time and money to charities, but when we hit specific goals on Patreon, we will share some of that as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaxes and Fees: \u003c/strong\u003eaccording to my dad, about 20-30% of all money raised will go into covering transaction fees and taxes. Patreon, Paypal, Vimeo, IRS all take a \"piece of the action\" as my dad says.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s573/Johnewilliamson/Kid_in_kitchen/IMG_0836_zps7ba6cfc3.jpg\" style=\"width: 348px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s573/Johnewilliamson/Kid_in_kitchen/10346050_10153187368163504_5613635506763026369_n_zps5ebcd22d.jpg\" style=\"width: 130px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a kid who loves to cook and wants to share that enthusiasm with young and old alike. \u00a0Cooking is fun, fast, healthy and easy if you pick the right recipes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is like a tip jar. If you like what I am doing, you can drop in a buck or two (or more). The fact that Patreon allows you to create  a subscription if you will, makes you a Supporter of the Arts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nEven users with hundreds of thousands of YouTube subscribers do not make enough money from YouTube to focus on their videos.

As this is a US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.

If you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you if need to donate less that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want.
