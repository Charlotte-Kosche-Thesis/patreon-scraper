From being diagnosed bipolar in my teens, I truly understand the power that music therapy has as a tool to recover from illness and maintain a balanced life. For me, it was, and still is, a godsend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to enrich the lives of others through music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis entails recording, creating videos, and performing live for a variety of audiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy upcoming album, filled with wondrous musings, will easily entrance with playful instrumentals and awakening harmonies. Im now reaching out to ask for support in the creation process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s such a beautiful thing to have music free and at a our fingertips in a moments notice, but this also makes it harder for musicians to continue creating content when the revenue is hard to come by. With your help, I can record new music, tour, and continue the growth of my musical career. By becoming a patron of the arts you are becoming an important piece of the 21st century\u0027s evolution of music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are changing how we support musicians in response to the unlimited access to free content.
