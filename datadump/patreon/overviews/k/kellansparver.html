    "summary": "I write stories.  Sometimes they\u0027re science fiction or fantasy, depending on how you squint and turn your head.  Sometimes they\u0027re just little bits of life, mine or someone else\u0027s.  Sometimes they\u0027re weird and misshapen. Here are a couple:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://kellansparver.com/2014/05/02/fiction-hitchhiker/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Hitchhiker\"\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://kellansparver.com/2013/04/27/the-fun-police/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"The Fun Police\"\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://kellansparver.com/fiction/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eother stories\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI submit these stories to magazines (a loose term in the age of e-publishing).  Mostly they send them back with polite little form notes. \u00a0They regret that they are unable to respond to each submission personally, but they are unable to publish my story.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u0027s fine.  They don\u0027t owe me an audience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery once in a while I get a personal note back saying that the story was strong but not the kind of thing they publish, or that it made them think but didn\u0027t quite work for them, and I cherish those notes. \u00a0(They\u0027re even from magazines you\u0027ve heard of, statistically speaking. \u00a0So I can\u0027t be \n\u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0nuts, right?)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce I\u0027ve sent a story to all the eligible markets\u2014or at least the markets I would respect in the morning\u2014I usually post it to\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://kellansparver.com/fiction/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e.  For short stuff (flash-length pieces) or weird stuff (black humor), that\u0027s easy to justify to myself, but I find it hard to post longer pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s always another token-paying magazine which \n\u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e publish them.  Although... if a magazine is paying me $5 for a story, how many readers does it really have?  Is it worth the heartache to get my work in front of those few strangers?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere has got to be a better way for people to meet my work and for me to meet them than this endless spaghetti-throwing competition.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile she was doing it, I subscribed to Catherynne Valente\u0027s \u003ca href=\"http://www.catherynnemvalente.com/omikuji/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOmikuji stories\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0The deal was, you paid once a year, and then every month or thereabouts she would mail an original never-before-published story to you.  Real paper, wax seal, with a little note about life and work and the weather in Maine, signed by her.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEverything but the signature was laser-printed, of course\u2014by the time I subscribed, there were enough of us that hand-writing would have about killed her\u2014but even so there was a personal touch about it, and I came to look forward to when the cream-colored envelope with the red border would arrive in the mail.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe stories were usually short, suitable for reading over breakfast.  Theoretically each mailing she would choose someone to receive something extra-special, though I never did, and for me neither that nor the exclusivity of the stories was the point.  Just that steady contact did more to make me a part of her community than a dozen series could have.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am not as prodigious a writer as Catherynne Valente, nor am I trying to support myself on my fiction as she does, so I can\u0027t promise stories as often or as regularly, and I don\u0027t want to ask you to pay up-front. \u00a0Still, I\u0027d like Patreon to be something similar\u2014a little community of us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m still learning how to do this fiction-writing thing. I\u0027ve only been working at it seriously for a couple years, far fewer than I\u0027ve worked at any of the other things that I think I do well. I don\u0027t fit neatly into boxes\u2014my own or anyone else\u0027s. I don\u0027t know how to be approachable yet, how to win the reluctant reader\u0027s trust. I know my reach exceeds my grasp.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eStill I can\u0027t shake the conviction that my stories have value. Sometimes they\u0027re the stories I want or need to read. \u00a0Sometimes they\u0027re the stories I\u0027m too scared to read. \u00a0I say in them the things I know no other way to say.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAmanda Palmer has a TED Talk on \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking#t-291535\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"The Art of Asking\"\u003c/a\u003e, and I think the idea she espouses is profound, if not always simple to act on.  She doesn\u0027t use these words, but I will: as an artist, I exist by the grace of the people who support me\u2014by your free gifts.  You don\u0027t owe me an audience.  You don\u0027t owe me that support.  But if you\u0027re willing, I\u0027ll accept it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWill you support me?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e===\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now for some frequently asked questions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you intend to post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past couple of years,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve written about two stories a year. \u00a0I\u0027d like to write more, and I think this will encourage me to do so, but I\u0027m a slow writer with a day job. \u00a0I definitely won\u0027t post more than once a month. \u00a0(If you\u0027re worried, though, Patreon allows you to set a maximum amount you want to spend per month, for ease of budgeting, and please feel free to do so. \u00a0I know how that goes.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you posting the stories on your blog?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I\u0027m continuing to post the stories for everyone to read on my blog. \u00a0Right now nobody has heard of me or read my writing, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll help me change. \u00a0So to some extent, yeah, you\u0027re supporting me doing something I would have done anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get if I support you then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePartly faster posts. \u00a0It\u0027s a lot easier for me to convince myself not to screw around submitting to token markets if I know people care about and read my stories. \u00a0Also I\u0027m posting outtakes, \"demos,\" little bits and pieces of really raw behind-the-scenes stuff for backers only here on Patreon\u2014for example, the beginning of an (unfinished) sequel to my \"Hitchhiker\" story. (I don\u0027t want to seem to slag on token markets here; a lot of them are run by friends, or people who could be.  I just don\u0027t think that it\u0027s worth submitting to all of them, all the time.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you mail your stories to my house like Cat Valente did?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMaybe! \u00a0When I started doing this, I wanted to be really careful not to make promises I couldn\u0027t keep no matter what happened. \u00a0As it goes along and we all get more comfortable with this, I\u0027m open to new ideas. \u00a0Would you like me to mail my stories to your house? \u00a0Let me know!\u003cbr\u003e"
