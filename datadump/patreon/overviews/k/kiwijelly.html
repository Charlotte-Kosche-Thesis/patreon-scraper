That changed this year, thanks to the folks at LoadingReadyRun and Desert Bus and their surrounding communities. When I submitted my work to the Desert Bus Craft-Along, the enthusiastic response to my idea and the interest in my ongoing progress blew me away, and I realized that no one can respond to art they never see.\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I can put my heart and soul into my work without worrying about how to pay for art supplies and storage, buy a computer that doesn\u0027t crash THREE SEPARATE TIMES while I\u0027m trying to edit my Patreon page, and one day publish the complete version of my thesis, a comic/graphic novel about witchcraft, puns, and Basque, Spanish, and French cooking!\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for helping me to continue making and sharing art.\u003cbr\u003eLove, Kiwijelly."
