    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Kirby Ferguson and I\u0027m a filmmaker, writer and speaker. I make the popular video series \u003ca href=\"http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEverything is a Remix\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and did a \u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/kirby_ferguson\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTED talk\u003c/a\u003e on the same topic. I also have a video-on-demand series called \u003ca href=\"http://thisisnotaconspiracytheory.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is Not a Conspiracy Theory\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. The influential London paper \u003cem\u003eThe Guardian\u003c/em\u003e has called it\u00a0\u201cspectacularly ambitious,\u201d\u00a0and in fact, if you pledge $3 or more, you get access to that ongoing series for as long as you are a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos about creativity, media, culture and \ntechnology. I analyze various topics within these realms, and produce \nfun and hopefully thought-provoking shorts. Many will be video essays, some might add to the \u003cem\u003eEverything is a Remix\u003c/em\u003e collection, some might be \ninstructional. They\u0027ll be an eclectic lot, not a series, but they\u0027ll be \nunified by my storytelling and filmmaking style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon backing helps support the time it takes me to research, write, and produce my videos. These dollars also fund my production costs such as media and research expenses, software subscriptions, hardware maintenance, and administrative infrastructure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my videos take eight weeks straight, full-time to make. Some take a year part-time to make. Some get cranked out in a few weeks. Because of this, my videos cannot be released on a set schedule or published monthly. But when they do come out, they are high quality. And having strong patronage means I can cut back on client work and devote that time to researching, writing, and producing great videos for you to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in a nutshell, if you like my work, here\u0027s a way to help me produce more of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being a Patron!\u003cbr\u003eKirby\u003cbr\u003e"
