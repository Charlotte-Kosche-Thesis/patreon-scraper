Or sponsoring a youth soccer team. Some shit that gets our name out there but also helps others at the same time, rather than just like...Facebook ads or a radio commercial. Though the thought of forcing a radio company to play a commercial of us saying dumb stuff about how awesome Kanye is...that is appealing. But we\u0027ll sponsor good causes instead.\u00a0",
