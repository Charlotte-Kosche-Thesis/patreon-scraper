Dismal, to say the least. However, I think it\u0027s incredibly easy, even as an artist, to take art for granted and therefore to forget how much artists need support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am one of those.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll give you a brief overview of why I am raising funds for myself and encourage you to watch my video (coming soon) which will give you more personal and detailed insight into what I\u0027m doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, writing is my great love. I will do it always and I will do it for myself above all else. But I also desperately want writing to be my career and way of life. Thanks to the work I\u0027ve put into that goal over the last couple years, this feels more in reach than it ever has.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy opportunities at this time cover a wide range, and I intend to zero in on the ones that suit me best so as not to spread myself too thin. I am in touch with an agent that reached out to me, a publishing house, am working with an illustrator on a project we\u0027ll submit to a publisher, have been writing for a lit blog and...that\u0027s not quite the full list. Point being, none of these are things that currently generate money or are even guarantees, but all of them hold a lot of promise and opportunity that I am so incredibly excited about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s where your financial support comes in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt current and through the end of the school year I will be working part time as a nanny. Afternoons, Monday-Thursday, to be precise. My goal is to not have to pick up other work which would enable me to finally, finally be able to set work hours for myself each day for writing. And my hope is that if I can do just that, by summer these said opportunities will have blossomed and I will be able to leave that job encouraged that I won\u0027t have to get another random one but will actually be in (or extremely close) to a place where writing is my job. My real and only job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said, none of these things are paying \u003cem\u003eyet \u003c/em\u003eso the idea is that through this marvelous site I can raise enough funds to pay myself for those hours, with the alternative being looking for a morning job and being back in a place where I am scrambling to find the hours to devote to this dream of mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a firm believer in a little going a long way, and that by the smallest contributions made by many I can meet this goal. It would take a small fraction of my blog following giving $1 a month to meet it. If it\u0027s not something you can do, that\u0027s more than okay and I thank you for reading anyway. But if you can give even the minimum amount, you\u0027ll put me a dollar closer and that will mean the world. Thank you guys! Love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Kalyn\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(cover image by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eviecahir.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEvie Cahir\u003c/a\u003e)"
