    "summary": "Hi everyone. First and foremost, thanks for stopping by my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kelly (I also go by Kandell at conventions). I\u0027ve been cosplaying since 2009, but I was raised to be a nerd. My father made sure that the first movie my sisters and I ever saw in theaters was Star Wars: A New Hope during a special re-release a local theater was doing. We were too young to really remember it, but I think it left an impression nonetheless. While my father got my sisters and I interested in science and science fiction, my mother did her part by raising us on the Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, and crafting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date I\u0027ve made around 40-50 cosplays for myself, and several for friends/clients. I love sewing and learning new crafting techniques. Most recently I\u0027ve been working a lot with resin and leather (my newest passion).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run instructional panels at local cons on topics ranging from beginner resin demonstrations, to beginner leather demonstrations, to cosplay swimsuit construction. I also host interactive panels like Wizard Dueling, #cosplayproblems, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother hobby of mine is photography. I\u0027m still relatively new to still photography, but I will be taking more and more photos of cosplayers as the opportunities present themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to bring tutorial videos, convention vlogs, cosplay breakdown videos and more to everyone that cares to see them. Your support on this adventure would mean a lot!"
