    "summary": "Kiddie Commute is a cost-effective transportation company that serves\nbusy working parents in transporting their most precious assets, their\nchildren. Kiddie Commute provides a comprehensive solution that allows parents,\ncaregivers, and schools piece of mind by providing affordable, timely, and\nconvenient service. Ensuring safe and reliable transportation to and from\nschool, and to extra-curricular activities. We are the new school bus!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pressure of being a working parent is tough. Having to juggle work\nand school drop offs or pickups is nerve wracking. Services that exist now are\nran by random drivers that have not been background checked in cars that\nhaven\u2019t passed safety inspections.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKiddie Commute is a mobile app that connects parents to safe, reliable,\ntransportation services for their children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur CEO Shan Cureton is a busy working parent. When she was 18 years old, she was unable to complete college after becoming pregnant. When her kids were old enough she decided to resume her educational goals. And at the age of 35, decided to go back and finish what she had started. She was determined to not let her age stop her from finally earning her degree. As a non-traditional college student, she worked full time while attending classes. This is when she encountered some challenges. Because of her scheduling demands, her kids were using ride share services. This made her uneasy not being certain if the drivers had been properly vetted. She looked for a local service that could solve her problem, one did not exist...thus Kiddie Commute was born!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is to empower women and educators across the nation to dedicate themselves to keeping our children safe by providing safe transportation services in their neighborhoods. Our goal is to allow children, no matter their socio-economic status the opportunity to attend school and extracurricular activities anywhere in their area. We are a firm believer that when you show a student new things, outside their current circumstances, they will grow. It changes their perspective and gives them a fresh look and direction towards life. With your support we will be one step towards reaching our goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
