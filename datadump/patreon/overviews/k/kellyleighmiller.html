Welcome to my Patreon! \u003c/h2\u003eI am Kelly, an independent illustrator and author living in Chicago, IL and I\u0027m creating art for you! I have two children\u0027s picture books coming out from Dial. The first one is I Am A Wolf, which will be published in 2019, and the second one is a super secret project to be published in 2020! All the story concepts and designs I talk about on my Patreon will not be these two stories (since I can\u0027t release any info on them,) but they will be stories I am prepping to pitch in the future so you all will see projects I\u0027m working on probably YEARS before they go public if they get picked up! Books take a while from concept to published, as I have found out! Haha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn here, you will find Patreon-exclusive sneak peeks on future stories, commissions, and a look into my secret story concept sketchbook!\u00a0Patreon helps me focus on independent projects and have more time to create commissions and other fun projects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to help, all you have to do is pick your monthly pledge! Even $1 goes a long way. And no worries, you can edit or cancel your pledge at anytime if you need!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate all of you and all of your support!
