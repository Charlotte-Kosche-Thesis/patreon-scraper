    "summary": "Seven years ago, I wrote the script for a graphic novel recounting my experience participating in a Christian ministry as an out, queer person, but the project was put on the shelf as my time was consumed with day jobs that were worthwhile and helped other people, but left me too tired to be creative during my down time.\u003cbr\u003eLast year, I left my day job in order to devote myself full-time to pursuing illustration and the project(s) that have been calling to me: completing my graphic novel (Books I and II), completing a children\u2019s book (or three), and launching a new webcomic series based on my life and experiences (tentatively titled Hump Day).\u003cbr\u003eMy goal through Patreon is to scale back the time I spend focused on freelance projects and instead focus on \u003cstrong\u003emaking the best comics and illustrations, telling stories with unique perspectives, and create a space for learning and sharing among other creative people.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to those who are already supporting this through direct contribution and by sharing my work with your friends; it means more than you know."
