Just enough moving to re calibrate the nervous system, get into the body, and reframe your day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n*30 MINUTE BREATH/MEDITATION/SOMATIC MOVEMENT PRACTICE: ongoing explorations help you see for yourself the missing steps that have kept you from sustainable meditation practices. You\u0027ll also see, for yourself, the way yogic practices open your life and change the way you move, in it. These practices will help you \u0027connect the dots\u0027 in understanding asana, meditation, who you are, and what is possible. Along the way, you\u0027ll focus your mind, reduce your stress, come back toward balance \u0026amp; establish a regular routine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTake what you need. Don\u0027t worry about the rest. Just take what you need.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is all deconstructing vinyasa to a profound felt experience, and leaving behind canned \u0027sequences\u0027 and the hyperbole of the yoga industry. These videos require no experience, and will help those with experience break away from the superficial. It\u0027s time to move past contortions, memorized \u0027poses\u0027, and into the actual body. Karin is teaching directly to\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*those students who have a sense that yoga might help them, but are turned off by the yoga industry\u003cbr\u003e\n*those who have been injured or simply gotten bored and stuck by the way yoga is generally taught.\u003cbr\u003e\n*students who want more than \u0027postures\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\n*students ready for a teacher who will guide you into finding your own answers\u003cbr\u003e\n*teachers looking to embody their own transformation and become better guides\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m trying to take the esoteric tradition and makes it personally relevant. To reach for your own heart, allowing students to be in their own body, and provoke an inquiry into what and who we truly are. These practices allow for an on-going path, over time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI recommend that you invest in yoga blocks, something like a strap or belt, a mexican style blanket, and a large yoga bolster (google it). If you could look at your own schedule and set aside \u0027class time\u0027 at the same time every week, your progress will blossom. Even when you miss a week.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKarin\u0027s work has been handed down directly through the lineage of Sri T. Krishnamacharya.
