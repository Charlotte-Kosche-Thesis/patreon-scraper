    "summary": "Hi, and thanks for stopping by my Patreon! I\u0027m Katherine Lampe, and I\u0027m an independent author of Urban Fantasy and Speculative Fiction. I\u0027ve published a book of original fairy tales as well as six books and a novella in my Caitlin Ross series, and I am currently working on book seven, which I plan to release this coming summer. In addition, I blog at theshadowsanctuary.wordpress.com. My topics include intersectional feminism, mental health, and Paganism. Currently I am one of a very few authors who write with a Pagan audience in mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an independent author has a lot of advantages. It also presents a wide variety of challenges. Besides writing, I do the lion\u0027s share of the editing on my work. I also do all the formatting, both for print and e reader editions. As you might imagine, this takes a lot of time and commitment with no guarantee of monetary reward. Before I can publish a book, I need to hire a cover artist, and after publication, getting my work into the public eye requires I invest in advertising and other marketing tasks. Since I don\u0027t have naturally deep pockets, all of this comes catch as catch can. With patron donations, I can worry less about how I\u0027m going to manage everything and concentrate more on turning out fun and engaging books for people to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for this year is to start my own imprint, Maenad Ink. Publishing under my own imprint would benefit me in numerous ways. Currently, I publish my print editions through CreateSpace and use their free ISBNs. The problem with this is CreateSpace then becomes the publisher of record, and CreateSpace is owned by Amazon. Amazon has been pretty good to independents like me, but I\u0027d like to get out from under them. Many brick and mortar stores, especially smaller ones, will not carry books published under the CreateSpace imprint because they see Amazon as a drain on the publishing industry. Under my own imprint, my books would be free of this stigma, and I\u0027d have a better chance of getting them into customers\u0027 hands. Also, my books would be listed in catalogues brick and mortar stores reference when ordering. This would cut a lot of the work on my end, since I currently must place my books on commission at the few stores that agree to carry them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting my own imprint will not come cheap, I\u0027m afraid. Expenses include an ISBN block for current and future use, design and trademarking of the imprint logo, and re-publishing through Ingram Spark. Having an income source while I work on all this will make the difference between accomplishment and...well, not abject failure, but serious problems and delays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me on this journey! I\u0027d love to hear from you.\u003cbr\u003e"
