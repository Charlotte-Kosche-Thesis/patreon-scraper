    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eKate Reads Books\u003c/strong\u003e happened by chance and timing. I\u0027d been unemployed going on some time and the new gossip-filled book \u003cem\u003eShattered\u003c/em\u003e was coming out about the Clinton campaign. A kind twitter follower, Chris Burlingame, gifted me the book and as a way to \"pay it forward,\" I decided to live-tweet the book so all my followers could enjoy as well. Also, I decided on a whim, along with a tied twitter poll to back up the decision, to ask for tips for reading and tweeting. Hence,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/@katereadsbks\"\u003e@katereadsbks\u003c/a\u003e was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter finishing \u003cem\u003eShattered\u003c/em\u003e, I set up a new book-only account,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/@katereadsbks\"\u003e@katereadsbks\u003c/a\u003e.  Followers  then voted on which book to read next, among various leftist non-fiction, which is the focus of the account. As I read a book, I live-tweet personal responses, annotations, and summaries, along with a screenshot of the text.  I then continue to reply to each previous tweet, creating one long thread that summarizes the entire book.  Followers often reply with their insights and thoughts, which generates conversation around the content. I consider the Kate Reads Books followers and patrons a community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKate Reads Books provides a public service and enriches the online leftist community.  It\u0027s a valuable project to grow the online left for a couple key reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsing twitter frequently, I found myself struggling to be able to maintain the concentration to read a book (embarrassing, yes, but I know I\u0027m not alone). Kate Reads Books allows busy people and/or Very Online folx to follow along and either read the book with me, or to substitute the thread for reading the book. Based on feedback from followers, this has increased their reading output, and based on Amazon links, it has increased book sales.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eOver the course of the primary and forward, many people, myself included, have found themselves moving left on twitter.

The account enables the widespread sharing of nonfiction books in the online left which continues to expand people\u0027s understanding of leftist history and theory; it\u0027s more than just reading a book.\u00a0Furthermore, reading the book together online enriches the learning happening and community-building of the online left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKate Reads Books has been a very rewarding and exciting project thus far. \u00a0In order to remain viable, I need to be able to make a living wage to reimburse for the time, content, and commitment. \u00a0Becoming a patron will allow me to continue this project and will give you some perks for your tips! \u00a0Thank you for your follows, favs, rts, endorsements, donations, etc.  You\u0027re the reason the account exists and I hope you will join me on the Patreon journey as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ud83d\udc9c\u00a0\ud83d\udcda\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ekate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS potential future projects include collaborations with authors and popular leftists, a website with easier-to-read twitter threads, podcast/s, articles, and beyond!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePPS\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/apocalizzy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@apocalizzy\u003c/a\u003e is the artist responsible for both my avi and my header image; you should\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/apocalizzy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efollow her on twitter\u003c/a\u003e, commission a piece of art,\u00a0and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/apocalizzyart\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebecome a patron of her art\u003c/a\u003e!"
