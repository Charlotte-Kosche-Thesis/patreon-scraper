The thing that ties them all together is that they all feature hands in some way, and all experiment with style of writing and visuals to best suit the concept that they are trying to express. It\u2019s been a very satisfying project, and there\u2019s no real end in sight to it other than when I run out of ideas! Some of the issues are only 10 pages, some are more like 32!  Many of them are on my \u003ca href=\"http://outside-life.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, so check them out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been nearly half a year since the Patreon started, at the time I\u0027m writing this, and in that time I\u0027ve been reliably delivering my rewards. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$2+ patrons get a once weekly post filled with content. \u00a0It generally has one unseen piece of artwork, a pitch for a new project which will often have a little bit of concept art (sometimes a full comic page), a little bit of writing about my life, a bit about projects I\u0027m working on this week, sometimes a passage from something I\u0027m writing, and notes about what other posts are upcoming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5+ patrons get polls where you can give your input on what direction I should go on with my art! And also you get to see pages before they go up on my website and tumblr. \u00a0 Often that can mean being something like 40 pages ahead on all of my projects! \u00a0I like my buffers, so I am usually way ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10+ patrons get access to exclusive streams that happen occasionally, as well as videos of me drawing. \u00a0Technical issues mean that right now, the videos are more common! \u00a0But that still is plenty of stuff to watch. \u00a0And you can see how the art comes together, and how I think of it as I draw it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$20+ patrons get the mailings!! \u00a0Which I am proud of!! \u00a0I am basically making a mini-comic a month, and sending it out, so far. \u00a0Sometimes it might not be a mini-comic, who knows! \u00a0But it will always be an art project which I think will be exciting and interesting. \u00a0And, something no one else will see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePast $20+ there are a variety of variations, including getting original pages and commissions! \u00a0Which would be amazing, if you can give that much. \u00a0And I\u0027ll do my best to do right by your generosity!\u003cbr\u003e"
