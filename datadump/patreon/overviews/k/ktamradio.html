Fully Licensed (SoCan Tarrif 22.f) our goal is to be entertaining and informative with immersive game specific content from hosts to ads while also letting people who do not have the means to create/host their own radio/shows do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur commitment is to remain independent and not fall into the traps of being commercialized while also not being restricted to playing the typical commercial/royalty free music offered by so many other online radios and streaming services. K-TAM Radio does not accept commercial offers for real world advertisements that are not community related, such as clan/guild adds, independent games, musicians or projects members of our community are involved in. We exist on the generous donations of our dedicated listeners and fans. Thank You Very much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support K-TAM Radio can improve what it offers in the way of more content, promotions, contests and prizes. By expanding our listener base which will allow us to better represent what the community would like to hear and to represent their interests in music, independent developer interaction and to share in conversations in our unique open format interviews. To continue to expand the range of content and hosts on K-TAM for our listeners; representing our growing community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe couldn\u0027t do it with out you and we are always looking for ways to show our gratitude and appreciation to our supporting fans and listeners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
