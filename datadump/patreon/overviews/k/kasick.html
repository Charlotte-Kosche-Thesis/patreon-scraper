    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAnd you are...?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kris Asick and I run a one-man-operation under the name of Pixelmusement. Although I\u0027m a game designer at heart and have released a few freeware and non-free titles, lately I\u0027ve been doing a web show entitled \"Ancient DOS Games\", where I take my analytical nature and apply it to all the old PC games few people play anymore, giving light to the old classics and even the games which probably should\u0027ve stayed forgotten. Regardless of how good they are, I give every game a fair treatment, occasionally finding out interesting tid-bits in the process, and I also provide information on how to legally obtain these old games and get them working on modern computers. Below is an example of the kind of content I produce on ADG, specifically, Episode 119 - SimCity 2000:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQkCVJ1LFhs\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo why are you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo put it simply: A number of fans of ADG have expressed the desire to support the show more directly, so after a lot of thought I ultimately decided to give Patreon a shot. Now, I should make something perfectly clear: \u003cstrong\u003eAncient DOS Games will ALWAYS be free to watch!\u003c/strong\u003e The whole point of my being here on Patreon is for those of you who want to support the show beyond simply watching it. You don\u0027t have to be a Patron of the show to enjoy it! That said, being a Patron will give you some exclusive bonuses indicated at the bottom of the page as my way of saying thanks for being extra-awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nDon\u0027t you run ads on your show? Why bother with Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAd revenue is a fickle thing and you\u0027d be surprised how little a nich\u00e9 show such as mine makes. The ad revenue pays for my webhosting and occasionally I can get an extra DOS game or two from it, but that\u0027s about it. Patreon allows people interested in the show to give money directly towards its continued existence on a regular basis and helps to guarantee its future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat do I get out of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the bottom of the page are several exclusive rewards offered to anyone who pledges a certain amount per month. Even as little as $1 a month is enough to get something for your generosity! Plus, since this isn\u0027t very obvious allow me to express this plainly and simply: \u003cstrong\u003eEvery reward level includes ALL previous reward levels!\u003c/strong\u003e This means if you pledge $16 a month, you also get the $1, $2, $4, $8 and $12 rewards! You also don\u0027t have to match the rewards exactly, as you can pledge any amount you want to really. You can even pledge nothing and continue to watch and enjoy the show as always! (But of course, then you wouldn\u0027t get any rewards.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWait... you just added $2 and $12 tiers but I\u0027m not on them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m going to make an effort to make sure people are aware of this change but to qualify for the new reward tiers if you do but aren\u0027t already set to them is to just edit your pledge and change the reward you want. That\u0027s all you gotta do! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAnything else I should know?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI do more than just produce ADG and make games. On my website is a special section dedicated to \"Miscellaneous Stuff\", which includes huge quantities of the music I\u0027ve made, some custom levels for various games, and even a link to my DeviantArt page, which I will admit, I don\u0027t update very often at all, but you can check out some of the conceptual screenshots I\u0027ve drawn up over the years along with some other random art-type stuff. Pledging any amount at all not only supports ADG and my making games, but absolutely everything else I do, so even if you\u0027re not specifically interested in ADG, you\u0027re still welcome to support me for any of the other things I work on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you\u0027ll probably be wanting a link to my website.
