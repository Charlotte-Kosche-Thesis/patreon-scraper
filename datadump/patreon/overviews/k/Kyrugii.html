I\u0027ve done several stories involving anthropomorphic characters, or furries for short. I\u0027ve recently decided to test myself and take up the challenge of writing a serial story. The goal is to have one chapter ready to publish every week and keep it running as long as possible until I reach the ending. I also welcome comments and critique. That good enough?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s it? Look at everyone here. Don\u2019t you feel obligated to give your audience more than just a short blurb?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePfft. If anyone actually stumbles across this then maybe I\u2019ll extend my comments, but for now it seems more like a waste of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat doesn\u0027t seem very friendly. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d like to know a bit about who you are.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFine, fine. At least tell the audience what the story is about.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I think they\u2019ve proven capable of reading for themselves. Just shut it and give them some credit, I\u2019m sure they can figure it out for themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell then folks, I doubt I can get any more out of him, right this way to the story\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait, there\u0027s more. Since\u00a0the reward for stories is\u00a0monitized at fifteen dollars anyone\u0027s\u00a0supported giving hits that mark they earn a story in return.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
