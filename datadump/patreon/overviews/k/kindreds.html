And even more, we love how many of our listeners tell us our podcast is like having us at their kitchen table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find our episodes on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, or at kindredspodcast.com, \u003cstrong\u003ewhere we also have show notes for every episode\u003c/strong\u003e packed with links, articles, reading and podcast recommendations, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is Kindreds on Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started Kindreds out of a desire to talk about some of the complicated thoughts and feelings we have around \u003cstrong\u003efaith, our religious institutions, and what it means to be women who challenge the power structures we encounter in our lives and work.\u003c/strong\u003e From talking to other women in our lives, we knew that we aren\u2019t alone in these thoughts, so we wanted to let others in on our conversations. Also, we like to try new things! So why not a podcast? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur agreement was that we\u2019ll do this as long as it\u2019s fun. And lucky for us, we \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e it! But the reality is that \u003cstrong\u003eeach episode takes somewhere between 4 and 6 hours to create\u003c/strong\u003e -- from planning the content and developing an outline to recording, editing, and uploading to our website. We\u2019ve been pushing ourselves pretty hard to release two episodes a month, and up until now that\u2019s been pretty doable! But as our listeners know, we each have a full-time job, and now both of us are parents (or soon-to-be!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve heard from our listeners that you\u2019d love to be \u003cstrong\u003epart of a Kindreds community on Facebook, \u003c/strong\u003eand we want to be able to make that happen! But that means we\u2019d need to hire some help for things like posting content, moderating comments, and keeping the page running smoothly. And podcasting itself isn\u2019t free- there are monthly fees for hosting our audio files as well as annual fees for our website. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat brings us to Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e. Instead of pursuing advertising (which would mean amassing a larger audience, seeking out sponsors, and creating commercials), we decided to take a more grassroots approach by asking those of you who love our show to help us grow it. \u003cstrong\u003eWe have big dreams for Kindreds\u003c/strong\u003e -- dreams like interviewing guests, reaching new listeners, and hosting meet-ups for our Kindreds family in person! But we need your help to get us there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can help by becoming a Patron at any level!\u003c/strong\u003e And if that isn\u2019t in the cards for you right now, you can also support Kindreds by sharing, rating and reviewing our podcast on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe can\u2019t wait to be co-creators with you!\u003c/strong\u003e"
