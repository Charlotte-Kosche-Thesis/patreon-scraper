I have several projects that I am currently working on. I love escaping into fictional worlds, whether by writing them or reading them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI publish multiple stories on multiple sites, and only a couple have set release dates, the rest are all random, and some don\u0027t get edited. All chapters that \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0get edited are self-edited by me, and the quality probably won\u0027t be professional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love dragons. Think it\u0027s childish all you want, but I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Stories:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am most comfortable with the fantasy genre, with sci-fi close behind, all geared towards the Young Adult demographic - that is, adolescents. I write in the first-person present-tense perspective, a form that isn\u0027t used very often, due to the fact that it\u0027s very much like someone\u0027s just talking the entire time - which is exactly what it is, someone telling what is happening as it\u0027s happening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery story of mine features dragons in some form. You can expect them to show up at some point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Goal:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat is my goal? It\u0027s to provide stories to you, the reader, while providing a way for me to continue to write without worrying about feeding myself or paying bills - a win-win for my readers who enjoy my stories, as well as for me. I will \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0put a gate on my stories, but will, on occasion, post Patron-only content, such as backstory chapters or character information. By becoming a Patron, you\u0027ll also gain access to the community and early release of WAC, and other stories from RoyalRoad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWAC, when posted on here, will be released locked to Patrons, and after five days, will be posted for free on another site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy starting goal will be to release a WAC chapter on the 5th and 20th of each month (approximately 15 days apart), each chapter being 6.5K-10K words, though as I get into the story, the chapters will probably grow longer and longer, which is what seems to happen with other stories that I release episodic (by chapter).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll other new stories on RRL will be posted on here first for Level 3 Patrons, who will have access to the six newest chapters. Level 2 Patrons will have access to the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-newest chapters, and Level 1 Patrons will have access to the sixth-newest chapters. Once a new chapter is released for Level 3, all chapter accesses will be bumped down a Tier, with the seventh-newest being made public on RoyalRoad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eNOTE ABOUT THE REWARDS:\u00a0\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhen you go to pledge, you can donate any amount you wish.

I enjoy fantasy and some sc-fi, and write a bit of both. I also write a little bit of erotica, but you won\u0027t find that on here, or linked on here. Some of my stories have darker tones to them, but I like protagonists who aren\u0027t perfect, which is obvious if you look at my favorite books!",
