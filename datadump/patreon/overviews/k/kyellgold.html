I\u0027d like to do it again and see if I can get some support so I can devote more time to writing the novel. If I get a lot of support, I can work with two outstanding artists to create ongoing illustrations, more than a publisher would normally commission for one of my books. Additionally, I\u0027ll be able to spend more time talking to fans about the direction of the story and, with extra support, can provide short bonus stories in the world of this novel or others!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to read the beginning of the novel, you can find it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/love-match-part-1258333\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and an example of Rukis\u0027s art is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/love-match-by-1342310\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.
