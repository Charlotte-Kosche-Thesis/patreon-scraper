YOU) with your favorite content creators ( I guess me XD!). The way that Patreon does this is by allowing supporters to fund their favorite creators through pledges--similar to Kickstarter. However, unlike Kickstarter, Patreon is made for long-term funding--similar to a magazine subscription. You decide how much you\u0027d like to\u00a0pledge\u00a0through a tier system, with each tier being a different amount. You can can also set a monthly maximum so that you\u0027re always within your budget. In return, you receive different rewards from the creator you\u0027ve chosen to pledge to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eWhy pledge to me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy plans for my Patreon is to provide illustrations, traditional work, digital paintings (Both safe and NSFW), sketches, speed paints, tutorials and guides, as well as some comic art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to be able to provide a fun relationship between supporter and creator!

I started drawing at about the age of 6. My inspirations are Disney movies, magic, anime, superheros, biblical and religious folk tales \u0026amp; myths, afternoon cartoons and Adam Hughes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA small fun fact about me is that I\u2019m left handed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom a young age I learned simple doodling, which turned into simple drawings, which turned into full blown art pieces. I learned on my own what colors were complementary, what colors pairings were more aesthetically pleasing to the eye and overall what made more sense.\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a child I knew I wanted to work in an artistic environment; doing something that would please and challenge me as an artist, as well as please my audience and any onlookers that decide my artwork is worth taking a gander at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of now, I have tons of influences, which have all helped in developing my artwork and my diverse style. Although, I know improvement is an unquestionable given, I will never lose my confidence and the hope that one day my artwork will make a difference and leave an impact on the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
