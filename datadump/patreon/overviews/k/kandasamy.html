    "summary": "Hello everyone there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Meena Kandasamy. I have been writing since I was 17, and that\u0027s almost half my life. I have written about women\u0027s rights issues and feminism in India, about caste oppression, about liberation struggles. I started out as a translator. I have written two books of poetry, \u003cem\u003eTouch \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eMs Militancy.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more about my writing on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kandasamy.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. Months after I received my PhD in 2010, I quit a job teaching at a university to write my first novel. \u003cem\u003eThe Gypsy Goddess\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ewas experimental, metafictional, historical: it was an anti-novel in every sense of the word--and it tried to tell the story of post-Independent India\u0027s first caste massacre. It took the reader to the tiny village of Kilvenmani where 44 Dalit landless labourers were burnt to death on Christmas Day 1968 because they were agitating for higher wages and fighting untouchability. My second novel \u003cem\u003eWhen I Hit You: Or, A Portrait of the Writer as a Young Wife\u003c/em\u003e, published this year took on the theme of domestic violence and marital rape--which are taboo topics to speak about in larger society, and issues which remain unexplored in literary fiction to a great degree.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am using Patreon because I need your help. I\u0027m trying--for the first time--to do a non-fiction project that I had to abandon years ago because of adverse circumstances. I\u0027m also trying to research what could possibly become my third novel. I have ideas for another poetry collection. As much as I\u0027m bursting with enthusiasm, I also have to confront real life: I now live in London, where I had to move for love. I do not have a full-time job, and I have to desperately worry everyday how and where I\u0027m going to find the money to pay my rent. The kind of writing that I do (not journalism, not massmarket fiction, not social media poetry) is not the kind of writing that pays. If I get a little help--the time I spend figuring out my next rent is going to go into my writing. Your money will help me buy time and pursue writing. It will allow me--if only temporarily--to pursue my dreams."

Her critically acclaimed first (anti)novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Gypsy Goddess\u003c/em\u003e, smudged the line between powerful fiction and fearsome critique in narrating the 1968 massacre of forty-four landless untouchable men, women and children striking for higher wages in the village of Kilvenmani, Tanjore. Her second novel, \u003cem\u003eWhen I Hit You: Or, The Portrait of the Writer As A Young Wife, \u003c/em\u003edrew upon her own experience within an abusive marriage, to lift the veil on the silence that surrounds domestic violence and marital rape in modern India.\u003c/span\u003e\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;She grew up in Chennai, India where she lived most of her life before moving to London in 2016.\u00a0She was a fellow of the International Writing Program (IWP) at the University of Iowa in 2009, and a British Council Charles Wallace India Trust Fellow at the University of Kent in 2011.
