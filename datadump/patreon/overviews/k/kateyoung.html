When writing the songs, I also looked into accounts of stories from around Scotland where the Nettle, the Dandelion and so on had been used and how.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel a need to highlight this part of our heritage, a once vast knowledge which is swiftly disappearing, to find a way of bringing it to our younger generations particularly. That is why I used a commission in the winter to compose a repertoire of songs which weave pieces of this knowledge, my own personal experiences with some of the plants, stories and so on to create a sonic fabric from which something might grow. The songs are accompanied by string quintet, harp, drums and bass as I felt these instruments provide the perfect vehicle to illustrate a multitude of textures, sounds and sensibilities that also characterise the plantworld. I hope that this body of work and my future work will act as the seeds on a dandelion clock does - burst in the wind and find their own paths to recreate a new population somewhere else in the next turn of the seasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting some videos, recordings of songs, artwork and poems about my botanical encounters and every penny contributed towards this will go into a big pot which I will use to record an exciting new album called \u0027Umbelliferae\u0027 (this is the family name for the kind of plants which spread their seeds by exploding in the air and travel by wind).

This sonic feast was added to with some tremendous playing on the harp, double bass and percussion. I\u0027m really proud of what I have written and am keen to get these new tunes out into the world and recorded in the best possible way I can, as it took a lot of dedication and effort to create this body of work, I feel it deserves a really good quality record and send off into the atmosphere!",
