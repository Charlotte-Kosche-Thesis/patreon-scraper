I use a wide variety of tools and media in my visual art practice, because I love to experiment.\u00a0 Most recently, the focus of my work has turned to abstract landscapes, sky-scapes, sunsets, etc. However, as abstracts some might seem a bit alien. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese fall into what I think of as dream-scapes, spiritual landscapes, or if you will \"S\u0027scapes.\" They are my expressions and generally stem from my emotional and spiritual condition. It\u0027s just that they might also represent a stormy sky if that happens to be where my head\u0027s at while painting. It is also a fair metaphor for the fiction I write, which is generally a cross genre hybrid of cyber-noir, science fiction, and fantasy.
