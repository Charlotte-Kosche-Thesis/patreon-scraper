    "summary": "This a patreon page of Danika Kristine, of her modeling and reference/nude photography work that inspires her paintings and other art. By becoming a patron to her page here you will have access to her modeling work, photography work of both digital and film, behind the scenes photographs, and a few personal mind bits here and there. Pledges are charged by the post, example: when a post is published, which is about every one-two months, that is when you will be charged rather than a monthly subscription charge as before. This way it will help bring us together, collaborators and patrons, so we both are giving and getting equally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are looking for art work, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.danikakristine.com,\"\u003ewww.danikakristine.com,\u003c/a\u003e for as of 2017 art work post will no longer be posted here (only exception is many sometimes on $1 tier if so). Reason being is that most of you are here to see the other side of DK\u0027s work that she keeps privately: her modeling and the nude photography of models she captures for her art/painting references. If you wish to sole support art work, please visit Danika Kristine\u0027s portfolio website listed above (To note however: sometimes some art prints will be put into mail rewards that are related to the content posted here)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon is a site source that allows fans to \"pledge\" a monetary amount of money and in return you get amazing perks like personal letters, previews that no one else gets to see, behind the scene photography work, and more depending on per post amounted tier reward you would like to select. You may reduce your pledge at anytime, there is no fee and no hard feeling as I am grateful no matter what of your time in helping support my work \u0026lt;3\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being here, love and light.
