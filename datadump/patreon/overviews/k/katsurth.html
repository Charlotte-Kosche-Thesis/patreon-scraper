I like to be active in photography, video making, and writing, but trying to do things somewhat different than the rest. Many times, I am also the subject of these creations. You\u0027ll often see me wearing a tie. My hair style (and color) can change at any whim. I try to document both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my dear friends told me about Patreon, as he knew that I was trying to raise funds to turn part of my garage into a studio (and give it electricity). By having a studio, I will be able to create things at any time and be warm while doing so. (I have shot several videos and photos outside in the Minnesota winter in the past. Brrr!). While I\u0027m cute with a red-nose, the shaking camera person is killing me with his eyes for dragging them in the snow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, people request photos and videos of me all the time, but I don\u0027t think that they don\u0027t understand the time and costs involved with each one. Hopefully, by receiving support from these lovely folks, I can fulfill many of their requests in a faster time frame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support and kind generosity. With your help, I\u0027m able to buy better props, clothing, and etc. for my videos and photos; and create more content for you to enjoy. Even if you aren\u0027t able to help out now with even just a dollar, thank you for taking the time to read my stuff. I appreciate everything you do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
