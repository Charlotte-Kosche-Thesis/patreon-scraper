    "summary": "hey there!  Thanks so much for visiting my Patreon page. My name is Ken Hyland and I\u0027ve been writing, performing live, and releasing music for years. And because of your support, here on Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to keep doing it, and doing it consistently!!! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis platform is now my central focus.  All my new music and videos will be launched from here first - and sometimes ONLY here. My goal is to bring you\u00a02 - 4 episodes of Koffee w/ Ken, or straight up music videos, as well as the occasional new song (without an accompanying video), as I normally would each month (iTunes, YouTube, streaming services, etc). But when you pledge your support to me on this site you\u0027ll get much MUCH more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(DESKTOP/IPAD) See the reward tiers in the column on the right ---\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e(MOBILE) Click the \u0027Become a Patron\u0027 button at the top right to see the reward tiers.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEVERY BIT HELPS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eAmanda Palmer said \"I think this site is a new revolution in music-release and art patronage,\"  and I couldn\u0027t agree more!\u00a0Unlike KickStarter, which is about one big project that requires lots of funding, Patreon allows you to become a bonafide patron of the arts with much smaller, ongoing donations, which means that you can directly support me by making a contribution, for whatever amount you want, whenever I release a new video or song. \u00a0And, as a thank you, I will provide patron-only downloads for each new release, bonus tracks, and other goodies each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a lean operation - I write, record, mix, master, create the artwork, and release all of my music myself, so I have a very low overhead, but there are still expenses.\u00a0Your support will give me some financial breathing room and allow me \u003cem\u003ethe time\u003c/em\u003e to INCREASE the amount, and quality of music that I make. It will also help me to maintain a consistent recording and music release schedule, which, in the past, has been a challenge. It will also help me to keep my instruments and recording equipment operational, allow me to upgrade and get additional gear when needed, tour and perform live when the opportunities arise, and, most importantly, \u003cem\u003efeed my family :)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHAT IS WHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GO! \u003cem\u003eYour patronage will allow me to continue to make music -- better music -- full-time, and it will go directly towards supporting myself and my family! \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will go A LONG WAY! Again, my goal is to release 2 - 5 songs and/or videos each month, but if you\u0027re at all concerned about going over budget you can simply set a monthly maximum, and you can cancel at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll join me on this adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n-ken\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. If you can\u0027t afford to contribute at this time, or just don\u0027t want to, don\u0027t worry, you\u0027re not obligated and I will continue to release music and videos on YouTube for you to enjoy, for free!\u003cbr\u003e"

First off, you will get my undying gratitude. Second, you will get everything in Tiers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, PLUS:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Get a customized song \u003cstrong\u003eWRITTEN AND RECORDED JUST FOR YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e This could be a unique gift for a friend, loved one, or a couple for a special occasion such as a wedding or an anniversary. It could be for an event, or a promotional song (dare I say...jingle?) for your business. If you\u0027re a musician, singer, rapper, DJ, or hip hop producer this could be a unique, exclusive track with live drums and instrumentation recorded on my personal vintage gear that you can remix and/or appropriate to make your own. It\u0027s up to you. I\u0027ll ask you a few questions beforehand and we can agree on a song style. This can be labor intensive so I\u0027m limiting this to 5 patrons at a time. I anticipate the turnaround time to be approximately two months (approximately 8 payments). And in order to get the process started I only ask that you commit to being a patron of me at this level for at least that amount of time. I can make your song available in any digital format you like as well as provide you with STEMS (separate tracks for remixing) if desired. Once the song has been delivered to you, you can either continue your patronage at this level and request another song, or downgrade to a lower level.",
