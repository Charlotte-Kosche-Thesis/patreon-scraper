    "summary": "Like most artists, Katie Sikora Photography (but you can call me KSP) has her hands in too many projects to count and your pledges will go towards supporting her in each and every one. Just having the funds on hand supports artists in their journeys as it gives them the extra time and energy needed to keep bringing their art to the world. Some of the KSP endeavors you will be supporting with your dollars include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003einterim mag\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/interim-mag)\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/interim-mag)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA freshly created online music magazine representing the underserved musicians and musical projects left behind by the larger and \"more traditional\" New Orleans music magazines. Don\u0027t get us wrong, we love us some funk and jazz music as much as the next human, but there\u0027s so much more happening and we want to showcase that. interim mag aims to bridge the gap between New Orleans\u0027 musical past and future through journalistically-responsible storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKatie Sikora Photography \u003c/strong\u003e(http://www.katiesikora.com)\u003cbr\u003eOwning a small business, especially an artistic one, is not for the faint of heart and requires constant maintenance, restructuring, and creativity. Often times these minor and not-so-minor changes require capital that just doesn\u0027t exist leading to a seemingly unending circle of \"I can\u0027t do this new thing because I don\u0027t have the money\" - \"I need to do this new thing to build a bigger client/support base\" - \"THE WORLD IS OUT TO GET ME\". It can get bleak my friends. Your pledges help to ease this very real stress from the world of a hard-working artist so that she can continue on in her journey to enrich the world with true stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Sexism Project \u003c/strong\u003e(https://www.thesexismproject.com)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis project does indeed have its very own Patreon page but if you want your pledge to support all of these things at once and more, this is the place to be. The Sexism Project is an ongoing interview and portrait series of real women in real industries experiencing real sexism. Think Humans of NY but waaaaaaay more important and feminine and timely (shoutout to Humans of NY, you\u0027re awesome and no offense). Our first installment featured women in the New Orleans music community and we are currently working on our second installment that highlights sex workers in New Orleans as they combat ongoing legislation and moral zealots attempting to shut down their clubs and in turn, prevent them from supporting themselves and their families.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKSP is humbled by the support of her patrons and can\u0027t thank y\u0027all enough for being such a big part of making this a reality. Without your support she couldn\u0027t offer the additional products and services that you will be receiving in exchange for your pledges. In addition to access to stories and photographs on the reg, you will have the ability to sit in on live Q\u0026amp;A sessions, get free visual downloads, discounts for photo prints and photo shoots, exclusive patron-only merchandise, as well as raffle tickets for monthly KSP print giveaways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
