    "summary": "\u201cYou\nlive a life every day that you may think is ordinary and\nunexceptional. It only is if you see it that way. Your little detail\nmight be someone\u0027s entire reason for telling their story.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nwrote that August 19, 2015. It was three sentences in\nthe middle of a bunch of other sentences, in the middle of a story.\nIt\u2019s been the underlying reason to almost everything, if not\neverything, that I have ever written. I\u2019ve been writing publicly,\nvia social media, for more than ten years at this point. Almost\neveryone I have met over the years has a story. Some of those stories\nsound like any other person\u2019s story on the surface but its the\npersonal details that make them special. Some of those stories, if I\ntold you plain, you\u2019d never believe. All of those stories,\nregardless of metaphor, have been, and continue to be, a part of my\nstory. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThe\nbest way to tell your story is to tell the stories of the ones you\nlove.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\ndon\u2019t remember the first time I wrote that. It also works the other\nway around. You tell the stories about the ones you love by telling\nyours. Real stories don\u2019t end, they keep going, that string that\nyou pulled keeps unraveling whether or not you continue to pull. Even\nin death those stories keep going if someone is willing to tell them.\nSomebody will listen, somebody will remember, and somebody will tell\nit to someone else. The only thing lonelier than a book that\u2019s been\nclosed and put back on the shelf to get dusty is the book that never\ngot opened in the first place. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMemento\nmori is a Medieval Latin Christian practice of the reflection of\nmortality. It means, \u201cRemember that you mist die.\u201d By realizing\nand accepting that your mortal coil must at some point be unwound you\nturn your attention to the immortal soul. It\u2019s not just religion,\neven science says that matter can not be destroyed, but becomes\nsomething else, changed from one form to another. I\u2019ve told stories\nabout the dead. To remember the dead you celebrate their life. I tell\nstories about the living. To love is to not forget. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\nworld is full of ordinary, beautiful people who make the lives of the\nones around them better on a daily basis. They change their world,\nperson by person, every day. They\u2019re my heroes, they\u2019re the ones\nI love, they\u2019re the reasons why I tell my stories. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIt\u2019s\nyour story. It\u2019s up to you how you tell it. You\u2019re in charge.\nNothing can happen that has the power to to take that way from you.\nYou tell it well enough and even death is powerless because the ones\nyou told will keep telling for you.\u201d \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nhave no set plans on what kind of stories I\u2019ll be telling here. I\ndon\u2019t want to close myself in with arbitrary parameters. Since it\u2019s\nHalloween I\u2019ll start with one of the first stories I had published,\none that most of my friends have read already. After that it will be\nlike I have been doing for the past ten years. There will be stories\nabout the places I\u2019ve seen and the people I have met along the way.\nThere will be some \u201cspooky\u201d stories, funny stories, maybe even a\nlove story or two. It will depend on you and what is on my mind.\nThere will be some old stories retold. There will be some new stories\ntold for the first time. There will be stories. \n\u003cbr\u003e"
