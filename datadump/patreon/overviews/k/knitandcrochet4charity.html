So many people are without and in need of warm clothes during the winter months. I love to knit and crochet. I have a desire to knit and crochet hats and scarves and distribute the finished products to various charities. I would love to bring people together in order to make beautiful hats and scarves for people in need. There are so many different charities that are in need. If we work together and make things to donate we can fill so many needs. I know everyone is not able to knit and crochet, however, we can also accept donations of yarn to be distributed to knitters and crocheters. We also accept monetary donations to be used to purchase yarn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYarn and monetary donations helps with the cost so I can share more yarn with the people making the beautiful items for people and organizations in need. This helps us to be able to reduce our costs and bless those in need. This also shows that someone cares enough that they wanted to make something beautiful and handmade for them.\u003cbr\u003eAll proceeds will be used to buy supplies and help with marketing. \u00a0The more money we raise the more people we can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for donating to help us with our mission to keep the homeless warm.
