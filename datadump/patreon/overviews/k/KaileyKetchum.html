Patreons will get things like sexy prints, calendars, stickers, and possibly even things like mugs, t-shirts, hoodies, etc in the future.

I am new and just starting out so I do not have the budget to be changing things around. That being said, I am not taking suggestions at this time. If you would like to purchase me an entire cosplay, however, that\u0027s a different story, and I\u0027ll definitely make sure to squeeze in a shoot with it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you making your cosplays yourself?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor the most part, YES! I LOVE art and always have. Almost any art form really, including sewing. Most of my cosplays will require me to make at least some parts, if not the entire thing. However, there are things like props, wigs, accessories, etc that I do not have the knowledge, time, or money to create (YET). So I\u0027ll be purchasing certain elements. I\u0027d like to try and make most of my cosplays unique in some way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
