I am an artist pertaining to anything creative. I was born in San Francisco. Growing up with a single mom who was raised by a single father. She was always working and being punk af. As a lead vocalist \u0026amp; guitarist for a band called \u0027The Trashwomen\u0027. I was clearly always surrounded by music. I even wrote and recorded my first song \u0027Boys r Toys\u0027 at age 5.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter moving ALL over San Francisco in a chaotic childhood mess where anything and everything bad happened to me. In 2000 we moved to Oakland. Where I became settled in and got to begin exploring my creative talents. From my preteen years on I used a VHS camera to record videos, made beats on Acid Pro w/ my mom\u0027s boyfriend\u0027s computer, Production Keyboard, Played on his Technics, and Microphone. Me and my friend Avian made whole mixtapes and gave them out to all our friends in the neighborhood. I joined many after school programs to keep kids of the streets that taught breakdancing, graffiti and mural painting for 3 years and played Advanced Violin in a class before classes started. (Wish I had the time to do all this stuff now, LOL)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nAs, I became more of an angsty teen I became engulfed in dark side of growing up in East Oakland. Falling into the wrong crowd, experimenting, and soon enough I found myself getting expelled from school after school. Things got darker when I found myself on my own at 16. Partying just to have a place to be at night. Staying at friend\u0027s houses w/ their parents. \nI had to make a change so, I enrolled in Job Corps. A Government program where you live and receive work training for free. After getting my GED I used my graduation check to get an apartment in West Oakland. Started working at IKEA and saved money to get my first MacBook and that\u0027s when my life changed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUsing my talents I have harnessed my whole life and finally being in charge of my own life I was allowed to follow my creative instincts. From 18 and on I used my computer to edit videos, make beats and record music. It was an amazing creative outlet for me. I took a huge liking to my filming and invested money I made from selling drugs at the time to funding my own self-run production company. I directed, filmed and edited over 30 films. Which landed me a full scholarship to Berkeley Digital FIlm School. I was doing everything.\nAfter a film school I moved to L.A where I thought I would build my way into the film scene by working on sets. But, Soon enough all my other projects started taking off. From my documentary and production work with V-Nasty to MY OWN MUSIC. Which was completely surprising to me at the time. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0027Gucci Gucci\u0027 came out and everything blew up within hours. Life completely changed. From traveling constantly, working w/ extreme amounts of anxiety, fraying friendships and relationships, and the ever present social bashing. Of course a lot of good memories were made but, at the rate things were blowing up my mind and body could not catch up. Shortly after my first album didn\u0027t \"live up\" to \"media\" standards. I became pregnant after a national tour. Right after Sony/Colombia found out I was let go off the label. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nMy whole attitude towards creating music was ever changed. I associated it with the most negative emotions possible. I focused all my energy into Directing, DJing, Radio/Podcasting and of course BEING AN AMAZING MOM! My life still has had some insanely intense rollercoastering but, I am ready to tell you about it via some NEW MUSIC. and there it is.. My life story.\n\n\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eWHY AM I GIVING KREAYSHAWN MONEY?!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n..Isn\u0027t she rich from Gucci Gucci? Well, actually I am not. Gucci Gucci the video was \n\u003cstrong\u003enever\u003c/strong\u003e monetized. My contract with the label \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e has me in recoupment.

I don\u0027t have much of anything. \u003cbr\u003e\nAs you know artists do not have a stable income no matter what. Life can be very erratic and stressful especially while raising a kid! Making music will put me back on doing shows, allow me to monetize my visuals and be able to make money outside of recoupment. \n\u003cstrong\u003eIt will also help draw attention to my other talents I have a passion for like Film, Production and Writing! \u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are a Kreayshawn\u003c/strong\u003e Hater..\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h1\u003e\nI still welcome you to donate out of spite and prove you are better then me.
