    "summary": "My name is Christian Kirchner. I\u0027m a 20 year-old fantasy writer. I have been published for a short story called Blood and Sand. I am currently writing a book called Corinthian. A fantasy epic adventure which has been described by almost anyone who has read my work as, \"Like Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings\". A fact I\u0027m pretty proud of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here? Well, because I would love to be able to make a video game, a MOBA of this world, but I can\u0027t without downloading the proper assets. I hope to make this MOBA rival the likes of Smite, and I genuinely will try until it nearly kills me. I would also like to make a youtube series of animated videos which detail specific points in Corinthian that I frequently get asked about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this requires much time, and if I\u0027d like to make anything out of my MOBA I would need to, not now, but someday, hire a team to work on it with me, this could also be done for the animated videos, so here I am on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be grateful for so much as a single dollar pledge to my project, and frankly, with just a single pledge, it would stir enough motivation in me to keep pushing through, no matter how long these projects may take! I would greatly appreciate any support, and I will be sure to keep updating any progress I make on this project through here, as well as my facebook page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
