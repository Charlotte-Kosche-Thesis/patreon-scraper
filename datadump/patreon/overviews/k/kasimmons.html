Simmons. Welcome to my Patreon page, the digital launchpad for some totally stellar stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an author: I write novels, children\u2019s books, and short stories. My genres are science fiction, fantasy, and steampunk. My first novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Toymaker\u2019s Opera\u003c/em\u003e, is currently entering its final draft stages and will be ready for self-publication shortly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting in my spare time, however, is proving to be a slow and frustrating experience. My stories are new and exciting and sometimes subversive, and since I have so many of them stacked up in my mind behind \u003cem\u003eToymaker\u003c/em\u003e, I want to be able to share them with you all as soon as possible. To do that I need your support so that I don\u2019t have to work as many (or any) hours at a 9-5 job--so that I can write EVERY DAY instead of whenever I\u2019m not wiped out from work. Sneaking a few words in during the mornings and evenings just isn\u2019t cutting it any more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m here on Patreon to ask for you help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more money I\u2019m able to make as a writer means more blog posts, more free chapters, more books sooner rather than later, and being able to attend conventions to see all your lovely faces in person. Please consider chipping in; every little bit helps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003eKim"
