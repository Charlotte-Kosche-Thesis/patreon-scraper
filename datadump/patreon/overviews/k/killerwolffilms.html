    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the patreon page for KillerWolf Films owned by me, Len Kabasinski, director of films like SWAMP ZOMBIES, CURSE OF THE WOLF, FIST OF THE VAMPIRE, SKULL FOREST, and many more.\u00a0 Why is KillerWolf Films starting a patreon page\u00a0now? Well, simple...I would like the ability\u00a0to concentrate more\u00a0on giving our audience bigger and better projects in the future! With patreon, my goal is to also give\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e monthly content\u00a0produced by KillerWolf Films. For example, in being a patron to KillerWolf Films, you could receive monthly videos such as \"\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLen\u0027s forgotten movie den\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\" where I select films that many people may or may not know about and discuss why I loved the film and more (expect a ton of ninja movies with a good helping of other martial arts \u0026amp; horror films). Aside from the \"movie den\", there will be a \"\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eKillerWolf Films mailbag\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\" where I will answer questions submitted by patrons from all over the world. In addition to the two videos a month listed above, there are more perks such as \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emembership to the KillerWolf Films forum\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (where you can chat with other KWF fans/viewers about KWF or films in general), access to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emusical\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edownloads from KWF\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e composer Brian Lee, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emy personal KWF blog\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e where I talk about happenings past, present , and future for my films as well as discuss a ton of experiences I\u0027ve had along the way. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBehind-the-scenes footage and still pictures\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e of films will also be made available to patrons as well as a google hangout live chat with me once a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. So I hope you consider being a patron to KillerWolf Films and help us not only make some fun videos every month but also make you \u003cstrong\u003ebigger and better\u003c/strong\u003e films in the very near future!"
