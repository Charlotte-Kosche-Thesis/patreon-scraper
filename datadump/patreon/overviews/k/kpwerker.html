I\u0027m also a writer; in addition to writing books about creativity, I write two email newsletters a week (one about art/craft and activism; the other about general creative life).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy patrons help me by financially supporting my writing and the work I do to explore the ideas I end up writing about.

But it is the sort of thing that\u0027s very meaningful to both my readers and to me, personally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work includes writing two email newsletters every week \u2013\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/157831?v=6\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAction + Craft\u003c/a\u003e on Tuesdays, which is about the sweet spot where art and craft intersects with activism; and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kimwerker.com/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWeekly Digest\u003c/a\u003e on Fridays, which sums up the week and includes a no-experience-necessary project to try and a bunch of links to fuel your creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t get paid to write those newsletters, but I spend several hours each week preparing them.

It\u0027s not about how good we are at creating things \u2013 it\u0027s about how much fun we can have even if the end result is a total mess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last thirteen years, I\u0027ve worked as a crochet editor (at CrochetMe.com, the website I founded in 2004; and at \u003cem\u003eInterweave Crochet\u003c/em\u003e magazine), wrote six\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kimwerker.com/books\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e about crochet, taught three online crochet classes with Craftsy, burnt out on crochet and worked at a tech startup, challenged myself to make something \u2013 anything \u2013\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kimwerker.com/shop/ebook-year-making/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eevery day for a year\u003c/a\u003e (I\u0027m on my fourth year now), and realized that writing is my my favourite creative outlet and that teaching online is my favourite part of my career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mightyugly.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMighty Ugly\u003c/a\u003e is perhaps the most well-known project I do \u2013 it involves making something truly hideous on purpose in an effort to make ourselves feel more comfortable about the inevitability of making ugly things by accident as we learn how to make beautiful things. I wrote a book inspired by this project, called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amazon.com/Make-Mighty-Ugly-Exercises-Creative/dp/157061914X\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMake It Mighty Ugly\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the three of years since the book came out, I\u0027ve been obsessed with finding the \u003cstrong\u003efun\u003c/strong\u003e in our collective creative experience, and have loved experimenting with how to lead adventures in creativity. I\u0027ve learned that the best way to experiment is to share even the most harebrained ideas publicly, because I am terrible at predicting which ideas will resonate with people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich is where you and Patreon come in.\u003c/strong\u003e Because the timing of my successful\u00a0ideas is unpredictable, it\u0027s very hard for me to decide which ideas to pursue as potential revenue-generators to support my livelihood. It\u0027s untenable to try to create an online class, tutorial or ebook \u2013 an involved, time-consuming process \u2013 for \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of the ideas I think are brilliant when I first come up with them, but then turn out to be total duds when I release them into the world. And anyway, sometimes a thing that leads to the rare successful project is the feeling of spontaneity that comes with our shared surprise that it\u0027s \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a dud.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is a platform that\u0027s kind of like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, but instead of enabling a discrete project to be funded one time, it enables fans of a creator to support them on a continuing basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor someone like me, whose best work is often created on a whim and without warning, or best done as a form of writing that\u0027s hard to get paid for, the ability to be supported by predictable income will be a total revelation. Taking the fear and mystery out of my business will allow me to focus serious time and energy into making creative adventures whenever those great ideas pop up, and will relieve me (and you) of an endless cycle of product launches and sales promotions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, ongoing support enables me to produce the Compulsory Podcast \u2013 a half-hour interview show about what compels us to make things. Podcasts are notoriously difficult to generate income from, but rolling Compulsory into the blanket of \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of my creative work allows me, with your support, to keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk, so how does this work?

In other words, it\u0027s a straightforward way to support the relationship between creators and fans. For as little as $1 per month, you can become a patron of the arts by supporting my work, and I will create work that only patrons can get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DOES PATREON WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pledge to tip/pay an amount of your choosing to me every month. This income allows me to create meaningful work on a regular basis, and gives you access to exclusive rewards that only patrons get (check out the list of rewards over in the sidebar on the right). Every month, Patreon will charge you in the amount of your pledge. If you support more than one creator on Patreon (I support several, myself!), you can set a limit to the amount of money you spend each month so you can be sure to stay within your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimply put, Patreon makes it easy and rewarding to support the creators who enrich your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOn my end, each month Patreon makes the total amount of funds collected available to me (less their fees), providing me with a stable, predictable income to support my creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT EXACTLY IS IT THAT YOU CREATE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI create fun, creative adventures for grownups in the form of online classes, newsletters, ebooks, challenges, conversations, and a podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call myself a \u003cem\u003ecamp counselor for grown-ups\u003c/em\u003e because I think it best encompasses what I do. Camp is super fun for kids, but it also involves a whole lot of growing up \u2013 campers are away from home and their parents; they must try new things all the time; the relationships campers form with each other and with their counselors can be lifelong and profound. We adults don\u0027t go away to camp anymore, but we can still enjoy the benefits of trying new things and inviting fun and trustworthy people to lead us on adventures. I help people rediscover the joy of making things, without any pressure for those things to be \"perfect\" or \"pretty\" or even \"good.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve worked in the crafts and maker worlds for well over a decade as a teacher, writer, editor and speaker.
