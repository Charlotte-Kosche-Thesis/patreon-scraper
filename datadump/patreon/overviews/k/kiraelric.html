I\u2019m Kira Elric but feel free to call me Kira. I\u2019ve been making costumes since 2002, and active in the cosplay community since 2005. I\u2019m a professional seamstress, costume commissioner, and wig stylist. I\u2019ve made things from dresses to trench coats; vests to cowls. I hand pattern all of my work, and even do custom color dyes. I will be providing everything from early access to my latest works and my work in progress posts to behind-the-scenes content and live chats.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also intend to bring you guys tutorials, polls to pick future projects and the opportunity for customized personal items, plus some of you might even get to pick my cosplay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y9/kamui_Yamato/Patreon%20stuff/12118899_1657758811138246_2836512961884787277_n_zpst7g12ppg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e(Photo Credits: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/artisticaisecosplayphotography/\"\u003eArtisticaise Cosplay Photography\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay changed my life.

I want to be able to give people the confidence to make their own costumes and/ or just get involved with the community. I want to be able to inspire someone else in the way cosplayers inspired me when I first discovered it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s where you all come in.
