    "summary": "I have braved the big wide world of Patreon to try and help support myself and my passions. I am and have always been an odd ball searching for my place in a society where I simply don\u0027t belong, so instead I have created a world of my own: A world of art, of empathy, of expression, of creativity and freedom.\u003cbr\u003eMuch of my time is spent taking care of my son and a menagerie of animals, most of whom are rescues. Our goal in life should be to do the best by others and I consider that my top priority in everything I do. There is no kindness too small and I believe that sacrifice, understanding, patience, and hard work should be at the core of every action and decision you take.\u003cbr\u003eI am both behind and in front of the camera so moving forward I may also be sharing some of my photography of other models as well.\u003cbr\u003eI had been on an extended hiatus after a very large personal tragedy a year ago, but am full force trying to re-engage my gifts of creativity to share with my fellow man.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIm looking forward to having the opportunity to share this journey with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat to expect on this page: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the platform I am choosing to use to share my work. Much of my content will be FREE. That said, your donations provide supports for me not only creating but caring for my rescues and being here for my autistic son.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to see more of my critters and notifications when new art may be up please follow my Instagram! @Grand_canyon_tits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I want to intrinsically exist as myself, nothing more, and in my own humanity to feel at peace, at home, filled and fulfilled. I lust to feel at ease being tossed and turned in the ever changing tides of life and circumstance. I long to breathe and have the quiet peaceful awareness of each inhalation and exhalation, notice that the breathe of life is sweet. I mourn over the bitter truth that I can never and will never be enough in my own eyes and heart, that who I am or will become is largely inconsequential. That simple yet pervasive reality shatters my hopes to become something more. Still, whether or not there is anyone to hear this caged bird sing I intend to continue doing so from the depths of my broken heart. I have a need to exist as what \u201cI am\u201d and aspire to\u201d be\u201d regardless as to whether or not it seems sufficient or is even of consequence.\""
