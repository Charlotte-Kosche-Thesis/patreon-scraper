Using professional paint and materials ensures the quality of my art and that it will last forever. Which allows my art to appreciate in value as time goes on. More supplies, means more original paintings to be released, which means more prints, progress, and studio photos, speed paintings, in-depth tutorials and more each month that I can share with you, my lovely patrons! I will also be able to invest in studio lighting that will allow me to start filming more speed paintings, in-depth tutorials, host live streams, and just work more efficiently at night when needed.",
