    "summary": "This is the official Patreon page of pianist, composer and inspirator Kenny Werner. Over the past 4 years colleague and jazz singer Vivienne Aerts has been video recording my teachings on Effortless Mastery. Over the years she created a huge database of videos about the techniques of how to \u2018let the music play itself\u2019 and let go of the need to sound good. Besides this, I also gave a few classes on \u0027random composition\u0027, harmony, and other subjects.. and played a bunch of tunes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo now its time to share these with you!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this website, there will be new videos available, every week,\u00a0for subscribers to this patreon page.

Kenny\u2019s revolutionary process of Effortless\nMastery - originally meant for musicians to remove the blocks to their creative succes - was found to be equally\nvaluable and profound for the businessman inhibited by the consequences of his decisions, or the golfer and\nthe consequences of his next swing. It turns out that the process of Effortless Mastery releases the master\ncreator within everyone and is applicable to anything. Kenny will guide you through his process in videos, taken during retreats,\ntalks and master classes. Through intimate conversation and sparkling demonstrations at the piano, he will\nshow you how to enter what he calls \u201cthe space,\u201d a realm of effortless thinking, inspiration, and freedom in\nwhich creativity and confidence arise and grow naturally. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Kenny Werner\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKenny Werner has been a world class pianist and composer for over 40 years and is\nthe author of the landmark book \u003cem\u003eEffortless Mastery: Liberating The Master Musician\nWithin\u003c/em\u003e. The New York Times has called him a \u201cvirtuoso,\u201d the Boston Phoenix has\ncalled him \u201can extraordinary gifted artist,\u201d and his prolific compositions and\nrecordings have won National Endowment for the Arts grants, a Grammy Award\nnomination and a Guggenheim Fellowship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKenny has created videos, lectured worldwide, and authored many articles on how\npeople can discover the \u2018master creator within\u2019 through surrendering thoughts,\nwhich are the source of all unrest. Playing and practicing from \u201cthe space\u201d brings\none into the moment and away from the difficulties of the mind. Detaching from\nthe mind\u2019s thought habits connects one with their heart and true intellect.\nSpiritually, It connects one to the master creator within, to all that is; an ocean of\nconsciousness. Then one\u2019s actions naturally benefit all other living beings and the\nplanet in general. Those actions always create the right outcomes for one\u2019s own\nself. They bring the true happiness we\u2019ve been looking for, perhaps everywhere but\nfrom within. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Werner is a musician, the concepts presented are for every profession or life-style where there is a need for free-flowing, effortless thinking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book is available here: \u003ca href=\"http://kennywerner.com/effortless-mastery\"\u003ehttp://kennywerner.com/effortless-mastery\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eQUINCY JONES about Kenny Werner and the Effortless Mastery Book\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201c\u003cem\u003ePerfection. 360 degrees of soul and science in one\nhuman being.
