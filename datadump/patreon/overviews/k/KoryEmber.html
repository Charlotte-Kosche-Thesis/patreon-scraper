My name is Kory!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** GAME PAUSED **\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a cosplayer!\u00a0I went to my first convention, Otakon in 2011, woefully unprepared for the amazing chaos that is conventions. After that year, I decided I wanted to cosplay, but I wasn\u0027t sure what to create or how to go about creating and crafting. I ended up putting together a few rave outfits that fulfilled my want... for a little while. In 2013, I decided to go full throttle and attempt to make a Silent Hill nurse and Pyramid Head. \u003cbr\u003eI got amazing feedback and I fell in love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went back to Otakon in the following years after remaking my nurse dress and Pyramid Head\u0027s head. There was an even better response. I was totally hooked and ready to take on more challenges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wrTOOSt.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom then, I have made 2 versions of Poison Ivy, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aoXgRSa.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlake from Season 4 of RWBY, Lilith from Borderlands, and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MYPi5O6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point in my life, I have more time to dedicate to my passion, to making costumes and cosplaying with an amazing community. I ask that you think about becoming one of my patrons. It really does mean the absolute world to me and I thank you for even reading this far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile I have not experienced any flak when voicing my thoughts about joining Patreon as a creator, I know others have. The reason for me joining is I want this more than anything. I want to be able to do this 24/7, nonstop. That\u0027s my dream. Unfortunately, in the world we live in that means being able to make this a job, a business. By receiving money from Patrons I will be able to make more, bigger, better! Don\u0027t worry though. Even if you aren\u0027t able to contribute or don\u0027t want to, I will still be posting on my Facebook and Twitter. \u003cbr\u003eJust you thinking about it makes me warm and fuzzy inside.\u003cbr\u003e"
