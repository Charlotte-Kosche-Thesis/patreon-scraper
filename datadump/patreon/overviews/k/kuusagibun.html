I\u0027m from the Chicagoland area and I\u0027m a cosplayer, non-professional model, and convention goer! I\u0027ve been attending conventions and cosplaying since 2012, however, I\u0027ve been more avidly and actively attending conventions and cosplaying since Winter of 2015. I currently work alongside dogs because of my passion and love for them when I\u0027m not working on cosplays or planning in advance for conventions. I currently do not attend college but prefer to choose my dog-related jobs and cosplaying to be my full-time passions and what I do with myself. I occasionally stream on twitch and make YouTube videos, but overall, cosplay, modeling, and con-going are my priorities and favorite things to do. I have cosplayed characters like Toothless from \"How to Train Your Dragon\", Poison Ivy from DC Comics, Suicune from \"Pok\u00e9mon\", and more! Lately I\u0027ve been getting more into creating at least 75% of each of my cosplays whether they\u0027re armor cosplays or sewing cosplays, or mixes of the two! Some of my cosplays are standard clothing items pieced together to create cosplays while others of mine are made completely or nearly-completely from scratch! My goal alongside working with patreon is to be able to make more cosplays from scratch through the help and support of my patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/m3Murxu.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I have a patreon? I have a patreon to help assist in paying for cosplays, conventions, photoshoots, and the like. Yes, I could afford to do all of that without patreon. However, I would be able to do things less frequently. I wouldn\u0027t be able to afford things like: sewing materials, fabric and threads, eva foam and worbla, convention badges, transportation to and from the con, a space in a hotel room for a convention, outfits to model in, transportation to work with a photographer, paying to get a really good photographer, and more! With patreon, I\u0027ll be able to overall create material for my patrons more frequently because I\u0027ll be able to afford more materials more often in order to make better and cooler material for those subscribed!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/g45QNRE.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere does the money from your pledges go? Well I\u0027ll tell ya! All of the funds from pledges go towards learning about cosplaying, actually cosplaying, getting materials for cosplays, purchasing commissions, attending conventions, doing photoshoots, and more of the like! All of the funds come together in some way, shape, or form to crank out more material for patreon for you guys!\u003cbr\u003eYes I do subscribe to other creators, and that\u0027s so I can see how they make their cosplays and learn from them! And by learning, it still comes back to you because I\u0027ll gain talents to use in my cosplays and material for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/2FkvHNj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ekuusagi.contact@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003ekuusagi.vistaprintdigital.com/\u003cbr\u003efacebook.com/KuusagiBun\u003cbr\u003etwitter.com/CaseytheUsagi\u003cbr\u003einstagram.com/kuusagi_bun\u003c/div\u003e"

That sounds ridiculous but it will include blog posts about any kinky thoughts that go through my head, any shibari and bdsm-style shoots I do, any toy play photos(not including the lady bits), and anything else that goes along those lines. This is mostly for the personal outlet of anything I want to do but not particularly show to anyone.
