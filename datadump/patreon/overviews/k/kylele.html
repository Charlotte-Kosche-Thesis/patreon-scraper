    "summary": "Apil 2018 Update: I applied to grad school in SoCal. If I get in, I will probably attend. Though plans might change, as of writing this, that is my current plan. If I don\u0027t get in, that\u0027s another story. For now, as I wait for my applications results, I will hit the road to meet my viewers, Vietnamese people, old and new faces, and in June I will visit Vietnam to help a few causes, spend time with family and friends, and explore. Of course you will see all of this on video and on my YouTube Channel. Your support is appreciated. After mid July to August, I believe i won\u0027t travel as much as before. We\u0027ll see then...time will tell with the applications and life results. Thanks for hanging on with me and allowing me to follow my passions of video making. I don\u0027t know how good the videos will be moving forward or if im able to make full length documentaries anymore or just vlogs, but thank you for the support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt might take me a little bit longer than usual to upload, please be patient. Thank you. Be sure to follow me on Social media for up to date info and as always feel free to email me with any questions or concerns.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 2018 Update: As my 29th birthday approaches, I\u0027ve more or less concluded that I want to have a base again and no longer do YouTube or travel full time. I\u0027m in the process of looking for a day time job, may it be stationary or remote.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been on the road pretty much for almost a year and I need a break from burnout as well as gain other experiences.\u00a0 I will still create as many videos as possible - vlogs, short docs, travelogues. They might be from America or California mostly and they might mostly be vlogs. But I will try my best to occasional visit different states and nearby countries to keep exploring the Vietnamese diaspora. I will continue to use ALL Patreon money here towards the production of videos. For instance, transportation: Uber, Gas, Plane Tickets, travel and film equipment, accommodations ,specialty foods for video purposes, etc etc.\u00a0 I might release less videos than before, but I will still release videos as often as I can. I might not release for two weeks or more or You might not notice any difference. Maybe I\u0027ll release weekly. I don\u0027t know right now, all I know is that I\u0027ll keep trying to release as often as I can. If my new job does not allow me to make any videos at all, then I will shut down this Patreon. But if I am still able to, then your support is still greatly appreciated.\u00a0 My life is always changing and I might hit the road again Who knows?!. I also don\u0027t have any Vietnam videos now, but I might in the future, especially with your support. Your support allows me to do more, thus I can film more and make more videos. And I will continue to share my life and my friends with others. Thank you. If there\u0027s any questions, please write me. I\u0027d love to hear from you. Now, if any of you are unhappy with a different direction of videos or for whatever reasons you want to stop your support, I am nothing but grateful. No hard feelings, I completely understand that supporters are not being forced to support, but do so entirely on their own free will and for that I have nothing but gratitude. But just remember, like the evolution of my life and channel, who knows what\u0027s coming up next. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJanuary 2018 Update: I\u0027m still on the road exploring various places, seeing old faces, and new faces with the Vietnamese diaspora in mind. Trying to figure out a new place to put down a base. This is a transitional period so you might see less documentaries and more vlogs (someone of you prefer vlogs) as I attempt to try new endeavors beyond YouTube. Again, if future outside work or any other reasons do not allow me to make YouTube videos (vlogs, short docs, any videos at all) then I will close this account. But in the mean time, your support allows me to film and produce more content. So thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeptember 2017 Update: I\u0027m hitting the road again to film as much content and to meet as many Vietnamese people living abroad as possible. Again, if I\u0027m unable to produce videos, I will shut this Patreon down. But in the meantime, your support is ever so appreciated. I can\u0027t wait for you to see some really great videos coming up. Your supportive contribution is used exclusively for the making of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarch 2017 Update: Even though I have left Vietnam, I will continue to produce from my backlog of videos. Many of which feature Vietnam or Vietnam related content. When I can no longer produce any type of videos on YouTube due to new careers and endeavors on a consistent basis I will shut down this Patreon. Thank you all for your support. Your continued support will help me make even more content. \u00a0Again, Patreon support is used entirely to fund the creation of the videos and nothing else. \u00a0Therefore, no new videos means no more Patreon. I will not take your money if I can not make videos. It\u0027s as simple as that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho I am: Hi, I\u0027m Kyle. Right after university I sojourned to Vietnam to work in education for a year. A year has since turned into five. And throughout these many years I have brought viewers along for the ride in the motherland on my blog at \u003ca href=\"http://www.KyleLe.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.KyleLe.net\u003c/a\u003e and more recently on my YouTube Channel at \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/KyleLeDotNet.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyoutube.com/KyleLeDotNet\u003c/a\u003e I\u0027ve made it my passion and dedication to bring to you quality content from Vietnam and Asia with the utmost consistency and depth. I\u0027ve traveled to every major Vietnamese city and so many neighboring countries around Vietnam. I also feature interesting people and Viet kieus from all over the world with similar interests. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Video production isn\u0027t free and requires a lot of money to fund projects and documentaries. From airfare to hotels to transportation, film equipment, hard drives,\u00a0 memory cards, cameras, etc etc. (5 Star Hotels are Sponsored / business opportunities (I don\u0027t get paid to make hotel review videos, just a place to stay) and I never use Patreon money to stay at fancy places. I\u0027m constantly figuring out ways to improve my videos. You have definitely seen an improvement over the years. \u00a0YouTube earnings and all Patreon goes back into funding more travel expenses and equipment and thus the creation of more videos. It\u0027s a constant investment back into the product, hoping that this will lead into some career or something bigger. Remember, you\u0027re not paying me just to travel, \u00a0this is support that enables me to make videos that you and others have enjoyed. Think of it like buying a movie ticket to support your favorite action star in their next movie release or supporting a local artists by buying their painting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not already rich, how can you travel so much? Again, I use my YouTube revenue and all Patreon money back towards videos, which means travel. \u00a0It\u0027s a constant reinvestment into creating better and better content. More and more locations and videos. From vlogs to documentaries.\u00a0 I also try to travel as cheaply as possible. But sometimes, it\u0027s not possible to. You\u0027ve seen me take super long lay overs just to save money. I don\u0027t eat lavish food like you see on camera all the time. I\u0027ve slept at airports to save money. I eat pizza slices often. Viewers let me couch surf. There\u0027s many things off camera that you don\u0027t see in order for me to bring you content that you do see on camera.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo production of my quality, quantity, frequency, and depth require a lot of money to produce. Do your own research! My average video views is so low, while some videos costs hundreds and thousands of dollars to produce. Sites like Social Blade only offer estimations, often extreme wide estimates, and not concrete proof. Just google \"is Social Blade Accurate\" and find out for yourself. Small Youtubers like myself are not making the big bucks and sponsorships are few and far in between and can not entirely fund video production.\u00a0Remember, I\u0027m not just sitting in front of a camera and talking, I\u0027m actually taking you guys to so many places all over the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you have appreciated and enjoyed what I\u0027ve done so far and want to ensure more, then please consider supporting so I can keep churning out content of Vietnamese and Viet Kieu people abroad and many new stories and places beyond Vietnam and Vietnamese diaspora with many other countries possible and taking you to places that were once familiar to you and places you didn\u0027t know existed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t offer you much in return, except you have direct access to me. Also, sometimes you\u0027ll get early screenings of videos. I can\u0027t promise this because I\u0027m always behind on videos. But more importantly, just know you\u0027re helping me create videos that younger generations can relate to and learn from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I only want you to support if you appreciate the effort I\u0027ve put in over the years and the continued awesome video releases.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e No one is forcing you. This is all entirely optional and out of your own generosity. I\u0027m only one guy by myself, so any amount is appreciated and you see directly where your money goes. BACK INTO GREAT ORIGINAL CONTENT!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
