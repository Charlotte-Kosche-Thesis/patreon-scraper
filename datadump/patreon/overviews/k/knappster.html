But whenever possible I like to remove intermediaries so that I work directly for, and am accountable directly to, my readers and listeners. And my preferred revenue model has always been \"throw it out there for free and ask those who like it to pay me what they think it\u0027s worth.\" I was pleased to find that Patreon is built to facilitate exactly that revenue model. So here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current projects include the KN@PPSTER blog, op-eds for the William Lloyd Garrison Center for Advocacy Journalism, the KN@PP Stir Podcast, and various and sundry other things.\u003cbr\u003e"
