Some of you have even attended my events and social experiments.\u00a0 For a few years now I\u0027ve been using social media to share the art that I\u0027ve created and to connect with others who create, appreciate, or both. The industry for the arts is rapidly changing. With the help of the internet and sites like Patreon artists are allowed to connect with their fans and patrons directly. It used to be you had to go through a gallery or manager but now you can speak one on one with the artist, seeing how they work, new art as it\u0027s being made, and offering input as well as the financial means to make dreams and goals into a reality. One of the beautiful things about change is allows for new solutions. This is a guilt free environment. I make art and you enjoy art. I will keep posting my art publicly and for free. When you become a patron you are saying \"I appreciate you.\" By providing financial means it makes it easier for me to continue to create without interruption. I\u0027m currently working onto decks and a solo show. You\u0027ll also get to see in progress and process shots. I want to do bigger and better things, large shows, huge events and I want you to be a part of it. So I hope you\u0027ll join me on this crazy caravan we call life.\u00a0 I\u0027m excited about this new venture and hope you are too. You can check out my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.katelanfoisy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eWhy monthly?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work in a gamut of mediums but my subjects all pertain to the alchemy of life. I want to offer you a range of different art, right down to my process and travels. Many of those things inspire the next piece. Some of these projects take longer than others, so a per project pledge wouldn\u0027t really work. Monthly pledges aid in the financial stability allowing me to focus on the work rather than finding other means to stay afloat. Below are some of the projects I\u0027d like to do and goals I\u0027d like to attain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Hire my right hand lady. You know her as Lectas Portal. I know her as godsend.

     "description": "In 1997 Kenneth Ransom was killed by lethal injection in a Texas prison after thirteen years on death row. Despite actions by Amnesty International, numerous evidence proving his innocence, and pleas for release from religious leaders he met his fate. His last words: \u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I feel like this is God\u2019s will. I feel like I\u2019m the \ninstrument in hopefully abolishing the death penalty forever.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eKnowing the state was in the wrong, police stopped the funeral convoy and escorted him along with police\n helicopters to be buried. The funeral was paid for by nuns in \nEngland and the mosque of his spiritual adviser. Kenneth left behind two sons, a fiancee, and a wish to be pardoned. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe postcards will go to inmates that have been unjustly imprisoned. Kenneth\u0027s fiancee and I will be sending some to a forensic psychologist working with prisoners on death row in NC but anyone who would like to have a postcard sent or knows an inmate that would like one is welcome to request one. The front side of the postcard is the portrait of Kenneth as seen on my profile page #772 \"I\u0027m the instrument...\" The back will be this poem he wrote while incarcerated. Both are posted below. If this goes well we are hoping to start other services such as poetry programs etc. The amount made here goes to postage, envelopes, and extra printing of cards. We have a starting run of 1000. You can comment here or send me a message to request one once we make the goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will post in progress shots so you can keep up with the project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1297.photobucket.com/albums/ag32/Katelan_Foisy/28bf94b1-3bf2-4b25-922e-f53c5eced94f_zpsltkzy51z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
