    "summary": "Hey Folks!\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t describe how excited I am about Patreon and all the possibilities it presents for content creators like myself. I have always been terrible asking for donations, and felt sorry for those few who donate money for things I create. Now there is an easy and equal chance for everyone to be part of the creations I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are these creations then? They are wide and varied. I have always been extremely interested in Linux and BSD, and been running various sized servers since elementary school. Game servers are some sort of a passion of mine, as are external tools for many games I enjoy playing. A few examples of those are listed here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRagnarok Online market scanner for bargain deals\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRunescape market tools\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTravian simulator for counting the best starting strategy, separate food calculator for supporters of World Miracle construction\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEVE Online market profit calculator, separate tool for miner kills to find unfortunate miners at certain region and recruiting them\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEVEScout, intelligence gathering service\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVarious parsers for many game outputs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emany many others, already downed services\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThere has been a wide variety of servers that I have been running. I own an IRC network, I provide a Mumble server for people to use. There have been dozens of various Minecraft servers, I have kept OpenTTD servers, Arma2 servers, and even some grey area servers. These need resources which require money. As it is my passion I keep doing those but I like people helping me with these costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not least, I have a desire to create my own games. I have a few really good ideas but I want to gather a community around these creations from the very beginning and get them involved in the game development. Platforms which I have planned supporting are browser based games, some PC games and possibly mobile games (Android first, others may come later).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you will have a chance to help me fund some of these servers. But even a bigger thing is the support you give, showing that I am on the right track. As a Patron you also have a say in the games and the tools I make, maybe even getting something useful for your own gaming experience too. Not a bad deal I\u0027d say?\u003cbr\u003e"
