We do whatever we can in our free time to give our light novel reading fans what they want exactly to read to the fullest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eI just thought my team and I could use some motivation to help speed up our translations. Also, the things is, mainly for myself, my little vice administrator and I don\u0027t wanna ask our parents for allowance, plus I\u0027m going to try and use the money to upgrade our website into a premium version, so that it will not have to stay as the free version any longer. Plus I\u0027m kinda looking forward to try and make this hobby into a full time thing in the future, so that we don\u0027t have to work at an office job or spend less time translating any series for you guys to read and that you\u0027ll get your releases a lot faster than before. So I hope you guys will help us out and make that a dream come true."
