Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that\u0027s not just true for children. I think that is true for \u003cem\u003eall \u003c/em\u003eof us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe \u003cstrong\u003eneed\u003c/strong\u003e heroes. We \u003cstrong\u003eneed\u003c/strong\u003e to hear stories of courage, of people who are steadfast in their defense of others, of people who stand against the darkness. We are \u003cstrong\u003eall\u003c/strong\u003e made better by these tales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u0027s one defining element of my writing, that\u0027s it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write science fiction and fantasy. More than that, I write tales of heroes - people who face their fear, and stand up against the odds for what they believe is write. My heroes make mistakes, but ultimately they all have one thing in common: they strive to do the right thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figure we could all use a little of that in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets me reach out to you directly. It lets me drop a copy of my book into your mailbox - in any format you want. People who support here at the $3 tier or higher will get a copy of the ebook format for every new book I produce, and they\u0027ll get them earlier than ANYONE else. That will almost always be at least one new book per month. This is the ONLY way to get my books in ePub format (but you\u0027ll get the Kindle format too, if you prefer that!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got awesome rewards for the higher tiers as well. From postcards to signed paperbacks, I\u0027ve set things up so that readers who opt to pitch in at those levels will all have something cool as a benefit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve wanted to tell stories for a living since I was seven. That\u0027s when I wrote my first short story. I\u0027ve come a long way since then, with over a dozen novels available. I\u0027ve got many more stories in me, though, and I look forward to sharing them all with you in the years ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you SO much for joining me on Patreon! Enjoy the stories!"
