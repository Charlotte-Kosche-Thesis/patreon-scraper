Welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhether you just stumbled upon my page by chance or were referred to it, I\u0027m delighted that you\u0027re here and are willing to give my art the time of day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe All Have Our Reasons...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUp until recently, my main inspiration for creating was so that I could\n give my art to friends and family. I have always found handcrafted gifts\n to be the most meaningful. If I have a recipient in mind, it makes the \nprocess of developing concepts, goals, and deadlines for each piece \nhappen much quicker.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAs a full-time nanny, I have a lot of time to reflect on the subtle \nintricacies that are often overlooked in the day-to-day. Not long before\n creating this page, I reached the point where I could no long resist my\n urges to act out these observations in the form of visual art.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have only recently discovered a \u003cstrong\u003estrong \u003c/strong\u003einterest in Watercolor as well\n \nas Pointilism with pen, as well as the \u003cstrong\u003estrong \u003c/strong\u003efinancial strain the \nneeded materials can cause. My profession offers me all the time for \nreflection, incubation, and actual creating one could ask for in a \nprofession. However, it does not quite offer the ability to afford all the \nmaterials necessary to expand my art to its full potential. So receiving\n some help in that regard is definitely one incentive for making this \npage. Of course, the opportunity to network is equally important to me, \nbut what is most important to me is simply that my art is seen by \nothers.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Join Me. Please?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you join and support my Patreon page, you will be giving me all that much more inspiration as I will consider you as part of my viewing community. If you join, you will have the chance to receive exclusive art from me, as well as a deeper look into my process that few get the chance to see. Rest assured, you will also become the inspiration for the art which is being created.\u003cbr\u003e"
