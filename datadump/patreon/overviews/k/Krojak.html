I\u0027m a YouTube Content Creator who has been putting out daily videos for the past two years. I\u0027ve created more than 1000 videos in pursuit of my dream of being a big YouTuber, and I\u0027m not stopping any time soon. I\u0027m a husband to my lovely wife Mrs Krojak, a gamer with a passion for sports, and a bit of a closet geek! Without the support of my amazing patrons, this dream would not be possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i394.photobucket.com/albums/pp22/Krojak/2_zps8yp1cna5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn July of 2015 I created this Patreon page, and since then we have achieved the dream of doing YouTube full time since we started, and I\u0027m so blessed to have such a strong, passionate, and positive community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon community is here for you.

This means more detailed videos, feature videos including collaborations with other awesome creators, and much more.
