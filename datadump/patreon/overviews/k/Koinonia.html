    "summary": "The word Koinonia has a threefold meaning \u2013 Intimacy, Community, and \nCommunion \u2013 defining the threefold purpose of Koinonia events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese evening rituals were created to move beyond sex positive spaces\n into Person Positive spaces, welcoming not only the sensual, but also \nthe intellectual, emotional, physical, and spiritual facets of the human\n experience. They strive to include people of all genders, orientations,\n bodies, and racial/cultural backgrounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWeaving together magical ritual, safer sex protocol, and a skilled \nteam of facilitators, Koinonia offers a safe and sacred space that is \nmore than a sex party \u2013 extending permission to every facet of the \nindividual, sows the seeds of community, and opening a doorway into \nTribe. Koinonia was a Sexual Freedom Awards Finalist in 2016. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so deeply grateful to everyone who has stepped through our doors time and again, and in doing so allowed us to continue to create this magic that we love so much, over three years, and three different venues. We want to nourish and build that community, as well as spread our wings a little more and perhaps run the ocassional event in other parts of the UK and Europe. This Patreon account represents a new step in that direction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Koinonia Patron, you\u0027ll be playing a unique role in ensuring the contunuity and growth of these events, allowing us to better balance accessibility (keeping our tickets affordable, and offering concessions to those in need) with sustainability (creating a fair exchange for the creators, and allowing us to cover our costs and give back to our Terrific Team). You can also help us to expand our kit for these events, whether with an exciting addition to our toybox, or that new soundsystem we\u0027re so very much in need of. Furthermore, if enough of you sign up, we plan to run some sweet, Koinonia-flavoured houseparties just for our Patrons and their guests!\u003cbr\u003e"
