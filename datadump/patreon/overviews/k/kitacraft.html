    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI\u0027m really excited to be able to bring everyone a series that has been in the making for over a decade!\u00a0 I took some familiar themes in fantasy and decided to tackle them from a different angle so never take anything at surface value for this one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Truth about Heroes, aka the Heroes Trilogy, currently has three published books-- One of Many, Two Sides to Everything and Menage a Trois. Release dates for the next six are(were) as follows:\u003cbr\u003eA World Reborn: Children of Heroes- April 20, 2018\u003cbr\u003eA World Reborn: Higher Reasoning- May 11, 2018\u003cbr\u003eA World Reborn: Deicide- June 1, 2018\u003cbr\u003eA World Reborn: Complete Trilogy Edition- June 1, 2018\u003cbr\u003eEach Endless Universe: Close Encounters- June 15, 2018\u003cbr\u003eEach Endless Universe: Dual Decision- June 29, 2018\u003cbr\u003eEach Endless Universe: Original Sin- July 11, 2018\u003cbr\u003eEach Endless Universe: Complete Trilogy Edition- July 11, 2018\u003cbr\u003e*The last release date coincides with my birthday, not because I\u0027m avoiding Friday the 13th.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the elements include:\u003cbr\u003e*animal-human hybrids\u003cbr\u003e*complex lore and mythology\u003cbr\u003e*adult human interactions\u003cbr\u003e*war and violence\u003cbr\u003e*characters with developed psychological structures\u003cbr\u003e*industrialization and invention\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are nine books planned with the possibility for more set in this world.\u00a0 I began illustrating them but plans changed and I\u0027ve opted to focus my art elsewhere. They will be released as trilogies, starting with the Heroes trilogy then preceding to the World and Universe trilogies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an adult fantasy adventure series, incorporating elements of eroticism and disturbing violence, so it isn\u0027t intended for all audiences. \u00a0Epic gamers will be familiar with the format of a large cast of characters whose lives and actions intertwine to tell the story. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not play with unnecessary filler text. \u00a0These books currently run 300-450 pages in print, less in ebook format.\u00a0 The covers for the first series are complete as well, so no additional time needs to be dedicated to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there\u0027s the next big project. A separate four book series is in progress, still adult, but this one is more action, less sex, and each story centers around a different cast of characters. UnNamed has been written, currently working on UnSung. UnNamed centers around a mercenary returning to a city he usually endeavors to avoid to retrieve an artifact he left with the kid. He had a general idea of what to do with it, but when it reacts to the kid, he ends up with a reluctant partner in his dangerous mission to seek answers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also a YA fantasy I\u0027m working on involving two young women immersed in steampunk culture and world-hopping adventures and a sci-fi thriller about a detective and a forensic scientist working to uncover the culprits behind a series of strange murders in the world\u0027s first underwater city. Expect to see these no later than 2020.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for where my illustrative focus is going (aside from cover design), I am working on a web comic titled Rock my World which will pop up on Line WebToon sometime this year, if I can get that organized as planned. It is a sci-fi romantic comedy about an early childhood psychologist that befriends a stranded alien. It\u0027s not the only web comic idea I have, but I\u0027ve probably got some heads spinning at this point, so let\u0027s leave it at that for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it sounds crazy ambitious, but it\u0027s doable and I like to stay busy. I\u0027m still new to this, finally gaining the courage to publish back in August 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m crap at marketing and I\u0027m not the sort to lie and insist my work is for everyone.\u00a0 If it is for you and you know someone else who might like it, spread the word! I\u0027m always open to suggestions for improvements. Please visit my website http://crimsonmoonchild.wixsite.com/kristagossettauthor for more details. Currently, it\u0027s a portal for books and book-related art, but I may link my webtoons to it later as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve barely gotten started and don\u0027t intend to go anywhere but up from here. There are many stories to be told!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
