It\u0027 s been a life long passion to make comics full time.\u003cbr\u003e\n Not only that, I\u0027d like to just focus on making creator owned comics for a living and not have to work on other people\u0027s books. I enjoy drawing but would much rather do my own thing. \u003cstrong\u003eFocusing on my own characters and stories is my goal and I would love to take you along for the ride.\u003c/strong\u003e I work a full time job which stretches my creation time thin and limits my time to write/ draw my own comics. Not just that, but when taking on client work on the side, I have to sacrifice that already limited time to work on art for others.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy main goal is to be able to quit my full time job and \u003cstrong\u003efocus\u00a0solely\u00a0on making comics full time\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and dedicating my time to fueling my dreams of making my Slayer comic and other creator owned comics for a living. I know this won\u0027t be easy and may take years to become a reality but Patreon is a place where I can reach my audience and along with your help, anything is possible!

He will stop at nothing to rid the deadly streets of Overlook City from evil and loosen the stranglehold that the sinister Crime Lord, \"Anthony Valco\" has had on the city for decades. Wanted by the police, marked for death by the mob, and a mystery to all, he is the cities last hope for\u00a0salvation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://s104.photobucket.com/user/midnighthorizon/media/cover%20final%20darker_zps4b4ui9ha.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m183/midnighthorizon/cover%20final%20darker_zps4b4ui9ha.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"

I have a love for all comics but those were the ones that I enjoyed the most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Slayer back when I was a kid. My newest incarnation of Slayer has been in the works for years. He is a suped up Ninja/Vigilante living in a corrupt city where the mob runs things. With only a few good cops left in this crime infested city, Slayer is on a mission to bring down the Crime Lord known as Anthony Valco and bring peace back to the people of Overlook City!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal here is to be able to work on my Slayer series as well as publish my horror anthology titled After Midnight. It\u0027s a compilation of short horror stories from myself and many other talented writers and artists. With the help of Patreon, I can help fund these books as well as gain a fan base and be allowed more time to focus on making comics as I gain the income allowed to turn away client work and focus on my own comics.",
