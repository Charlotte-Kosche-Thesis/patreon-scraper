NaNo (National Novel Writing Month) for ten years.\u00a0 If you haven\u0027t heard of it, the challenge is to write a 40k word novella entirely in the month of November.\u00a0 Most of \u003ca href=\"http://nanowrimo.org/participants/ascillian\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy NaNo\u003c/a\u003e projects have been fiction, and I love to write stories that involve magic or supernatural creatures of some kind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love being able to provide my writing to whomever wished to read it, and my blog will continue to be free.\u00a0 But it has always been a dream of mine to be a published author, and I feel this is a great first step.\u00a0 Pledges will help me to continue to have the time and freedom to write (instead of needing to pick up a traditional job).\u00a0 I would also love to have the money to be able to support other members of the Pagan community by purchasing their products or services (which I currently am rarely able to do).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you enjoy my writing, and I would be honored and so very grateful if you decide to make a pledge.\u00a0 May your days be blessed with love and laughter and your nights filled with sweet dreams!\u003cbr\u003e"
