This is the NEW Patreon page for Kathryn Colleen and KOABD.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI study what I call LIFE THEORY \u2013 how this life works, what it means to be human \u2013 what experiences are unique and what are true for all of us? I want to know which rules are law and which can be broken \u2013 testing the fences of this adventure we call existence through the lens of Music, Art, Writing, Philosophy and Science.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSongs, Essays and Art are a means to explore, study, understand and express. I write essays about my observations, I write songs to force myself to find just exactly the right small number of words and sounds to encapsulate an idea, and I make art when all else fails to give me insight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision for our circle of Patrons is \u003cstrong\u003ea worldwide group of friends, all experimenting to figure out the rules of life, and sharing that with each other.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I imagine meetups that are like beatnik revivals - a group of 10-20 of us in a coffee shop or other venue; we all bring whatever music gear, art gear, spoken word, or just ourselves. We play music together, share insights, share art, \u00a0discuss life theory and feel connected as people with like minds and like curiosity. We have a world full of friends - amazing people with whom we meet, discuss and discover. We have real discussions \u00a0in the most open way about the intersection of Science, Art, Music, Philosophy and how it all informs our theory of life and being human.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe gather at the discussion page at KathrynColleen.com. As we grow the circle of friends,\u00a0join in discussions and get the latest essays, songs and art delivered right to your inbox.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me on this journey!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Love, KC\u003cbr\u003e"
