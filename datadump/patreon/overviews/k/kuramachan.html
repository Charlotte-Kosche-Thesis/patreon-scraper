    "summary": "Kurama:\u003cbr\u003eHello!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m known as Kurama-chan in my art websites, nice to meet you! I live in Brazil and currently work as a psychologist in a public hospital. 3 times a week, I make art groups with patients. Since I was a child, I really took an interest in art, and as time passed, it transformed into a passion. I believe in art as a pure form of showing feelings and expressing them to the world. For me, there is no \"wrong\" or \"correct\" art, since each person has an unique mind.\u003cbr\u003eI also work as a\nfreelance-illustrator, and you can see most of my completed commissions in my DeviantART page. One of the things I most love is to see a client happy and satisfied when I present my finished work. Their hapiness is also my hapiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout what I draw:\u003cbr\u003eI mostly do Anime Art, but I can also change to cartoon style and semi realism style. I specially like how anime is expressive, since the favorites parts I like to draw are faces and expressions.\u003cbr\u003eMy tastes are very ecletic, so you\u0027ll find different types of themes in my gallery. I like drawing men as much as I like drawing women. I like all types of love, as long as there is consent by both parts. I like drawing people as well as animals. I like scenarios. I like practicing things I never drew before. When I have time, I like to get away from my confort zone and do challenges. I enjoy many things, haha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a dream. I want to live just with what I love. I want to earn my life just with my drawings. I want people to enjoy what they see and feel special when they see my creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYuu:\u003cbr\u003eYaharo~I\u0027m Yuu, also known as Yukiko-Kun on DeviantArt, nice to meet you! I live in Brazil as well as work as a secretary in the same hospital as KuuChan. I\u0027ve been drawing since 10 and writing since 7, those are my two favourite activities and quite honestly I wouldn\u0027t be able to mantain my sanity without them. I like pastel colors, cute stuff in general, ribbons, frills and lace. But I also love gruesome story with bittersweet and/or bad endings and the never ending anguis of the protagonist usually makes me beam~ Those are my favourite things. I work with commissions as well, so feel free to contact me if you want anything specific!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout what I draw: I also enjoy anime a lot, but experiencing with new styles is usually fun. For drawings I like vibrant, saturated colors the most, drawings full of contrast and hur variation are the best and I\u0027m always happy yo know new ways of implementing color variations to my art style. I\u0027ve been dawing women for most of my life, so quite honestly I\u0027d love to have a patreon who\u0027d want some +18 men as well. *eyebrow wiggle* Cute, sexy, gory, everything at once, I like drawing a variety of stuff and will try my best to convey my feelings through the art! If you\u0027re willing to become my patron, it\u0027ll be an honor to do everything I can in order to make it worth! Drawing is my passion and it\u0027d be super duper awesome to be able to make a living out of, especially if it\u0027s about my own stories with KuuChan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE COME HELP MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE!\u003cbr\u003e"
