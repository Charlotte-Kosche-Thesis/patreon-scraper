    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHello there! And thank you so much for visiting my Patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a creator on here I am\u00a0making the journey towards my goal of becoming fully self employed as an artist and ditching my part time\u00a0job at last\u00a0(yesss!) Working on my own folktale illustration\u00a0work as well as commissioned pieces for others. I have so many ideas! I am stuffed to the gunnels with strange beasts\u00a0and tales of wonder after so many years of working on folktales books for others. I want to collaborate\u00a0with storytellers I know both in Britain and abroad\u00a0on exciting book and performance projects that bring no immediate financial return but will create amazing art and storytelling experiences for people, this is near impossible at the moment due to financial constraints. I am determined that\u00a0will change and \u00a0you can become a\u00a0part of this unfolding adventure\u00a0by becoming my patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eart as storytelling, art that makes you want to know the story, art that you can weave your own story around. a whole world of magic\u00a0is out there ready to be\u00a0made\u00a0visible. gather around my campfire my friends and let me show you what I see.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI look forward so much to being able to\u00a0share all of this with you, the folks\u00a0who say \u0027on you go now, do all the things\u0027\u00a0 because\u00a0taking risks on more speculative work is key for me now.\u00a0I have always cherished the direct relationship I have with people who enjoy my work on social media\u00a0and I post about my work in progress and my process there regularly.\u00a0Patreon feels even more direct, you folks are my biggest fans, my community, my people.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e You\u00a0will get access to all of my updates\u00a0plus some patron only\u00a0content and offers too. As well as recieving a little something\u00a0in the post from time to time and discounts on my art prints, books\u00a0and original art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my\u00a0first goals with your help is to work on my Moroccan/Scottish tales project, one of my \u0027mostly still in my head\u0027 projects which involves working with parallel stories from the Moroccan Sahara, a place I love hugely and Scotland, my Dad\u0027s country, and also dear to me. I will be sharing my progress with this (made possible by you, my fantastic patrons!) my experiences in Morocco, my love of the desert (Camels, weird plants, cuddly camel spiders, occasional beautiful glimpses of Gazelle and glorious star filled nights...and more camels, I really like camels...) the names of my reward tiers reflect my passion for this special place...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a gallery of my work and my \"cover stories and other illustrator tales\" blog pop over to my website. \u003cbr\u003ekatherinesoutarillustration.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
