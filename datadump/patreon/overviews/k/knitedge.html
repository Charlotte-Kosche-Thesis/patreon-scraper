(You can see/buy back issues on Ravelry\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/periodicals/knit-edge\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e). Our original vision, to publish long form knitting content (such as articles or tutorials), along with selected patterns, continues. We\u0027ve de-emphasized patterns compared to other knitting magazines because we believe there are many, many places to find patterns and not as many sources of writing \u003cem\u003eabout\u003c/em\u003e knitting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe publishing world has been in a transitional stage for the past several years; the knit publishing world even more so. We founded Knit Edge with a traditional annual subscription model based on publishing three digital magazine issues per year. As the company has grown and changed, and as we\u0027ve brought on a new editor and a freelance staff located all over the US, we\u0027ve realized that the Patreon pay-per-new-release model is much more effective for what we want to do going forward. Not to mention there\u0027s the opportunity to help us build some new things for our readers, including educational events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging a payment each time a new issue is released, you\u0027re helping us pay our contributors and staffers fairly, and giving us a budget to develop these events and other materials (such as best-of books from the previous issues and more).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecent discussions on social media about #FairFiberWage have really hit home for us. Cooperative Press has paid a higher royalty percentage than any other fiber publisher since day one. We would like to similarly push for change in payouts to instructors, magazine contributors and everyone else that works to create the knitting content you love. But we can\u0027t do that without money. If you believe as we do that knitting talent deserve better treatment and payment, please pledge to keep Knit Edge running and growing. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
