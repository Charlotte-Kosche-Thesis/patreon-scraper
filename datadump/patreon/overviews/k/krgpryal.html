I\u0027m so grateful that you are here.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m an essayist, blogger, small-press author, and activist.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLet\u0027s talk about essay writing and activism.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMuch of my work focuses on disability rights\u2014in particular the rights of those with psychiatric disabilities\u2014and sexual violence. Sometimes I talk about the two things together. I\u0027m fun at parties.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy work has appeared in \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Toast, Motherwell Magazine, Full Grown People\u003c/strong\u003e, and other venues. Most of these venues\u2014which are wonderful, amazing places to writer for\u2014pay somewhere between nothing and $100. I do not make a living wage from my essays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditionally, I do a lot of timely activist writing for free. This work is crucial when getting the word out quickly is more important than placing it in a big-name journal. Patreon support will allow me to do more fast-paced, activist writing. When I have to make a choice between writing something for money in order to feed my kids and writing something for free that is urgent and will help make the world a better place, I have to choose the first one. Your patronage makes it possible for me to choose the second one.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn short, your support will help me and the people I work with\u00a0continue to push the world in the right direction. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLet\u0027s talk about fiction writing.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI write #ownvoices fiction about women and men who\u0027ve been through some real stuff: sexual assault, abuse, mental illness, and more. (To learn more about what #ownvoices means, go to the source:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.corinneduyvis.net/ownvoices/\"\u003ehttp://www.corinneduyvis.net/ownvoices/\u003c/a\u003e.) I publish exclusively with small presses, and I do not make a lot of money. But these are important stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy most recent novel, FALLOUT GIRL, features a main character who has bipolar disorder. As I wrote in a recent interview about the book:\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eI wanted to write a character with a psychiatric disability, in particular, bipolar disorder. As I discuss in the author\u2019s note in the back of the book, it was really important to me to get Miranda\u2019s character right, and to do right by her as a disabled character. Disabled characters rarely get represented in fiction, and when they do, they rarely get represented well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example, a disabled person lives her life without contemplating being disabled all the time. If being disabled is a character\u2019s normal, it ceases to be something she constantly thinks about. Just like non-disabled people, a disabled person has stuff to do, like laundry or going to the post office. While she is going to the post office, she is unlikely to be thinking things like this: \u201cI\u2019m a bipolar person going to the post office. As a bipolar person going to the post office, my experience of the world is different than those who are not bipolar people going to the post office.\u201d Probably being bipolar won\u2019t cross her mind at all. Probably she\u2019ll be wondering if the post office takes Amex, or if the line will be long because of the holidays.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that\u2019s not how disabled folks are usually depicted in fiction or film. Instead, they\u2019re depicted as always talking about or thinking about being disabled. I didn\u2019t want that for Miranda. I wanted to do better than that.\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLet\u0027s talk about this patreon page.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, my Patreon page is relatively new. To my first, early patrons: you are near and dear to my heart. I will always know who you are, in part because I wrote your names down so that I can give you things as this page grows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven the smallest donors get things. You will get ebooks. I will post, on this page, drafts of novellas and other publications in serial format. They have to be in draft form so that I do not lose the rights to publish them elsewhere. Higher level patrons will receive actual published copies of my books along with access to these early drafts. ALL of my patrons can email me to talk to me about my writing and my work:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSend me ideas for essays and other activist writing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSend me tips about injustices you\u0027ve observed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid you find an error in a draft story?
