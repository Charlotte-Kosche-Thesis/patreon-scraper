    "summary": "Kama Jiu-Jitsu has a dream to spread Rickson Gracie\u0027s Jiu-Jitsu to everyone. We believe that Jiu-Jitsu is more than just moves and techniques but a mindset. Our Jiu-Jitsu is a life style that not only builds the body and mind but protects it as well! We believe true self-defense is for everyone and not just the elite or strong. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why we decided to make a Patreon that can help us to make videos that anyone can use to grow in Jiu-Jitsu. Being a smaller school, we can\u0027t always afford to make huge instructional video\u0027s for people, but with Patreon we have the opportunity to give people the latest in Rickson\u0027s Jiu-Jitsu taught from one of his very own black belts, Dave Kama, as well as everyone in the Kama family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate anything you can do to help and we know you\u0027ll learn so much!\u00a0Thank you and enjoy the journey!"
