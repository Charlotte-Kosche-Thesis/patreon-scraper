His boots thudded on the old, squeaky pine planks, leaving clumps of mud as he approached my table. The velvet curtains rattled on their rods. A cloud of incense smoke coalesced around his barrel-chested form.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tLeaning over me, he rapped his knuckles with brutish swagger on the curse-rubbed wood. I wanted to chuckle.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHe\u2019d already killed 27 men. What was one more?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI cleared my throat, pressed my hands together, hiding the gnarled fingers of my left hand. \u201cWhat can I do for you, sir?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cI want the Lucky Pennies.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe Lucky Pennies. The cost of chance.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I don\u2019t remember you. Have I forgotten your face?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cNo. No prior arrangement, \u2018cept this one. Now hand \u2018em over.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI shook my head in bewilderment. \u201cWithout prior arrangement and proper \u003cem\u003epayment\u003c/em\u003e, I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t have them.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThat\u2019s when I found myself staring down the barrel of a Colt Dragoon. I imagined a flash, smoke, and a quick, painless moment before I exited this world\u2014if I didn\u2019t produce the coins. I smiled. My three-fingered left hand felt beneath the table for the special pouch. Raised it and dumped a few coins under his nose; the faces of tormented men howled up at us. Men whose luck had run out. But therein lay the secret of the coins\u2014their misfortune became your fortune, mostly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI dropped the pouch with a \u003cem\u003eclank\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe man reached with dirt-caked fingers for the pure, shiny silver. He stopped. A cruel smile curled his lips. Killer gray eyes lifted from the money and stared me down. \u201cThere\u0027s more to it than that. I need more than just the coins.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI gave an exaggerated nod, my expression falling. \u201cYes,\u201d I said in mock defeat, holding back a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve done the legwork, sir. You win. You have my permission to take the coins.\u201d Truth was the man had probably learned to read somewhere along the line, discovered a few of our dark secrets, and thought he could get the upper hand on me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHe flashed me a wicked grin, stuffed his gun into his holster, swiped the loose coins into the pouch, and deposited it into a breast pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHe turned and strode toward the door followed by the cloud of incense smoke, which congealed into a tendril, trailing behind him, an arm of stretching gossamer. Ghost fingers caressed the leather vest, reaching, sliding over his shoulder and around his neck with smooth purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe index finger of my left hand experienced a cold stab and a growing ache.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe tendril squeezed, jerking the man upright. He stumbled and spun, grunting and choking. The smoke wrapped tighter and tighter, its leading end rising in an open hand like a cobra\u0027s head. The man\u2019s fingers dug beneath the constriction. His eyes fixed on me, bulging with hatred.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt was a familiar look, the gypsy grimace, the expression of people who misunderstood us. At least until they needed something so desperately not even the threat of a curse kept them from seeking our mystic services.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMan and smoke cavorted together in the center of my trailer. A macabre dance, partner dipped in death. The pine boards squealed with laughter. The satin curtains shook beneath a gale of foetid wind kicking through the windows. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSomeone was sawing at my index finger with a blade made of ice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe tendril hand slapped at the flailing man, leaving blisters and burns on his skin. To his credit, the brute fought hard, wielding his free arm like a club. The hand dove beneath his defenses, not a strike, but\u2026 plucking the man\u2019s gun from its holster. It raised the weapon and tried to draw a bead.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cNo,\u201d the man said, alternately grabbing for the gun and putting his palm up as if flesh could stop bullets. The gun wavered, dipped and bobbed, narrowly avoiding being caught several times. A smaller tendril branched off, wrapping around the trigger, squeezing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy index finger was a gnarled root now, cold and black and dying.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cNo!\u201d Cried the man. \u201cI give \u2018em back\u2026 I give \u2018em back!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tExcruciating, the pain in my hand, but I reveled in it, giggling at the sound of spraying coins when flying lead ruptured the pouch. There was a thud, and one less brutish bully in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027d have to make a new pouch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tNo matter how frail and undefended we might appear\u2014even if you think you\u0027ve got the upper hand\u2014never steal from a gypsy. We embrace dark ambiguities, painful as they may be. We understand the cost of protection.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tContent yourself with frequenting our tarot booths, pay your coin, laugh or cry at your fortune, then take your leave. If you\u2019re the humble type and forthright with your payments, you might request a love potion or lucky charm. Maybe even something more nefarious than that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBut never, ever steal from us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI snuffed out the \u003cem\u003eincense stick of negation\u003c/em\u003e that had been burning beneath the table\u2014reptile musk, I think\u2014stood on my gnarled feet, then went to retrieve my coins.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
