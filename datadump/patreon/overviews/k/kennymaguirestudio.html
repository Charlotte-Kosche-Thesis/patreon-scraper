Since moving, I find myself more inspired then ever and spend nearly every morning creating art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I\u0027ve held a number of jobs, I\u0027ve only been really good at this. So, somewhere in my late 20\u0027s, I came to terms with the fact that I am an artist. Through and through, it\u0027s in my DNA.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to work in paint, wood-burning, carving, sketch, anamorphic drawings, illustration, you name it, I do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSt. Pete has been good to me, I am honored to have won the AARP Timeless Art, Limitless Ages Trolley contest in 2017, sponsored by Tampa Bay AARP and was featured in Leepa-Rattner Museum of Modern Art in Tarpon Springs October-November 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to sharing my space with you!",
