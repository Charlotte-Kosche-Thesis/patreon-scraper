    "summary": "Hi! I am Kimy. Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating and maintaining mods for various games since the early 2000s, but you probably came here because of my bondage-themed mods available on LoversLab. I started releasing a mod there because someone had the fun idea to spice up game play with trapped chests that would tie the player character up when triggering them. Open the wrong chest and you will to continue your journey in chains! The idea was sitting on the forum for a while with nobody picking it up, and being a software engineer by profession I thought \"Ok, that\u0027s not too hard to code, I guess can do that in an afternoon!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree years, later I can\u0027t believe that the mod in question currently sits a little under 300,000 downloads and has become one of the largest and most popular on the site, featuring all sorts of bondage-themed quests and devices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat was supposed to be a quick excursion into adult modding has turned into the largest non-employment related project of my life. I am currently maintaining six mods on LoversLab, including serving as the lead maintainer of the most popular BDSM Framework on LoversLab. It features a large selection of restraints and the functionality to implement them in game - to make them play as if the character is actually restrained! Gags make you unable to talk. Armbinders leave you unable to fight and very much helpless. And if someone puts a blindfold on you, you will have to stumble around in the dark! Oh, and like real life restraints, these items won\u0027t come off unless you have the proper key!\u003cbr\u003eThe framework is constantly getting updated with new features and new restraints the team is designing, making it the probably most comprehensive bondage framework mod ever designed for any game. It is available for both Skyrim and Fallout 4.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is very important to me is stressing that by supporting me on Patreon, you are NOT paying for the mods. All my mods are freely available under an open source like license for everyone to enjoy and will remain so. There are modders who find creative ways to put their work or parts of it behind a paywall, but you won\u0027t see that from me. What you can download for free is the real deal, no strings attached, nothing kept back. Any support you give me is completely voluntary. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me on Patreon, you will help me pay the bills, keep my computer updated, and my coffee and pizza supply going. You don\u0027t pay for the mods, but rest assured that I still appreciate each and every one of you who acknowledges and appreciates that I put several years of hard work into these mods I otherwise didn\u0027t get paid for. Your support keeps me going, both in form of supporting my life and by keeping me motivated to put even more work into my mods. I would very much want to work even harder on them, and your support could help me doing so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get in return? As my mods are not behind a paywall and never will be, I don\u0027t have any \"hard\" rewards to offer, other than my appreciation and gratefulness. Going forward, I plan to utilize my Patreon more to keep in touch with the people who chose to support me. I might talk a bit about upcoming features here and give my supporters to chance to offer their point of view on them, or leave their own feature suggestions with me. I have to add that I will still retain the right to implement or not implement any feature at my own discretion - but all things being equal, I will tend to prioritize the suggestions of people who support me financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading. And thanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
