    "summary": "I totally changed the direction of this page. \u00a0Since I\u0027m a writer and I want to emphasize my writing, my goals are to make enough money that I can cut back at my regular job and work more on my writing. \u00a0With that in mind as I make more money here I will be adding more story lines for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first story I will be working on is an ongoing work called Rebirth, in which we witness a raccoon scientist and his team attempting to save his world. \u00a0At the same time we\u0027re privy to the machinations of a sect of rats who believe they were the first race and how they are working to eliminate the rest of the creatures to create their version of the perfect world. \u00a0Along the way we meet spies and assassins, friends and foes at every turn. \u00a0Will our brave scientist manage to complete his work before his enemies succeed in destroying it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSynopsis\u003c/h2\u003eCharles is a renowned scientist in the microbiotics division of Meta Corp, he and his wife, Maria are working on a top secret project that could be the answer to curing several genetic problems facing the world as they know it.  One of the major problems being propagation of the various species.\u003cbr\u003eIn a matriarchal society where the offspring belongs to the biological mother until their 18th birthday it\u0027s hard for a mixed species couple to have a child of their own unless they choose to have a child of the wife\u0027s species.  Gay men have no rights when it comes to children, they can donate sperm but any child belongs to the mother and never the father. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen his brother, a raccoon, and sister in law, a cat, come to him with this problem Charles decides to break protocol and tell them about the breakthrough he and Maria have just discovered. The four of them set out on a dangerous path all for the love of a child.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExcerpt\u003c/h2\u003e\u201cIt\u2019s happening right now Mother! The birthrate is dropping. Of every hundred successful pregnancies only one is a multi birth and only one in ten of those is more than twins. We aren\u2019t having litters anymore we\u2019re having single births.\u201d The look on his mother\u2019s face said he wasn\u2019t getting through to her so he shook his head and tried again. \u201cLook, if Maria and I were to get pregnant we\u2019d have one child. Just like you and father did. Edmund and Elizabeth,\u201d the name of Edmund\u2019s dead twin, hardly used since she passed was like a splash of cold water to Felicia, but Charles didn\u2019t give her a chance to say anything, just kept talking, \u201cwere a special circumstance. Between the lower birth rate and the high infant mortality rate we\u2019re dying off. And it isn\u2019t just us. All the rodentia are, the felines and canines avoided it by mixing the species as you so elegantly put it, but the lupines and the great cats are in a similar situation to the rest of us.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA delicate snort preceded Felicia\u0027s next comment. \u201cPredators all of them. The world could do with less of them.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharles shook his head and reached for her paws. \u201cNo mother, we can\u2019t. Every aspect of our lives revolves around the birth rate. From food production to space colonization. Think about this. If the birth rate falls too low the colonies will die off and all the survivors will return. Not only that but with our short life spans\u2026 the implications are astronomical! We could breed ourselves into extinction in a matter of generations! Traditional ways are going to kill us all! Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e"

On the evening of the fourth day\u003cbr\u003eout from the village Tella came back from her rambling investigation of the\u003cbr\u003esurrounding undergrowth and grabbed Shilla\u2019s shirt pulling the smaller girl toward\u003cbr\u003ethe forest.  \u201cHey now, we\u2019re almost ready for dinner Tella.\u201d  The elven girl tried to\u003cbr\u003epush the cougar away but the large feline was insistent moving behind her and\u003cbr\u003epushing with her broad head against the girls back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was Mari who was looking off into the trees that suggested, \u201cPerhaps she\u2019s\u003cbr\u003efound something that needs your help?\u201d  Dar snorted nodding his head in\u003cbr\u003eagreement and they set off, leaving most of their belongings at the temporary\u003cbr\u003eshelter to find out what it was that Tella was trying to tell them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three of them started exploring the forest, Tella having darted away from\u003cbr\u003ethem deeper into the shadows when they headed in the direction she wanted\u003cbr\u003ethem to go, Dar let out a loud bugling call that pulled both the girls from where\u003cbr\u003ethey were flanking him over to see what he\u2019d discovered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a man.  He was dressed in the oddest pair of blue pants they had ever\u003cbr\u003eseen but most surprising of all he was pale of completion and had golden hair,\u003cbr\u003enot just on his head but all over his visible body: in sparse little tufts at the center\u003cbr\u003eof his chest, over his shoulders and down his arms.
