Seriously, I had a vision at age four, that I would be an Artist (yes with a capital ART!). So, that has been my driving passion ever since and has got me through some very tough times... more about me later. Here I am, Katie Roberts an Artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VeN0MDpOXzE/SxPbbbjVVxI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Hd3h0_Ot_7I/s1600/KatieRoberts4_by_EmmaBelyea.jpg\" style=\"width: 226px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT Are Your Qualifications?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied art for over ten years, first at NMIT then a BA Majoring in Drawing at RMIT (from 1996-1999 Under Godwin Bradbeer, yes I\u0027m name dropping - forgive me!). I made a cross-disciplinary installation art called\u00a0\u003cem\u003eCocooned\u003c/em\u003e and graduated with first class Honours in 2000. Following this I started a community gallery, Synergy Gallery in Northcote and curated and assisted hundreds of artists over 200 shows (mostly voluntarily). I completed my Masters of Fine Art in 2006 making projection installations and looking at the topic \u003cem\u003eLight as a Medium\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Art Do You MAKE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMuch of my artistic output are works on paper, often large scale drawings executed in pencil, ink and mixed media. Though I do not consider myself an artist limited to one medium. I make everything from drawings to video projections, oil paintings to multi-disciplinary, collaborative projects. In 2006 started a giant body of work about the Birrarung or Yarra River and the landscape and history of Melbourne. I have exhibited this along the river including a major exhibition at Montsalvat in 2009/10. Since then I have continued expanding this project to cover more of the catchment including a residency at Darebin Parkands (2014/15) and Point Nepean (2016/2017). I am continuing to work from my home studio and outdoors too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see more of my work \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Katie-Roberts-Art/94568642226?ref=hl\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e on my facebook page, or \u003ca href=\"http://www.katierobertsart.com.au/\"\u003ehere,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://yarraart.blogspot.com.au/\"\u003ehere,\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://darebinart.blogspot.com.au/\"\u003ehere!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY Do You Make Art?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am committed to making artwork that makes the world a more beautiful, honest and hopeful place. I try to make artwork that addresses critical issues effecting the humanity, society and the earth; including the personal, spiritual and environmental. I do that by making art that I hope captures the spirit of place, the universality of human experiences, that engages the emotions and that provokes thought. I hope it is somehow a conduit for social change.\u00a0Ultimately, I try to make work that is both profound and beautiful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does Your Art DO?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eImbued in most of my work is an interest in the environment and our relationship to it. Since 2006 I have been making a body of work about the Yarra River, or Birrarung, in Melbourne; incorporating many different cultural ways of representing the land and reflecting on the many layers of history here. This work is about acknowledging the Wurundjeri people and the Kulin Nation as the traditional custodians of this land and incorporating that history into my artwork.  This body of work is ongoing and I hope to re-map the whole of the catchment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do You NEED Patrons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiraculously I manage to actually live as an Artist! ;) But at the moment I DONT make a LIVING from my art. I don\u0027t quite live in the abject poverty everybody warned me I would when I was a child, BUT it is tough to make a living as an artist. I have a range of personal challenges and I do really struggle to do what I know I am capable off and fulfil the dreams, potential and myriad ideas I have just waiting to be born! I hope you agree the world NEEDS art. Art can be a world changing force, a transformational personal experience and is the essential ingredient to change in any culture and society.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT is a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eArtists have needed patrons since money became a part of society. Patrons not only buy artists work and commission them, they hold a special trusted relationship in which that artist shares their ideas and process; patrons support artists financially but in other ways too, providing them with the sense that their art has meaning, an audience, people who really understand and connect with it. That is worth more then gold. By becoming a Patron you will enter this trusted relationship with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does it COST to Make Art?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Art costs a LOT to make! Some years I have spent about $12,000 on art exhibitions, commission fees, competition entries, art supplies, art equipment, materials and running my studio, office from home and art classes. I run a few small art classes, they keep me in art books, pay for memberships, insurance etc. But they ALSO cost a lot to run. I did the sums last year and was alarmed to find that I live on a TINY amount, (about AU$10K), after I have spent everything I earn and more from my art. Currently I can not afford to hold a solo exhibition! Seriously, I haven\u0027t had a major solo show since Montsalvat in 2010. I would love to do this again and that is where you come in...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support will mean the world to me. You will literally\u00a0be helping \u003cbr\u003eme make and show my art! As if your cheering me on\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ein the studio, but in much more practical ways too...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW will our Support Help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThrough Patreon I aim to buy the camera I really need to document my art, to make videos too. To buy the projector I need to be able to make and project the videos to use for me projection installations. To pay for materials such as canvas, paint, paper and ink to make my art, to run my studio, pay for exhibition fees, to frame my art, make web sites, promotion and all the other costs associated with art making. Eventually to get a van as a portable studio and to travel to places both close like the desert and far away to make art about \u2013 eventually river systems around the world! Ultimately I dream of having a studio/gallery and a place to run my art classes from too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a plan for all the art I want to make, to share with the world!\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBut I need your help to do this..\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn fact I would LOVE you to come on the journey with me as I fulfil my \u003cbr\u003evision and purpose in life and make the ART that changes the world.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT will you do with our Support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you support my Patreon page you help me to create these artworks directly by providing encouragement, support and very helpfully \u2013 funds for materials, equipment, documentation, promotion, exhibitions, publications and other projects.

     "about": "At the age of four I knew my life purpose was to be an artist. Since then I have steadfastly pursued that vision, all throughout my childhood and into adulthood; through wondrous adventures, self-doubt and disaster, brilliantly shinning and solitary moments; that feeling has lasted. I know what I am meant to do, make art. So that is\nwhat I have done, mostly... A lot of other stuff has happened too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also been a single parent and raised my son, who is now 24! Yay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have studied art too. First at Tafe (Collage) part time for four years,\nthen four years at University, (including honours year with distinction) in 2000. Having graduated and still feeling intimidated by the arts industry and commercial gallery scene \u2013 I decided to do something proactive and an idea was born \u2013 with a group of friends I started Synergy Gallery a non-profit, community, contemporary art space in\nHigh St. Northcote, in the heart of the emerging art community in Melbourne. I co-ordinated and managed it for ten years, during which we assisted hundreds of artists and held 200 shows and events.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver this time, while raising my son I gave everything to helping others show their work and develop their art. I saw a lot of art and learnt tons, while I kept making art myself. After giving so much (mostly voluntarily), since then I have decided to return some of that energy to myself and my own art career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI returned to study in 2005/6 and I completed my Masters in Fine Art, the\ntitle of my project was \u0027Light as a Medium\u0027. After\nspending two years exploring the ephemeral and illusive art of making art that\nhad no tangible physical qualities, I really wanted to make something physical,\ntangible and actually messy again!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I embarked on making a body of work\nabout something that was at the centre of my life, at the centre of my city and\nconnected with me spiritually. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started making a body of work about the Yarra River or Birrarung, the river that runs\nthrough the heart of Melbourne, my home city and the place of my birth. I knew\nthis body of work I was being called to make would take years, possibly a life\ntime to complete...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Melbourne into share houses filled with anti-war, anti-mining and Landrights activists in the 1970s. My parents were activists, authors, journalist and pretty radical for the time, for anytime. We moved to the UK and lived in London and Bristol when I three, where we lived in legal squats in communities and I started school there in North London. That is when I had my \u0027vision\u0027 at aged four, while drawing.. it may sound crazy to you, but I \u0027heard my calling\u0027 as it were. We returned to Australia and lived in many different houses before settling in leafy inner suburbia where I have raised my family and still live today. Growing up we were immersed in the landrights movement and I count this as the greatest educational experience of my life, I hope to honour that and continue to convey the hidden stories of colonisation imbedded in the land.\u00a0",
