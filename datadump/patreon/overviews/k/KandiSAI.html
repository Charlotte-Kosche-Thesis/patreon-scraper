    "summary": "Hey everyone! My name is SAI (KandiSAI on social media) I am a music producer and I love to make remixes especially from video games. I upload content to various platforms such as Youtube and Souncloud. Not only that but I also play Pokken Tournament competitively and stream it as well! I\u0027ve started to produce because I had a passion for music. I never had the confidence to release my music until I\u0027ve started to gain many supporters over the years with my productions. With the recent remixes I\u0027ve done for Pokken, I\u0027ve had a growing success and had been advised to push for more! I would love to continue to produce more content not for myself, but for the music and gaming community as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all have very productive lifestyles that may take us away from doing the hobbies we love. I work alot to keep up with school and regular living (Yeah adulthood) So time to produce isn\u0027t always there. However I\u0027ve made a Patreon to have a start on reducing that work time and allow me to produce music, ESPECIALLY at a faster rate. A possible remix every 2-4 weeks is doable if time allows. My ultimate goal is to provide amazing remixes upon your requests and deliver the content you desire. Donating to my Patreon (even $1) helps me pursue my goal and would mean SO MUCH to me knowing there are people who support the remixes I do. $20 makes a huge difference in terms of free time to produce!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank all the people/fans that have supported me to this day, encouraging me to keep producing! Now only do I feel accomplish in remixing music, it also pleases me to see the happiness people get from listening to them.\u003cbr\u003e"
