We have studied anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, discrimination, and global LGBTQ responses to the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. We are all too aware of the painful fact that not all of our past donors or participants are still with us. This is a sad category of donation to create, but we welcome anyone who would like to make a donation in memory of a loved one they have lost. Ultimately, we do this research because we hope that it will bring us closer to living in a world where being LGBTQ does not in anyway shorten someone\u0027s lifespan or reduce the joy that they experience throughout their life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncludes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to patron-only content\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConnect with other KLB Research patrons\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",

We can\u0027t make any promises, but if it\u0027s possible, we\u0027ll do our best to run the study and get you some answers! After all, that\u0027s why we became researchers - to provide answers to all the \"I wonder why\" questions that are out there!\u00a0*Requires remaining at this donation level for minimum of 6 months.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncludes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to patron-only content\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConnect with other KLB Research patrons\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSend us some love, we\u0027ll send you a sticker!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSocial media follow\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to publications\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour Name on the KLB Research Website\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe the first to know!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKLB Research Swag\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePitch Us Your Research Idea!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",

     "description": "In addition to having a full time research coordinator, increasing our funding to $5000/month would allow us to improve the quality of our research and to provide financial compensation to our research participants. When we do not have much funding for our research, we tend to only use modest prize draws for research participant incentives. This can significantly increase the amount of time it takes to collect our research samples. Providing direct payments to participants, however, can become very expensive when working with the large sample sizes that we often have in KLB Research Studies. At the $5000/month funding level, we would be able to begin offering participants $5 to $10 per survey as a means of thanking them for the time they take to share their experiences with us. At this level, we would also be able to create more accessible methods of disseminating our research findings, including more regular blog postings, infographics, and youtube videos.\u00a0",

This would mean that we would have a paid, full time research coordinator, multiple paid student research assistant positions, and we would have the financial means to offer our dedicated research participants fair financial compensation for their time and energies spent sharing their experiences with us so that we can conduct the research that we do. This budget would also ensure that we would be able to translate all of our studies into mediums that the general public can benefit from, such as YouTube video summaries of all studies and research findings. If we were able to remain at this level of funding for at least three years, we would also be able to make significant capital investments into research equipment that would allow us to more thoroughly investigate questions of LGBTQ health. For example, we would be able to purchase heart rate monitors, pay for saliva analysis, monitor the physiological activity of participants remotely, and have our lab set up with an observation system for studying relationships.",

     "description": "With $600 of funding per month, the KLB Research lab would be able to hire a part-time (10 hr/week) student research assistant. Although we would ideally like to have a full time research coordinator, which would require reaching our $2500/month goal, the $600/month goal would go a long way in helping students to gain valuable research experience working in the lab. Often the KLB Research students have to choose between volunteering their time in the lab for free, or taking on paid employment so that they can afford their tuition and living expenses. The very first thing that our funding from this site will go towards will be paying research assistants for their time so that they don\u0027t have to pass up valuable research experience in order to afford their rent. Knowing that we can rely on paid research assistants also contributes to the quality of our work and the ability to plan our research activities out over time. For the summer of 2017, having a paid research assistant would mean, at a minimum, being able to launch our Parent \u0026amp; Child Memories of Coming Out Study before the Fall, complete our Global LGBTQ Responses to the Pulse Nightclub Shooting Paper by mid-summer, and launch the online version of our \"reactions to same-sex PDAs\" study.\u00a0",
