However as far as i noticed, most are just individual artworks. I don\u0027t know about you, but i personally am far more interested in actual manga, i.e. stories.\u003cbr\u003eI always loved to read Manga from Japan or slightly less Comics from America. And thus i became interested to create some of my own. Not just writing fanfics, or drawing artworks, but actual manga/comics. Over the years i have imagined hundreds of ideas, so many, i couldn\u0027t possibly ever draw all of them in my lifetime, so i guess, i have become a bit melancholic towards this dream and forgot about it.(after all, as adults money unfortunately comes first)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take the first step towards changing that though:\u003cbr\u003eWith this patreon, i want to create manga short stories for everyone to read for free. I want others to be able to enjoy reading a new story as much as i do. On top of that legally ;)\u003cbr\u003eAnd heck, maybe i will inspire others to do the same. (I hope you do)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will i do exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eOn this patreon i will make short stories(i.e. so called Oneshots) or pilot chapters of longer series(and depending on the success of individual stories, i might continue a story at some point)\u003cbr\u003eEach chapter will go around 40 pages. More or less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be 5 pages uploaded per week, meaning each new story will be done around every 2 months. Some days i might take a break to draw a random sketch on my twitter as i have since july 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince there is no actual payment, as this patreon is \u003cstrong\u003eCOMPLETELY FREE TO WATCH\u003c/strong\u003e, i unfortunately can\u0027t spend too much time on these, thus they will be drawn as sketches. However my sketches are usually very clean, so it won\u0027t look too bad ;)\u003cbr\u003eThe covers may be drawn in color, i will decide that depending on how much time i have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledging/Donations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eAs this patreon is planned to be completely free, meaning you can watch every content without paying a single cent, you don\u0027t need to pledge to me. BUT maybe there are some kind people who have a little money to spend to help the artist community, in that case, i welcome any donations :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast words\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eSo i hope you will stay or look me up from time to time to read some interesting, funny or dramatic stories. Have fun!\u003cbr\u003e"
