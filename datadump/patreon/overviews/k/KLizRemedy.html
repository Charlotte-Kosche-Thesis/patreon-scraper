    "summary": "\"Music, the one incorporeal force that\nunderstands mankind, but which mankind does not understand.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n-Ludwig Van Beethoven\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHello everyone!  For those of you who\ndon\u0027t know me personally, here is my story in a nutshell: ten years ago I was\nat the top of my game, or what I thought was the top.  I really was just\ndoing what everyone else said I \u003cem\u003eshould \u003c/em\u003edo:\ngo to college, get a degree, and become a music teacher.  In 2006, I was a\nvery successful orchestra director and teacher; I ran a huge program at a\nwell-known arts school with 750 students and several orchestras. I also worked\nten hour days and had my own home.  At age 26, I felt\n\"successful\" according to my exterior standards.  Don\u0027t get me\nwrong - I absolutely loved teaching, but the life I had built just wasn\u0027t as\nfulfilling as I thought it would be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter a lot of soul searching\nI decided that I really missed performing, something I had been doing since age\nfour.  One day, I threw all caution to the wind and decided to audition\nfor a rock band. This is something that I secretly had always wanted to do.\n The first band I auditioned for had my future husband in it, and he immediately\ntook one look at me and said, \"What the hell are you doing teaching?\n You are an amazing talent and you need to be performing for a living.\n I want to help you do just that.\"  So we started our own band\nand the rest is history.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince these past years, the\nband has been growing, but is still in need for a lot of help. As a\ntraditionally giving soul, it is embarrassing for me to ask for help, even as\nmy electricity is being shut off. \nHowever, as a supporter, here is how you can help me \u2013 crowdfunding.\nThis makes it possible for me to have the stability and support I need to give\nback to my fans. As well, it also shows the importance and power of music and\nart in society to create joy and balance, to transform our pain and take it to\nthat place of healing light in our lives. Artists are harbingers of light and\njoy and should be treated as such.  Art and music is essential to create\nchange and balance in society, and to give love where love is most needed.\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs my crowdfunding supporter,\nhere is what you can help me do more of:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduce original music and\nconcerts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrite and record my original\nmusic and get it out into the world\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrite blog posts to share my\nexperiences with others \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp organizations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBegin my non-profit mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI don\u0027t expect any one person to contribute more than they can afford, even a $1 per\nmonth helps!

With your help, I can be the\ncatalyst of change for my vision in the world.    \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
