However, this has become rather difficult in recent years.\u00a0This Patreon is in place so that those who wish to can support me and my efforts to continue to write freely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is simply a fact that, as things stand, I will have to focus all of my energy into making a living, leaving no time to continue the creative works I have cultivated over the last several years, such as Overheat or Dissonance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e With additional income, I will have all of the necessary time to continue those series as well, and, depending on the circumstances, even write specifically just for my Patrons; something catering specifically to their wishes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more money Patreon brings in, the less I need to work on traditional published books and the more I can work for my grand patrons.\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I won\u0027t cease working on original media entirely, no matter what, since those fans have a right to their continuation, too. No worries there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo support me means to buy me time. \u003cbr\u003eTo buy me time means that the work I have been producing will not be abandoned, but continued.\u003cbr\u003eMore time means more works and more content for my patrons.\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I am only human, too, so that does have its limits. Even in the purely theoretical scenario that I could live entirely from Patreon, I could not update every single day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA special perk for Patrons is the Monthly Creation.\u003cbr\u003eJust as the name implies, once a month I will collect suggestions and votes on what to create. Whether you can send in suggestions or vote depends on the tier of your pledge.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, as per Patreon rules, I cannot make any of the created content available purely for Patrons. Original fiction created through the monthly will be on my Fictionpress account, accessible for everyone while other works will be on my fanfiction account, linked below, also accessible for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those wondering, 900$ a month is basically what I need to make in total between Patreon and working a moderate amount of time (30-40 hours a week) on traditional publications to be reasonably productive with all non-paid work stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1239837/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA free taste of my writing, unedited however, can be found here\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/u/1023708/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis is where all original fiction created from the monthly will go\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
