Let me tell you about all of this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Work: \u003c/strong\u003eI have been creating art photographs to use as the canvas for my art. It sounds simple but what I am aiming for is \u003cem\u003eEpic, Flamboyant, Complex, Massive Tapestries of Colour\u003c/em\u003e. This involves taking photographs which have very little colour (not black and white). It means finding all that is whiteish. It means fabrics with patterns. It means white flowers and figures on white. I have a passion for still life and I am aiming for dark backgrounds and crisp photos of flowers, reminiscent of the Dutch masters. Then I add exquisite colour! But this is just the beginning. I am working on bringing people into the scenes, all in white, involving different characters. Each of these images will be printed out in large format. They take many hours to colour and the results so far are tantalising. The results pinpoint all that I love in an image, beauty with a hint of discord, shifting perspectives, depth and flatness, immense beauty paired with wildness...I\u0027m just bursting with excitement!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis technique emerged from my painting, drawing and photography experiments over the years, coming through in the end, like so often, as a result of certain creative limitations. I was working on a project on a deadline and I just did not have the time to draw or paint the illustrations. I had been working through a series of flower drawings, which I called my \u0027pencil paintings\u0027 which involved a lot of wild pencil scribbling. After that I started experimenting with colour, essentially drawing outlines and colouring them in. That was the start. You will see some of my past work in the patron only gallery, which will form some of the rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore experimenting followed with spray-painted still lives, whitening the subject before photographing and colouring, a wedding dress, a withering stalk of white flowers, all with my eye on the larger studio installations which I want to create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5613e2aee4b059fef2a40d36/5620ded3e4b0306d245e7c73/56d58d7486db4336abe20362/1456835968957/IMG_3500.JPG?format=300w\" style=\"width: 648px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Art Patronage: \u003c/strong\u003eThe funny thing is, that after years of experimentation and wrangling with the economics of it all, I had just reconciled myself with the idea that I would be taking the commercial route for the next few years. That I would be creating artefacts or products which will be sold in galleries, that I would shelve all other projects (like Ecourses, colouring courses, an idea for a sculpture) because of time and that, with the resources I have available at the moment (time and money), it would take years.\u00a0I figured I could release some of these photographs for sale for people to buy and colour themselves, since colouring has become so popular and these images are really different. Then I heard about \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eand I began to realize, that maybe it doesn\u0027t have to take years. Maybe if I ask for practical support, I will be able to get these images out now, this year. You may understand how thrilling that feels. It also means it is possible to achieve a sort of freedom from the current model of selling art as an \u0027object\u0027. It reduces the risk of trying to make images that people will buy and allows supporters to get behind me, even if my work is not what they would hang on their walls. I also love the idea of giving people access to the Artwork who may not be in a position to buy it from the gallery. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, this is how Amanda Palmer, an Artist who successfully uses the platform to facilitate her making her \"\u003cem\u003ethings\u003c/em\u003e\", describes it: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"If you\u0027re a fan of mine and want to support me in the creation of new songs/webcasts/videos/writing/performance-art and more random, unpredictable art-things, this is the place.\" (Amanda Palmer) For me, Kerstin Walsh, replace songs and webcasts with\u00a0\u003cem\u003eEpic, Flamboyant, Complex, Massive Tapestries of Colour.. to start.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0If you are supporting me, you will see how these images are born. I will show you what is happening. You will be the backbone of my work. Much of the energy I would have put into selling my \u0027products\u0027 can go into finding ways of rewarding you and making better art! You will get art, downloads, discounts, invitations to events, Ecourses and more! It\u0027s going to be fun because I am going to be involving people in my images.

I have one full time job already (2 girls) and though I have worked on many aspects of my art in the last 6 years since the first was born, full on \"concentration\" is something I need to pay for. However, when you support me, what is most precious to me is the idea that you are saying to me \"go Kerstin, go make these things, I believe in you and I get what you are doing\". The world needs art. This next year is going to be the most exciting and challenging in my career so far.

I have written an Ecourse called \"Learn to Draw and Make Friends with your Finances\", which is the tip of the iceberg. It states that the way we view money is partly responsible for creating barriers to changing the world for the better, it is about learning to see more clearly. I won\u0027t go into it here. For now, imagine artists, writers, creators, gardeners, healers, activists, scientists, food producers, full time parents at the height of their creative powers, (etc etc) were released from the agenda of their employers. Imagine all the creatives who are foostering around trying to find money to pay the rent for their studios and their health insurance could have a salary, so that they could stop worrying about money and let their amazing minds change the world? Being an artist and being an entrepreneur or salesperson involve extremely different skill sets. We can\u0027t ALL have ALL the skills, even though we do try.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo quote one of the most hardworking artists in Cork, Tom Campbell:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eONE THING IS FOR SURE..........\"you need a bus load of faith to get by\"(Lou reed)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI take my hat of to All artists of all genres making a living is tough.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI wouldn\u0027t want it any other way,part of me feels like the struggle to earn a living makes me a \u0027better\u0027 artist, part of me is really tired of It.The question of the next sale is never very far from my mind ,I am not greedy and would be happy on a very low subsistence wage........my business is making art ,selling is the hassle.it\u0027s not just \u0027artists\u0027 who struggle .my hope is that if I ever get beyond say 60 ish that I have an easier living......I meet a philanthropist who likes art. whatever I\u0027ll keep on making art. Tom\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTom Campbell sells a lot of art. As he says \"Art is a Doing Thing\", and he is constantly at it.

I want us all to put our voices together in a concrete way and say: \"the world needs Art and Theatre and Public Gardens, independent music and creative people who also can put their voices behind what they feel is important, in a financial sense. There are many great people working for companies and causes they do not really believe in. There is room for more people to earn a living in a way which moves them (and thereby our world) more strongly in a positive direction, and not be poor! This world so desperately needs beauty I am welling up even writing this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be honoured to have you on board dear friends. For those of you who don\u0027t know me, be assured, I deliver on my promises. My life has been a constant search for meaning and beauty and freedom and energy. A search, a search, a search. I don\u0027t just flow with my strengths, I take on jobs and tasks that I can\u0027t do, so that I can learn. Sometimes I think I studied social work to make myself more practical and to get a closer look at interesting people\u0027s lives. And it is true, I did get more practical, until I began to wonder, is\u00a0\u003cem\u003epracticality really what I need?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have taught the Artists Way and drawing. I have published articles on creativity. I have illustrated books. I have waitressed, I have worked on a ranch. I have exhibited my work. I have been chosen to exhibit my work. I have sold work. I have not sold work. Now I ache to be free to use my strengths and weaknesses in the way in which they choose to be used.\u00a0I have a BA in English Literature and Sociology. I have a HDip in Social Policy and a Masters in Social Work. My research partner and I were in discussions with the University to create a course for the Masters Programme, to train Social workers to use Creativity in their Practice, until life took us in different directions. I already have many informal patrons.

     "description": "It is all well and good being a \u0027starving artist\u0027 when you are single and you can be flexible about when and where you live, eat and sleep. But with age and with children it becomes a lot more complicated. Have you ever experienced dependency? We will all in our lives move through different processes and qualities of dependency and independence. Those who are independent support those who are dependent. It is as simple as that. We are all interdependent. Thank goodness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never imagined how difficult it would to be dependent until I became a mother. When I gave birth I not only acquired dependents, I also became a dependent slowly, over time, in subtle ways, as my old way of working became incompatible with my job as a parent. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel now that instead of telling our kids to save for their children\u0027s education we should be telling them to save in case they want to be fully available for their children\u0027s early years. I will be honest in saying I never thought about how I would pay for staying at home with my children. I always thought I would work. And I have been working, but my work does not have a regular income. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a mother and artist in this society (a society which is increasingly economically geared towards two-salary households), I now have a second job with no salary. A second full time job in which I have to fundraise for my own position or depend on my partner for a salary. If any mother or father starts a Patreon page to fund themselves while they are raising their kids, in return for whatever rewards, I would soo love to fund them. I might just do that as an art project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnyway sisters and brothers, this issue is not going away, and I will give as good as I get. That\u0027s a promise. I love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider this tier commissioning the artwork and paying for it in advance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlong with all the other rewards you can be my model for an artwork or work with me on an image. We can talk about it.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA large scale gallery print of your choice from the new collection.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, sincerely.",
