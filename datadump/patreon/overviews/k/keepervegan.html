A lot of people spouted the same half-facts over and over, and there were absolutely true facts that were horrifying that people didn\u2019t know about at all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I started pooling information and researching, and then KV was born. I tried being a \u2018normal\u2019 person for a while, but it turns out being an Angry Dick is kind of my thing, and so that\u2019s how I do what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo check out the show for news and swearing, check out the website for science and swearing, and check out the social media, where we can all swear together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSave the planet, save the animals, save yourself, go vegan.  \u003cbr\u003e",

If I can improve the sound quality of Keeper Vegan content, it\u0027s going to make the videos more professional-looking, and reach a wider audience. Better control over what sound the recorder picks up also means I can shoot at times of the day I currently have to avoid, which will hopefully lead to more videos being made.",
