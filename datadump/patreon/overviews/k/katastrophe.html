    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Kat, and I have three jobs. I work full-time as office manager, code monkey, accountant, and general cat-wrangler for a small business; I have a two-year-old daughter; and I make the webcomic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sunsetgrillcomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSunset Grill\u003c/a\u003e, a science fiction ramble about gangsters, corrupt government, social inequality, and the people who drink beer and complain about all of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all my jobs. Lately, though, I\u0027ve been having issues with all of them, struggling and frequently failing to meet my obligations and then suffering through the inevitable emotional backlash. After a particularly bad meltdown, in a desperate attempt to find and diagnose the problem, I sat down and did some math. I estimate that between the day job (35-40 hours), the kidlet (30-35 hours), and the comic (25-30 hours), ever since my daughter was born, I have been spending 100 hours a week -- 14 hours, 7 days a week -- working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe good news is, I \u003cem\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0have found my problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bad news is I can\u0027t keep this up.\u00a0I can\u0027t \u003cem\u003equit\u003c/em\u003e, because each of those jobs is doing something very necessary and vital for me. But some reorganization will have to happen. And, realistically, since the comic neither keeps me from starving nor runs around the house demanding food, attention, and/or pants at ear-splitting volumes, the comic is the most likely thing to suffer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I am between the proverbial rock and hard place. But if the comic is doing its bit -- even a small bit -- towards that goal of \"not starving\", then I get some wiggle room. I can talk to my bosses about cutting my hours or possibly even going down to four days a week. I can return the comic to the two updates a week I\u0027ve been only haphazardly delivering for some time now. I can\u00a0follow up on other stuff (like print collections or side stories) that I keep looking at and then helplessly putting away as too much time and energy that I don\u0027t have for no promised gain. I get \u003cem\u003eoptions.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe great thing about Patreon is it lets a lot of people donate a small amount, every month, at the level they can afford... but from my end that small amount adds up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, I will keep making this comic -- but I would deeply appreciate making it at the pace I want without going completely insane. Thank you in advance for helping that happen.\u003cbr\u003e"
