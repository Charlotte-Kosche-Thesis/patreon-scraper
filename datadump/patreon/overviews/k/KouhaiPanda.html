Over the years, I have tried to fit the \ntraditional molds and pathways that were given to me for thirty years of\n my life. I don\u0027t, can\u0027t, and won\u0027t. I tried. It seems the core of my being revolves around expression. There are stories in my mind that are aching\n to be drawn out into the open. Expression in the highest form. But most of all, I want to write epics worthy of word and film with strong characters with flaws who can love and lose, anger and anguish, and cringe and cry. I want to spend the rest of my life writing scripts and stories. I rather delight the hearts and souls of those around me, knowing that I gave them a place in their lives when the world did not. That is my mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStories\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnofficial Overwatch Short Film Scripts\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause I kinda went Reddit famous, I will be doing monthly scripts for your entertainment!
