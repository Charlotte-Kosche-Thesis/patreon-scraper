It is an universe primarily based on the vore and giantess fetish, although over the years it has acquired a life of its own thanks to a very active and involved community. For those who may not know, vore is a fetish about creatures swallowing others alive and giantess, as you may guess, is a fetish involving size differences in creatures where the larger is female (for example, normal-sized humans coming into contact with skyscraper-sized alien women). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work involves erotic and sexy pictures, giantesses, fanarts, vore, comics, and humorous strips. I love to paint beautiful wild landscapes as well and I do some concept art every now and then in order to flesh out the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/7c80/f/2017/181/0/1/headercrisis_petit_by_karbo-dbemh1w.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/7c80/f/2017/181/0/1/headercrisis_petit_by_karbo-dbemh1w.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75,172,198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUR PATRONAGE WILL ALLOW ME TO DO:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been drawing Felarya as a hobby for several years now, in between two jobs. Patreon allowed me to be able to put a lot more time into it and others personal projects and essentially turn this hobby into a second job. Something I would never have been able to do without you!\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is now to be able to make the switch and to work on Felarya full time :) It\u0027s a rather distant and lofty dream of course but ... imagine! If this works out, I\u0027d basically draw all day for it and I could even start making full-color comics for free :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you contribute as a patron will go directly into paying for my food, bills and so. Any money earned through such support is money I don\u0027t have to take time to earn through my job, allowing me more time to draw fun stuff!\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind Patreon is entirely based on good will and generosity. You are not bound by any obligation or contract of any sort where you become stuck. If you can\u0027t honor your pledge at some point, you can pull out at any time and you will still have my big thanks nonetheless for having contributed. Every single contribution helps a LOT and I\u2019m extremely grateful for that support :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, as a patron you get to see my work in progress, sketches, behind-the-scene phases of a comic page, and finalized pictures long before they hit internet. I will also regularly ask questions to help decide on a certain aspect of a picture for example and you, as a patron, get a voice in it :3\u00a0  And of course, particularly generous patrons will get some special rewards from me ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75,172,198);\"\u003eREWARDS:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
