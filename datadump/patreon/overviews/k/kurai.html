I want to pursue my dreams, BEYOND smut. *gasp*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSAY IT AIN\u0027T SO! Yes.. I am afraid it IS SO! I want to make pretty pictures (ok some surreal weird shit) , I want to craft weird stuff, and cool stuff, and nerdy stuff, and modify dolls into awesome things. I want to paint with real paints, and draw with real pencils, craft clay with my hands. I want the beautiful things inside my head to bloom into reality and wow you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut life costs money, and it takes up time, and I have neither between living and striving to scrape by every month doing simple furry smut commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, hold my hand while I become something more than this. I want you to be a part of it, of my dreams. I want you to see the sights and colors I see in my head, and feel my feelings through my art. Come on this adventure with me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get to see??\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI make all sorts of stuff, usually it is furry art. But I enjoy fantasy art with humans and normal animals in nature as well. I sometimes do abstract soothing images, or strange surreal paintings. Not everything I do is smutty porn, that\u0027s just what I have been doing to make a living for the past 5 years or so. I am here to branch back out into the other things I love. Comics, traditional medias, jewelry making, candle making, lipbalms, soaps, small clay figures, dolls, zen gardens, terrariums/vivariums/palladariums, and I also want to try sewing, knitting, and stuff like stickers and fun things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther thoughts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know how to make everything yet, I am going to teach myself, so prepare to see me fail a few times. I am learning to stream better, even use a camera to let you see me do the physically real life stuff. You will get to learn along with me, possibly even grab your own supplies and MAKE it with me. That would be awesome. If you know how to edit videos, or make prints, or any other skill like that.. please share, knowledge is a worthy as money to me.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Like everyone my age, I have a nice ball in chain called student loans. Yes, I sold my soul for money. I have been working my butt off for a few years to get it down 2k, but there is still more to go. I didn\u0027t even finish college due to money (transportation and food is not cared for by loans). \u003cbr\u003eThis is one of the biggest goals in my life: to finish paying off this loan, and possibly out-of-pocket my way to my associates in Graphic design. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou get:\u003c/strong\u003e I will give away the actual physical copies of the art I will be painting (signed with a personal thankyou), to my patreons who helped me get here.\u003cbr\u003e",
