I had to tell my parents about this cool band I had heard and that led into their friends introducing me to bands like Pantera. I\u0027m sure everyone has been through some tough times in life and when I have gone through mine, music has been my medicine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m working hard on my dream to become a professional musician, it is difficult since there isn\u0027t currently any other method to generate stable income apart from Patreon. I\u0027m married and we have 2 daughters which also brings lots of responsibility and pressure. I have been waiting over 5 months for Youtube to enable monetization for my videos but still I haven\u0027t heard anything from them. This means that I haven\u0027t earned anything from advertisements, which is the main source of income on Youtube. I also have some running expenses which need to be covered somehow and currently I\u0027m not even breaking even.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for showing interest for my Patreon page, my words cant describe the gratefulness for my Patrons that are a big part of making my journey on becoming a professional musician possible! \u003cem\u003eIf you enjoy my content and you want to support me, please consider becoming a Patron.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m uploading files, such as backing tracks and tabs here after the release of a new video. If there\u0027s anything else that I can do to thank you for the support, please let me know and I will try my best to make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e"
