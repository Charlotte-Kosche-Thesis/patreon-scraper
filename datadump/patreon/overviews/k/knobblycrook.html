    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you? \u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Ethan James Petty. Hi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo, but who *are* you? \u003c/strong\u003eOh. I guess technically I was one of the early \"Indie\" PC devs way back in the 90s Shareware scene, but now I am a scriptwriter working on AAA multiplatform titles for--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m sure that\u0027s fascinating, but what is *this* project? \u003c/strong\u003eThis project is a \"point and click\" adventure game in the style of the ones we all loved growing up. You can download Chapter I: The Horse You Sailed In On *free* on Steam \u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/378300/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eby clicking here\u003c/a\u003e. It is called The Knobbly Crook and it follows a simple paper-farmer in his quest to join the royal--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWait! Wait! Let me share some basic concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"O\u2019Sirus is a simple paper farmer who aspires to be a Knobbcrookian royal guard\u2013a Guffaloon. Stories of their heroic battles against the fearsome Bogold empire echo throughout the Crook. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not currently recruiting simple paper farmers. He\u2019s going to have to use every dirty trick in his book to cheat his way to the top.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree key elements factor into the core physics of the Knobbly Crook and surrounding areas. They have a looping hierarchy, with each element proving superior to one of the others and inferior to the third. By understanding this science, the Knobbcrookians have begun to craft powerful machines and build weaponry specific to felling their foes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eScissors \u003c/em\u003e- Though scissors are the most focused of the blade elements (being two blades crossed), any blade or any forged metal will serve a similar role. Blades are the most important element of the Knobbcrookians because each one has elements of metal in their own bodies. This makes any Knobbcrookian a significant threat against creatures that are paper-based in nature and is why the they herd paper animals and harvest paper crop. This also makes them afraid of rock-based creatures such as Bogolds. Since rock is metal at a base form, it trumps any blade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRock \u003c/em\u003e- The bogolds of the Gnarled Scar are almost entirely composed of rock, making them massive, intimidating enemies. Of course, rock is everywhere and entirely unavoidable, but inert rock does not frighten a Knobbcrookian as much as animated rock. The stone bogolds are not invincible, though, they fear the bred paper animals of the Knobbly Crook as well as the feral paper-based races in the more savage, distant areas of the world. A bogold will never near the paper sea as falling in would mean certain death. In this world, a rock cannot penetrate a wall of paper, not even a jagged shard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePaper \u003c/em\u003e- The Knobbcrookians know that a paper net will quickly disable the largest bogold and they construct folded paper blades and fearsome whips to fight them. Paper-based races fear the metallic Knobbcrookians as well, but do not view the bogolds as a real threat. Explorers have returned to the \u2018Crook with reports of vast paper forests beyond the paper sea, inhabited entirely by intricate folded paper beings. This new world has sparked the Knobbcrookians to build massive ships and form exploration parties, headed for lands rich with exploitable paper. The bogold religion, however, describes these lands as a sort of living Hell.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk, I kind of skimmed through it. I was confused. \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s OK! In fact, the game will immerse you in the world and teach you everything anyway as you explore. These games are all about world-building.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it look like? \u003c/strong\u003eIt looks like something that will destroy patreon\u0027s polished UI in most browers. Something like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/1959481405729625236.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/1959481405729625236.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/patreon.posts/YUrCh08V1ciwYzuyxgM1c4r9isE5H1NvaDW9RaCHtiNKSjemDDTuDWiUG5MrYoNe/blackfeather.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd just look at the crazy concepts some of your fellow Patreon donors came up with:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPUmIShUsAA6hJb.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are you using to make it? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m using\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAdventure Game Studio\u003c/a\u003e, an amazing tool to make your own point and click games and I encourage you to try making one if you have any interest. You absolutely can do it. Which is why I absolutely can do it. I am not a programmer. In college, I failed to move around a little turtle on a screen in my one programming class, but here, the scripting is all easy enough for even me to understand. I draw the art (with a mouse - which means every little blade of grass is a click-drag-release!) in Photoshop. These assets are all hand-drawn and original.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have a team? \u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, I have an old industry buddy named Julien Fullum helping me with some great, twisted concepts on paper, but the bulk of the work falls onto my plate. The music I am using is free-to-use music I carefully select to match the mood, but eventually, I may trick a composer friend into crafting custom music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you charge for the game\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e? \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I plan to release the game in at least three chapters, all of them absolutely free. Chapter I has already been released and Chapter II should be released during the winter of 2015/2016. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why do you need money?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eBecause I would absolutely LOVE to return to the indie scene and be able to do more of this, which is why patreon is extremely interesting - supporting an artist because you enjoy their work. If you don\u0027t enjoy my work, you shouldn\u0027t be donating. If you like my work and don\u0027t donate - that\u0027s absolutely fine, too - I\u0027ll keep making stuff, it will just be slow going as I juggle projects. Dedicating an hour or two a night to something that requires this much artwork is obviously going to take a while.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou don\u0027t like working on AAA projects? \u003c/strong\u003eI love both. I\u0027ve been working for game companies for about 12 years now, including work on the Disciples series at Strategy First as well as the big hits at Ubisoft, including the Assassin\u0027s Creed, Watch_Dogs, Splinter Cell, and Rainbow Six franchises. I\u0027ve been in QA, I\u0027ve been a level designer, I\u0027ve been a game designer, and I\u0027m currently a scriptwriter. I\u0027ve worked on small projects, Facebook projects, and 8mil+ sales projects. I get to work with some of the most talented people in the industry. But I enjoy working on different types of things and this is one of them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou said you made some Shareware? \u003c/strong\u003eI did!\u00a0In 1992, my friend and I (high school students) founded Bloodlust Software. It was our response at a time when games were being heavily censored and games were constantly under attack by the media (they were actually more new and scary back then for people). I was raised on horror movies, splatter films, and anything related: GWAR, Troma, anything just gory and stupid. So we made these rebellious, stupid, ugly, shocking games that actually did make us a decent amount of money and pay for some of our college expenses. Bloodlust did have a slight resurrection in the Click and Create era, notably with Wrath of the Sea King, but most of the games were just quick experiments. I tried to launch a few full-scale games, but ultimately could not find a stable programmer to make them happen. Now I don\u0027t need one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo is Knobbly Crook going to be a Bloodlust game?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIt is not. Bloodlust was very much a company that reacted to the issues in its era. Honestly, anything shocking about it would be pretty tame compared to what\u0027s out there now and I think our point was made. The Knobbly Crook is under my new label: Gnarled Scar Manipulations. It\u0027s totally set within a fantasy universe, it\u0027s going to be a little dark, but it is primarily comedy and *mostly* family-friendly.\u00a0 I want you to get lost in this unique, bizarre world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, what\u0027s your closing statement? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m asking for your help to buy me a ticket aboard the crazy train. \u00a0Realistically, I\u0027ll keep doing what I\u0027ve been doing - juggling a fun industry job with an evening hobby. Could it be something BIGGER? I think so. I think patreon is a great way for people to invest in what they like to play and I hope this is something you\u0027ll like to play. I know I\u0027m having a blast creating it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
