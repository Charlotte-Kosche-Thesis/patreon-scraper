If I can make one person\u0027s day better with my music then I\u0027ll be one happy cat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is an amazing platform that makes it possible for artists to create and be compensated for their work by their fans. For less than a Netflix membership, you help me create the art that I love. If you enjoy my art, you can join my community and pay a few bucks per creation. I\u0027ll create music and videos, and you can choose the maximum amount you want to pay each month. When you subscribe, you get rewards like song downloads, behind the scenes looks into the creations, CD\u0027s, merchandise, and more. You can opt out at any time if you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY GOAL:\u003c/strong\u003e I have been working on putting together my second album. My goal is to be able to sustainably create music so I can keep on releasing it. I want to make High-Quality music videos as well. Your support helps me do this. You can help me cover costs for:\u003cbr\u003e-Equipment (microphones, cables etc.)\u003cbr\u003e-Video Production (locations, actors, wardrobe, sets etc.)\u003cbr\u003e-Collaboration Costs (I work with other artists)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY LONG TERM GOAL\u003c/strong\u003e is to get my songs broadcasted on a large scale so that I can touch even more people with my music. With the support of my fans here, I can do this. You are the one\u0027s who make these dreams possible. You guys are my audience. You are my team. You help me fund important things. You help me do what I love. Together, we\u0027re going make something great!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO\u0027S KALA?\u003c/strong\u003e I could probably write a whole book (or very committed lifestyle article) about how music has touched my life, but I\u0027ll try and keep it short and sweet. My music journey started back in the day. I was laying in bed listening to \u003cem\u003eWhen I Look at You\u003c/em\u003e and thought to myself, \u0027this would probably be easy to learn on the guitar\u0027.. It was not. I spent about 3 months trying to teach myself that one song. I know what you\u0027re thinking.. What were you doing Kala? 3 months.. I know. It quickly became apparent that I was no natural Santana, and I spent many nights crying over my guitar. I guess you could say that my guitar was the reason for my teardrops on my guitar. ANYWAY, I eventually mastered that song and many more thereafter. Then I struggled for a while to learn how to sing. I wasn\u0027t a born singer, and I have the videos to prove it. Maybe someday you\u0027ll get to see them in all their embarrassing glory. One day I met with Payy Mee at Dream High Studios, and started making music with him. We worked together to make an album. The Flow is the name of the album we made, and the songs are incredibly smooth. But suddenly, it took a turn for the worse. Just kidding. My life isn\u0027t that dramatic--You can download that album here if you\u0027re a Patron, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kalaloa.com/shop\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I loved the process of making music, so I went on to study music technology at UCM. During this time, I started performing my songs at various venues and realized how many people I could touch with my music. The people who would come to me after a performance and tell me how much they loved a certain song, or that my voice touched them gave me a whole new drive. Now I\u0027m finding more and more ways to share my music with people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Love you all and am sending hugs and music you guys\u0027 way. \u2669 \u266a \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
