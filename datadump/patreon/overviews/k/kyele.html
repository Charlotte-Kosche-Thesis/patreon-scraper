In 2015 I found myself writing more and better than ever: setting schedules and sticking to them, amassing a group of loyal readers, and hitting the ambitious output target of 500,000 posted words a year. In 2016, I\u0027ve resolved to take myself seriously as a writer, and this Patreon page is part of the fulfillment of that resolution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you? \u003c/strong\u003eThe short verson:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ebecause you want me to write more fanfiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I have the slightly longer version, please? \u003c/strong\u003eSure! Story time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my friends, in order to make ends meet and try to bootstrap\na career, run a YouTube Let\u2019s Play channel called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyRm9hNPW4Wz82bgqvzPfYA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNo Nostalgia Filter\u003c/a\u003e. They\nwere talking about this recently with great joy and interest, and everyone was\nresponding in kind \u2013 no hint of shame or worthlessness here. Several of us,\nmyself included, were telling our NNF friends that they should start a Patreon.\n\u003cem\u003eIt\u2019s great!\u003c/em\u003e we said. \u003cem\u003eDon\u2019t feel bad about it!\u003c/em\u003e we said, when they looked\ndoubtful. \u003cem\u003eYou\u2019re working hard, you deserve to be taken seriously!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd then one of my good friends \u2013 one of the few who know\nthat I\u2019ve been really invested in my writing lately \u2013 turned to me, and said, \u003cem\u003ewell, Kyele, has it worked for you? How\u2019s\nyour Patreon doing?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSuffice it to say, this was an eye-opening moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy friends and I made a deal on New Year\u2019s: we\u2019re going\nto do this together. We\u2019re each telling each other that our content has value,\nand so here it is: my Patreon site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s the bottom line? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve realized that I need to stop treating my fanfiction like it\n doesn\u0027t matter. No, it\u0027s not original fiction; no, that doesn\u0027t mean \nit\u0027s somehow less. I\u0027ve resolved to stop saying \"oh, nothing\" when \nsomeone asks me what I\u0027m writing. I\u0027ve resolved to start talking about \nmy writing when someone asks what\u0027s new with me lately. I\u0027m going to \ncome out of the closet, in short. And I\u0027m hoping some of you will want \nto come on that journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy fics will always be free.\u003c/strong\u003e That won\u0027t change.
