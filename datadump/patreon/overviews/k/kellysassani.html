    "summary": "Hey there, I\u0027m Kelly! I\u0027ve had a lot of other handles over the years...some of you may know me by my modeling name Sassie or SassieNOPants, or from my adult work under Lizzie Daniels. In the past my photography name has been Kelly Marie. But here I am, putting everything under one nice umbrella, as Kelly Sassani. Nice to meet you, finally! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s19.postimg.cc/fazxz76oz/Kelly_yellow2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s19.postimg.cc/ufrgiz5ib/kelly_croft_candy_14.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s19.postimg.cc/64hnbx1gj/Sassie-04.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been modeling for almost 10 years and have more recently picked up photography. I would say I\u0027ve been shooting for about 5 years now, but I still have a lot to learn. That brings us here...Making art is expensive. I have a full time retail job that pays the bills, but I would love to someday be able to take my photography full time. I would like to use Patreon as a medium, not only to put all of my work in one place for people to enjoy, but as a motivator to continue putting out new work on a regular basis. I want to be able to travel more, to see things and people that inspire me and shoot in amazing locations. I need to upgrade my equipment as well, but no one wants to hear about gear! I\u0027m currently shooting out of a studio in my home, but I have big plans for the future! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s19.postimg.cc/4178491nn/final.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s19.postimg.cc/mi1mv2hlv/DSC_0104.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s19.postimg.cc/4511ki74z/DSC_0131.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know what to tell you about myself on a personal level...hmm. I\u0027m a manager at a plus size woman\u0027s clothing store. I don\u0027t hate my job, but I hate working retail, and photography is my real passion. I live and work in Amish country. My house is pretty much surrounded by Amish farms. If you ever get a chance to come work with me in my home studio you\u0027ll see that I\u0027m not exaggerating! I love dogs and I can\u0027t wait to adopt one of my own, but for right now I have two pet rats. And a pleco fish who I\u0027ve had for over 5 years! I have bipolar disorder and fibromyalgia, along with many other things, but those are the two you\u0027ll here me talk most about (if at all) because they affect my life on a daily basis. Music is a huge inspiration in my life and my art. I\u0027m a whiskey lover (as you can probably tell from my rewards!), and my other main love is burritos. I think that about sums me up.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI hope you will check out my rewards, as I tried to make a little something for everyone! You will get access to patron only blogs, photo sets, one of a kinds prints and more! Thank you so much for your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
