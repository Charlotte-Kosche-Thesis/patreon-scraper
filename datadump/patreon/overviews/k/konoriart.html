I\u0027m known on the internet as \u003cstrong\u003eKonori\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m a freelance artist/hobby writer living in the southern U.S. and I love drawing, writing/reading, cats, and foxes. I enjoy creating new takes on old creatures, sharing my work with you all, and I adore hearing back from my fans about how my work makes them feel and if it inspires them to draw and write too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo why have I joined Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI joined Patreon about a year ago during a very tough time in my life (I had just lost my beloved Aunt and just recently a favored grandmother). Because of that, I was emotionally unable to provide all the art and chapters I wanted to my followers. But things are picking up! Patreon allows me to fund my art, writing, and keep my glaring (I\u0027ve got four cats \u0026gt;\u0026lt;) fed and healthy. It also gives me the ability to \u003cstrong\u003einteract more with you\u003c/strong\u003e and provides me with ways to \u003cstrong\u003eoffer more rewards\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ereach my dream\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my dream?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy dream is to become an animator at either Marvel Studios or Weta Digital (the magicians behind \u003cem\u003eThe Lord of the Rings\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Hobbit\u003c/em\u003e trilogies). To do that I need to be able to focus on my art so I can get into this exceptional college in Ontario, Canada, get my Master\u0027s degree, and start working on films you all love as much as I do. Your pledges will keep my bills paid, provide me with means to get better equipment which means more rewards for you, and keep my glaring and my own stomachs full and happy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like my work and you want to get cool rewards while joining a gal on the way to her dream, just \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913709-How-do-I-become-a-patron-to-a-creator-\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echoose how much\u003c/a\u003e you want to \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208404313-Why-was-I-charged-immediately-Will-You-Charge-Me-Again-\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epledge per month\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (seriously, even if it\u0027s only $1, it all helps), and select some awesome rewards like one-shot requests, character sketches, colored character busts (which you can request I turn into a badge), or if you\u0027re only a diehard reader, access to chapters as I write them where you can comment and make suggestions! The more support I receive from you, the \u003cstrong\u003emore rewards\u003c/strong\u003e I can offer!
