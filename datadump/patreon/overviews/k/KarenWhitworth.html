I get to share my life, art, and inspiration with you, without a middle man. It also creates a simple platform for artists to be compensated for their work. This can be viewed as a tip, or a monthly subscription to content. Other ways that this money is used on my page is for monthly mentoring, or even a layaway option to purchase original art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I have a Patreon Page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFrom the very beginning of pursuing my art I have been enamored with the very special connection we artists have with our audience. It is a unique and beautiful relationship, one based on sharing on a deep level. The artist puts a lot on the line, sometimes even becoming vulnerable in sharing their heart in the form of their craft. It isn\u0027t always easy to do. But when the artist is connected with their audience, this sharing is embraced in an incredible way. Those scary moments of baring one\u0027s raw emotions are received with such grace and sensitive acknowledgement that the artist is encouraged to do it again... and maybe this time try even harder, reach even farther, because she knows she has a team standing with her, watching, waiting, all with great anticipation. And should she fail... because we all dwell on this often... she knows this same team is still there waiting... offering their support and encouragement for the immense effort that was made. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I have a Patreon Page. It is a platform where I can share not just my art but what goes into it, to engage and involve anyone who is willing, in this amazing art journey.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://f4aqhq.dm2304.livefilestore.com/y4m0BIX6NnpJes4JiaRk0mj73gbSedpId0E5sSqxtUjC2RsybO13tfB9UwFBdGYoGceOSjbKnwSWFfXCf793g8iLHZf8WNBDbcSrJM5QUp9-PicZbDaKj05qjuTZOf5-RvtZZJCK3QB2N1r1KrfTsP156itEV9z0ycEEzYHswrrJxCWzfKed-YFUqwdYVGKydqSycMgNVVjVt-Y2zLQebIZUw\" style=\"margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; width: 343px; float: left;\"\u003eHow do I use the money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe money from my Patreon Page is something that allows me to take on more creative risks than I would be able to otherwise. While pledging is not required to be a part of my team (It is just one way to participate of many) it does provide me with resources to pursue that next creative hurdle with great gusto. Yes, I make money from the sale of my art. But just like any other business there is overhead and those bills get paid. So when I receive money above that threshold, it allows me to pursue things that didn\u0027t fit in the budget before. One example is for Patreon funds to pay the entry fee to a competition (The last one I submitted to was $45), should I win - that investment will bring more income, should I loose - it won\u0027t. So those types of expenses often aren\u0027t made. But with Patreon, I can! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://z9wxna.dm2304.livefilestore.com/y4mn6t58PtS8xvspv4iNRJGBYNhe-CuoQ1SFgPBaDaQX9xTNaOVN1bp7YhBpt5ilhuF7DJV_q9AELf4VdTlavrieJK1w8F6k8LJmn0gHA7BHSYnGLfv4b0Xpdk43nTaVsIaxAUxU4HGK2P8sPrYgQo21Xq5a3txrI2YT9qhLPw4yaO_3s7b9EkD1dMekhLiN3p-f8oYPCIFU13cYR6YMWDTWQ\" style=\"margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; width: 343px; float: left;\"\u003eIf you are considering becoming a patron, first I would like to say:To support an artist with your hard earned money is not only a financial blessing to the artist, but an incredible compliment that encourages the artist to strive even harder to passionately chase after that which inspires them.

     "about": "Originally from Oregon, artist Karen Whitworth has spent her life enjoying nature and its vast sources of artistic inspiration. At a young age her family moved to Alaska where her passion for the outdoors was nurtured and her drive to capture it through paint blossomed. For the next 20 years she painted the rugged landscapes and beautiful animals that resided there. Whether painting a landscape en plein air or a still life in her studio, a common thread of vibrantly illuminated subjects tie her work together beautifully. It is this light that has inspired her recent works and those to come. Her original paintings are exhibited across the U.S. and can be found in collections around the world. Karen now resides in Redmond, Washington with her husband and 2 young children.",
