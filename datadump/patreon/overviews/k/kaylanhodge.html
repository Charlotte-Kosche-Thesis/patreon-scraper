I\u0027ve been writing since the moment I learned how. The first \"book\" I ever wrote was made out of sticky notes about a cat and a dog learning how to share a ball, complete with little doodles. My biggest aspiration has always been to publish, but there was always something barring the path\u2014usually myself and my own anxieties. Though I\u0027d written original things mostly, when I was 14, I fell down the fanfiction hole. It\u0027s only recently that I began sharing my works, though, and I\u0027ve really discovered that people actually\u00a0\u003cem\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e what I write. That I\u0027m thinking too hard and only coming up with excuses; getting in my own way. It\u0027s inspired me to kick into gear and really give my dream a shot so I don\u0027t have to keep wondering what could be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left; font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\t\t\t\t\tTHE EXCHANGE\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\t\t\t\tI write mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and horror. I\u0027m sure a lot of you readers are familiar with my fanfiction mostly, but I want you all to know that this is NOT for my fanfiction. That stuff is going to continue being posted for free and updated on my own time. I might randomly throw in fanfiction-related things every once in a while like early chapter drafts or other things I feel like sharing (for anyone to view), but it will only be in addition to my original stuff, and it won\u0027t be on a tight schedule. You can view my fanfiction completely for free over on FanFiction or AO3. \t \t \t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\tYou\u0027ll have exclusive access to chapters of my original work before publishing, giving you a chance to offer feedback, input, and the ability to watch it grow from concept to polished product. I\u0027ll be able to get my hands on a real copy of a word processor instead of using free browser versions or Google Docs, and with your help, I might even be able to quit my day job and do nothing but create for you lovely readers! Turning my favorite hobby into a job I can use to help support my family with is my goal, but it doesn\u0027t compare to knowing that my writing is bringing joy to people all over. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left; font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\t\t\t\t\tCURRENT PROJECT\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eRight now, I\u0027m working on polishing a novel titled Grotesque. It\u0027s been in the works for a while now, but I\u0027ve again stood in my own way and haven\u0027t focused on it until recently. It\u0027s a fantasy story based on elves, fairies, and all other fantastical creatures. There\u0027s gonna be adventure, danger, creepy things, and maybe a little romance thrown in there. All around, a good time. It\u0027s written in the third person, and around 100k words. I\u0027m not that great at making up summaries or blurbs, but I\u0027ll give it a try: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLeah finds more than she bargained for after applying to be a tour guide at the local mansion-turned-museum in town. A chance encounter introduces her to an entire world existing within our own full of wonder and danger. She has to learn the ins and outs of Faerie if she wants to keep her new friend. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to be posting the first draft chapters once a week, so stay tuned! I\u0027ll be posting all kinds of goodies as well, like written drafts and outlines and anything else I jotted down to help me work (open at slightly higher tiers). You guys can feel free to offer criticism and advice on each chapter, helping to drive the project and feel like part of the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first chapter is public so anyone can have a little taste before they decide they want to pledge. You can also see my fanfictions for more examples of my writing!\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left; font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\t\t\t\t\tMY GRATITUDE\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\t\t\t\tIf you\u0027ve come over to check me out because I mentioned this Patreon on my fanfiction accounts, thanks for taking a look, guys! I\u0027ve finally decided to break out of my shell because of all you lovely people and the nice things you say and all your favs and follows. You have all touched and inspired me in so many ways. You\u0027ve truly given me the confidence I lacked to try and achieve the dream I\u0027ve had for so long. If you become a Patron, then there aren\u0027t enough words in any language to express just how much that would mean to me. Hopefully, though, the rewards I have set up will come close enough to repay you!\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right; font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\t\t\t\t\t~ KAYLA\u003c/div\u003e"
