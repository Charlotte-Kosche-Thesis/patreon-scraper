Unlike the main protagonist of \u2018Knockout,\u2019 the only insomnia Jesse suffers from is self-induced. The latest hours are best spent writing. When he\u2019s not toiling away in his encyclopedic forge, Jesse can be found spending time with his family, playing the occasional video game or dipping into his collection of Punisher comics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eD.C.\u003c/strong\u003e is an editor and screenwriter who often draws inspiration from creators such as Sam Esmail and Edgar Wright. When outside of his writing practices, D.C. is engaged in the soulful sounds of jazz ensembles. He is also an avid gamer and streamer. Being involved in the creation process of #ProjectKO has pushed D.C. like he\u2019s never been pushed before. In addition to molding himself into a better writer for his own contributions, D.C. is passionate about the impact Elijah and his story will have on the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/d8JRHS/KO_project.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#ProjectKO is a community effort designed so that a group of people could craft a world of superheroes and use it as an outlet for the stories that they want to tell. At the heart of this project sits Knockout, the novel we are currently working on and hoping to release late this year. Knockout is set to be distributed digitally alongside Project KO, which will be a collection of short stories and illustrations gathered from the community and from our supporters. These stories will be based in our world but will feature unique characters and conflicts. We have already brought together a multitude of contributors and they have began working on their own contributions. That said, our gates are not yet closed. Project KO is currently planned to be a non-profit companion piece to Knockout itself. If anyone should be interested in submitting a short story or a piece of artwork to be included in that collection, please forward any questions or submissions to \u003ca href=\"mailto:contact.knockoutproject@gmail.com\"\u003econtact.knockoutproject@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/k8ErHS/KO_story.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnother innocent life is taken by police violence. This time the victim is a super-powered woman. The murder spins the community into chaos as the few powered locals grow paranoid and question if they could be next. As the remainder of the city wonders if they should stand with the police or with the powers they\u2019ve yet to understand, one takes it among themselves to retaliate and quickly threatens to turn that chaos into war.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2018Knockout\u2019 is the story of Elijah Harris, a black insomniac with growing super strength. His life is soon tangled in the conflict as he is forced to choose between the heroism he has long avoided and the danger that remaining uninvolved could pose.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/kVTe47/KO_goal.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are hoping to use #ProjectKO as more than a means of releasing our novel. We have recruited a group of guest contributors and will continue to gather more, with our Project serving as the platform that will allow them to express themselves and their ideas on a larger scale than what they might normally have access to. When we publish our completed work, their names and their stories will also be included in the Project KO companion piece. Together we will build an entire world of new legends and new heroes, and in doing so we will amplify the voices of these new creators. This is about building something together, about becoming the platform that so many young writers and illustrators need to elevate their work and build their confidence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon funds will be put towards professional artist commissions and marketing. We want our community to be part of something real, something that they can each be proud of. Much of that will be decided by the appearance of our finished work and by the promotion(s) that have gone into exposing this project. Excess funding, should we receive any, will be put towards the potential physical release of both Knockout and Project KO. This Patreon is intended as a temporary, modest hub for us to gather those funds. This page will only run for as long as the project is being written and revised. We are hoping to complete every element of writing, editing and publishing within six months. We will continue to work regardless of this funding, releasing content once per week, but production windows will obviously be dependent on how much time and money we have to commit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ex_x"
