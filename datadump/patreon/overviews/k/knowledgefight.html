It varies. \u00a0What doesn\u0027t vary is the conviction the two hosts, Dan and Jordan, have to try to understand exactly what the hell is going on with Alex Jones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDan listens to the show every day and gathers clips to play for and discuss with his buddy Jordan. The two get incredibly confused, sometimes get very mad, and usually end up laughing maniacally at how big a bigoted liar he is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show take a whole lot of work, so if you would like to support the show, it would mean a lot to us. \u00a0Thank you in advance for your generosity.",
