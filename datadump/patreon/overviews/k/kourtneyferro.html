I\u0027m the artist behind \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/colouryourworld15\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKourtney Ferro Art \u0026amp; Colouring\u003c/a\u003e and the former creator and reviewer of the adult Colouring review blog \u003ca href=\"http://www.coloururworld15.weebly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eColour Your World\u003c/a\u003e! Since April 2015, when I did my very first review, I\u0027ve grown tremendously and I can\u0027t thank everyone enough for following me along  this crazy art adventure. I have brought thousands of people tons of reviews of coloring books, art products, along with YouTube videos, an informative website, two supportive groups on Facebook for the adult Coloring community, LIVE coloring classes on YouTube, personalizing people\u0027s Coloring books with their favorite Disney characters, and fun colouring entertainment on various social media outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe adult coloring trend that started this massive following of mine has also helped me grab hold of the artist in me that was always there and branch out! I now have a reclaimed love for drawing and painting again! Disney is my inspiration and slight obsession, so you\u0027ll see a lot of fan art on here, on my Instagram and Facebook fan page :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile all of this has led me to so many opportunities, including collaborating with the lovely and popular coloring book queen, Johanna Basford, all of this is a lot of work and takes a lot of my time. It\u0027s basically like having a full time job, except not getting paid for all that I do. With your help and patronage, I can bring you all better content more FREQUENTLY than I already do now---Better quality YouTube videos of my art and reviews, more colored work and tutorials for my adult coloring fans, and more fan art that you all know and love. Supplies get expensive so with your support, this source of income will help keep me going, keep my supplies stocked and doing what I love and it\u0027ll be all because of you! I\u0027d love to be able to tell people that I can support my family off of my art. \u00a0And don\u0027t worry, you get plenty of perks and rewards for becoming one of my patrons. I\u0027ll take care of you! Anything helps so that I can keep this up as long as I can hold a pencil or brush in my hand! Art is what I love, and I would love it even more if it could help put food on the table for my little military family. My husband does enough by sacrificing so much being in the Navy, so it\u0027s my turn to start helping my family by doing what I know....creating things, and putting my heart and soul on to paper, and I can\u0027t do it without you! ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some frequently asked questions you may have yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**So what is Patreon exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHere\u0027s a video that\u0027ll help explain it better than I can! Basically in a nutshell it was created by creators FOR creators to allow them to make a living doing what they loved creating but become actually worth something because of their patrons supporting them and showing the recognition they (we) deserve. Their patrons being their biggest fans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wH-IDF809fQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**What do you use the money you earn for?\u003cbr\u003ePaying for supplies, paying for a sitter so I can go sit at an art class for a couple hours, managing my websites, putting food on the table, keeping a roof over our heads, ya know...important stuff! Don\u0027t worry, I will not be using this money to jet away on a caribbean island vacation (wouldn\u0027t that be nice?) lol but I will be using it to support my art and my family, so there\u0027s that! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Are these all of your creator posts?\u003cbr\u003eNope! If you\u0027re a newcomer to my page, and not a patron yet, depending on the tier you pledge you\u0027re only able to see posts that I decide to make public! So there are some things that won\u0027t become visible to you until you pledge! Certain commissions or projects I\u0027m working on, behind the scenes stuff, ect!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**What if I want to stop being a patron (no offense)?\u003cbr\u003eNon taken! You can easily cancel your pledge, no strings attached, and I thank you for supporting me as far as you have on this crazy journey! And you can always become one again and I\u0027ll be welcoming you with open arms!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**When do I get charged?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon does this automatically on the 1st of every month. It\u0027s extremely consistent and there\u0027s no unpredictability as to when you can expect it to come out of your account.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**When do you mail out the rewards if we\u0027re receiving one for pledging?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon suggests to the creators (me) to wait until a new patron has been charged for the first time to make sure they\u0027re using an active card, and then go ahead and send a reward. So it would be upwards of a month before you would see your reward in the mail! So keep a look out for the first couple weeks after your first charge goes through! I\u0027ll also announce here when a group of rewards are going out! Also keep in mind that some of you are getting originals so bare with me on the time frame!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**What if I want to make a one time donation (weird i know)?\u003cbr\u003eYou can totally do that if you really want to! You can send it through paypal (my email is kcecero@yahoo.com) But even if it\u0027s just a dollar a month, i would be seriously grateful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny other questions please feel free to email me at my business email: hello@kourtneyferroart.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
