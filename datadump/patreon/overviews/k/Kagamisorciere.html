Will it work? Well, that\u0027s entirely up to you guys and my poor attempts at persuasion to convince you to come and play. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a variety of things, tripping my way through genres like fantasy, scifi, surrealist, noir, and even supernatural pieces. I also live in an antique flat in NYC with three roommates that, honestly, hasn\u0027t really even been renovated since it was built- just held together by good wishes and half an inch of paint (I even have a gas lamp switch still attached to my wall- I spin it sometimes for fun). It\u0027s cool, but for this city, it\u0027s low-end living. And costs are high. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently living off of carefully hoarded savings after working in news (yeah, I know) to break more fully into the writing business. The ultimate goal is to elbow my way into either screenwriting or do that One Great Novel everyone allegedly has pent up inside them. It\u0027s a process, though, especially being a Lady, and if you\u0027d like to be a part of that process, here\u0027s what I\u0027d like to have on offer for you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Original Stories Can Get Weird...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBetween\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003epossibly being way too subtle and really just bizarre sometimes, I invite you to peep inside my addled notebook with:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2013 \u003c/strong\u003eOriginal short stories before they\u0027re posted on wider sites, or not posted widely at all to be hoarded for higher purposes (The first 10[TEN] patrons will have access to back works!

Heavy hitters in the Patron department will get the option to have a work proofread by me if they so choose, with any tips and tricks that may apply. The only caveat is some months will be unavailable as I will be drowning in works to edit for a literary magazine during those times. (those months will be March, July, and November)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2013\u003c/strong\u003e The top of the shiny pedestal is a prompt filled of your choice! It can be something original, or fanfiction. Obviously because I am not a wizard and cannot attend to every show that ever was, fanfic requests will be limited to the titles I\u0027m knowledgeable about, but hey, let\u0027s have fun with it. This item\u0027s main caveat is that I reserve the right to decline certain themes (think rape, which is against Patreon policy anyway, so let\u0027s keep it classy, friends).\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 There\u0027ll also be the occasional long ramble from myself about writing, living in the city, and progress on the Greater Employment Journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\uff0aGOALS\uff0a\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a reasonable person.
