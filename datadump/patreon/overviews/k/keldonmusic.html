Nice to meet you!\u00a0I\u2019m a British singer-songwriter, in my early 20\u2019s, who spends most of my time bumping into things, and trying to figure out how to be an adult\u2026 then I turn it into a song. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sensation I get from playing my own songs, at an intimate London venue, to a receptive crowd, has to be the best feeling. I still find it surreal that listeners can actually find some sort of joy or comfort from the words I\u2019ve written in my bedroom. I just pray that this is something that will continue to grow so I can experience that feeling for a long time\u2026 and that\u2019s where you come in! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve recently taken a year out of posting music on YouTube, and other platforms, and I felt I was in need of some self-development. Of course, I\u2019ve still been writing music, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve taken to time to figure out what I actually want to release. In this time, I\u2019ve moved to central London, which I\u2019m certain has helped develop myself in the way I want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with that in mind, I want to begin again. Music is all about reinvention and truth. If you\u2019re not being true to yourself, it surely can\u2019t be possible to write music that speaks truth. I\u2019ve always wanted to share things that I believe in, and this is where I plan to start.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO,\u00a0WHAT NOW?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to reinvent my song, \"Always Here\", which I posted on YouTube, back in 2013. This song was written with the topic of anti-bullying, and particularly eating disorders, in mind. It has had the most beautiful comments and feedback from listeners, letting me know how it has touched and inspired them in some way. Therefore, I have been in the studio, reproducing the track and trying to give it all the right \u0027feels\u0027, and all I need now before I launch my EP, is a music video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

Of course, the equipment and locations for this are expensive, especially in Central London! Luckily, my best friends happen to be actors and dancers, so they\u0027re going to be featured wherever possible. However, I\u0027m likely to need either a director or choreographer, depending on the storyline we choose for the video, so this will be another expense we need to consider.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce the music video is filmed, it\u0027ll be edited and released online, along with the song on iTunes \u0026amp; Spotify. I cannot wait for you all to hear the new, fully-produced version! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, all of this isn\u0027t cheap. I\u0027ve been saving up from my side job to try to make this happen, but realistically, for the budget I need to make a high-quality video, it just won\u0027t cut it as most of my savings ends up being spent on London rent, bills \u0026amp; food. So, I\u0027ve come here to Patreon, after a recommendation from a friend, to ask if there is anyway you can help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every donation that can help me make this a reality, you will receive something in return! Whether it be a song download, four-track EP or handwritten lyrics. Once the song \u0026amp; video are up on iTunes \u0026amp; YouTube, I will be donating 50% of the profits made, from all revenue streams, to UK based anti-bullying charity, Ditch The Label. I want to stand up and be a voice for those who need one. So, let\u0027s make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e",
