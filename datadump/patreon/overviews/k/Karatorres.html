    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"Www.fineforagerarts.com\"\u003eFor the past 8 months, I have been working towards creating a modern, cartoon version of Hieronymus Bosch\u0027s Garden of Earthly Delights. I held a 6-month residency at New City Galerie in Burlington, VT, during which I did extensive studies and completed a portion of one panel. The final projects will depict all three panels in black ink. I have lived below the poverty line for several years, so I have to spend my time finding money instead of making art. Flow state is hard to attain while snatching moments between work and on weekends. It requires long swathes of uninterrupted time.\u00a0Your patronage means the absolute world to me, and I would be thrilled to complete this project. Thank you so much for reading! A more extensive description of my project is available below.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e When I was a kid, I read \u003cem\u003eGo, Dog, Go\u003c/em\u003e. As it was a \u201clearning to read\u201d book, the text was sparse, but the illustrations deeply impacted me. I was particularly enchanted by the illustration of \u201cthree dogs at a party, on a boat at night.\u201d It was difficult for me to understand why the image appealed to me so much, until I studied religion in college and learned about liminality and the tension between the known and unknown aspects of the world. That was when I realized that what was so appealing about the illustration was that the depiction of the \u201cparty\u201d had so very few indicators of being a party--a lollipop, a guitar, a checkerboard, and a few hats--that it was, in fact, almost not a party at all; it was a party by only the most generous definition, a party that verged, even threatened, to not be a party at all. It was precisely this tension that felt so cozy to me; it created a sense of yearning coupled with sadness that for me reflects the ultimate truth of being human. This is the beauty of cartoon art: by reducing complex living things and objects to their bare essentials, it dances playfully with the idea of nonbeing while simultaneously revealing and validating the emotions that create our vulnerability. As an emotionally intense person, I struggle to find my place in the everyday world; for me, cartoon characters represent the most plain of truths, and the painful beauty of being. I seek to create a world that is both magical and dangerous: goofy cartoon characters existing in actual peril. I am fascinated by artists and writers old and new who work in a variety of styles, such as Hieronymus Bosch, Daniel Merriam, Roman Klonek, Dr. Seuss, and Clive Barker, who create dark, mysterious worlds with unusual juxtapositions. I have been especially inspired by Bosch\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights, which contains creatures and structures amalgamated from animal, vegetable, and mineral elements. The pink-colored structures throughout the piece appear to be made from a combination of flesh, glass, and plants. I want to continue creating combinations that defy being defined and easily categorized, because I believe the human tendency to quickly define things with language can often limit our ability to truly see and experience them. I think that by pairing and combining surprising objects, it can allow the viewer to feel and experience rather than think \u0026amp; define. I plan to continue working in micron pen and marker to create a set of drawings that show complex cartoon scenes reminiscent of the world depicted in Bosch\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights, full of chaos, bliss, and torture. I want to create intricate and elaborate scenes that one could look at for long periods of time. I plan to mesh aspects of my various styles, combining cartoons with delicate shading, darkness with light, colorful frivolity, and depictions of characters in intense emotional states. I am interested in experimenting with depictions of recognizable everyday objects that have unexpected textures (ex: feathery hot dogs, bubbly plants), and I\u0027m interested in using color to define objects. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve reflected on the American obsession with happiness and beauty, and ideas from my childhood about what defines femininity. My ultimate goal is to portray a world that reflects the experience of emotional intensity and questions cultural ideas about the primacy of joy."
