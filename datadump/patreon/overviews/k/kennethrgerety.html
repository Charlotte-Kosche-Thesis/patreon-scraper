    "summary": "Welcome to my page\non Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllow me to introduce myself, my name is Kenneth R. Gerety and I\nhave been an avid reader and writer for many years. Stories are what I live and\nbreathe, and though it may not be possible for me to make a living as a storyteller,\nI\u0027ve decided to pursue self-publishing because, simply put, storytelling is\nwhat I live to do. I have already concocted a few volumes of poetry, and am now\nready to focus my creative energy on prose, which is where I feel the most\ncomfortable and driven to succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am currently in\nthe process of editing \u003cem\u003eA Shadow\u0027s Rake:\nWaves of the Tide Book I\u003c/em\u003e, first in what will build into a series of novels\ncentering around the exploits of paranormal creatures known as shadow-waves, as\nwell as the scions of the Bright who labor towards understanding them, and\ncurbing their influence over humanity when they begin to pose too great a\nthreat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese stories are being crafted with the \"Gothic-Fiction and Fantasy\"\ntradition in mind, combining dark moods with intense emotions into a tone\nspanning the spectrum of human passions. I am also a big fan of the epistolary\nformat, using letters and other documents written from certain character\u0027s\nperspectives to inform the plot. It is my aim to utilize such devices towards a\nunique narrative which will be accessible and engaging to readers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy interest in Patreon is that it allows for stimulating interactions between\naudience and author, and provides the kind of support which is difficult to\ncome by when one is attempting to be successful in this ever-changing business\nof storytelling. Should I gain your support, I will be using the resources\nprovided by you towards publishing costs (specifically ordering copies of my\nbooks to proof), and to build my presence in the market, creating marketing\ntools and expanding my reach through social media.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWander with me, alongside my characters, through\nthe grey mists between illumination and numbness, where we are either paralyzed\nby what we fear, or enlightened as we witness our potential through the prism\nof human experience, however shaded our perspectives, however distressing the\nstruggles may be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere is a link to my Author Spotlight on\nLulu.com: \u003ca href=\"http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/kennethgerety\"\u003ehttp://www.lulu.com/spotlight/kennethgerety\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere is a link to my Facebook Author\nPage, Kenneth R.
