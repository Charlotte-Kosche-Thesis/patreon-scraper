    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Bardic Arts are an important part of life in the SCA. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0These \u00a0are our legends, our stories, the tales of our family and friends. Those we share blood with and would shed blood for. \u00a0It is the duty of the bard to chronicle and remember great and low deeds with equal passion and fire, to immortalize the great and to..um...infamize (is that a word?) the less than great! Yes. Infamize. \u00a0Shakespeare made up words, so can we...moving on. \u003cbr\u003eWe need your support, because as per usual, the artistic dreams of bards around the known world vastly exceed the financial means of bards around the known world. \u00a0Hosting and maintaining a podcast at a high level of quality and access does not come without a price tag. \u00a0Equipment used to collect performances unobtrusively does not come cheap. \u00a0The more support we have, the better programming we can produce. \u00a0 Basically it breaks down like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. We need to keep the lights on.\u003c/strong\u003e Hosting and domain costs aren\u0027t what they used to be, but they still sting a bit. Especially when you\u0027re paying for them out of a teacher\u0027s salary (NC is #46 in teacher pay in the nation).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. We want to enable unobtrusive recording of performances at events.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0We\u0027re as sick as you are of seeing laptops and smart phones being whipped out at events to capture a moment. We here at the KWB are super grateful to everyone who DOES do this, but wouldn\u0027t it be awesome to have someone at an event who can discreetly record professional quality versions of entire bardic circles or individual performances without having to ruin a magical moment with a boom mic and camera crew? \u00a0We want to buy and equip teams around the Knowne World with stuff like recorders from the ZOOM handheld series (Google those, they are awesome) so that we can do just that. \u00a0The better recordings we get, the more immersive the podcast can become and you can finally have a clear copy of the newest song to rock Pennsic or Gulf Wars or that golden oldie you haven\u0027t heard since your first war to learn from or just enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. We want to connect bards around the Knowne World in performance and in collaboration.\u003c/strong\u003e If you\u0027d have told me when I was 19 and playing SCA back in 1993 that I\u0027d have the ability to hear and learn from bards from as far away as An Tir, Lochac, or Drachenwald I\u0027d have probably given you my eye-teeth as a thank you. \u00a0For every Bardic Madness adjacent hot bed of period music in the SCA, there are long stretches of land where bards are thin on the ground and are singing their hearts out for the chance to connect with and learn from others. \u00a0We want to help those in the less bard-y parts of the world get advice and guidance from the most respected names in the bardic universe. \u00a0Sort of like having your own peer-in-a-podcast so to speak."
