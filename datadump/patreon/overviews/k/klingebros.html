    "summary": "\"Strange Curiosity\" is the culmination of our interest for paranormal subjects coupled with a experienced eye for production quality and cinematic storytelling.\u00a0 It is the canvas for us to paint the picture we see deep in our minds for not only the entertainment of the viewer, but to bring them into the story with us.\u00a0 Our story is a bit opposite of the norm.\u00a0 We started at the top--thrust right onto the worldwide scene with our show \"Ghost Lab\" on the Discovery Channel that ran for two seasons and 26-1 Hour Episodes in over 80 countries.\u00a0 Cancellation of the show did not cancel our desire to continue.\u00a0 In fact, it fueled it.\u00a0 Every minute of filming for a network television show taught us how to do it.\u00a0 We were sponges to the process.\u00a0 It inevitably gave us the power to create our own brand--one in which we did not have to bow to the network gods.\u00a0 So now we are grass roots.\u00a0 A band of friends taking their own time and money to film what many people call one of the best shows in its genre.\u00a0 But our passion to do this is not fueled by only our desire.\u00a0 It is perpetuated through the energy and support of our fans we made with Ghost Lab who have continued to be with us in our independent adventures with \"Strange Curiosity\".\u00a0 The journey from videotaping our investigations as the team Everyday Paranormal to the Discovery Channel to producing our own independent \nfilms has been a wild one, and we would like the thank our many loyal \nfans and supporters from around the world who have come along for the \nride with us.\u00a0 In order to continue bringing the world new content, we are asking for small donations/subscriptions via this Patreon platform.\u00a0 As you know, these projects take lots of time and money, and we of all people know money is tight no matter who you are.\u00a0 But with a minimum two-dollar per month subscription from our fans, not only could we continue, we could become better and better.\u00a0 In return for our fans generosity, we will not only offer you the exclusive platform for Strange Curiosity going forward, but the longer you stay patrons, the more we will offer never-before-seen paranormal evidence, behind the scene footage, classroom experiences, virtual reality tours, discounts on merchandise AND MORE!\u00a0 That is why we have chosen Patreon, and we hope to see you all here very soon.\u00a0 This is where the party starts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eBrad and Barry Klinge\u003cbr\u003eThe Klinge Brothers\u003cbr\u003e"
