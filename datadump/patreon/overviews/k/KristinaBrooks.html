That means I\u0027ve got about a dozen people in my head just bursting to tell their story. Honestly, I would write them all anyway. But to make them good enough to share I have to keep polishing my craft. That means, classes, conferences, and lots of practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first series, \u003cem\u003eFields of\nAsphodel, \u003c/em\u003eis still in production, six books drafted but as yet\nunfinished. They follow the strange and often humorous life of a\nyoung boy orphaned in a futuristic war, his struggle to find meaning,\nand his need for love as he works to overcome his circumstances and\nfind peace. The first couple of books are nearing completion, but\naren\u0027t there yet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the side I\u0027ve spent the last year\nworking on another project. \u003cem\u003eOn Pilgrim Island \u003c/em\u003eis a\ncompilation of novellas that center around the everyday struggles and\nhumor of life for the citizens of a small town in Fictional\nNorthwestern America. It began as a NaNoWriMo project that fell short\nof novel length, but with added short stories and novellas I believe\nit will be an even more zany and in depth look at all the characters\nconcerned. The first story, \u003cem\u003eAbigail\u0027s Neighbors,\u003c/em\u003e is coming\nalong nicely in fourth draft. The second story, \u003cem\u003eGeorgette\u0027s Pig,\n\u003c/em\u003eis in first draft, nearly finished, and a fun ride. The third, as yet untitled story focuses on Joan and is only barely begun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eSo you see, I still have a lot of\nwork to do\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e. \u003c/span\u003eMy goals as a creator include:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrafting a third novella for \u003cem\u003eOn\n\tPilgrim Island\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEditing all above mentioned books\n\tand stories to their highest potential\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePublishing all the above works\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrafting, editing, and publishing all the stuff in my ideas\n\tfolder that I haven\u0027t even mentioned yet!\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e.
