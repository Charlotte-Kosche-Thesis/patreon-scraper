    "summary": "ETA: Okay so I am clearly going to be posting a lot of recipes in public. I\u0027m learning how I am comfortable doing this Patreon thing as I do it. On the other hand I am also realizing that people are also willing to support my nonfiction work \u0026amp; my tips on craft. Also I am going to add some things about writing sex scenes and the mechanics of kink that will definitely be Patreon only posts. Basically, I\u0027m going to add other kinds of content alongside the fiction and the recipes. I\u0027m still going to make creating more fiction my own personal goal. But that\u0027s because I want better representation and imagery, and frankly we could all use some fun. However I also want patrons to get something good out of supporting me regardless of their reasons for being here. So, a variety of content ahead. I hope that works for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Mikki Kendall. I write. A lot. Most of what you\u0027ll see me write is non fiction. My byline has appeared on a lot of sites. From Washington Post to Salon to the Guardian to Time to Ebony...my non fiction work gets around. It shows up in comics, books, on Twitter, and even on TV and radio. What you might not know is that I also write fiction. My work has appeared in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.firesidefiction.com/issue38/chapter/23/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFireside\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://revelatormagazine.com/fiction/if-god-is-watching/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRevelator\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027ve even posted a couple of stories on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@Karnythia/virgins-170df242f873#.i99vu2m9b\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e. I love writing fiction, but I have always struggled with the idea that it wasn\u0027t really work. Blame a childhood full of lectures about getting a good job and staying there for 30 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love being a writer, but for a long time I sort of trained myself into the mindset that fiction was a hobby. Something to do when I can\u0027t sleep. Now, I am having some minor success with fiction. And I have the really wild idea that I could put out some of the books I\u0027ve written for myself when I couldn\u0027t sleep. (Insomnia means I have a bunch of unpolished manuscripts on my hard drives. A bunch. Rough estimate is 9, though I am starting to realize that if I count the unfinished ones it is more like 15. I don\u0027t get a lot of sleep.) But I still have to make my end of our monthly expenses because well..kids. Kids who eat more than a football team.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that brings me to you patrons. With your support I can devote time to long fiction without feeling guilty and post weekly short fiction. I\u0027ll happily take you out of yourself for a few minutes every week. Because I\u0027m me, there will also be random bonus content. Recipes, peeks at pieces that I have in process, even sneak peeks at Jazzland the graphic novel I am working on with my husband and oldest son. Maybe even some vlogs if a topic really gets me going. I can\u0027t promise you\u0027ll like everything I\u0027ll post, but I can guarantee I\u0027ll give your brain some candy regularly. And maybe something more substantial to chew on regularly too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far, thank you for supporting my work in whatever aspect you support it. I really appreciate it. And you. For those who can\u0027t swing pledging but who have taken the time to read this far? Check in from time to time. I\u0027ll occasionally post free public content. It might be super short flash fiction, it might be cheesy jokes, I won\u0027t know until the mood strikes, but you\u0027ll have a chance to see what goes on in my head too! Thanks again!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
