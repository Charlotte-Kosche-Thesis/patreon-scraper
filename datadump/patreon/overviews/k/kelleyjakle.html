    "summary": "THANK YOU for visiting my Patreon page!\u00a0 The fact that you are reading this automatically means I SO appreciate you and your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLabels are becoming more and more obsolete, and in their place we artists are trying to come up with ways to do what we love but still make ends meet. \u00a0That\u0027s why I think Patreon is such a brilliant idea! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes a village to create a music video. First, there\u0027s the creative process. To produce a song, it takes a studio, musicians, an engineer, an editor, a mixer, and a producer. \u00a0Once we have a full version of the track, we get to planning the video - the concept, getting a director and DP on board, renting camera and lighting equipment. \u00a0Then, depending on the scale of the shoot, we may use a full camera crew, a choreographer, hair and make up, wardrobe, and actors/dancers. \u00a0It is not cool to ask people to work for free, and it IS cool (ok just necessary) to feed the people that come to work.\u00a0 This process for ONE song can take between $5k - $20k. Bonkers, right?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re low on money, DON\u0027T sweat it. \u00a0I\u0027ve definitely been there. I will carry on making music videos\u00a0whether you donate or not, they just might be a bit better and more frequent if\u00a0you do.\u00a0 I love you either way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the fun rewards below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eNO - Pay in any currency!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0As this is US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYes, please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford. Even $1 per music video I upload will make a huge difference and would be greatly appreciated. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eYes of course! If you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you need to donate less that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I grew up singing in Sacramento in between soccer, swim practice and bro-ing out with my older brothers. \u00a0After six years of a cappella magic, I am back to my roots of covering, writing and recording my own music and I am loving every minute of it.\u003cbr\u003eI love to make music. And I love to make videos for the songs I cover/write. Unfortunately, it\u0027s really hard to do that without support. From writing to recording to filming to editing, the process is time consuming and expensive I can\u0027t do it on my own. I would love to be able to make good content and to be able to pay the people who help me along the way. \u00a0That\u0027s why I joined Patreon. If you like what you see here or on my youtube channel, please consider donating to, well, my career. \u00a0Thank you!!\u003cbr\u003e",
