A world where spiders became gigantic and are used as mounts or eat those who are too bold. Sometimes, if you are lucky, they just chew off an arm or leg. A world where some people have to fight for their freedom and if they manage to escape, for acceptance. As they are not always welcomed by the free people. Be there, when everything starts to unfold, gets build before your very eyes and maybe it even leaves some parts for you to sculpt and form. I have made up 5 chapters so far, so there is huge story to be discovered. Be a witness to how a comic book comes together, for the goal is to have it printed once every single page is done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOthers may be interested in how worlds are being build in general and how stories come to life. Maybe you want to be a part of a universe I create, so here is your chance. Whatever you may choose, be assured that you will be part of something unique and special. And who knows where the journey will take us? But I know there will be a lot of stops on the way to get in or out or to enjoy the fruits of our labor and take a moment of mutual wallowing in the world of \u0027After the Shifting\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very excited to work on \u0027After the Shifting\u0027 and more so to share the process and everything concerning ATS with you! I will put out as much content, as I possibly can, but since I have to work on ATS in my free time, the releases may vary. Together we can totally accomplish a weekly release for you to enjoy. All of the comic pages will be available on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapas.io/Kaydee\"\u003emy tapas\u003c/a\u003e page for free too, after they have been released on Patreon. Extra Content will be Patreon exclusive and part of the printed issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlanned is a weekly creation on friday which will contain 1-3 Comic Pages. Extra Creations will not be charged, but are only accessible for patreons pledging $2 or more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
