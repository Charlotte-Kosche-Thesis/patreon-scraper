This will be an 18+ adult-themed portfolio and there will be explicit nudity, however it will be handled in a tasteful, erotic manner rather than simply being pornographic, with an emphasis placed on the emotional bond shared between the two partners.\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/h2\u003eHello, I\u0027m Kannos! You are likely here because you\u0027re already following me at places like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://inkbunny.net/Kannos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInkbunny\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~kannos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWeasyl\u003c/a\u003e. Like most freelance artists, I spend the majority of my time working to bring other people\u0027s ideas to life. While I enjoy this kind of work (nothing beats the squeals of joy when I reveal a piece to a client and it\u0027s everything they imagined it would be), this means that I often have to set my own ideas on the back burner. The few times that I have managed to find time for personal works, they were met with a lot of enthusiasm, so I have decided to try Patreon as a means of helping to support these ideas and allow me to create more art. The funds generated through Patreon will go towards helping to pay my living expenses, cover art supplies/upgrades, and in essence make it possible for me to explore and develop ideas that would otherwise be neglected due to a lack of time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003ePatreon is a pledge-based crowdfunding system that that allows my fans to support the creation of new art pieces. You decide the amount you are willing to pledge towards the completion of new artwork and, in return for your awesome support, you will receive access to exclusive supporter-only content such as high resolution files and even discounts on future commissions!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCan I control how much I spend?\u003c/h2\u003eYES! The sponsor tiers are shown as being per image, however you can also set a monthly cap for yourself. You may want to simply do $1/image with a $1/month cap. This means you will never be charged more than $1/month, regardless of how many images I produce. Conversely, you may choose the $5/image tier with a cap of $15/month. This means you may get charged as little as $5 or as much as $15, depending on the number of images I produce that month, but you will never pay more than the maximum of $15. Regardless of how productive any given month may be, you will never spend more than you are comfortable with. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCan I REALLY have access to content for just $1/month?\u003c/h2\u003eYES! I realize that economic times are rough, so to allow this content to be accessible to anyone I have created a tier that allows people to access content for just $1/image with a $1/mo cap. This will grant you access to everything within the $1 sponsor tier. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat kind of art can I expect to see?\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003eEverything! The pieces will range from detailed scenes to character pinups/portraits. These pieces are essentially all the ideas that I have bouncing around my head but don\u0027t have time to create because I am busy spending all of my time working on commissioned illustrations as a means of supporting myself. There may even be comics, as well, since some ideas are sequential and best expressed that way. All the content created via Patreon will be exclusive to this site and will not be posted elsewhere!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eI want to see a specific species, is that possible?\u003c/h2\u003eYep! While some pieces will come with species I have already determined, there will be plenty of pieces where I will open up for feedback from you guys! This means that you can vote on what the next character(s) will be, and the most popular ones will be selected to be drawn!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eI still have questions!\u003c/h2\u003ePlease don\u0027t hesitate to ask me! I will do my absolute best to be as helpful as I can be! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
