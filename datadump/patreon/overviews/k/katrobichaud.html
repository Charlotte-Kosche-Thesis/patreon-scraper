    "summary": "Hello lovelies and darling misfits!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kat. Some of you may know me from The Voice. Some of you may know me from my fabulous San Francisco variety show, Misfit Cabaret. Some of you may know me from seeing me trek up and down the east coast in my very first band, The Design. Or maybe you just stumbled upon this page and are intrigued. HELLO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 4 successful Kickstarters and GoFundMes, I am starting a Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to release new art to you (songs, music videos, and other artistic endeavors) without you having to wait. I plan on releasing a thing every 2-3 months, and I\u0027ll always give Patreon backers a heads up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.katrobichaud.com/misfitcabaret/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMisfit Cabaret\u003c/a\u003e is a wild variety rock opera for which I write two new original songs for every new show. Each show is themed, and I write within the parameters of the theme. For instance- we have a cult film variety show called Cinephilia, so I wrote songs about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/_o6SUjq0zP0?t=34s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEdward Scissorhands\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/fMl24E1MBGw?t=1m41s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ephoto journalists turning war into art\u003c/a\u003e. For Whimsea, our nautical themed show, I wrote a song about a real life\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYY1SfGMvf4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunderwater ballroom tragedy\u003c/a\u003e, and a song about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWiYHkECJug\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDavid Bowie on a beach\u003c/a\u003e (he had just passed away, I wanted/needed to write a song for him, and parameters have workarounds). For A Very Bloody Misfit Cabaret, I wrote a song about Stephen King\u0027s Carrie White and a song about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCMOJvLGX5U\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ealcohol in the form of a succubus\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first 10 songs from Misfit Cabaret, I released a heavy full length album through Kickstarter (\u003ca href=\"http://www.katrobichaud.com/kratdmmusic/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCHECK IT OUT!\u003c/a\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that we\u0027re doing a brand new\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.katrobichaud.com/misfitcabaret/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMisfit Cabaret\u003c/a\u003e every two months, the music is flowing fast, and rather than wait an entire year or two to release all of the new songs on another album and do yet another giant KS campaign, I would love to record them one at a time and give them to you as soon as they are ready to be released. Patreon is perfect for this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to releasing new music, I also want to create cinematic music videos for some (or all) of the Misfit Cabaret studio recordings. Incredible videographers in the Bay Area have approached me with ideas that I\u0027m over the moon for, and I would love to create visual art to go along with each of these songs. We plan to shoot the first video (for \"Artists\") on July 10th, and \"Misfit Cabaret\" sometime in the summer. \"Song For David Bowie\" is also in the works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to release Patreon-backers-only exclusive videos of the full Misfit Cabaret shows from beginning to end, especially for fans who live on the other side of the country/world and can\u0027t see it live. Grimm is the first one I\u0027d like to tackle, because it was such a beautiful show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn supporting this Patreon, you are not only supporting me as an artist, you are also supporting the Bay Area artist community. Having the funds to record new songs and create new videos means I get to employ local artists\u2013 just as Misfit Cabaret employs local performers and gives them a big gorgeous stage to dazzle on.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support!

How much will this cost me?\u00a0 Is it a monthly charge?\u003cbr\u003eANSWER: There are two ways of setting a Patreon up- one is a monthly cost and one is a pay-per-thing. I went with the pay per thing option because I\u0027m only going to be putting something out once every 2-3 months. I wouldn\u0027t want people to pay monthly if they\u0027re not receiving anything. It\u0027s completely up to you how much you pay for a thing. There are different price tiers to the right of the page, and you can be a patron for as little as $1 and receive song downloads and other goodies.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

After a successful run on The Voice, Kat relocated to San Francisco and promptly earned a name for herself with Misfit Cabaret, an electrifying variety show featuring some of the Bay Area\u0027s most talented burlesque dancers, aerialists, magicians, musicians, with Kat herself as the savagely brilliant ringleader.  Kat Robichaud\u0027s latest album, Misfit Cabaret, is comprised of songs from her show and smolders with dark, vaudevillian glee. Featuring songs about telekinetic revenge (\"Bully\"), a harrowing dance with death (\"The Last Waltz of the Wrights\"), and a dreamy tribute to a lost soul (\"White Snow, White Dress\"), Kat\u0027s Misfit Cabaret sends its listeners on a delirious jaunt through the light and dark sides of love, death, and of course, musical theater.",
