    "summary": "Howdy y\u0027all ^^ Since you must have gotten here somehow, we\u0027re gonna take it as a given that you know who I am. And if you\u0027ve been following me for a while, you\u0027ll know that I write a lot. The reason is that I don\u0027t actually consider my writing of fanfiction to be a hobby, I consider it part of my eventual writing career. Specifically, it\u0027s basically like an internship \u2013 I\u0027m spending hours on end writing, so that some day I\u0027ll have the experience and ability to make a living with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, I don\u0027t plan on making that living through Patreon. Authors don\u0027t typically make a livable wage here, and that\u0027s fine. But I do work a lot fewer hours than I should so that I have more time to work on writing, and earning some kind of income on the side would go a long way towards making up for the loss in my primary income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I went into this without any expectations of financial compensation. I\u0027m going to continue writing with or without a successful Patreon, so there\u0027s no need to feel obligated into doing anything. Hell, if I can get even a few dollars a month out of this, that\u0027ll be one milkshake per month that I didn\u0027t have before =D"
