Once each month (on or around the 1st), the amount pledged per creation by each patron (that\u2019s you!) is multiplied by the number of creations posted that month and processed. If you want to limit the amount to a certain number of \u201ccreations\u201d each month, there\u2019s an option to do that in the initial checkout process when you sign up. This can be edited later in case you change your mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to pledge at a level that is not shown, just choose a level lower than the amount you want to pledge, and during the checkout process, change the amount to the amount you\u0027d like to give.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan\u2019t wait to get to know you and make some beautiful music! Thank you so much!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e- Keith Tim\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
