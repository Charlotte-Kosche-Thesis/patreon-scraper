     "about": "Within each heart and life are deep internal motivations. We are driven to express\u2026 to communicate\u2026 to move to the rhythm of a passion to know and be known. We have been given an ability to think and dream and engage all that is around us\u2026 but yet there is a longing for a meaningful interaction with a world that is seemingly beyond our grasp. So begins the journey of the heart\u2026 desperate to experience life and all it has to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe songs upon this site are mile marker moments within this journey. They are intersections of time when I was moved to express an experience\u2026 be it a celebration or a moment of sadness it is all sincere and honest\u2026 it is my journey. I hope as you listen to these songs\u2026 that you will be encouraged in your journey and that you are ultimately able to find your way within this marvelous gift of LIFE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll never forget when I first heard Will Ackerman\u2019s album \u201cPassage.\u201d It was Fall of 1982 and the moment I placed the needle on the grooves of this record, I was immediately drawn into it\u2019s simplicity and beauty. At that time I had been playing the guitar since 1978 and I started to dream of one day recording an album as beautiful as \u201cPassage.\u201d I am still in pursuit of that dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a musician my focus is acoustic guitar, although I have recorded works that feature electric guitar and I may do so again, but for all intents and purposes\u2026 my heart and deepest passion is the wonder and beauty of an acoustic guitar. All it took was one listen of Will\u2019s album \u201cPassage\u201d and my life was changed. Music can have such a profound effect on our lives. It\u2019s the reason why I play!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKen has been featured on several sampler releases. He has appeared on Winter Gifts, and Winter Gifts II (Many Miles Music). Ken was also featured (music and photography) on The Gathering which is a handpicked collection of songs from 22 artists recently produced by Grammy winning guitarist and founder of Windham Hill Records, Will Ackerman at his Imaginary Road Studios in Vermont. The Gathering in 2012 won \"Album of the Year\" at the 9th annual ZMR Music Awards. Recently Ken was featured on Best New Age Reviews (music \u0026amp; photography) - The Guitar. This sampler disc contains some of the world\u0027s best guitarists!!! Ken has a growing audience in Asia and Europe and hopes to tour there one day.",
