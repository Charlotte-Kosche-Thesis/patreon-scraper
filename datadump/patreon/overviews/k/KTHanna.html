The entire set is available \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/K.T.-Hanna/e/B00ZBPYU78\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Originally from Australia, I met my husband in EQ2 way back in 2005. My parents warned me he could be an axe murderer, but so far I think we\u0027re good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been living in Kansas, USA since 2007, and own corgis (yes CORGIS plural), and two awesome rescue cats.\u00a0 We have a lovely little human girl who won\u0027t eat anything I make, and listens to nothing we say.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as what this Patreon is about - I create. I create stories. In fact, if I don\u0027t create stories and worlds and give solidity to all the voices in my head, I become \u003cem\u003e\"the evil bitchmonster of death\" \u003c/em\u003e(bonus points if you know where that line is from). I find sharing what I create with people makes me create faster and better content. Thus! The idea for this Patreon was born! You gain access to said creative flow, and receive lots of creativity from me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering I met my husband in a computer game, it took me way too long to discover GameLit. However, I\u0027m rectifying this by writing like a rabid... typer. I\u0027m so excited to dive into this genre which is ridiculously close to my heart and my own life experiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also plan to release several other books I\u0027ve written previously at some stage along the line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccess will be fun, and hopefully sometimes funny, whether you\u0027re laughing at or with me, I really don\u0027t mind. From Maps to concept art, and fully fledged art pieces, and a little more time to write whole lot more, I\u0027m really excited to continue my writing journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u003cbr\u003eK.T.
