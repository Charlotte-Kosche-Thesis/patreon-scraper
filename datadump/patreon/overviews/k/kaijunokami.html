    "summary": "Throughout my life, I have experienced many things and tried my hand doing something new. \u00a0It has been an adventure which has now led me to making reviews and educating others on film and television. \u00a0Also, it has given me an opportunity to provide a voice to fans at conventions and public events. \u00a0While I have been successful doing this on my own, now I need to ask for a little help. \u00a0Donating films, providing feedback on how to improve, and becoming a Patron are great ways to help get me there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a little about me, Kaiju no Kami. \u00a0My real name is Marcus and I am originally from Buffalo New York. \u00a0My wife and I moved to Denver Colorado in 2006 to take our first adventure in moving across country. \u00a0For many years I worked movie and video game retail services as an expert on the quality of products. \u00a0With my love in all forms of media, I was able to connect with and inspire others to try new things. \u00a0In 2010, I worked on my Master\u0027s degree in Education to help pass my love of media and learning onto students. \u00a0While doing that and seeing how it helped students, I wanted to try my hand at helping others learn more about movies and other forms of entertainment such as Tokusatsu. \u00a0This not only helped me connect to with others, it also taught me a lot about myself and the ability to take risks. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumbly, I thank you all for this experience as it has been fun and something that I hope to continue doing for much, much longer. \u00a0If you can offer financial support through Patreon that is awesome! \u00a0If not, I appreciate your watching my videos and being a fan. \u00a0At the end of the day, I am doing this for you!\u003cbr\u003e"
