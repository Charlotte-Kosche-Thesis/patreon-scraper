    "summary": "I\u0027m Keith Frady, a fiction writer living in Atlanta who has been trained by author bios to slip into the third person when describing himself. My work has appeared in a few online journals and a couple of print anthologies, including Meerkat Press\u0027s \u003cem\u003eBehind the Mask\u003c/em\u003e, which was selected by Kirkus Reviews as a best indie book of 2017. I primarily write prose and comics short stories that lean towards the speculative end of the fiction spectrum, with a heavy tilt towards magical realism or fabulism. I don\u0027t exclusively write in these genres, but when I write I tend to emphasize and literally depict humanity\u0027s wonders and horrors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a short and a long term goal for Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort term - I recently launched a webcomic anthology entitled The Usual Choices, wherein I write short comics and hire different artists to draw them. These talented artists need to be paid, and by saving up from my day job I can afford a new comic on my own every 3-4 months. With Patreon, and your support, that can be upgraded to a comic every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong term - To support myself financially solely through writing. This is the big one, the quit-my-day-job endgame. I currently submit short stories to journals and anthologies (and, occasionally, they are kind enough to publish them), and I will continue to do so for the foreeable future, but short fiction isn\u0027t a particularly lucrative form, and it\u0027s how my creativity tends to function. Maybe one day I\u0027ll pen a novel, get a story collection published, or land an ongoing comics series, but until then my fortunes are going to be based more in luck than wealth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your faith and hope in me, you will get access to flash fiction exclusively available on Patreon, as well as behind-the-scenes materials on my prose and comics work. I\u0027m also considering writing essays, or book and movie reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, thank you. Writing is a lonely endeavor, but telling stories is communal. It would be impossible for me to do my job without you sitting around the proverbial campfire. Thank you for reading, and giving me the chance to write. Maybe one night, the full moon above grinning with something like malice, the fire casting shadows that dance on the ancient faces of the trees, the chirping crickets all around will suddenly fall still, and I can make you catch your breath just as something cracks a branch in the dark."
