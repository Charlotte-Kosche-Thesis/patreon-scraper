    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi! Thank you for stopping in.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Kali\u003c/strong\u003e - wife, mom of two under two, step-mama to three, Southern girl living in Toronto. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd your favourite writer. \u003c/strong\u003e(Hopefully...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m wrapping up completion of a novel I\u0027ve been working on for almost \u003cstrong\u003ethree years\u003c/strong\u003e now. In between an international move, parenting, marriage, and trying to combat writer\u0027s block and exhaustion, it\u0027s taken me a while to get this one finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next step, if I were following the traditional publishing model, would be to start crafting witty query letters to try and tempt an agent to open up the first few pages of my manuscript. Then hopefully within 8 weeks they\u0027d ask for the rest, and then maybe a year or so after that a publisher might consider taking on my work, and after a ton of edits, cuts, and things I probably wouldn\u0027t like, it might end up on the shelf of a bookstore conglomerate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t want to do that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo instead, I\u0027m publishing my book here, online. \u003cbr\u003eDirectly to you, the reader. \u003cbr\u003eThe people I actually care about most when it comes to my art.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing the chapters roughly three at a time (this may vary slightly). There is only one monthly payment option, and everyone will receive all of the chapters as they are released. This means, hypothetically, you could wait until you see that I have released the book in its entirety and only pay once and get it all. \u003cem\u003eFor obvious reasons, I wouldn\u0027t recommend that. \u003c/em\u003eBut it\u0027s your money. Use it how you\u0027d like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis also means that if you sign up in the middle of the novel, I\u0027ll send you all of the chapters you\u0027ve missed up until that date.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also receive access to my patron-only content - mainly the patron blog, behind-the-scenes pictures and editing content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND I want your input - if you hate a character, love a character, or love to hate a character, let me know. If you find something cheesy, implausible, outrageous, or hilarious, tell me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis book is for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, about the book.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWicked \u003c/i\u003eis an espionage thriller - full of international drama, heartless spies, and strange sex. It circles around Elena (or is that her real name?), a spy for the elite, private espionage agency known only as The Firm. Even \u003cem\u003eshe \u003c/em\u003eisn\u0027t sure what they do. And then there\u0027s Aiden, a reporter living in Toronto looking to make his big break. When their paths collide, they each have risky decisions to make - like, does she kill him? Does he give her up to the American government - who will likely torture and then kill her? Will this all end in death?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this novel had a movie rating, it would be NC-17. It\u0027s full of violence, twisted manipulation, sex and strong language. You\u0027ve been warned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you all enjoy it xx\u003cbr\u003eAnd again - THANK YOU \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
