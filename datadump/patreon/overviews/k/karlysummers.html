(Also because music lives undeniably in my bones)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the past few years, I\u0027ve had growing pains where I\u0027ve struggled to find a balance within my emotional self. My heart wore thin. I was torn between the expectations and logistics of life and who it is that I really am, and what I really want- regardless of the former. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eDuring this time of inner work, I continued to pour myself into what remained constant to me- music and songwriting- and I composed songs that I feel are the strongest I\u2019ve created as an artist yet. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNot only has my art evolved, but I feel I have too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, the way I go about sharing all this- all I have learned and expressed through words and melodies- is also evolving.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnter this Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonGBowen/jongbowen.github.io/master/karlyyay.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m recording each of these new songs, one at a time, just as they came to me, in my little studio and sending them off directly to you, with no delay, so that we can share in this together. All of which, are uploaded to my SoundCloud account. If you want to keep going and fully share in this art-love fest though, then \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethis is the place to be!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (And you mean a lot to me) *And I\u0027ll probably send you private messages that rhyme now, holy cow*\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTo help with the love part of the fest, you\u0027re able to support me and my art by pledging any one of the suggested tiers on a monthly bases that are listed on this page. Donate the amount you see fit. Think my music is the price of a fancy latte? You can pledge $5. Think it\u0027s more like a straight up drip coffee? $3. Think you love me? $20. It\u0027s your call!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027ll be doing on my end is working my creative butt off to ensure that you receive your pledges worth. I\u0027ve designed each tier with love to bring you goodies! Goodies that I have coddled, kissed and told were magnificent and am now sending off to you, their rightful owner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, let\u2019s talk songwriting, hangout, send love notes, get inspired and be\u2026 raw, uninhibited and authentic together!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://github.com/JonGBowen/jongbowen.github.io/blob/master/jon-easter-egg-lol-haha.jpg?raw=true\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo much gratitude, \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eK\u003cbr\u003e"
