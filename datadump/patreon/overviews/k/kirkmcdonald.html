Most of the problem of calculating ratios is fairly trivial to implement, and so you can find any number of implementations which can provide useful numbers for the first 90% or so of the problem.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, the problem becomes considerably more complicated as you start paying attention to the small details, and there are very few Factorio calculators which bother to pursue the problem after the point where solving it starts to become difficult.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of the notable features of my calculator include:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOil processing calculations. Factorio\u0027s oil processing recipes are the first point where most calculators start to have problems producing a solution. My calculator does the hard work necessary to calculate optimal and numerically precise results for these recipes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eModules and beacons. These items allow you to modify the costs of recipes, and can have an enormous impact on the designs of late-game factories.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eUnlimited numerical precision. My calculator performs its calculations using\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic\"\u003ebignum rationals\u003c/a\u003e, avoiding any of the loss of precision that using ordinary floating-point values might cause.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAnd more!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else I should know?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s been quite gratifying to see the response to this little side-project of mine. I started writing it merely for my own benefit, and I\u0027ve been quite pleased to see that other people find it useful, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for using my Factorio calculator!"
