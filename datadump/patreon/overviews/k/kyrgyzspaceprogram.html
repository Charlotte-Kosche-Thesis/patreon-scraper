In fact, CubeSat is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cubesats/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe most popular class of satellites among amateur space explorers\u003c/a\u003e.

We are most famous for the media outlet that we\u0027ve been running since 2007: it is called Kloop, and most of its authors are young people aged 14 to 25. They cover politics,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/server-shenanigans-local-media-reports-kyrgyz-campaign-used-government-server/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einvestigate corruption\u003c/a\u003e, and report on human rights violations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the young age of its authors, Kloop has become one of the leading online media in Kyrgyzstan, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wm19zoN2uw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewas even featured at TED\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKloop Media has been running its own journalism school since the year of establishment. We have always been proud that our students have equal access to knowledge, no matter what their gender is. This is how we brought up the whole generation of female investigative journalists, editors, video engineers, camera operators, and sports reporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen to the TEDx talk of Anna Lelik, one of the most famous alumni, reporters, and editors in Kloop\u0027s history:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j8i68s7rTHs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what journalism has to do with space exploration?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe decided to reach new heights, and in 2016 Kloop Media launched new courses on programming and robotics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, robotics course was mostly attended by boys. This is when we decided that we should launch a STEM course aimed specifically at girls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe same year Bektour Iskender, one of Kloop founders, met Alex MacDonald from NASA at TED Summit. Alex\u00a0travels around the world inspiring people to launch local space programs. After hearing what Kloop Media does, he proposed the idea of setting up Kyrgyz Space Program, saying that launching satellites has become \"as cheap as never before\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe at Kloop Media then decided to combine two ideas (STEM for girls + satellite), and that\u0027s how the satellite-building school for girls was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen does the school start and how long will it last?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe school started on March 5, 2018. It will last until the moment the satellite is sent to the space. We hope that it won\u0027t take more than two years, but with satellite-building it is pretty unpredictable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho will train?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the first stage, it will be Kloop\u0027s own team of trainers, led by co-founder Rinat Tuhvatshin. Kloop has been famous in Kyrgyzstan for introducing technical innovations into journalism. For example, in 2012 the team led by Rinat built Kloop\u0027s first drone by themselves (because drones were not sold in the country back then). That drone flew several times and shot 15 minutes of footage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2014, Kloop has been experimenting with cheapest possible technologies for live video broadcasting, and that turned us into the leading media outlet in Kyrgyzstan in terms of the quality (and quantity) of online live video coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the second stage of the satellite-building school we will invite our friends from the Lithuanian company\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://n-avionics.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNanoAvionics\u003c/a\u003e. It will happen if we manage to reach $2500-a-month funding. NanoAvionics are famous for launching the first Lithuanian satellite, which was also a CubeSat, so their knowledge will be the most useful we can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll illustrations used for this campaign are by Tatyana Zelenskaya\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
