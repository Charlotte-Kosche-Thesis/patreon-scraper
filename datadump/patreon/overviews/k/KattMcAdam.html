    "summary": "So I\u2019ve been working on my webcomic \"Deadline\" for nine years. I\u2019ve tried all sorts of things to get my webcomic out there. So here I am. So what i would like to do (still want to do) is try to turn it into it\u2019s own book while still putting it up on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do work on other things; stories and other ocs that don\u2019t have a connection to my webcomic. (they\u2019re all anthromice, though i have drawn other anthros.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I forget, my webcomic started on April 26th, 2008 and all the characters started off as human. Though little bits here and there after December, 2014 I had started to slowly draw them differently. By July 2nd, 2015 I had officially started my comic back up after a year hiatus and had started drawing my characters as anthro mice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntro: Deadline is about a 16 year old girl that like any other teenager has parents, goes to school, has friends and has a part time job\u2026.her parents are both men (yup both men are biologically her parents, how? Sorry, spoilers ^^) her school is not normal (like doesn\u2019t have just mortals going there) her friends aren\u2019t normal (one works for mother nature, one works for cupid and two are half angels/fallen angels, but one works in Heaven and the other works in Hell. (yes, i said \u201cHell\u201d It\u2019s a place. So it works ^^ )  and she\u2019s a grim reaper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have another project in the works to do a audio podcast (think \u201cWelcome to Nightvale\u201d) only this is more based on what goes on with the school after they\u2019ve graduated from it ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Do highly suggest though that you are under the age of 15 that you ask your parents for permission before reading my comic. Mostly because of the graphic violence and sexual content in it. Therefore....the website is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://deadline12.smackjeeves.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeadline\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also one more thing. Half the money that is contributed will go to the book and the other half will be going towards the procedure; in vitro. I will be going through in order to have kids of my own since it\u0027s very expensive and most insurances don\u0027t cover it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*P.S don\u2019t be surprised if you see conversations between myself and my characters with the drawings/sketches. I\u2019ve worked on this for so long they practically write the story themselves as well as comment on what i draw ^^; *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLexis: Yup, we love talking to her!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: Lexis! really?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLexis: why not? they should get a taste of my 4th wall breaking ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: -_- yeah, yeah.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway hope you enjoy going on this ride with us as much as we will ^^\u003cbr\u003e"
