    "summary": "My name is Kay Holt, and I am a haunted house. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLife as a haunted house isn\u0027t easy. I\u0027m so overrun by bad\nmemories and nightmares that I can\u0027t work, I struggle to do things I enjoy, and\nsometimes I completely shut down. I lose time. I feel things that aren\u0027t there\n- I have panic attacks and tactile hallucinations almost every day. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe good news is that I am also a writer. And after years of\ntherapy and medication for my PTSD, and many requests from my friends, I\u0027m finally\ngoing to throw the book at my ghosts. Which is to say that I\u0027m writing a\nmemoir. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome of you have been waiting for this book almost as long\nas I\u0027ve been waiting to write it. Some of you just heard about it. Welcome to\nmy scary life! Now that you\u0027re all gathered here, stay awhile, and listen while\nI spill my guts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSometimes PTSD makes it nearly impossible for me to find\nwords, which is a BIG problem for a writer. I work around this by using\ndictation software to transcribe while I literally tell my stories. This way I\ncan draft my life story as quickly as I can talk, which is a little bit faster\nthan my internal editor can censor the process. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI could toil away on this project in secret, but keeping my\nghosts to myself is part of why I\u0027m still haunted. It\u0027s time to break that\nhabit, hence the creation of this Patreon. For most creators who use it,\nPatreon is primarily a revenue stream intended to supplement or replace their\nincome from other sources, but also an elegant way to expand and interact with\ntheir audience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSupporters of my Patreon\nwill help drive the course of my memoir. You\u0027ll get access to unedited audio of\nme telling my stories, plus the transcribed texts. Patrons at higher pledge\nlevels will get to see (and help choose!) pics as supplements to my stories,\nhave a character named after them (since I won\u0027t be using real names), participate\nin Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s \u2013 ask me questions I didn\u0027t answer in my recordings! \u2013 and even\nhelp me choose which stories end up in the final Table of Contents. That means\nyou\u0027ll get to hear stories no one but Patrons will!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver time I\u0027ll be posting polls\nasking the public which stories I should tell next. The polls will be open to\nanyone, but only Patreon supporters will get to hear the stories themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI hope that by going after\nmy ghosts with words, others will find support, humor, decompression, and relief\nas well. Please watch my intro video and check out the first story (from the\nfirst poll, free to everyone), and consider helping me share these pieces of\nmyself.\u003cbr\u003e"
