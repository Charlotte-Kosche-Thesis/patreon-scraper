    "summary": "Tons of people are trying to make playing games a career. I am late to the party in trying to do the same but I am hitting it with a vengeance! If I were ever to be in a position where I can quit my job and get payed almost the same amount from gaming then I\u0027d do it in a heartbeat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am actually rather content with my current job. Been doing the same job for 10-ish years and I can probably do it for the rest of my life. Might sound ridiculous to some people but it\u0027s done me well! The only thing is working for a little over minimum wage is not so great. I would get a second job but I love my hobbies way to much to make that sacrifice and I\u0027m in a position that I don\u0027t have to make that sacrifice. However, with your help I CAN make my hobbies as a \"Second Job\" and it can even go as far as being my main source of income! (Which will take some time for that to happen) I would be eternally grateful if you would become a patron of mine and support me on my journey to make gaming a career! Just imagine that. That\u0027s like EVERYONE\u0027S dream! Probably even Obama\u0027s dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso cat food and kitty litter are not cheap! =^.^="
