    "summary": "My name is Kami Chisholm, and I am a co-founder of the \u003ca href=\"http://torontoqueerfilmfest.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eToronto Queer Film Festival\u003c/a\u003e as well as a filmmaker, video artist, and media activist. I am originally from the US but am currently based in Toronto, Canada. \nI began my filmmaking career as an undergraduate double major in film production and English at Loyola Marymount University, before going on to do a PhD in History of Consciousness and Feminist Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Later, after giving up on the vagaries of part-time academic employment, I moved to Canada and decided to return to my filmmaking practice, attending York University\u0027s MFA program in Film \nProduction, where I completed my second long-form documentary, \u003cem\u003ePride Denied\u003c/em\u003e (forthcoming from Vtape), which explores topics such as homonationalism\n and pinkwashing in the context of the 2014 World Pride festival in \nToronto.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I have made more than a dozen films \nthat have screened at festivals, universities, and events worldwide, \nincluding \"The Well\" (Indiepix, 2015), \u201cThe Insomniacs\u201d (Wolfe Video, 2008), and \u003cem\u003eFtF: Female to Femme\u003c/em\u003e (Frameline Distribution, 2006). Recently,\u00a0 I spent eight months as an Artist in Residence at Osgoode Law \nSchool at York University, where I began \nworking on my third feature documentary, \u003cem\u003eCitizen\u003c/em\u003e, which examines the ways in which citizenship has become the framework for access to basic needs and human rights. For more information about my work, please visit my website at \u003ca href=\"http://altcinema.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.altcinema.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to \u003cem\u003eCitizen\u003c/em\u003e, I have a number of feature length projects - including a hybrid documentary adaptation of my PhD dissertation - as well as numerous short film projects in the works. These projects range from educational and activist videos to experimental documentaries to queer fiction films. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can start bringing these projects to fruition in the near future. It\u0027s not easy to survive and thrive doing creative and intellectual work without an academic appointment, access to grants (as a non-Canadian I\u0027m restricted from applying to council grants etc.), or other funding due to the non-commercial nature of my work. It has never been easier, in certain ways, to make films and video today... but how to support oneself while doing non-commercial work is a whole other problem! If you support independent media, the best way to help makers create it is to support them while they are still in production. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrowdfunding makes it possible for makers and viewers to come together to produce the kind of work they want to see. If you enjoy the work that I do, please consider making a pledge to help sustain and grow my practice!\u003cbr\u003e"
