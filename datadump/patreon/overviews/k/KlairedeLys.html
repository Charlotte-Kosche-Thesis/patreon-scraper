I\u0027m a\u00a0mixed media artist and writer from the UK and this is my Patreon. When I say mixed media artist what I mean is I do a lot of different things which all tend to blend into each other. I love photography, makeup, writing and art; so my art tends to illustrate my stories, I make stories for my art, and sometimes I create those characters with make and photograph them like the piece above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you by being my\u00a0Patron?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I do quite a few different things I\u0027ve set up different tiers for my different content\u00a0so that you can select exactly the content you want to see. For the moment I have three tiers which focus on my art and writing, but once I\u0027m ready to start my photography series (tentatively titled the \"In My Dreams series) I\u0027ll add a new tier which will include week early looks at the new photography, the makeup on the models, DIYs for the props and a vlog/walkthrough of the whole process for each new release. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I get too excited telling you about it I\u0027ll stop, because that project is still a while away, but it\u0027s been years in the making and I\u0027m very much looking forward to sharing it with you all! It\u0027ll be a beautiful combination of my photography, crafting and makeup, all mixed with a little bit of storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://klairedelys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Finishing-Touches.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eSo, let\u0027s start with tier 0.1...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWith this\u00a0tier you\u0027ll get to see all my videos a week before they go live on You Tube\u00a0and get a look at what goes on behind the scenes. This could be a new piece for my Emotions series, new fabric designs (like the picture above) or portrait and character concept art for the Outsider series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e And tier 0.2\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eAll the benefits of tier 0.1 along with inclusion in my giveaways and downloadable outlines of my artwork. If you liked the look of one of the pieces in my emotions series, or some of the fabric designs you\u0027ll have a PDF download available. Feel free to take them and make them your own, better yet, share them with me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/klairedelys/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e! I\u0027d love to see how you recreate them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the giveaways, there are two kinds I like to do. While I will sell most of my artwork, every month or two I\u0027d rather give them away to you guys, so I\u0027ll present a selection of pieces, you get to vote on which one you want, and out of all of those votes I\u0027ll select a winner and send their preferred piece to them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second kind of giveaway will be art giveaways. Currently, I\u0027m collecting together materials for a \u00a3200 art giveaway which will include all my favorite tools which I uses for the Outsider illustrations. I like to theme my giveaways, so the next giveaway is sketching tools, the next will be watercolors, the next my favourite inks etc. If it\u0027s a tool or medium I use a lot, at some point I will probably include it in a giveaway bundle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://klairedelys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Chapter-4-Leaving-Home.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat about tier 0.3?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis one includes all of the previous rewards along with my favorite project, the Outsider series.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eSet in the fictional world of Ammasteinn, the story follows Jarl Vorn. A dwarf convinced that his city is about to be overrun by the goblins who, for the first time in history, have all been united under one goblin; the savage and brilliant Ulf. When the king and his council ignore the threat, Jarl decides to leave his city and travel to the high city of L\u01ebgberg, where he hopes he can convince the\u00a0high queen, V\u00edgd\u00eds Kron, that the threat is real before his home is destroyed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLead by Astrid, a famed but reclusive guide from the human lands, Jarl, his best friend Halvard and his adoptive son Knud must make their\u00a0way along the Riddari mountains to L\u01ebgberg before time runs out. But Halvard can\u0027t shake the feeling that the\u00a0greatest\u00a0threat might be their guide, Astrid.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e___________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s the blurb for Outsider! :D There are three books in the series - so far we\u0027re on the first book- and each week I\u0027ll release a new chapter along with an illustration for it. Patrons get to read each chapter a week before they\u0027re made available on my website, but if you\u0027re a new patron and need to catch up with the series you can read all the previous chapters\u003ca href=\"http://www.klairedelys.com/outsider-1/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0here\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003eon my website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://klairedelys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Just-The-Hair-Left.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eEach chapter is illustrated, but I also create concept art for the world and characters of Ammastein. Of course, feel free to request portraits, character designs and concept art for any of your favorite places or people in the series. I\u0027ll be more than happy to create them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s me and what I do.
