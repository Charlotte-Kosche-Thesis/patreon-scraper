I knew from the second I stumbled on this unique art form that I had fallen in love. From then on I have kept creating while continuously looking for new ways to grow and improve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img07.deviantart.net/ca0a/i/2017/171/2/6/bgf_by_keeatah-dbdewr5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has come time that in order to continue to grow I need to start thinking about relocating. I love my little quirky shop but I have long outgrown it. The greatest issues come in the form of not having enough storage space and not being able to regulate the temperature of the room. Many of my materials are stored in other locations as well as my trailer which makes suit building highly inefficient at times. My shop also has poor insulation which means there are entire months in the year where casting is not an option. Meeting this goal would allow me to look for and eventually move to a new location with more space and better accommodations. This would greatly improve the quality and turnaround time of my products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img14.deviantart.net/be31/i/2017/171/3/0/7ygnjb_by_keeatah-dbdewt0.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpanding the team!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently I am the only official member of Kandorin Creations.

     "description": "My ultimate goal. I love my little quirky shop but I have long outgrown it. The greatest issues come in the form of not having enough storage space and not being able to regulate the temperature of the room. Many of my materials are stored in other locations as well as my trailer which makes suit building highly inefficient at times. My shop also has poor insulation which means there are entire months in the year where casting is not an option. Meeting this goal would allow me to look for and eventually move to a new location with more space and better accommodations. This would greatly improve the quality and turnaround time of my products.\u00a0",
