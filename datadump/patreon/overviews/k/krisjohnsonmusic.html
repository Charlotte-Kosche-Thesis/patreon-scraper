I\u0027ve been a soloist and arranger for the Count Basie Orchestra for the last 10 years, and I\u0027m the Director of Jazz Studies at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am launching a video series with high quality, interactive music lessons available for FREE to students across the world. This will be achieved through a series of YouTube videos I create that teaches universal concepts of music that are not limited by genre, region, or demographic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAcademic institutions alone are not fully equipped to provide students with the robust demands of today\u0027s music industry. \"Office Hours with Kris Johnson\" will be a place students can turn to in order to gain instruction on music theory, compositional techniques, music technology, arranging, improvisation, music business, and so much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so thankful for the support of my fans and patrons through my 10+ years experience as a professional musician, now I\u0027m excited to provide my supporters with an opportunity to give back to a young music community desperately seeking guidance and knowledge. Thanks in advance for supporting to this important chapter of my life dedicated to being a resource to musicians across the world!"
