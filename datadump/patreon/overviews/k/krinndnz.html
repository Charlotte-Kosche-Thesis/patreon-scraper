\u003cem\u003eyou should totally sign up for my Patreon.\u003c/em\u003e\n      Here\u0027s why:\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore:\u003c/strong\u003e\n        Every Patreon subscription will let me spend more time on writing than I\u0027d be able to otherwise.\n        There will be more of my work, more often.\n        This is the biggest reason my Patreon exists.\n        I want to write more \u2014 and the more support I have on Patreon, the more of my time I can spend writing.\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst:\u003c/strong\u003e\n        Patreon subscribers will see new work first.\n        All of my work will be available for free \u2014 somewhere, eventually, as I get around to it.\n        If you want to see my work right away when it\u0027s done, to have it show up in your inbox instead of going and looking for it, subscribing to my Patreon is the way to have that happen.\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicer:\u003c/strong\u003e\n        Having Patreon subscribers will let me package up my writing in nicer ways.\n        For example, I\u0027ll be able to devote time to producing ebook versions in various formats, to bundling up multi-story compilations, and to procuring visual art to go with them.\n        These versions of my work will not be available for free: Patreon subscription will be the best way to get these.\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBigger:\u003c/strong\u003e\n        More Patreon support will let me take on bigger projects, such as the novella series I\u0027ve been wanting to get to, or another visual novel like \u003cem\u003eMonstergirl Mansion\u003c/em\u003e.\n        I will be able to take on more ambitious projects than I\u0027d been able to in the past \u2014 and Patreon subscribers will see more of these projects, first, and in nicer formats.\n        I\u0027ll be able to take on projects that it would be impossible for me to even attempt without your support.\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003cbr\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Cu1X7ln.png\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Patreon might let me spend a lot more time writing, and I\u0027m excited about that.\n      Text is how I understand the world.\n      Writing is not just a thing I want to do with my time, it\u0027s one of the few things that I am compelled to do with my time.\n      The kind of writing I care most about doing is lewd writing: I like to say I write \"boutique bespoke artisanal erotica,\" a phrase that\u0027s fun but also ridiculous, therefore a great way to describe writing about sex.\n      I have hella opinions about what porn \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e be like and, consequently, what porn I\u0027m going to make \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e be like.\n      You deserve porn that doesn\u0027t hurt to read \u2014 that regardless of subject matter uses words deftly and gracefully, that makes it easier for you to engage with the subject matter instead of making you struggle against murky, inharmonious prose.\n      You deserve porn that, even when it\u0027s about animal people, is about people it\u0027s possible to \u003cem\u003ecare\u003c/em\u003e about.\n      You deserve porn about people \u003cem\u003eenjoying\u003c/em\u003e sex, whatever its form.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cbr\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      I\u0027m looking forward to writing \u2014 and to doing so with your help.\n      Thank you. :)\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n"
