I am creating voice controlled\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gamemusicpacks.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGame Music Packs\u003c/a\u003e for Voice Attack which are game specific music packs composed by me. There is huge potential for these packs and I have big plans relating to game integration, music player enhancements and more. To read more about the capabilities of a Game Music Pack, check out the website. But, if you don\u0027t already know, a Game Music Pack allows you to listen to licensed music which you can legally broadcast on your stream/youtube channel etc. But not only that, you can also ask the music pack to replace instruments in the track you\u0027re listening to, for example, replacing lead instrument, replace vocals, replace or remove percussion. It\u0027s an incredible system! It also features a system that dynamically \u0027composes\u0027 music using my unique Audio Blocks system which intelligently creates new music and textures on the fly so that it\u0027s different every time. A Music Pack will also soon be a part of your music media \u0027hub\u0027 whilst you\u0027re streaming or just gaming alone by integrating your own music collection and internet radio with the pack, you will be able to switch modes at your leisure, all via voice control.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s exciting stuff! Possibly the most incredible feature is still to come ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest.\u003cbr\u003eKathryn LJ\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gamemusicpacks.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGamemusicpacks.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
