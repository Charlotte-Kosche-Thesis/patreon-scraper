Welcome to Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0My name is Kat Jones and I\u0027m a self-taught, freelance artist living in Phuket, Thailand.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce pen, ink, and mixed media art and illustrations. I also love making stuff that I sell either online or at markets and fairs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt has taken me a while to settle into my style. I spent many years exploring different avenues and materials, and as a result my current body of work is relatively small. It is the most honest work I\u0027ve ever produced and I feel it has something to say, in its own little way. I have never been more inspired than I am in this moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo earn an income, I advertise myself as a blackboard/sign painting/mural artist to hospitality venues. But I\u0027m concerned that my own art is being overshadowed by my commissioned work. I need the time and resources to create and share my personal artwork and the things I\u0027ve learned over the years.\u003cbr\u003eI also want to share how I\u0027ve gone about educating myself and encourage people to nurture their creative edge, and practice techniques to help keep their inspiration flowing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron tiers and rewards are in the right column on this page. I will be adding more rewards for all my patrons once I\u0027m able. So watch this space.\u003cbr\u003eI am always humbled by the support I receive. I hope that what I do inspires you in one way or another, and that I can produce some quality stuff for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a great day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
