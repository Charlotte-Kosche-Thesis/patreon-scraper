    "summary": "Hello, potential patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this.\u003cbr\u003eI am Kiki Kalani, or sometimes known as Lapsa, a furry writer of erotic stories, coder of barely functional games, amateur hypnotist, poet, erotic pathfinder author, and sometimes productive even!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried my hardest to work and produce stories for the past few years since I\u0027ve become active in the fandom, but life often comes up to cause stress or demand my attention else where. I am hoping that with this site\u0027s help, I can at least alleviate that a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also currently am working on a game - with several more planned. Hopefully the replayability and updates and fixes to these help keep things fresh enough to convince you to keep supporting me~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, you should only click the become a patron button if you like \u003cem\u003ewhat I have already made\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNOT\u003c/em\u003e in anticipation of future stuff. In my eyes first and foremost this is a donation site, and not a commission or pay to view site. All of my stuff is freely available for now on my FA pocketed conveniently in a folder titled \u0027My Stories\u0027, or on my IB under a similar folder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is a text-based erotic puzzle game called Ancient Danger, created using the inform engine. Its a lot of effort, so I hope that you will consider rewarding some of my effort! \u003cbr\u003e"
