I love teaching art lovers, like you, how to unlock your full potential when it comes to art. I love nothing more than teaching how to utilize everyday household items and make them into beautiful art products.\n \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a lot of people, art can be a very expensive hobby. But, there are numerous ways to lessen the price, and still experience the fun, creativity, and healing powers of art. And, that\u2019s a big part of what I want to help you learn. I also love teaching new techniques that you may not even be aware of! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut first, let me tell you a little more about me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an animal lover and a lover of nature! I\u2019m self-taught and have been making art for years. My ultimate goal is to help inspire art lovers who are suffering from chronic illnesses (such as myself) to learn and create art that they might never have imagined they were capable of making. I want to help you show everyone that you CAN do what you love and what makes you happy, despite the fact that you\u2019re diagnosed with an illness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love doing everything from knitting to polymer clay, mixed media to art journaling, sewing and everything in between! I just love creating! The best part is making something from nothing and showing that even when you are having a bad day, taking just ten minutes and doing something creative can help you escape and maybe even turn your day around!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for visiting my Patreon page and if you would like to become a patron of the arts, then please choose the Reward that makes the most sense to you. You\u2019ll receive some great gifts in return, including access to exclusive content, special projects, and more, and you\u2019ll have my unending appreciation.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
