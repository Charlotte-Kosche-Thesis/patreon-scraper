In my first year, I was able to produce some amazing shows that featured Academy, Tony, Grammy, and Emmy Award nominees and winners, from the many professions among the world of performance.  In order to move to the next level, I need a little help.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to continue bringing you the podcast for free, because I love having the platform and time to really talk with all of these great artists and present them to you.  Now,  I want to start creating something bigger and even more fabulous: a monthly live show presenting some of Broadway\u0027s Fiercest and Finest, and introducing you to some even more fantastic new faces, as well.  With just a small or maybe an extremely large bit of support from the folks like you that love what I do, and perhaps many of your friends, I will be able to continue the podcast AND create even more access to a dream for all of us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider being a Friend of Keith Price\u0027s Curtain Call Podcast, for a mere $1/month.  I would even dare you to become a Good Friend of Keith Price\u0027s Curtain Call for $2 or more/month. In any case, I certainly will appreciate any help that you feel comfortable giving to help me reach this goal, and I continue to appreciate your generosity of time listening to, participating and commenting on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincere Thanks for All of your Support,\u003cbr\u003eKeith Price\u003cbr\u003ehttp://www.keithpricecurtaincall.com"
