If you\u0027re here you\u0027re probably wondering why I\u0027ve just now jumped onto the crowdfunding ship (or you\u0027re here by mistake, in which case stick around for a minute and let me see if I can convince you this is worth your time).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been running\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kritiqal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKritiqal\u003c/a\u003e for the last few years as a pet project, and while the experience has been fantastic (aside from all the times I caused the site to implode), I continue to find myself frustrated that I cannot devote as much time as I would like to growing the site into more than just \"my corner of the internet.\" And so, I am turning to you, wonderful friends of the internet, to help me make Kritiqal a thriving bedrock of pop-culture criticism and, on certain occasion, home to a joke or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, what\u0027s Kritiqal anyway?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn case you are new, Kritiqal is a project I first created as a platform for my various videogames writing. Originally, this was mostly in the form of reviews (like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kritiqal.com/2016/12/17/geometry-wars-3-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis piece on how Geometry Wars 3 is perhaps too much of a good thing\u003c/a\u003e), but lately I\u0027ve been branching out into other forms of writing as well as expanding the depth and scope of my reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kritiqal.com/2016/12/21/i-had-a-crush-on-sly-cooper/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy childhood infatuation with Sly Cooper\u003c/a\u003e, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kritiqal.com/2016/09/11/tahira-echoes-of-the-astral-empire-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehistorical and political significance of Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kritiqal.com/2015/04/08/im-not-a-gamer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emoving away from the term \"gamer.\"\u003c/a\u003e I think videogames are one of, if not the most interesting artform of the modern era, and have yet to run out of things to say about them. Take a look around at my past work, and if you like what I\u0027m doing, consider pledging a dollar or two so I can continue throwing myself into so many Word documents as I neglect building a social life and getting out in the sun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you specifically hoping to accomplish with Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy move to crowdfunding was primarily for the sake of being able to afford to a) keep self-hosting Kritiqal (web-hosting isn\u0027t terribly expensive, but it isn\u0027t free), and b) put more time and energy into my writing. As of now I am keeping my goals reasonable by aiming for one long (1k+ word) article/review a month, as well as potentially one or two smaller (\u0026lt;500 words) pieces here and there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my funding grows so will these goals, and if I can gain enough of a following I would especially like to use some of the money I make off Patreon to commission other talented writers to share their voices on Kritiqal (I\u0027m sure you\u0027d appreciate getting to read someone other than me, too).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am incredibly excited about what the future holds for Kritiqal, and think I\u0027ve never been in a better place with my writing and the things I\u0027m writing about. I hope you\u0027ll join me as I move into a bold new period in my writing career. Things are only going to get better from here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
