Videos of drawings start to finish. Experiments. Closeups. Both animated and still art, finished or  in-progress.And it allows me to try and fund the projects I am constantly working towards publishing. Any dollar gets me closer to achieving something I can tangibly share with others. Patreon was perfect, because not only does it help me towards creating an object you can actually own, but also it lets you see the process and work that\u00a0I put into it all! And you can decide for yourself it is worth it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Hope to Accomplish\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eAs of right now I am working on two separate coloring books, a line of unique and quirky greeting cards.And\u00a0a research and field guide book of \"theoretical\" monsters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first coloring book is an accumulation of the dragons I draw. The strength, beauty and power a dragon represents in different cultures has been an inspiration for me since I was little. There simply can never be too many dragons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second coloring book is called The Lost Girls. This is for those wild, adventurous girls at heart. Those who would have liked to be included in the tribe of lost boys in the story of Peter Pan, but were forgotten. It is a journey through dark and often scary, dark forests, mountains and cliffs. Because little girls are as fierce as any boy. And I always hated feeling left out of an adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third project is an ongoing collection of greeting cards you won\u0027t find in any store. Like dragon soup to make you feel better, or other \"quirky\" visuals. I wanted a new range of cards that make people smile, or even laugh at the absurdity. From sweet, to awkward. Something unique for every different person. The stranger the better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe theoretical monster field guide will be for those who like to imagine the dark and strange creatures that could possibly exist, and what they may be like. The final product would also leave blank pages waiting to be filled with each person\u0027s own interpretations, thoughts and fascinations into monster life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThese four are my core projects, but there will always be other random illustrations and work posted as well.
