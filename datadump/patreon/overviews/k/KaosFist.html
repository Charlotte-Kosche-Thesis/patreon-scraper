    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003ePURPOSE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reasoning behind this Patreon\u0027s existence is to afford a recurring artist to make this series grow. We at Dark Krow Image, founded by yours truly (The Lopez Brothers), do not have the time nor the speed to construct a comic book ourselves due to busy scheduling as well as minuscule spare time for production on our part. With your help, we can attain this series\u0027 ability to grow by funding an extraordinarily talented artist who has the power to work quickly on a free schedule. As exchange for the art, concepts, and pin-ups we provide for you, all we ask is for you to become a Patron for as low as $5!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLOT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story starts out with a married couple, Kenji and Akiko, raising their twin 3 year old sons Kin and Kayatu. Kenji wants to start a new fresh life with his family by leaving his father Royshio\u0027s army. While he was away for a discussion with his father on this matter, Kenji\u0027s evil older brother Raiju attacked Akiko her sons, kidnapping Kayatu in the process. Akiko met up with Kenji to tell the devastating news, and Kenji found Raiju holding his son Kayatu over a cliff in the mountains. Kenji pleaded with Raiju to spare Kayatu\u0027s life in vain; Raiju tossed Kayatu down, supposedly killing him. A battled ensues between the two, with Kenji emerging victorious but brutally beaten and weary. Akiko shows up and tries to talk Kenji into staying alive. Suddenly, he hears his son Kayatu\u0027s voice and he is revealed to be alive. Royshio somehow rescued Kayatu from the fall. Later, Royshio and Kenji seals the unconscious Raiju into a cave, preventing further danger. Several nights later, as Kenji and Akiko are tucking in their twin sons to bed, Kenji vows to forever give up on fighting to focus on his family a legacy. Akiko and Kenji leaves the room and shuts off the lights, but in the darkness we see the other son Kin standing in his crib with his eyes glowing menacingly red. That\u0027s a summary of the first two issues.  An important key to take note of is that the sons are not identical twins. Kayatu has blonde hair and blue eyes, traits that strangely none of the parents have. Kin has black hair and red eyes. Although his mother Akiko carries the trait of black hair, no one else in the family has red eyes. Akiko is cautious of her son Kin, and favors Kayatu more because of his pure looks. Unbeknownst to everyone, Kin\u0027s true form is that of an evil demon. Kayatu is haunted by an evil ghost that intends on taking control of him. \u003cbr\u003eIssue three will follow a princess goddess named Rose, who recently sensed a newborn being that has the power to destroy earth. She is sent to earth to find the source of this evil, but she is forbidden from physical interference with mankind\u0027s destiny. If she goes against this, she will be sent to hell with her sister Iris, who was punished for violating this code long before. Rose can only act as a guidance and warner to earthlings. I intend to make readers believe this evil source she senses is Kin, but in actuality it is a new major villain located at sea, who will pretty much be the \"big bad\" in this chapter of the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCHARACTER DESIGNS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/329/648/5d077ebd41908fd8fbdaf9e6cb877b94_original.jpg?w=456\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1498860218\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=503f6f0d1d178adc44d1b9d11c1b0563\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRose, the Princess Goddess sent to earth to discover the mystery behind the negative energy.
