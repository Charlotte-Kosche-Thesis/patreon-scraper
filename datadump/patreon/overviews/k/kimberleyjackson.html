    "summary": "Kimberley Jackson is a 33-year-old author and artist who publishes works of fiction and art online. Most of her stories can be found\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kimberley-jackson.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon her website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories are something special, something that should be available to everybody. Ever since I can remember, I\u0027ve told stories. To my little sister, to my classmates and friends--or even just to myself. They\u0027ve become such an essential part of my life that I can\u0027t imagine living without storytelling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBooks have always been a source of wonder and mystery to me, ever since I can remember.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since the rise of the internet, telling stories has become even easier. I truly believe in the internet as the medium of the future, even for books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to tell stories that will move people, bring them solace, or just take them out of their lives into another world for just a short time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReading stories shouldn\u0027t depend on country, or wealth, or social class. I\u0027m not writing for money, I\u0027m writing for the love of the story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I don\u0027t live in a culture where storytelling in itself is considered a skill of high value. Even I have to pay rent, and buy food and clothes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m asking YOU today: Please become my patron. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my stories, or my art, consider sponsoring me. Your donations will help finance my existence as an author and artist, help cover hosting and other cost, and basic living expenses, which will allow me to devote more time for writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: With this offer you don\u0027t pay for any particular stories or art (esp. not for fanfiction or fanarts). Stories and artworks will remain free for anybody to enjoy, and are not dependent on whether you pay money. (This excludes works that\u0027ll be officially sold as ebooks or similar on amazon and other platforms.) \u003cbr\u003e"
