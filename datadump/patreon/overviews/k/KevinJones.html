    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eKevin Jones\u003c/strong\u003e, welcome to my Patreon page! Music has been my passion from a very young age, which is why I finally started my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.YouTube.com/KevinJones\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emusic channel\u003c/a\u003e in early 2015. This is your chance to help me shape my future as a musician and performer! Making professional level music and music videos is a costly task. Right now, I produce all my music by myself, and my sister\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/legitchristine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChristine\u003c/a\u003e shoots the music videos. But imagine how much better they would be if we could hire people to help us! I want to perform and make music for a living, but I don\u0027t want to have to sign with a label or an agency to make it happen. \u003cstrong\u003eYour support \u003c/strong\u003ewill be the difference in making that dream come true.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut even if you\u0027re unable to support me financially, please know that your support as a fan still means \n\u003cstrong\u003eso much\u003c/strong\u003e to me. My videos will still always be online for free, and I couldn\u0027t have gotten this far without you watching them. Each one of you is special to me \u003cstrong\u003eno matter what\u003c/strong\u003e. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, a little info about how Patreon works. If you sign up to support me, you will be charged ($1, $2, or whatever you choose) for each music video that I release on my channel (not including vlogs), and in exchange you\u0027ll get \n\u003cstrong\u003ecool rewards\u003c/strong\u003e, which are listed on the right side of this page. :) I\u0027ll be making 1-2 music videos per month, never more than 2. You can set a limit on how much you spend per month on Patreon, and you can cancel anytime. Yay! It\u0027s that simple. If you need any more info, you can visit Patreon\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as soon as you sign up to be a patron, you\u0027ll get access to all the past rewards as well, which are previewed below.
