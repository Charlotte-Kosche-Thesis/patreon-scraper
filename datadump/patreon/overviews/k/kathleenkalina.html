    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy History and Esoteric Philosophy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBy Kathleen Kalina\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the 1970\u2019s and 80s I lived in Massachusetts and New\nHampshire working fulltime in the 80s as a medical clairvoyant.I did lectures and classes all over the\nUnited States, but mostly in New England. I became a mini celebrity because I\nwas in the newspaper and on radio so often.I was the first to call myself a \u201cmedical clairvoyant\u201d and many people came\nlater also called themselves medical clairvoyants. I even participated in police investigations\nfinding a lost man and solving a serial arson case in a case.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis was how I did readings: Health Readings and Life\nPurpose Readings.The health readings\nwere accomplished by reading layers in the body and discovering the cause of\nimbalances.The Life Purpose readings\nrequired reading the akashic records of a persons series of lifetimes as they\nconnected to the present lifetime.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Life Purpose readings were very popular and I had at\nleast one or two clients per day. However,each reading took two hours or more and took an enormous amount of\nfocus, so I couldn\u2019t do anymore than two a day.The Health readings were generally one or more hours.After doing that for 10 years every day, I\nbecame exhausted and wondered about using my other skills as an Environmental\nScientist, so I went to graduate school in Wisconsin.I spent the 1990s heavily involved in helping\nvarious Indian tribes.The mysticism of\nAmerican Indians became close to my heart as I was welcomed into many\ncommunities. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the 2000s, I went to bible college and learned the\nscriptures which tied into to my former understanding of a seer. I got a\nministerial degree and license.I was\ncalled a prophet by my church and those around me because of what I could see,\nhear and understand as it pertained to scripture. Six books of channeled\nmaterial came to me while a friend wrote it down.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis all seemed to be a giant circle of life and\nunderstanding of why we are here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are still questions about life.But there are certain conclusions that I know\nfor sure as proof was given to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are given a destiny and fated events.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are given a certain date of our death and\nthis can only be changed in the same way Hezikiah asked for 15 more years of\nlife.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCharity of love and caring for others is\nstipulated in scripture as a key ingredient to obtaining the best possible seat\nin heaven.There are many heavens and\neach person creates their heaven or hell. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are many mystical beings who can appear in\nour dimension or live in many dimensions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have spiritual helpers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe live many life times in an attempt to correct\nand use certain talents, be with people we are close to and solve problems. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJesus who is a manifestation of God, attempted\nto explain to us to the rules of good living.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSome people are born mystics and carry the\nburden of the gifts given to them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSome people are born to help the world evolve\ninto a better place by challenging injustice.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSome people are born to invent and create\ntechnology that makes our lives better and opens up leisure time for reflection\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSome people are born to destroy, (that was their\nchoice.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDomesticated animals, especially pets are given\nto us for ease of our difficulties and help us love.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWild animals are given to us for food and for\nbeauty and balance the ecosystem.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur wild and scenic lands are there for everyone\nto enjoy and must be protected from those who endanger it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe day of death is fixed, but many people get\nclose calls in order to see what lies ahead. There are three days after death\nwhere we can go back to loved ones and visit.We can chose at that time to close our connection to earth or decide to\nbe made available when needed. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt death we explore much about our lives on\nearth. For some people this may take a long time, but others who are more self\naware are able to move on to a place they chose in heaven.Some people choose houses on beautiful lakes,\nwhile others walk a vistas and others play with angels.God is close to all who have lived good\nlives, no matter what format they have chosen. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThen there is hell and many layers for the truly\nevil.Jesus said the worst sin is to\nhurt a child.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are places down in hell that one\ncannot be released.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nbig questions\u003c/strong\u003e: Wealth, Poverty, Sickness and Health.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe beginning of life starts in the\npreplanning stage before conception.A\nsoul chooses a set of genetics and a family group. Perhaps they choose even\njust one person in a family.They are\nstuck with the genetics of that family\u2019s gene pool.Evolution of Technology makes geneticweaknesses more probable to repair.Nevertheless, chronic disease or weakness is\nthere.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConsequently, physical strength and\nathletic ability may be important, but not so much the family. This may give\nthe person strength, but family problems.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChoosing a wealthy family may be an\nadvantage for someone with a difficult destiny. Whereas, someone may chose a\nfamily that is poor, but was interested in the physical strength.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePoverty in later years can be just a matter\nof circumstances and the country they live in.A failing market may wipe out a retirement, maybe the people were not\npaying attention or maybe there is a fated event in it.Most fated events are dramatic.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeople always ask \u201cwhy a sickly child who\ndies early.\u201d This was a chosen path for them, they only wanted to be in a\nfamily for a short time and get the loving attention.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA person who spends their entire life\nfocused on making money and nothing else has missed the point about why they\nare here.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChronic poverty may be an opportunity for a\nperson to move geographically and meet karmic friends elsewhere.Constant unearned wealth and good health may\nnot be the advantage it looks like, perhaps the person seeks something they\ncannot get like a relationship or self awareness.There is always something in every life that\nis sought after and challenging.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe question is very complicated.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
