Set during the Civil War, it highlighted the hurt and healing of a family attempting to weigh the pressures of societal expectation with the love of a couple\u0027s interracial marriage. The film received wide viewership throughout festival screenings and won numerous awards including \"Best Louisiana Short Film\" and \"Best Villain\". It was featured in Louisiana Film \u0026amp; Entertainment Magazine and was hand selected by John Schneider Studios to be distributed through his Cineflix Film Festival via both theater and Video On Demand platforms. The budget of the film was around $20,000. This film could not have been made without the generous support of contributors who believed in our project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ddl68nlzy8exlun/kay4.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 234px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/0r2eod7ibc6ok2i/kay13.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 227px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/oorsl646i5tzs9r/kay12.jpg?raw=1\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/pirglinxs2309f7/kayl.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 233px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8yayldt6j39umi9/kay5.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 224px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing the success of \"Madeline\u0027s Oil\", the same filmmakers came back to make \"With My Soul\", a Civil War story of heartache and hope for two diverse sets of women who needed to cross each other\u0027s paths. In this story, a group of girls who are growing in their faith of freedom, despite being captured by human traffickers, turn out to be just what a group of grieving nuns who are losing hope while nursing wounded soldiers, need. The film was screened at numerous film festivals and also won several awards. It was also featured in Louisiana Film \u0026amp; Entertainment Magazine. The budget for the film was slightly less than that for \"Madeline\u0027s Oil\" and was contributed mostly by the filmmakers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2omqj04un0txl4/soul1.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 204px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bg52dlmixluclcd/soul4.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 232px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1822zyvqb30eww7/soul7.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 530px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/okkya24jnbq2iar/soul9.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 242px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3kk95tk0kxkhsbu/soul10.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 242px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the makers of \"Madeline\u0027s Oil\" and \"With My Soul\" came our third short film together, \"Seed of the Free\", a little known story about the life of Sojourner Truth. While most people know of her remarkable work as a minister of faith and an advocate for women\u0027s suffrage and racial equality, we wanted to share the story that most people don\u0027t know. Before her ministry and advocacy began, Sojourner Truth, previously named Isabella Van Wagenen, was also one of the first African Americans and one of the first women to win a court case against a plantation owner. She learned to fight the system when the system gave her a fight that really mattered - the fight to win her child back and secure his eventual emancipation. This film was entered into the 2017 Louisiana Film Prize Competition and was screened as one of the top 20 contestants. It will film this year at the Louisiana International Film Festival for the first time. This film garnered around a $10,000 budget and was funded by a crowdfunding platform along with contributions by the filmmakers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/41g00xt4qzff1sf/truth1.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 180px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3pti339552fdhp2/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-27%20at%2010.55.01%20AM.png?raw=1\" style=\"width: 287px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/if7asodiaw6jbzg/seed.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 229px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/6vv7lhk59o6wyk5/seed2.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 234px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/76zn2x75nio29n0/seed4.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 318px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn recent news, \"Personal Justice\", a psych thriller novel based on a screenplay I co-wrote, has just been released on Amazon. \"What can you do when your whole world is ripped from your hands by the slam of the gavel? Dan Schroeder goes to extreme measures to achieve personal justice! Frustrated with a legal system that is stacked against him, Dan becomes prosecutor, judge, and jury in a courtroom all his own. He is about to pass a deadly sentence onto the attorney who ransacked his life. The clock ticks away on Amelia Melchor\u0027s life in Personal Justice with plot twists and turns until the bitter end.\" The feature-length film of Personal Justice is in pre-production with an estimated budget of $100,000, which is currently in effort of being raised. Current contributions to this Patreon account could be used towards the filming of this film, after the funding of the web series listed below. Additionally, I have written two other feature screenplays for production with this film group, for which funds have not been raised. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/tmfdh9sipdyv6ox/PJ.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 232px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/tkxrq5pu91z3l7j/pj2.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 249px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the makers of Personal Justice and other great filmmakers, I\u0027m in pre-production on #MenTooTheSeries, a dramatized, but educational TV series to promote awareness and resources for men coping with the aftermath of sexual abuse. The screenplay includes writing by a co-writer and myself who have both worked therapeutically as facilitators of abuse survivor support groups. The budget of the series is $20,000 and the film is scheduled to be distributed on Video on Demand and other platforms. As a first measure, $1500 is needed for initial securing of locations, film insurance, and crew. I also have a feature-length screenplay written as a psychological thriller (think what \"A Beautiful Mind\" was to Schizophrenia) to raise awareness of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in survivors of sexual abuse. The budget for the feature-length film will be $50,000. Following these projects, the same film group would like to continue making low-budget ($50,000) feature films. A second feature-length screenplay for this film group is in progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 200px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#MenTooTheSeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqm9s46p1o1v6pg/rainn2.jpeg?raw=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/2byxtlzcq76c3ft/rain1.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 385px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimilarly, I had the opportunity to write a short film for a friend with Aspberger\u0027s/Autism to help raise awareness of the challenges of living with these barriers to communication. \"Understood?\" was created with a 48-Hour team as a short film and has received mention in several publications. The Louisiana Film \u0026amp; Entertainment Magazine featured our film in April, in honor of Autism Awareness Month.

He has been featured as a guest on HBO\u0027s American Gangster: Monster Kody Episode and hopes to create a documentary that will highlight the personal hurts of his journey, the forgiveness, and the healing. The budget for the documentary will be $50,000 or less. I have also written a feature-length dramatized screenplay of his novel, which would require a budget in excess of $10,000,000. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlluyqg2bzlfj9k/gman2.jpg?raw=1\" style=\"width: 461px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMoving into more costly projects further in the future, I\u0027ve written numerous screenplays that would each cost an excess of $1,000,000 for production. In addition to expanding the above mentioned story beyond a documentary and into a dramatized feature film, I would also like to film the true biography of a child with Autism who learns to channel her uniqueness into strengths. She grows up to become a leading lobbyist and advocate for industry in her state and becomes a frequent and familiar guest at state officials\u0027 private parties and at legislative sessions at the State Capitol.

Although some parts of the films are fictionalized, the events surrounding the characters are based on interviews that my co-writer and I have had with Syrians who have lived through the war. I have written both a lower budget screenplay and a higher budget screenplay about these stories, ranging from less than $250,000 to $10,000,000 for production. These stories challenge the narratives told about Syria in the mainstream media, and we believe the telling of these stories is a critical part of giving voice to the Syrian citizens that the U.S. media has forgotten. Our urgency in telling these stories is with the hope that the spread of truth could help save lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-dft4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11295551_440377926140482_7221585821089113064_n.jpg?oh=f89b306309d4faa3b849cca43fc6135d\u0026amp;oe=5B234527\" style=\"width: 440px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAdditional film projects will include fantasy, science fiction, psychological thriller, and drama - maybe even some comedy, as I was asked this year by one of my producers to write my first one.
