    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Kate Tectonics?\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe make cinematic educational videos about geology and other geosciences in the beautiful mountain trails of Montana. Making environmental science cool, interesting, and accessible for everyone is our goal, while maybe getting you to go outside and gain a little more appreciation for the outdoors and the resources the Earth has to offer, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nProduced by Synema Studios and directed by Michael Aranda who\u2019s worked on SciShow, Crash Course, and The Brain Scoop. Hosted by Katelyn Salem, who is the proud owner of a degree in geosciences from The University of Montana. Combining an amazing director and cinematographer, a charming host, some interesting knowledge about the Earth, and the breathtaking landscapes of Montana, we\u2019ve got the makings for something you don\u2019t want to miss!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur first episode will be released on October 23rd!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat does my support do?\u003c/h3\u003e\nYour support helps make sure we can continue to produce beautiful educational videos about the Earth. You\u2019ll help our entire crew to continue spending time and putting amazing work into the series, because without them it would never be able to come to light. Aside from making sure the editor can continue to edit and the writer can continue to write, your support will also allow us to travel to more breathtaking locations and invest in cool equipment for more interesting ways to look at rocks and the Earth. There are dozens of places just in Montana that we\u2019d love to show you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow can I support?\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe have several digital rewards at different tiers that you can choose from with your monthly subscription. If you\u2019re really passionate about our content and want to see us be able to travel to more locations and cover more cool topics, the higher subscription tiers get you special perks plus all of the perks from the tiers below them for being so awesome. If you only want to subscribe to a smaller tier, you can still get some awesome rewards for doing so; $1 makes all difference. Even if you can\u2019t support financially, just viewing and sharing our content can be amazingly powerful. We thank you for just visiting our Patreon page and thank you so much for any further support you can give!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow pledging works:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tPledging is from month to month and you can cancel or change your pledge at any time. Patreon will charge you on the 1st of every month. So, if you start your pledge on the 23rd of the month, you won\u0027t actually be charged until the 1st of the next month. For this reason, we will send out most tier rewards towards the end of the month in case there are any problems with payments to give people time to fix them.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tSay, you want to pledge $23 a month. You then have the option to choose any single tier with the perk that you want that is up to $23. Since the highest tier up to $23 is the $15 \"Geology Club Treasurer\", you can pick that tier or any of the ones below it. Most tiers include all of the rewards from the tiers below it, but if for some reason you want to choose the $10 instead of the $15 tier, you can do that! Or if you don\u0027t want any reward, you can do that too!\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tSome tiers are limited to a certain amount of Patrons, like the $25 Signed Script tier, that way we aren\u0027t overrun with scripts to print out and mail. We will try to raise adjust the limits to what we think we can handle, but if the limit is full you can still choose to pledge $25 or above, you\u0027ll just need to pick a different tier.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tMost tiers include all of the perks from the tiers below it EXCEPT for a few. They include: The $50 \"Geology Club Vice President\" tier and the $100 \"Geology Club President\" tier. These tiers do not include a special thanks in the video description since you get the better perk of a verbal thanks in the video already! And the $100 tier also doesn\u0027t include you being called a \"Vice President\" as a thanks in the video since you\u0027re a \"President\"!\n\u003c/div\u003e"
