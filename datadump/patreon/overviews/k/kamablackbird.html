    "summary": "Hello, this is KamaBlackbird. I\u0027m Just a self-taught artist who likes to draw monster girls and personifications in particular, as well as myths/legends-themed art. This Patreon is a small avenue for my art themed around that, both for my personal projects and outside of them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you usually draw?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I said, monster girls, personifications (I like Pok\u00e9mon, just to make an example), and subjects related to legends and myths. Sometimes I do a little fanart on the side, if it\u0027s related to that. I especially have a fondness of youkai and Japanese folklore, as they\u0027re the focus of a personal project I\u0027m entertaining.\n\u003cbr\u003eMy current focus is exploring various kinds of classic monster girls, but in a very different way from the likes of \u003cem\u003eDaily Life with Monstergirls\u003c/em\u003e and MGE. For one, I like to design harpies/mermaids/centaurs based on real birds/fish/horse breeds, and write about their species\u0027 characteristics, customs and society. You can see some of my writing on my \u003ca href=\"https://toyhou.se/Kurobina_Yuki\"\u003eToyhouse\u003c/a\u003e account (don\u0027t worry, you don\u0027t need one of your own to browse).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI used to draw NSFW art for this Patreon, but in the end I could never draw enough to provide content on a monthly basis, so I moved that purpose to \n\u003ca href=\"http://choujuu-jinbutsu-jiiga.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy NSFW Tumblr blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI normally take commissions, but that isn\u0027t always enough to get by. \nThat said, I\u0027m not asking for much, as long as I manage to break even in\n months when I get little to no commissions.\u003cbr\u003eAll my finished works \nare available for free on DA and Tumblr, this Patreon is mainly for who \nwants to see work-in-progress stuff and support me financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/111195045696114688/408598982818922507/BigCityFeathersPromo-DA-2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAmong other things, in the near future I\u0027ll start working on my comic, \u003cstrong\u003eBig City Feathers\u003c/strong\u003e. It will be a slice-of-life with a good-natured comedy bent set in a floating metropolis inhabited by harpies of all kinds, told from the viewpoint of Victoria, a domestic pigeon harpy who just moved in. I\u0027m still working on the various designs, but I\u0027ll start putting out pages as soon as I possibly can and if you want to support me to that end I\u0027ll definitely appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan non-patrons see your work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, you can see more of my stuff on \n\u003ca href=\"http://purplekama.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Deviantart page\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://kama-blackbird.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emain Tumblr blog\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m still figuring out what kind of perks to offer to patrons, but I\u0027ll think of something for sure.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can also get in touch with me on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/KurobinaYuki\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n---\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo to recap, if you like my art and have a couple dollars to spare, go ahead and become my patron. Even a tiny amount is enough, I\u0027m grateful for any support I get.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
