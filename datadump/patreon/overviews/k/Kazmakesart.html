I\u0027ve been on social media since I was 12, and taking selfies since I was 13. And here I am, on this website, \u003cstrong\u003epromoting paintings of pictures of my face. \u003c/strong\u003eIm exploring post-Internet art, and I cannot let the selfie phenomenon go. It is too important.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo even though the \"selfie\" is the butt of nearly every Internet joke, why are we so committed to taking them? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSelfies are a powerful thing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSelfies are empowering and therapeutic.  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIndividuals can be photographed exactly the way they\u0027d prefer. Having the camera\u0027s power in their own hands allows them to present themselves to the world at their best angle, their best \"selves.\"\u003cbr\u003e\nWomen photographing themselves for their own pleasure is considered vanity, but it\u0027s \u003cem\u003enormal,\u003c/em\u003e it\u0027s \u003cem\u003eart\u003c/em\u003e for women to be viewed as objects for men\u0027s pleasure. \u003cbr\u003e\nSelfies have meaning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere is power in self-love and self-acceptance, even one selfie at a time\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\nThe selfie itself is a long-standing fine art form. Selfies are self-portraits - a practice that even the old masters used. The art of the selfie is nearly as old as art itself - and yet it\u0027s mocked. There has never been a time when cameras were as accessible as they are now, and there has never been a time when more self portraits were being created than now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nYour selfie is important. Your favorite angle of yourself is important. Self-love is important. \u003cbr\u003e\nSo yes, I\u0027m here exploring myself through my selfies, but I don\u0027t want it to stop there. I want to see others through their selfies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eLet me immortalize your selfie, your self-love, into fine art. Or not. It\u0027s up to you\u003c/strong\u003e. \u2728\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also exploring other mediums! I\u0027m also working on Selfie Sculptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w420/Kazisaninja/UM_KAZ_ZUMBRO_1_S_MIRROR_5_60_36_zpsxi440jyg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w420/Kazisaninja/UM_KAZ_ZUMBRO_4_S_Untitled_4_23_15_zpsstav7epr.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;/center\u0026gt;"
