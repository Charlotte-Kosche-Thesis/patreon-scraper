For those of you who may not know, Patreon is\nlike a crowd funding site for artists and creative geniuses to gain support for\nthe awesome work they do.Making art\ninto a career isn\u2019t easy, and through my struggles I want to let you guys know\nthat yes, it is possible and it is worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is why I\u2019ve created my Patreon, and if you pledge your\nsupport to me as a patron, you\u2019ll get exclusive access to great rewards such as\nhigh resolution files of my work, video tutorials, and even have the chance to\nparticipate in fan art contests.Doesn\u2019t\nthat sound amazing?!Even if your pledge\nis only a few dollars a month, I will be super appreciative.But of course, anything more than that would\nbe so helpful in allowing me to pay my food bills and continue following my\npassion.Hopefully I can also provide you\nwith some useful knowledge that\u2019ll expand your artistic horizons as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou are what keeps me pushing forward to reaching new levels\nin my art, and I hope you\u2019ll join me on this journey.Thanks so much guys, and remember, when the\ngoing gets tough, \u201cKeep Persevering.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e"
