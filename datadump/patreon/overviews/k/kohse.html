    "summary": "HI, My name is Lee Kohse. \u00a0I am a freelance artist in the entertainment industry. I have created artwork for Voltron, Lord of the Rings, Shrek, Indiana Jones, Dr. Who, multiple Marvel films and spent several years as creative director of Speed Racer. My biggest client for the last several years has been Lucasfilm and creating art for various Star Wars projects. \u00a0I\u0027ve also been a guest artist at several Star Wars Celebrations, as well as doing live art demos at events like D23 Expo and Comic-Con.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.kohse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/swp1-e1445229350186.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI love drawing and the ability to support my family through my art is a blessing. \u00a0However, I also love doing private commissions and working on my own personal projects. \u00a0The irony is, as I become more successful in the entertainment industry, the the less time I have to work on personal projects and private commissions. \u00a0Enter Patreon. \u00a0In an effort to stabilize my workload, I\u0027m using Patreon to manage my commissions and give something back to those who support me. \u00a0This will free me up to do more personal projects (like my webcomic,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kindergoth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.kindergoth.com\u003c/a\u003e) and do more commissions for you. So whether you have been waiting to get a personalized painting or just a fan of art, please consider being one of my patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is different than most so read carefully. \u00a0There are two tiers: \u003cstrong\u003eArt Commissions\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0($25 and up) is a way for Patrons to contribute money once a month that is applied toward a larger commission than they may usually be able to afford. \u00a0Think of it as Art Layaway. For example, if you contribute $25 a month for 12 months, you can cash out for a $300 commission. \u00a0Or let it ride longer for an even bigger commission.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eArt Supporters\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0$1-10 a month\u00a0you love art or watch my Twitch Stream (www.twitch.tv/kohseart) and you want to contribute in some way. \u00a0Patrons at both tiers get first crack when I do open up for commissions and get access to Twitch and Patreon Exclusive stuff. \u00a0Patrons that are also subscribers to my Twitch Channel will get additional perks as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt Supporter Tiers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt Supports are contributions anywhere from $1 to $10 a month.  Each of those tiers has their own benefits, but more importantly, if you are wanting a commission or original art, anyone that contributes as a patron will have dibs. \u00a0As commission slots open, I will announce them to my patrons first. \u00a0I will also make the original art I create for other projects, available to my patrons first. \u00a0As I get more patrons, I will also start releasing exclusive content and swag to my patrons. \u00a0See Milestone Goals for more information on Patron Exclusive Swag. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt\u00a0Commission Tiers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe commissions work like a layaway plan. \u00a0Pick the commission level you want. \u00a0Then pay a little each month, let me know what you want painted, and after you accumulate enough funds, you order your original art and I create it for you. \u00a0You also get to watch me create it live on Twitch. \u00a0You\u0027ll notice, there are not a lot of slots open. \u00a0Don\u0027t fret! \u00a0As time allows, I will announce new commission slots to my patrons first. \u00a0This means, even if you are not on a current commission tier, you still get dibs when new commissions are available. \u00a0This includes events like San Diego Comic Con or NY Comic Con.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Lee Kohse was born to a family of rutabaga beta testers in Crescent City, California and as a child learned to draw in the dirt when he wasn\u0027t busy mining dust for spaghetti western films. While serving in the Marine Corps, he started doing art for underground comics and indie rock magazines. Most notably he created the cult comic Kindergoth, and later its Webcomic incarnation,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kindergoth.com\"\u003ewww.kindergoth.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, on an archeological dig in a broom closet, he discovered some oil paints and a dead rat he fashioned into a brush. After an intense montage showing Lee teaching himself to paint, featuring a solid punk rock soundtrack, Lee became a freelance artist working for such clients as Verizon, MSN, Lucasfilm, Dreamworks, Topps, Marvel, and 20th Century Fox. From 2010-2012 Lee was creative director of Speed Racer.. His first project for Lucasfilm was providing licensing art for Indiana Jones in 2006. In 2007 he provided licensing art for the Clone Wars theatrical release and has been contributing Star Wars art regularly ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s Lee\u0027s goal that with a strong Patreon following, he can return to his first love of doing comics and updating\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kindergoth.com\"\u003ewww.kindergoth.com\u003c/a\u003e",
