    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Kastel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written reviews and researched articles about niche media, subcultures, and anything fun. I always have three articles published per month. You can read, for example,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tanoshimi.xyz/2016/11/29/yes-sadpanda-is-one-of-my-sources/\"\u003eJames Tiptree Jr.\u0027s influence on Japanese science fiction\u003c/a\u003e on Tanoshimi.xyz. If you are into video game criticism with a personal twist, I have written a post on ZEAL\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal/atelier-beyond-practical-and-theoretical-lives-e171576d6766\"\u003ehow \u003cem\u003eAtelier\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0has helped contextualize my trilingualism across the years\u003c/a\u003e. And I have written articles that dive deep into the philosophical roots of certain media that may be deemed esoteric like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tanoshimi.xyz/2017/03/21/violet-evergarden-spoilers/\"\u003eYokoo Tarou\u0027s Eternal Recurrence: Transhumanism in \u003cem\u003eNieR Automata\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. If I\u0027m not writing about Japanese media, I will be looking into media and subcultures that people may have not heard about.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mimidoshima.wordpress.com/2017/06/22/i-hate-instant-noodles-except-shin-ramyun-they-are-p-good/\"\u003eEating Ramen Around the World: Immigrant Food as Fads and Culture\u003c/a\u003e is one example that shows my more transcultural posts. I also write about cool literature you may have never heard of like\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mimidoshima.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/alamak/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Art of Charlie Chan\u003c/em\u003e: A Small Heartbeat of Singapore\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be more articles of these kinds queued up throughout the year, but after looking at my credit card bills, I feel I may have incurred too many high research costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe need for better research\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo matter how much preparation work you have done, you will inevitably need to do some googling and time. Sometimes, these sources can be damn good. I have used Sakugabooru to talk about a certain aspect found in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mimidoshima.wordpress.com/2017/05/24/its-not-everyday-i-get-to-link-vanilla-ice-videos-on-a-post-on-koe-no-katachi/\"\u003eKoe no Katachi\u003c/a\u003e. But not all sources are created equal and some of the best ones are behind a paywall. I am writing for free most of the time and if I do get paid, it will be for a one-time payment that ranges from $50USD to $100USD. Good research always goes beyond that price.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t believe research has a monetary value; it is priceless. Sharing good research destroys ignorance and apathy. Misconceptions can be disproven easily with a hyperlink to an article. Curiosity is piqued and interesting discussions can be gained. It helps everybody. But because I want to make these articles free for the public, the research costs will add up to the point I may have to decrease my writing and research standards or worse stop writing altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to half-ass my research and writing ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I research and research costs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause I like to do overviews of movements and history in a post that is supposed to be innocuous like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tanoshimi.xyz/2017/02/16/do-not-touch-my-beautiful-boy-saihara/\"\u003eDanganronpa and the History of Mysteries: A Newer World Order\u003c/a\u003e, I end up reading and citing many works that have influenced this post. Each post is its own bibliography and provides original research from all spectrums of the fields.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike anyone who has found a cool book that references another cool book and is tempted to buy the book, I often research following several threads and seeing where they lead to. I make sure to look at how much time and money are used. For example, some\u00a0articles point to an academic text that I find enlightening for the post. I can usually find these works in libraries and elsewhere. But if I have to buy them, good grief. I can find the same information elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, even at my most efficient days, I will have to open my wallet and take out the credit card. There are costs I cannot go around and time isn\u0027t always an ally to articles with deadlines. This is the case with Japanese media. There are not many good free English or Japanese sources on Japanese video games and literature. Sometimes, I do have to buy the relevant academic text in order to understand the context of these works. I try to avoid them as much as possible -- and will still do, even with this Patreon -- but these costs add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon will whittle down the research costs I have incurred over the years. Once these costs are low enough, I can do more ambitious articles that I have always wanted to do but couldn\u0027t. These posts include: \"Pulp Fiction 2.0: From Science Fiction to Japanese Light Novels\", a series of posts on postmodernist video games and how they affect the player, an overview of Singaporean literature, and an actual recurring feature of Japanese book reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to hire a copywriter for my work as well because I admit I\u0027m not always the most careful of writers when it comes to grammar and sentence structuring. It helps to have another person look over the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also like to get feedback from paid supporters who want their money\u0027s worth on what they will like to read more of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll do with this Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be sharing a monthly total cost breakdown with Patreon supporters under paid posts what the money has gone into. I will catalogue what I have bought and explain why I bought it. It will be like an annotated bibliography, this time in the form of a receipt to supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is as much as a reward for supporters I can do for the time being.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am not comfortable with the idea of giving out rewards and tiering supporters. This Patreon will be a donate-all-you-want deal. People are free to offer suggestions for articles and blogs I could write for. I will respond to any comments, concerns, and questions as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not too worried about how much money I will get. I want to however write the best I can and any support is appreciated. Even if you are unable to donate, your readership matters just as much as money. It is why I want to keep the good content free for everyone, regardless if people donated or not."
