In order for it to be created quicker, I\u0027m seeking your support to facilitate my focus on the first book\u0027s completion that I\u0027ll afterward self-publish. Unfortunately the comic book industry does not pay new unpublished creators any type of salary or wage to create their first book and thus is the reason it\u0027s so difficult for some new creators to finish their first polished works. The amount of labor and concentration that goes into illustrating these pages is an intense amount of detail. This is why patron support per page completed (1 page per month - with the goal of completing 2 pages) would be so great. In return I offer exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the production process in real time. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/bePatron?rid=75155\u0026amp;u=259031\u0026amp;patAmt=5.00#r75155\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBecome a Patron!

A goal is set by each creator and any funding that is accrued in that month, even if it doesn\u0027t reach the goal amount, goes towards the creator\u0027s project production. There is always the option for any supporter to opt out at anytime, although the fundamental impact of this amazing platform is to offer the opportunity for enthusiastic great people who want to see artistic creations come to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 The creation of my graphic novel in these beginning stages is an entirely solo endeavor, which includes the writing of the story, the penciling, inking, lettering, and the hand coloring of each page.

Where many other comic creators my age have been working on comic shorts for anthologies and web comics, or have been content working as writers or artists on other peoples stories in the \"BIZ\", I have been consumed with years of story and design development on this one creator-owned graphic novel of mine in my attempt to make it as original as I possibly can.\u00a0\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51); line-height: 28px;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51); line-height: 28px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I have yet to build a solid fanbase like so many other creators and to me this feels a bit daunting to seek support through crowdfunding; I was just hoping the quality of my page samples could attract the support needed to continue creating more pages.\u00a0\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51); line-height: 28px;\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51); line-height: 28px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0As of a couple years ago, I have finally pulled together all the pieces for the complete story arc and have got all my character designs where I like them to be. Being an organic writer, now\u00a0it\u0027s only down to the nuances I can fill in as I go. This graphic novel project\u00a0has been something I\u0027ve put a lot of innovative thought into and has been almost 2 decades in the making. I\u0027m also an INFJ personality type, which only amplifies my desire to not focus on much of anything else extensive until I finish this one major project independently as my own boss. I\u0027m driven to create this illustrated story, with as much of my undivided attention as possible, so I\u0027ll finish it and share it with the world.",
