    "summary": "Do you want to live in a world where you feel yourself as part of nature, of the cosmos, of a great, loving, intelligence? Do you want humans to learn to live in harmony with the Earth and remember that we are created from and an integral part of Her?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do,\u00a0and I want to share that beautiful sense of connection and belonging with those who want to listen, and feel, and create their lives in a manner that honors the Earth, the heavens, and each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to live in a world in which I am supported to do my soul\u0027s work of reconnecting people with themselves as an integral part of a vast and beautiful world. Enter Patreon as a way for me to go beyond the old model of burnout and exhaustion that marks the way I earned my living in the past and was aiming for, again, until I saw a way in which teaching, writing, guiding, creating could be a community-supported endeavor rather than the one-to-one exchange I was used to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a couple of decades in corporate-world, trying to play by the rules that didn\u0027t and don\u0027t fit most people let alone women, I left, burned out and fed up with myself as much as anything. In the past seven years, I\u0027ve made a couple of pilgrimages to India; lived alone in a mountain cabin; started and ended a natural medicine clinic; spent my savings and retirement funds on classes and healers and life; and most of all, re-created myself. I reclaimed my feminine self after a lifetime of tomboyhood; studied Ayurveda and yoga; and discovered a passion for and familiarity with astrology as an incredible language of spiritual guidance. I moved home to the Montana mountains to reclaim intimacy with the Earth in a place I\u0027ve know since childhood.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, it\u0027s time to create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am posting regularly on the blog on my personal website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kristinebackes.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ekristinebackes.com\u003c/a\u003e. I teach yoga, self-care and astrology to my local community of Livingston, Montana. I am beginning to create online classes in self-care and astrology. I offer soul guidance sessions to individuals both in person and online or by phone. I\u0027m also working on a spiritual memoir recounting how a child of the military and patriarchy reclaims her connection to nature, and herself as a woman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter if or how you choose to support me financially, I appreciate the fact you have read this far, found me here, looked at my page.\u00a0If you do support me, you\u0027ll have access to excerpts from the book as they come along, plus some patron-only posts on what I\u0027m up to. I\u0027ve created a tier of rewards to try to keep you interested, and me accountable to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore important, by supporting me you support my vision of human beings living in integrity with their bodies and souls and the natural world around them; you support me in finding a new way through this world of entrepreneurship that does not involve pyramid schemes or over-promising or shaping myself and my words to outside expectations. You support one woman\u0027s journey and the impact it has on the world - seen and unseen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I am a blend of ancient wisdom in a modern culture; a woman learning to reclaim her own natural wisdom in a world that has lost the balance of feminine and masculine archetypes. My mission is to help others reclaim their own natural wisdom; reconnect with their bodies; see themselves as an integral part of the natural world; re-learn their natural rhythms and remember themselves as creatures of this Earth.",
