Maintaining his integrity as a rapper, the \u003ca href=\"http://sbstrct.com/\"\u003eSubstruct Music\u003c/a\u003e artist formlessly combines elements of Jazz and electronic music in his production style with Rap aesthetics to create what many have coined to be \"Dapper Rap\".\u003cbr\u003eColeman broad spectrum of sensibilities can be seen in his group affiliations. He is a member of the Hip-Hop duo COA (Center of Attention) and the lead singer of the 8-member Funk/Rap/Soul band The Phantastics. Kemet, shines as a complete showman embracing a James Brown-esque persona via syncopated vocals, rhythmic dance moves and dapper costume style.\u003cbr\u003eKemet the Phantom is a Kansas City enthusiast and urbanist often known for his unprecedented collaborations with KC entities and organizations such as University of Missouri-Kansas City, KC Streetcar and The Kansas City Royals. He is also highly regarded for his impresario role within the Sly James for Mayor Campaign in the 2010-2011 where he created the first ever Kansas City mayoral candidate rap song. Also University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City alumnus, Kemet, after being fed up with his alma-mater being a sports afterthought (locally) created \u201cGold and Blue\u201d which has garnered thousands of plays on YouTube and has been featured on prime-time television commercials for the university.\u003cbr\u003eCreating almost a formless persona as a rapper and public figure, Kemet the Phantom has graced the cover of multiple newspapers and magazine covers and won numerous awards: 2009, INK Magazine, 2011 KC Magazine, 2012 Pitch Weekly. He is a two time Pitch Music Award nominee for \"Best Hip-Hop Act\" in Kansas City and was the 2011 Big Brothers Big Sisters \"Sexiest Single\" in Kansas City.\u003cbr\u003e",
