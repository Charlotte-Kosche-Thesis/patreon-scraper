    "summary": "Hi lovelies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting this project! \u00a0Supporters like you keep the music alive and this project turning, bringing Raw, Real, Uplifting music to people around the globe. \u00a0You are becoming a part of a growing community who believes in the healing power of music.  We spread hope to the internet by releasing an uplifting song every week on popular music sharing platforms including Youtube, Facebook, Reddit, and Soundcloud. \u00a0Creating music together has never been faster thanks to advances in music technology and the internet. \u00a0On the other hand, online bullying and mental illnesses have been reaching an all time high. \u00a0As of 2014, \u00a0suicide is the #3 killer of people ages 10 - 35.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does music heal, you might ask? \u00a0I am no doctor, but I have been kind of a psychology nut for as long as I can remember. \u00a0As both an artist, an engineer, and a teacher, I can say in all ways music has saved my life. \u00a0It has given me a powerful way to talk about difficult emotions. \u00a0It has also given me a way to connect with people so that they may be more open about their emotions. \u00a0I think we can all agree -- music has lifted our spirits out of misery into wonderful experiences, laughter and dance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue to work on a team to bring healing through music. \u00a0By creating songs every week, we are inspiring the people around us to do what they love everyday. \u00a0To let go of the perfectionism when it comes to art and appreciate ourselves for exactly who we are, warts and all. \u00a0This project is about taking a music snapshot of a point in time and having the courage to share it shamelessly to the world, because truly, you love it. \u00a0When you love it, so will others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreate Art. \u00a0Love the Art. Do This Everyday. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for becoming a part of the team! \u00a0We adore you!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeet the Production Team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngelGrams is a team effort.  We are producing quality, radio-ready music that you can be proud of sharing. \u00a0I start writing lyrics on Thursday, and either creating an instrumental or reaching out to other producers in the community as collaboration partners for the instrumental. \u00a0The song then undergoes two studio sessions, one pre-production/songwriting session and one production session. \u00a0The song is then mastered, a video is created, and it is released every Wednesday. \u00a0 Thank you for becoming a part of the AngelGram Team! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKrysti Subieta - Singer/Songwriter/Assistant Producer/Recording Engineer/Person talking to you right now. \u00a0So...I guess I am also the project manager and marketer? \u00a0SO many hats...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I found myself in a church band soon after moving to Austin, I discovered I love\u00a0singing for families, children, and people with mental disabilities. \u00a0My passion for music and healing lead me to run an ipod fundraiser with Music and Memory to give patients suffering from Dementia and Alzheimer\u0027s the opportunity to listen to familiar music so that their memories would be returned to them. \u00a0 I love taking long walks on the greenbelt, \u00a0channeling into spiritual energy when writing, and collaborating with other artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJames Gibson - Producer/Guitarist/Engineer/Super powerful communicator and songwriter\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJames Gibson was part of a song-a-day project in 2015 as part of a band The Brothers Vinyl. \u00a0During this experience, \u00a0James mixed hundreds of songs and became aware of his passion for collaboration. \u00a0James continues to be a skilled Sound Engineer providing a beautiful studio space where he writes, records, and mixes, over a cup of tea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart-time team members\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlake Freda - EDM Producer, \u0027nuff said\u003cbr\u003eZakk Myer - Electronic Producer\u003cbr\u003eRand Ramos - Mastering Engineer"
