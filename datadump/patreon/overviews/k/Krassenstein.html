    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWho Is This Guy?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys, I\u0027m Krassenstein (pronounced like Frankenstein). Thanks for checking out my Patreon page. I am currently making my very first game called Knightfall. It is being made with Unity and I am using the C# programming language. I currently do all of the code and art for the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s face it. Game development isn\u0027t cheap. I work a full-time job and I am able to allocate 8 hours a week to the development of Knightfall. Being a husband and father, I have my hands pretty full but I still want to be able to chase my dream of making video games for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me through Patreon allows me to help pay the bills while pursue my game development dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat\u0027s Knightfall?\u003c/h1\u003eI\u0027m happy you asked. Knightfall is the first ever game produced by Static City Games. I do all of the coding and art (with some help from my wife). The game is a 2D top-down RPG. Your hero can only see a short distance around him, due to there being no other light sources. You fight different types of enemies, collect loot, level up, and fight MEAN bosses, all while having a ton of fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI firmly believe that if your main character is in a suit of armor, then there is no room for inventory. I\u0027ve established a \"no-pockets\" model that allows you to carry one weapon, wear one piece of armor, and hold one trinket. Picking up a new item of a certain type will destroy the current one you have, so you have to choose wisely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you really enjoy the game just as much as I did developing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
