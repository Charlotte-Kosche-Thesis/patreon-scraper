The reason why I decided to join Patreon is that here, creative people can end up producing more beautiful art without having to worry about money. And the people who help them can get paid back with awesome creative pieces and patron only access specials. A win-win situation. I hope the same will happen with me."

(I currently reside in Tallinn, Estonia). The 9th Art aka Comics/Bande Dessin\u00e9e/Fumetti etc is really what I am truly passionate about. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on publishing a series of mine and I\u0027m also creating fantasy (sci-fi, sword \u0026amp; sorcery etc) art for purchase. At the same time, I hope people will support me and help me in order to achieve my dream: make a living out of what I love doing.\u00a0I aspire to inspire people so they would use the power of their imagination more.",

I went to her country only once cause I and my family, couldn\u0027t afford another. They had many expenses helping me and my two siblings (Iam a triplet) with our university studies among other expenses. So, my girlfriend was working and was using these money to come and see me every 4 months for a few days only. After I finished with the university (School of Fine Arts-MFA) and the army, it was time to move in with her in 2017. Reaching the necessary monetary amount will help me pay a visit from time to time to my folks. Also I\u0027ll be able every May to attend the comic-con event of my city, promoting and selling my artwork and offer to my patrons some nice exclusive material of my time there.",
