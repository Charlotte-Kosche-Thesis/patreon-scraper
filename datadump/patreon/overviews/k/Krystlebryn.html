    "summary": "Hola to all of my beautiful compadres reading this!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first want to thank you, thank you, thank YOU for even making it this far! I appreciate any bit of support given to me- even if all you do is read this line you\u0027ve supported me b\u0027cause you found me and clicked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am on my newest adventure in life and you have found yourself reading it. I am once again trying to figure out how my passions of creating art and movement can live together and support me and my 3 children, comfortably. I am perpetually in awe and amazed at everyone\u0027s support when I launch something new so here I am, launching.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new here to Patreon I can give the downlow so you can understand a little better:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of mine (or about to be, or want to be) this is a way you can support all of my crafty/pole/performance/teaching/whacky idea things going on! The list is rather random if you don\u0027t know me... well I suppose it\u0027s random even if you do. I\u0027ve learned to live with that because the bottom line is #1- I like random surprises. #2- I\u0027ve learned to love me #3- The craft world and the fitness world are absolutely where I belong. My passion is there. My heart is there. My mind is there. And my soul came from there. I have to move and I have to create. It\u0027s a must. I have a plethora of ideas for both worlds but I can\u0027t make them all happen for free and I can\u0027t make them all happen while trying to raise 3 kids by myself and working a ho-hum job I don\u0027t care about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore we go any further we should dive right in with a bit of a backstory on my craftiness, shall we? (If you\u0027re just one for meat and potatoes you can skip to the last paragraph:)- Anywhoblit, I\u0027ll skip all the parts of where I knew in my soul I should be creating and moving and had no idea how to even start. A great point of reference when the Universe kicked me in my butt was when I became a single mother of 3 toddlers. I needed to make money and I needed a way to stay sane while talking to toddlers all day.I found my way to my roots of creativity and started pumping out all the things. I got a job teaching pole fitness and wearing my creations or giving them as gifts and sometime in 2012 my Etsy store was born which I chose to call Lotus Opus. I started shipping a few things around the world and was hooked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy 2014 the gym closed and I was so busy trying to work my own pole gym business, while working 4 other jobs, I barely had time to create. That went on for entirely too long and I finally burnt out and had to reevaluate. In 2017 I purchased an old city transit bus for my fitness\u00a0and moved across the country from VA to Las Vegas, NV. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat line of \"purchased an old city transit bus for my fitness\" tends to throw people off so I feel the need to clarify. I want all people to have access to some form of fitness because I know the benefits so I am making fitness mobile so there are no excuses! The bus comes to you, you get on and work it, and you go about your day. Some other things the bus will park and\u00a0host:\u003cbr\u003e-Bachelorette parties\u003cbr\u003e-Wine and paint night\u003cbr\u003e-Money Consciousness classes\u003cbr\u003e-Luncheon\u0027s for the homeless\u003cbr\u003e-Yoga for children before tests at school\u003cbr\u003e- Meal prep classes\u003cbr\u003e-Crafty classes\u003cbr\u003eAnd so much more!\u003cbr\u003eIn order to move forward with all of my bus plans she\u0027s going to need new flooring and some sort of heating and cooling system. \u003cbr\u003eThis is where YOU come in! You get to be a part of\u00a0my dream and help me make it a reality! With your monthly support, my camera and expertise, applied with endless amounts of love and gratitude, I can make this happen! In return all of YOU get to reap the benefits! Monthly pledges can get you some good Karma, tips and tutorials on how to make your own crafty goodness, fitness classes, movement tutorials,\u00a0and even surprise goodies in the mail!\u00a0 I will have a top secret\u00a0Facebook groups so the discussions can continue and you can get feedback on your own creations as well. I am SO excited to meet this a community of thinkers, movers, creators, and innovators!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s Do This!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Krystle"
