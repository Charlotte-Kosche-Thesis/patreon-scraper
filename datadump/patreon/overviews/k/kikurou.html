    "summary": "Hi there, thanks for visiting my patreon page~\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kikurou, a freelance artist who draw cute bara (muscular) guys, human and anthro alike. I live in South East Asia, Indonesia. I have been interested in drawing (among other things) since I was a kid. My other hobbies are reading some random wiki pages (go figure) and gaming. I\u0027m here on Patreon invited by \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/aliensymbol\"\u003eAlienSymbol\u003c/a\u003e. Check him out for more bara kemono drawings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s not much to tell about me, really. I have 3 main characters of my own: Rock the innocent anthro german shepherd dog, Scissors the yandere cheetah and Paper/Kikuro the representative of myself (previously, he is a white lab rat). Usually I love to draw them just to see people\u0027s reactions. But nowadays I need to be able to provide money, since my family is not really a stable one. So I began taking commissions, which unfortunately cut down the time I have to draw something for myself. But it\u0027s not all for nothing, I\u0027m still improving from it, and hopefully things get better as I go on. And this is where Patreon comes to my attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was hoping, that if somehow Patreon can provide a portion of my income, then I can cut down on how many commissions I need to do each month, which means I can draw free commissions! Plus I can draw other things for myself too, and bring back my characters~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough, I can\u0027t really provide much for my patrons... I don\u0027t have merchandise or anything, I can only provide exclusive votes or drawings here and there when I have the time. Nonetheless, I thank Patreon and those who keep supporting me on here or thru commissions. Hopefully things will get better for all of us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me in\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kikuro/\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/KikuRuffRuff\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e."
