    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWelcome!\u003c/h3\u003e\nWelcome to Knyght Errant\u0027s Patreon page! \u00a0If you\u0027re not already familiar, I create original educational content focusing on my experience and research within the Medieval Living History community. \u00a0The goal behind my channel is to create the kind of content I wish I had access to when I was starting out in my serious study of the Middle Ages and with my start in re-enactment. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough my Knyght Errant videos I hope to bring to the community high quality, well-researched information and opinion on various Medieval topics to include armor, weapons and more mundane material culture. \u00a0I\u0027m trying to chip away at many of the widely held misconceptions about Medieval armor and other material culture so that we may all benefit from a better understanding of this period. \u00a0Whether your interest is in re-enactment, academic study, gaming, or is artistic in nature, I believe you will all find something of interest here. \u00a0Most of us have had our knowledge of the Middle Ages informed by modern entertainment and pop culture through media like movies, role playing games and video games. \u00a0I was no exception! \u00a0When I began to study the real objects several years ago, I quickly discovered that most of what we \u003cem\u003ethink\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0we know about our Medieval counterparts is wrong!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough carefully researched topics, demonstration of high quality reproductions and videos detailing my personal opinions and philosophies on living history, re-enactment, medievalism within pop culture and various subsets medieval history, I hope to meet the goal described above. \u00a0I am finding that I can\u0027t do this alone, and that\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy Proposal\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027ve been very hesitant to request monetary support through something like Patreon for a lot of reasons. \u00a0I don\u0027t like the idea of putting any of my content behind a \u0027paywall.\u0027 \u00a0The whole purpose of my work is to provide this information free of charge to anyone interested and willing to learn. \u00a0I\u0027m not particularly fond of providing exclusive rewards like the ability to \u0027ask me questions\u0027 or other things that I try to make myself available for regardless of whether someone is paying or not. \u00a0It also tends to make people feel like they are entitled to guide the future course of my channel. \u00a0I prefer instead to take inspiration from any and all ideas brought forth to me, not just from people willing to donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI simultaneously find myself having to face some realities. The videos I create are costing more to make than they bring in through traditional avenues like \u0027YouTube ads.\u0027 \u00a0At the time of writing this, my ads bring in less money per month than I have to pay out just for the software licenses I need to simply edit my videos and images. \u00a0This is before I even begin to factor in things like videography, photography and sound-recording equipment. \u00a0Of course this doesn\u0027t even take in to account the actual time invested in research, production and editing much less the money required to source objects to showcase for you in videos where that kind of aid is helpful. \u00a0Long story short, my current model is unsustainable without compensation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo instead of offering rewards or exclusive content, I simply ask that people who currently enjoy what I do, consider donating just $1 per video to help maintain the quality of content that I produce. \u00a0I\u0027ve chosen to go with the \u0027per video\u0027 model because of the relative infrequency of my videos (on average 1 - 3 videos per month).\u00a0 Also keep in mind that you may set a monthly \u0027cap\u0027 on donations, so if I suddenly make 6 videos in one month and you were only prepared to donate for 2 of them, you have that control.\u00a0 If you would like to donate more, you have my sincerest thanks, but $1 is all I ask. \u00a0Thank you for your consideration!"
