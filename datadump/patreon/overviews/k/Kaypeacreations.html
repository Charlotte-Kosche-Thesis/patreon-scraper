That alone means so much to me and I appreciate!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk now for real. Hey there! My name is Karen and I am an Art Doll creator. Way back in high school (2012...totally not that long ago) \u00a0I started playing with clay and man was I in love with the stuff! There was just one problem, I hated how once it was baked and painted that was it, you couldn\u0027t change anything about it. I couldn\u0027t stand that as I always wanted to re-position them in a \u00a0pose I thought would be more fitting. It bugged me so much that I had to see if there was any way around it. I was certainly not disappointed when I discovered art dolls, it was exactly what I as looking for. A realistic looking and feeling sculpture that moves! Never stuck in a single pose and is interactive. The addiction began then and 4 years later I\u0027m even more in love. In the past 4 years I\u0027ve had enormous joy making and sharing these creations with you, Connecting with you guys, and just recently opening the doors to this beautiful art form for you all to learn and try for yourself! While I don\u0027t plan on giving this up anytime soon I will admit it is really hard to manage my passion and function in the real world and this is where I\u0027m hoping you can help me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/cd16/f/2017/125/a/1/0_by_kaypeacreations-db89akj.jpg\"\u003eI am burning with passion and dreams to make this a full-time reality. While that does get the ball rolling, finances and lack of time can really hinder things. I currently work 40+ hours a week working a \"real 8-5 job\" On a typical day I have around 4-5 hours of free time and in that time I have to cook, clean, do any errands I may need and then try to get in the zone and let my imagination flow. \u00a0After awhile that can run anyone down! My dream is to be able to make art full-time as my career and teach and inspire people to let their imaginations flow! This is will take many years for me to accomplish alone but with your help I think we can get there! With your donations I will be able to expand the horizons on my art, my set ups for how I teach you and lets be honest pay the bills! I will be able to be full time and share all my ideas freely with the world! I of course have perks for you guys as a huge thank you for taking a leap of faith in me. I have so many cool things planned for Patreon like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive PDF tutorials and videos only you guys will get!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet access to sales, adoptions and videos before anyone else\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBehind the scenes and work in progress shots\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive giveaways\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscounts if you\u0027d like to adopt one of my creations\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull length videos of art dolls to really get a detailed look on how things are done! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have cool things planned if things go well like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLivestreaming\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiy Doll kits for you guys to practice\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMini art dolls\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity based art doll creations!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd much more\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it through all this I thank you greatly for taking the time to read about a girls dream to shine a little creativity onto the world.
