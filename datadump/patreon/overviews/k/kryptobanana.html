    "summary": "Hi everyone! My name is Nikita (a graduate student at UW) and I have a passion for photography -- specifically, women\u0027s soccer. For the last few years, I have been capturing the Seattle Reign from the stands with a basic camera (Nikon D5100) and kit lens (55-200 mm). While this is not the best gear in the world, I always believe that you can make anything look beautiful if your pictures tell a story and you get creative. In order to overcome the shortcomings of my setup, I have turned to more artistic editing and even stop-motion animations! (Check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/kryptobanana\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Instagram\u003c/a\u003e!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany players have used my images on their own Instagram or Twitter.\u00a0More importantly, because of my pictures, I am finally starting to get opportunities photographing major games from the sidelines. I recently captured the Tournament of Nations in Seattle, Portland Thorns and Timbers at Providence Park, Seattle Sounders, and the CANWNT vs USWNT friendly in Vancouver, BC.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate: I will be photographing the Portland Thorns as an unpaid photographer for Stumptown Footy for the 2018 NWSL season. However, Portland Mercury will pay to use my photos in their online and print publication so that should help costs!)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem with turning a dream into reality: I did this all for free and the costs add up. My gear for Tournament of Nations, essentially two games, cost $200.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eIf I want to continue producing better content and traveling for unique opportunities, I need your help! \u003c/strong\u003eYour investment in me will allow for a few things:\u003cbr\u003e1. Lens rentals are a lot cheaper than camera bodies (typically less than $40) at a local shop near me. However, again, per game, this adds up. (\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate: I have purchased a new camera body, a camera strap, and monopod to help reduce costs).\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. I need to be able to travel beyond Seattle but in addition to the cost of all this equipment, travel costs will be expensive.\u003cbr\u003e"
