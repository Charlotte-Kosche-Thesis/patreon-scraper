You might have seen me featured in \u003cem\u003efrankie \u003c/em\u003emagazine or at an arts festival somewhere in Australia. Maybe you know my voice from\u00a0\u003cem\u003eJust A Spoonful \u003c/em\u003epodcast, or from the recent OzPod conference broadcast on ABC Digital Radio. I also write sometimes for \u003cem\u003eJunkee, \u003c/em\u003eFairfax and \u003cem\u003eSeizure. \u003c/em\u003ePoint is, I love doing media things and telling stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s tough to make a living in the creative industries - and particularly tricky when you have a disability, like I do. I live with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a debilitating chronic condition which makes it impossible for me to work full-time hours, or even find a part-time job. I\u0027ve written about the challenges of living on a low income with a disability for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/ppx3pz/the-forgotten-young-people-on-the-disability-support-pension\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVICE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.seizureonline.com/content/2017/1/18/an-inconvenience\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeizure\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m mostly house-bound and surviving off the disability pension. However, I have massive ambitions and with a bit of help I reckon I can make them happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support means that I can\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ethrive instead of barely survive\u003c/strong\u003e. My monthly income from Patreon gives me the opportunity to plan and work on my own projects. Check out my Patreon goals to find out what your patronage helps me do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of my work is dedicated to improving awareness and circumstances for people with chronic illnesses and disabilities. Creative work is important for its own sake, but I also feel an urgency to use my voice for social and structural change. I live with an incurable medical condition that destroys the lives of millions, can be fatal, and subjects patients to a quality of life lower than that of people with Multiple Sclerosis or cancer. Yet hardly anyone outside the patient community is talking about it or seeking solutions. I\u0027m writing a book I hope will move the needle another millimetre for myself and other ME patients in Australia, and this Patreon is how I will have the ability to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon. You\u0027re awesome, and even if you can\u0027t support me through a pledge right now, your interest in my work means a lot to me."
