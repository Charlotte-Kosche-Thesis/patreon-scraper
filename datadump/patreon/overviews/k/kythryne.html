    "summary": "I\u0027m a full-time artist/small business owner/single parent/sarcastic gimpy chick, a part-time writer/musician/rabble-rouser, and apparently I want to be a cantor and/or a rabbi when I grow up. (It would have been nice if I\u0027d realized that before I flunked out of college 20 years ago, but I\u0027m a little slow on the uptake sometimes.) Basically, I\u0027m one person with at least four full-time jobs, none of which pay very well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour years ago I was diagnosed with a brain tumor the size of a clementine, and I promptly had brain surgery. (For the definition of \"promptly\" that means \"six months later\" which is actually pretty prompt when it comes to convincing a health insurance company to spend half a million dollars.) It wasn\u0027t fun and I don\u0027t recommend doing either of those things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing poetry in the aftermath of the surgery, mostly by accident. My first published poem \"\u003ca href=\"http://stonetelling.com/issue11-nov2014/aisling-disk.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNothing Writes To Disk\u003c/a\u003e\" was nominated for a 2015 Rhysling Award, and I was a 2015 semi-finalist at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/slamfreeordie\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSlam Free or Die\u003c/a\u003e because it turned out that yelling poems at strangers is cheaper than therapy and healthier than whiskey. And then I got divorced, which resulted in more poems and more yelling, and then I started singing in my synagogue\u0027s choir and training as a lay music leader and apparently now I write songs? I don\u0027t know, I just work here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past year, a number of things have collided in my life in such a way that I can\u0027t really keep pretending that writing and music is just a hobby. I\u0027m much too cynical to call it the hand of fate or G-d or the universe, but when something whacks me upside the head this hard I do eventually listen. (Grudgingly, and with a lot of whining, usually.) I started jokingly saying that my role is the revolution is to feed people and get them to sing, but as time goes on I\u0027m not entirely sure I\u0027m joking anymore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy poetry tends to be about the intersections of identity: \u00a0I\u0027m a queer single mother, a brain tumor and domestic violence survivor living with PTSD and chronic illnesses, and I\u0027m an observant feminist Jew, so there\u0027s a lot of intersectionality right in my own back yard. (To paraphrase from one of my own poems, nothing is sacred and everything is holy.) I\u0027ve written poems about plastic dinosaurs and I\u0027ve written poems about visiting graveyards and surviving hurricanes. I have a website and all that jazz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to music, my primary focus so far is Jewish liturgical music, but I\u0027ve only very recently reclaimed that piece of my identity; I also love me some depressing folk songs and I do a damn fine cover of Famous Blue Raincoat."
