It carries cultural and historical values from the ancient samurai warriors. It seems like that people are attracted to the competitiveness of kendo more than those values. I am loving to see that kendo is becoming more popular around the world but at the same time I am sad that those values are less emphasized by many people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the last 20 years, I saw a dramatic changes in kendo. The current main stream kendo style is not the style I was told to do. People start teaching kendo differently too. The way I learned the kendo basics is different from many other people. I\u0027ve been feeling \n\u003cstrong\u003ea big gap\u003c/strong\u003e between the recent kendo and kendo that many late 8-dan and 9-dan sensei taught in the past.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSomething I cannot just leave as \"Time Has Changed\"...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am so afraid that \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003ekendo as budo won\u0027t survive for the next generations IF we don\u0027t intend to preserve it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u0027t disagree with kendo as sport but I \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely refuse to lose kendo as budo\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0Are You With Me on This?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are with me, please\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003ebe a part of my ongoing project to preserve the values of kendo.\u00a0Can you be a part of me making videos and writing books?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can focus on creating videos, podcasts and articles.

I would like to devote my life to preserve the kendo I learned from the traditional kendo teachers for you and the next generations. You have rights to know these teachings. Creating videos and books needs a lot of researching,editing and technical skills too. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is not easy It is rather difficult and challenging.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIaido and Jodo\u003c/h2\u003eIf you love kendo, you can benefit from iaido and jodo too. Even though I have studied Iaido and Jodo before, I\u0027m not an expert. Since I live in a remote area, I most often have to fly out to study those martial arts. With your help, I can build up my skills and knowledge on these and share them with you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can help me out with $1 per month, \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ethat can change everything\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.
