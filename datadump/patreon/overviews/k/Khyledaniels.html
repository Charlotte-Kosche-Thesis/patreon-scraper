Through my art/framing/overall story direction/comic-writing/digital ink/ digital coloring/overactive imagination/comedy/ and passion has lead to the creation of This page.\u003cbr\u003eI want to release two graphic novels: Grey \u0026amp; Nocturne.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSet in a post World War III era, our stories follow Greyson (A beat cop with a shady past and a morally grey compass) and Jason (A young enslaved boy who must kill to survive). I am heavily inspired by the Batman (Scott Snyder version) and Scott Pilgrim versus the World comics. By using Patreon I hope to bring this project to fruition and not starve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game I plan on releasing is a genre -bending 8-32 bit indie game based on the Developers that will be making it (including myself and my friend). I don\u0027t intend to use Patreon for the support of said game however, it will be a perfect forum to allow others to see what some of the process work and rough sketches look like, as well as giving a bit more publicity to the project I hope to pursue. When the time comes I will post a link to the Kickstarter that will be associated with the game, in the meantime, stay tuned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly I am working on several ideas and storyboards for some small comedic animations and some serious Ghibli-styled animations. With Patreon I hope to showcase them in their rough stages before they are shown on Youtube or any other forum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you\u0027ll:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ereceive progress updates\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esee exclusive art before anyone else\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebehind the scenes look at concept development\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eroll clips of how this comic is coming together\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebe apart of an adventure\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I love making pixel art the most though, it\u0027s been a hobby of mine since I was young and continues to bring me joy to this day. I also love classic video games, some of my favorites include: Chrono Trigger, FF I-IV, Sonic (The classics), Streets of rage 2, Legend of Zelda (any of them), Super Mario (Any) I could go on and on but I think you get the idea. Part of the reason I\u0027m creating a game is to pay homage to the classics and truly follow my passion. I love pandas and most animals including dogs. My dream dog is a Shiba Inu, I think I\u0027m addicted to Monster, and chocolate, I give awkward hugs, I have two jobs, I can\u0027t do work unless my room is clean, I blame Disney for most of my childhood fears and nightmares, I don\u0027t think cheerleading is a sport, I\u0027d like to be a rapper, and lastly I hate coleslaw and tupperware.",
