    "summary": "How\u0027s it going, guys? I\u0027m Dakotah Moss, but you can call me KO! Allow\u00a0me to\u00a0welcome you to my Patreon page! Your visiting means a lot to me, so I\u0027m going to make sure I do a killer job of explaining what exactly happens here! Erh-hem, Let\u0027s get started, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, if you aren\u0027t familiar with Patreon, it\u0027s a fantastic platform that allows creators like me to create a sustainable income from their creativity via \u0027patronage\u0027 from their fans! That about summarizes it! These supporters \u0027pledge\u0027 an amount of money to a creator on either a monthly or per creation basis! Typically a creator has different reward tiers for patrons who pledge different amounts, thus incentivizing\u00a0fans to support even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s why I\u0027m on Patreon: To create an income that would allow sustaining better this passion of mine via my brand/website: Kotamoss. I\u0027m 19 years old, and have been passionately writing, studying technology, and being a geek over anime since my age was in the single digits! Of course, this means there is a lot of progress to be made, but that\u0027s also one of the most invigorating aspects of the journey for me! I hope it is for you too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creating 3 videos weekly currently on Kotamoss: A Technology Video, An anime video, and a \u002760 second Japanese Language\u0027 video,\u00a0all of which will be archived on YouTube! Every now and again I will do silly, one-shot, lower effort videos for a joke on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReward tiers will feature all sorts of goodies, secrets, snippets, and extras surrounding any content I make, which isn\u0027t a whole lot to offer, but I\u0027m hoping\u00a0I can inspire generosity with my content nonetheless. Be sure to check out all of the social media accounts too for updates and such! I really hope you join me on this journey - It\u0027s gonna be fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
