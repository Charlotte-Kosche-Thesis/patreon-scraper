    "summary": "Hey everyone! I\u0027m Kaitlin. I\u0027m an aerialist, producer, choreographer, costumer, makeup artist, organizer, and \"event architect\". I run a performance troupe called Cirque du Nuit. This year, I just finally got the paperwork for an LLC, and am in the process of working with my team to create the groundwork for our first ever event concepted and realized by us. Here\u0027s some exciting text I borrowed from our website:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We specialize in immersive, interactive circus-inspired theater. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work with you to build site- and event- specific performances that borrow from global theater and circus traditions, to craft audience-driven experiences that elevate and transform.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeat, yeah?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think so--and I hope you do too. I\u0027ve been working like crazy since the middle of 2016 to create a strong base for my company, investing a lot of time and money into learning how to do basically everything from the ground up. My goal is to create a financially viable, artistically thought-provoking and exciting company of performers from diverse backgrounds that combines the awesome talent of shows like Cirque du Soleil with the exuberance of nightlife and the subversive and exclusive feel of the underground Brooklyn club scene from the early 2000s. We choose work that is emotionally resonant to us, and transform it into a living, breathing, fully interactive world that the audience can walk into, and watch as their choices and actions influence the world around them, all while surrounded by the heightened spectacle of performance artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSorry/not sorry for the lengthy description. I do get really excited when I\u0027m talking about it, and go on for a bit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is to give inside access to that learning curve, and lots of the pitfalls and successes of my personal development while creating works, learning new skills, and first looks at our newest works. Funding will help to actually support me personally while working on these projects, as well as go toward the actual building of events, for things like rehearsal spaces, costuming, and coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, guys. And really, thanks for donating. I\u0027m broke and like eating food.\u003cbr\u003e"
