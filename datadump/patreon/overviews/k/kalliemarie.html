    "summary": "Hi, I am a composer and producer of music. I write music for film, tv, dance, video games, apps, art installations, and my band Explosives For Her Majesty (if you can think of something else to write music for I wanna know!) \u00a0I am also active as a producer working with various bands to help hone their sound and create recordings that meet their artistic vision. \u00a0I love what I do and I want to do more! I have big projects in mind, many of which I hope to share with you, with your support, in time. \u00a0A few of my projects have research components and if all goes well I would like to use Patreon to help fund either a PHD or other larger scale endeavors. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport like yours helps to ensure\u00a0\u00a0that I continue to have access to the software and technology I need to create; which may include software updates, studio upgrades, and the hiring of session musicians or studio space and mixing/mastering where applicable. Your support ensures that I can better sustain myself during periods of writing and creating which will ensure focus, larger scale projects, better quality work, and grander collaborations and projects.\u00a0In future this may help toward things like live appearances, and bringing what I do closer to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is very new to me, and I am really interested in how we can grow together as a community. I would love to hear feedback on what kinds of rewards you may be interested in! \u00a0I want to make this as meaningful and collaborative as we can. So please, don\u0027t be shy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the grand scheme of things I have several longer term, larger scale projects that I would like to bring to fruition, but first we must start here, and create a path together. \u00a0As we complete milestones, and create our own dialogue of exchange we can add more and greater milestones that we can reach together. \u00a0Shall we begin? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
