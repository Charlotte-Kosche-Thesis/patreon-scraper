Over here...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t much time to convey this message before I am missed, so let me make this brief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Anton Channing, an operative in the KIA Invisible Agents. They currently have me working on their computer systems, including their public facing website. Which needs some work. And truth be told, some funding. KIA has no hierarchy, no membership fees and no advertising. So we are completely reliant on the goodwill of those agents and supporters willing to donate to our noble cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why I\u0027m handing out to \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e this important mission, should you choose to accept it. If you can spare some of your survival tokens we can help KIA grow. Your support will not be thankless. In addition to my love and gratitude, there will be rewards for your generosity. Some of these will be collective, such as more articles, sound projects from Dana Varahi, film projects from Alchemical.TV, plus the sharing of plugins and themes for WordPress, MediaWiki and other software as we develop it. Others will be personal depending on level of support given, such as previews of books, ebook copies of my books or even hard copies if you donate enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterested? Then sign up as a patron of KIA today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUndecided?

These two themes dance as stand ins for the left and right hemispheres of my brain, in a poetic sense. The animism allows me to communication with all kinds of entities, to see consciousness in all things and enjoy wild flights of fancy. The rationalist within me allows me to come down to Earth and explain where I have been, without getting caught up in belief. However, I allow neither side to dominate my personality, and my approach involves harmonising these perspectives rather than engaging them in conflict. In other words, the animist perspective allows me to do what I do, and the rationalist perspective observes and makes theories as to how that works.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy magical background includes a number of years involved in chaos magic, practise in a neo-pagan magical group and many connections with decentralised magical networks that organise online, and meet offline when possible. In addition to KIA, these include Free Illuminism, the School of Galatorg, EtherSec, DKMU, CMG, Discordianism and Z(Cluster). I will continue to expand the range of decentralised agent groupings that I inflitrate and engage with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTheory\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nExamples of the kind of theory articles I will produce include:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://octarine.kiamagic.com/2014/02/26/magicians-as-agents/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMagicians as Agents\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ufo.kiamagic.com/2014/06/04/ufo-abduction-as-experience-of-the-monad/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUFO abduction as experience of the Monad\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eField reports\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nExamples of write-ups of magical experiences include:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://earth.kiamagic.com/2014/05/15/summoning-storm-summary/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSummoning Storm Operation\u003c/a\u003e ~ An eleven day evocation marathon.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuest Writers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many other agents in my network that produce great writing.
