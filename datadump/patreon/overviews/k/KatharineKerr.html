    "summary": "Yes, my author photo there looks a little grim. Here\u0027s why. Seven years ago, my much-loved husband developed early-onset Alzheimer\u0027s dementia. \u00a0As you can probably guess, this turned our lives upside-down. \u00a0My writing career first faltered, then ground to a halt while I desperately tried to take care of him myself. \u00a0Didn\u0027t work -- we now have a full-time live-in caregiver while I try to get my writing back on track. \u00a0Our primary caregiver, VJ, is wonderful but he isn\u0027t cheap, just worth every penny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the high cost of medical care in the USA, I have spent all of our savings over the past 3 years. (We own a house, just enough property to fail to qualify for any kind of government assistance.) I have the all usual bills plus a big lawyer\u0027s bill from filing for the conservatorship over our finances that allows me to pay them. \u00a0We live in a shabby area of the San Francisco Bay Area, where costs are high. \u00a0I now have three people and two cats to feed. \u00a0I need help doing it, plain and simple. \u00a0As much as it gripes me to admit it, I cannot take care of everyone as well as myself on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to do is get my writing career back on track. I have a contract for a new book in the Deverry universe. \u00a0I also want to write more short fiction. In the meantime, however, those bills make it hard to concentrate. \u00a0I spend about $300 a week on food, basics, and utilities, plus even more on medical expenses. My current income falls short. \u00a0Any help I can get is very very welcome. And thank you all very much."
