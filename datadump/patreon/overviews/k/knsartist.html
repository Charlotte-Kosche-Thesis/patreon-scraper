    "summary": "Hey there lovely internet people, thank you so much for visiting my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may know me from my instagram @photographer_vs_dog, but if you don\u0027t, then allow me to introduce myself; My name is Nicole and I photograph my dog. That pretty much sums me up. (Okay, occasionally I photograph myself and other things too, but the dog is the most interesting, I promise.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I started my instagram, I\u0027ve had quite a few of you request for tutorials, presets, and explanations on my process so I\u0027d love to finally share these things with you all and offer you exclusive content and services that you can\u0027t find on instagram.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on my Patreon, I\u0027ll be offering lots of goodies including, but definitely not limited to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0-\ud83d\udd38Access to a Patron only feed where I\u0027ll post many of the photographs found on my instragam, but with explanations detailing how I set up each photo, camera equipment used, settings, backstory, etc. I\u0027ll also be posting my personal tips and tricks on this feed as well!\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 -\ud83d\udd38You guys asked for it, so you\u0027ve got it! I\u0027ll be offering detailed critiques and reviews of your images!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 -\ud83d\udd38Finally, for my top tiered patrons, I will personally edit your images in my style or the style of your choice. (For now these will only be Lightroom edits, I may offer composites and Photoshop editing/retouching later on.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 -\ud83d\udd39In the future, I\u0027m hoping to release my presets and also create custom presets tailored to each one of you. Shoot me a message or comment and let me know if this interests you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to join me on my journey and get access to my exclusive content, then feel free to become one of my super awesome Patrons! Even if you\u0027re not interested right now, I really appreciate the time you took to read this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnsartist \u003cbr\u003e(or if you\u0027d like to call me by my real name)\u003cbr\u003eNicole\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
