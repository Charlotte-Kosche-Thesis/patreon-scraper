    "summary": "Thank you so much for your support and encouragement! To get a sense of what you\u0027re supporting past the basic \u003ca href=\"http://www.katierunde.com/\"\u003evisuals\u003c/a\u003e\u2014say, why be a realist painter in the age of really pretty great smartphone cameras?\u2014here\u0027s a look into why I do what I do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more I paint, the more I realize that it all comes down to a study, appreciation, and\nobsession with light. Whether in still life or portrait, realist painting is an act of attunement\nwith something or someone we may see every day but not necessarily think\nto delve into. It is not about the illusion of dimension, but a celebration of the beauty\nin being. Even a simple study becomes its own theology\u2014to look hard enough at what\nis is to engage with its sublimity. This engagement is no more apparent to me than in\nthe painting of a portrait. Here there are so many levels that must be attuned to\u2014not\njust the light without and the tones and subtle color plays that it makes, but the light\nwithin, the irreplaceable spark that makes each person an individual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for why I paint from life in the age of the super accessible camera, there are no words to describe the breadth of disparity between soaking in the presence of a living, breathing, whole person while taking reference photos and actually reviewing those photos afterward. Where is the human mediator in those photos, the \u0027I\u0027 that responds on an objective but deeply attentive level to a subject as fantastically huge and complicated as another individual?\u00a0 Painting, even from photos (gripe, gripe...oh, that\u0027s another thing Patreon can help enormously with\u2014funding live models!) allows me to integrate my experience of that whole person into the image I create, bringing the life back into it that was lost in photographic translation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealist painting can seem a little bit antiquated nonetheless\u2014it\u0027s analogous with classical music in that training for it is tremendously difficult and time consuming, and, as my more contemporary artist friends ask, where is the CONTENT?\u00a0 Someone else wrote that symphony, it\u0027s all been done before...and a rose is a rose, right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a good question, one worthy of an apologia (but NOT an apology):\u003cbr\u003eBeauty is of transcendent value and I think our culture has forgotten that to its own immense detriment.\u00a0 I leave the brilliant treatment of the horrific anxiety inherent in modern life in innovative new styles and mediums with incisive, clever writeups to my contemporary art friends, who speak that language.\u00a0 As for me, I am in the business of beauty\u2014trying to capture what I find both within and without as regards my subject and laying it out there as a reminder for us all that while we live in this world of tremendous anxiety we still have a mighty potential to reach for...and the beauty of our world, ourselves, and our fellow people to protect and nourish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more I arrange my life around finding and working with beauty, the more I am struck by how the search sounds like its own theology (or, if you find that a difficult direction personally, its own philosophy).\u00a0 Even in teaching a spate of intensive drawing classes this past summer, I was both struck and very much amused by how most of the statements coming out of my mouth in regards to abstracting light and dark and angle and shape to transfer light and life to paper could just as easily have been extrapolated at length into theological (okay, okay, or philosophical, though it is DIFFERENT) reflection.\u00a0 The more I live in this space, the more I realize the content it already HAS.\u00a0 I intend to dig deep here and explore these parallels as much as I can, which brings me back around to why your help here is so important.\u00a0 Your support through Patreon helps offset the costs of what I do, opening up more time for me to pursue my personal work as opposed to the usual stream of commissions and readily saleable still-lives.\u00a0 While I still pursue commissions and still lives with as much integrity as I can give them, I create them then they are gone, and I have nothing left either to bring forth to galleries OR to address with sustained attention my personal artistic voice, which is ultimately the most I, as one individual to so many others, can give.\u003cbr\u003e"
