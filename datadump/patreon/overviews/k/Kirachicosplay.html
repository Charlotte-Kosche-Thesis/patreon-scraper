Throughout the years as I have become more and more involved in cosplaying I have found that by bringing these characters to life who I love I am able to make so many people smile! ~About Me~\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a little kid Sailor Moon was the only word in my vocabulary! That\u0027s where my entire obsession started and it has only grown since then! I started cosplaying at a young age and my focus has always been bringing my childhood hero to life!\u003cbr\u003eAs time has gone by I have cosplayed from series such as Drakengard, Final Fantasy, Batman, Card Captor Sakura, Love Live and many others that have all inspired me in many ways!Though I cosplay so many different characters I always focus around a common theme of Self Empowerment!I Would be no where without all of my friends, photographers, family, fellow cosplayers and fans!\u003cbr\u003eI owe everything to you. You are all by my side through the good and the bad. The silly and the serious. I could never ask for more amazing people in my life!\u003cbr\u003e",
