In 2018 I started doing the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.blackandgreenreview.org/b-g-podcast\"\u003eBlack \u0026amp; Green Podcast\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI see civilization as innately endemic: it is mathematically, ecologically and socially impossible to sustain. The problem is that we\u0027re unable to see it that way. We\u0027ve been trained to continually reiterate the values of civilization, particularly of this hyper-technological stage of Modernity. This is the domestication process. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The upside of that is that this process has a beginning. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We can see it in understanding how nomadic hunter-gatherer bands (our primal state) function and interact. We see it in the minutiae of changes in societies where some degree of sedentism or domestication take root. But we absolutely see it in comparing how civilizations arose, function and exist. This is a quantifiable assessment of a quantitative distinction. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The domestication process has a beginning, but it has no end. It is a perpetual state. And it is a losing battle. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wildness surrounds us, it calls to us. Civilization is a collective attempt to thwart the wild and expand its own grasp: it is a war on wildness. Civilization may have the better arsenal, but it cannot sustain life. It cannot sustain itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And we are better off without it. Sooner than later. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to focus on undermining that domestication process: to uphold wildness and combat the narratives that civilizers have instilled within us. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That translates to writing, editing, interviewing others, helping encourage writers and projects to flush out their ideas and to bring more strength to their work. It means publishing under Black and Green Press and keeping \u003cem\u003eBlack and Green Review\u003c/em\u003e moving along strongly and quickly. It means undergoing the rewilding process and encouraging my daughters to explore wildness within their own lives. It means taking strides in hunter-gatherer subsistence and rewilding the place where our land project is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have a lot of projects in the works and a lot more coming along as well. Your contribution and support goes a long way to ensuring that these projects continue and that I can help push this milieu and anyone we can reach further towards the wild and hack at the grasp of the domestication cycle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Doing these projects is what I love. It\u0027s what I care about. It\u0027s a drive that never fades even when it probably should. If you feel the same and want to see more coming out against civilization, for wildness, and for the earth, here is where you can contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. \u003cbr\u003eFor wildness and anarchy, \u003cbr\u003eKT\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.kevintucker.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.kevintucker.org\u003c/a\u003e"

It is the unfortunate reality that being an anarcho-primitivist doesn\u0027t immediately give you an out on that situation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m stuck in the same work cycle as anyone else and I\u0027ve dumped untold amounts of time and cash into projects for over two decades now. And I have A LOT of projects in the works. Essays, books, journals; you name it, I\u0027m working on it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been one to ask for hand outs or even assistance. I loathe money. I loathe bringing money into the equation when it comes to writing and anarchist projects. But if I\u0027m being honest, all that really means is that I\u0027m just shouldering the expenses with the occasional gracious contributions of others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s where I\u0027m at. My time is currently heavily limited by work. Any contribution that I get here can inch me towards having to work less and to be able to spend more time on the real work in life: targeting civilization.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAny support is greatly and unendingly appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDoing these projects is what I love.
