    "summary": "Firstly, I want to sincerely thank anyone who has pledged to my cause. I am eternally grateful, and want you to know that your pledge will make a difference. Every little bit does.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Harrison. As of writing this I\u0027m 26 years old. I\u0027ve been battling depression, anxiety, and most of all drug addiction since the age of 14. It has destroyed my life, over and over, but I will never give up, After a few years of rock bottom I decided to do something about it. I went to rehab, and got clean. Relapsed again, and got clean again. I live with my lovely supportive partner Abby and I am grateful to have come through everyone without too many permanent scars. My blogs are my therapy, but I believe they can help others who suffer or suffered just as I did. Addiction is brutal, and relentless. Addicts need support, and understanding, not judgement or alienation. Addicts are just people, suffering from a mental illness with no simple fix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still an addict. An Addict will always be an addict. Addiction cannot be rid of, it can only arrested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny one who pledges is helping us all. I hope to start a charity in the future, to help spread real awareness of addiction, so more people can understand what it\u0027s like to go through it. It\u0027s not a fun ride, it\u0027s the worst thing I\u0027ve ever experienced in my life. The last thing addicts need is to feel abandoned by society. Instead we should be doing our best to help them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging right now, will help me to get awareness of my page, blog, and mission out there. This is really important, and the start is always the make or break point of a project. So please, if you can spare anything at all, I thank you with all my heart. If you aren\u0027t able to do that, then please, share my blogs / Facebook page with people you think it could help. That\u0027s most important after all. It\u0027s about helping people, help themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarrison"
