It wasn\u0027t an easy decision to quit our jobs, put all of our\u00a0stuff in storage, and leave our friends and family. But we knew we\u0027d never regret it. We wanted to document it in some way, so we decided to share this adventure through daily vlogs on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had no clue how much that decision would change our lives.\u00a0We\u0027ve now uploaded almost 500 videos and developed an amazing community on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis adventure was originally supposed to last one year... But here we are 2+ years later, and\u00a0we\u0027ve made it our personal goal to visit 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (March 20, 2019).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe debated for a LONG time about whether or not we should create a page here on Patreon. The personal battle we went through ultimately boiled down to the value we felt like we were creating. I think a lot of creative people undervalue the work they do and the impact that it can have on people\u0027s lives. Kara and I definitely did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe didn\u0027t realize the impact our videos were having on other people\u0027s lives until\u00a0we started receiving messages that said we were inspiring people to live a more positive life, encouraging people to travel internationally for the first time, and even strengthening people\u0027s marriage and family time through our videos!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea that our fun travel videos could have such an impact on people\u0027s lives still blows our minds! We\u0027ve never done anything that has had this big of an impact on so many people, and we want to keep it going.\u00a0This brings us so much joy, and we\u0027re not ready for it to end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far, thank you! We know not everyone who reads this will have the disposable income to become a patron, and we in no way \"expect\" you to contribute financially. We\u0027re more than grateful for any and all the support we receive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u0027re offering a few extra \"rewards\" to those of you who decide to become patrons, we still need everyone\u0027s support to continue this journey.\u00a0If you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to become a patron, we\u0027ll be just as happy to have your continued support on YouTube by watching, liking, commenting, and sharing our videos :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKara and Nate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
