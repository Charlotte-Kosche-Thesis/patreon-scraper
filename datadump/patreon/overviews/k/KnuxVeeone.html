    "summary": "Welcome to the chaos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dave, I write science fiction novels and host the \u2018Knux Veeone\u2019 YouTube channel. I\u2019m also responsible for Chaos Nova, a group of authors and gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur YouTube channels feature a variety of quality videos ranging from; two seasons of a modified Shadowrun 4th Edition RPG, a huge number of video game playthroughs and the occasional podcast. \u003cbr\u003eYou can also follow my journey as I build the Super Bus and drive it across Europe to Estonia. Chaos Nova has hosted three annual events known as \u0027Quake-A-thon\u0027, in which we play the Quake games to completion, raising money for Child\u2019s Play Charity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my sincerest hope that you enjoy the unique content we create. We use quality equipment to maintain a good standard when it comes to recording, but there is still a lot to learn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main aspect of Chaos Nova is the Sci-fi universe that has taken over a decade to create. \u003cbr\u003e\u2018Split Personality\u2019 and \u2018Shell-Shock\u2019 were our first releases, and soon we\u2019ll be adding \u2018The Seeker\u2019 to that list. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve created detailed maps, timelines, characters, reading samples and short-stories that will soon be available to view on our website. We also have a couple of big projects in the pipeline; audio books and a card game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are extremely fortunate to have people on-board who are passionate about the Sci-fi universe. In order to grow, we need additional funding to help us achieve our goals. We\u2019d like to hire an artist, attend conventions, and begin an advertising campaign. We want to start showing our work to a larger audience, in many accessible formats. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo show our thanks for your support, there are a number of things we want to do.\u003cbr\u003eFor any size pledge, your name will appear in the front pages of future publications and you\u2019ll receive a personal thank you from me in Super Bus videos. If you\u2019ve got a channel, a website or something to advertise, I will link it in the relevant description.\u003cbr\u003eIf you are feeling even more generous, higher tier pledges are thanked with signed copies of our work, invites to games, special gifts and ultimately, the chance to be immortalized in a future novel or series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of starting this Patreon, YouTube adverts on our channels have been disabled. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support our dreams, no reward can ever truly show our appreciation, but I hope that you enjoy our creations as much as we do when we\u2019re making them. Thank you for taking the time to read this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003eKnux and the squad at Chaos Nova\u003cbr\u003e"
