Primarily focusing on horror and urban fantasy, I take occasional side trips into westerns, romance, historical fiction, sci-fi and video game reviews. Most of what I write goes to my blog or Wattpad for free (if it doesn\u0027t wind up in the recycling bin, anyway). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to think of myself as being a little different and that I bring a unique perspective to the table, with a background that includes witches, abuse, a varied education in fields ranging from private investigation to criminal psychology to computer programming to motorcycle repair, a work history that has gone from retail register biscuit to assembly line worker to video production to manager of a television station and a voracious appetite for books, learning and education on nearly any subject. There\u0027s nothing out there that isn\u0027t somehow ripe for storytelling seeds, and I love digging through all of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to folks like yourselves, I\u0027ve had the opportunity to go from a stolen typewriter and Mario fanfiction to worldbuilding with presidential\u00a0zombies while staring out my second-floor window. That\u0027s a great accomplishment, and I thank everyone who\u0027s helped me get this far.\u003cbr\u003e"
