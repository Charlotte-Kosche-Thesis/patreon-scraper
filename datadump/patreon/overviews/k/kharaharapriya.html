    "summary": "Hello! My name is\nDorian and I tweet at @thewildestsea. For those of you who follow me\non Twitter, you\u0027ll already know my background, but I\u0027ll explain it\nhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am a young,\ndisabled parent who is non-binary and transgender. My son is 13\nmonths old, and I am married to a wonderful woman. After giving birth\nto my son, my mental and physical health worsened until I was in need\nof 24 hour care, and my wife had to give up work in order to provide\nthis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus enters the\nbenefits system, the malevolent villain of the piece. Thanks to a\nseries of government fuck-ups, bureaucratic nightmares and awful\ncrossed wires, we\u0027ve been left in the lurch by an incredibly rude and\nobstructive advisor who has halted all of our claims, leaving us to\nsurvive on almost nothing. We are in need, in a scary way that\nreminds me of being a child again, counting pennies to pay for the\nelectric meter. We do not know how we are going to feed and clothe\nand warm and house our family in the forseeable future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt has taken me a\nlong time to realise that marketable skills are not the only valuable\nskills. I am funny. I say important things, that people listen to,\nand that\u0027s crucial. I am changing the world, one step at a time. I\ndraw comics to talk about pronouns. I design tattoos. I blog loudly\nand forcefully. In the summer I will present a huge project on\nManchester\u0027s kerbs to a big room, determined to make change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am changing the\nworld.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere isn\u0027t\nsomething huge here. There isn\u0027t something that\u0027s easily marketable.\nBut if you want to contribute to supporting our family, please\nconsider a donation or a monthly amount. It could be pennies. It\nmeans a lot to me and mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you donate over\n\u00a310, please feel free to ask me for something you\u0027d like me to write\nor draw in return, and I will make sure it gets to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"
