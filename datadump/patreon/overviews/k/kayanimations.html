    "summary": "Hey guys, Kay here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out my Patreon page. It means a lot that you even considered helping out! ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Black Crystal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlack Crystal is an original anime-style web series. It follows the story of an anthromorphic boy named Kuro setting off on a journey to find his family. Along the way, he meets many new friends and enemies as he slowly discovers the truths of the world, and helps restore the balance of the warring land. Black Crystal started off with an animated film which acts as the prologue of the story. From that point on, Black Crystal will continue as an episodic game series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe Black Crystal game will be a story-focused, episodic arcade style action game. In terms of gameplay, it will be very similar to the Odin\u0027s Sphere games, where you control a character to fight hordes of enemies and bosses, while customizing your character to create the build best suited for you. There will be \"action stages\", where the gameplay is most like any arcade beat-em-up game. There are also \"quest areas\" where the game will be more close to the town hubs in other games such as Shovel Knight, where players will be able to interact with NPCs in towns, acquire and complete quests, trade with others, or even play mini games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI created the first episode entirely on my own, aside from hiring a musician and a couple voice actors using my own savings. I wanted to prove that this is not just any side project that will get dropped off to be forgotten about. I wanted to prove that I can do this, I wanted to build credibility for myself and this project, even if I had to do it all on my own first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, we do not have the budget to be able to commit to this project full time. Until further goals are met, we will have to work on developing the game or the animations on the side along with our day jobs. However, we hope that in the future, this Patreon page may continue to grow so that one day, we \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0able to commit to this project full time and bring out updates and releases much faster. So until then, we hope to have growing valued Patrons support us in addition to our current day jobs so that in the future, we will no longer need those day jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE: IF A KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN IS CREATED IN THE FUTURE, ANY PATRONAGE YOU PLEDGE WILL COUNT TOWARDS KICKSTARTER REWARDS IF YOUR TOTAL HERE EXCEEDS THE KICKSTARTER REWARD.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see where your money will go, please take a look at the goals to the left for more details! If you do decide to help out, I would truly, truly appreciate it and thank you from the bottom of my heart. It\u0027ll be entirely thanks to you that this passion project of mine can continue and be shared to the world, perhaps to become something really great in the future. And hopefully, I\u0027ll be able to return your kindness by creating work that you will love and enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do want to help support this project but do not want to commit to a monthly payment, consider checking out my Ko-fi page instead!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/kayanimations\"\u003ehttps://ko-fi.com/kayanimations\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e-Kay"
