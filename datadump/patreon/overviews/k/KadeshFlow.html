In case you have no idea who I am or what I do, I\u0027m Kadesh Flow. I\u0027m a trombone player who raps...or I\u0027m a rapper who plays trombone. Depends on whom you ask. Doesn\u0027t matter to me; I\u0027ve been doing both since I was 11.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO IS KADESH FLOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRapper with an MBA. Trombone Super Saiyan. Otaku Maven. Cosplay Padawan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say the above  on literally every tag line of everything I have, so this can be no different. I\u0027m Ryan Davis, but people who consume my songs via the internet and who attend the shows I play know me as Kadesh Flow. Ever since I coined this moniker during my sophomore year of college, friends and listeners have shortened it, calling me \"Desh\". Now, I say \"Desh\" before I do just about anything: dive into a pool, put up some solid weight at the gym, \u003cstrong\u003eor go in on a dope instrumental or seven.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI digress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to release exclusive content, sneak peaks, process information, and updates to my KF family, so I\u0027ve set up this Patreon, so that you can get everything first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU PLEDGE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA number of my listening family have asked me to provide more updates on what I\u0027m actually doing, especially when it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve put up a video or released a project (i.e. now). I\u0027m traveling all over the place playing shows, but I\u0027m not releasing anything new. That makes both you and I sad, because I really would love for you to hear the things that I\u0027m creating. There\u0027s so much. Honestly, creating the content isn\u0027t the problem. Perfecting it and effectively promoting it, grabbing more merchandise, and doing everything to ensure that I can elevate my creative career by putting great, high quality content in front of more and more people gets expensive, especially when I\u0027ve released most of my work for free up to this point. That\u0027s where I need your help, and in exchange for your love and pledges, I\u0027ll get you in on the scoop. I can\u0027t wait to share these things with you! I\u0027ll be releasing at least two songs per month. Some will be early releases.\u003cstrong\u003e Some will only be available here\u003c/strong\u003e.

For example, I\u0027m a cosplay padawan. I can\u0027t sew. I don\u0027t do as well with lessons as I do when I buy a piece of production equipment and then take some time to learn it. This would help me get started with solid equipment such as a sewing machine and fabrics, etc. I also have awesome animation ideas that I don\u0027t have time or funding to learn, especially in relation to coding for animation. Classes for these verses teaching myself everything would immensely expedite the process of me adding cool animated aspects to the things I deliver to you!",
