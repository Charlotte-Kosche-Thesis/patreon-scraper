    "summary": "You happen to have stumbled upon Killrob. Once working within nuclear physics designing and building detectors for particle accelerator experiments, nowadays I am designing and building software at Camshaft Software as my full time job in Wellington, New Zealand, creating an awesome game called Automation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a hobby I\u0027ve taken up making YouTube videos for more than just Automation\u0027s YouTube channel. On KillrobPlays I create let\u0027s plays intertwined with a smattering of game design and balance commentary. I strive to provide non-lazy, entertaining let\u0027s plays for people who enjoy the odd games I happen to showcase and comment on. That is anything from the ARPG classic Diablo 2, over some modern tycoon and simulation games like... for example, uhh, Automation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really would like to see community interaction grow around the channel. So far I\u0027m able to respond to basically every comment on YouTube, but probably it is about time to start my own discord channel, too. As I\u0027m much better at communicating with few people at a time rather than with larger groups, the discord channel will remain patreon-supporter only. I want to properly engage with and respond to you without the noise typical of public channels. Thoughtful talks are most welcome if you have the time and quick chats aren\u0027t harmful either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a very long time now I a semi-professional photographer and have \nsuccessfully taught this craft in courses I put together myself. New \nZealand is a paradise for landscape photography, which I love to do, \nshare, and discuss. So if you happen to not only like my YouTube work \nbut want discuss some good old photography and get quality feedback, \nconsider those tiers which include the photo corner access. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChoosing to support me will aid me in continuing to deliver great content to the channel. Considering how much time and effort it takes that indeed would make it sustainable in the long run. I\u0027m having a lot of fun doing what I do and would love to continue that with your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If all that sounds like something you might might want to support, please check out my content and maybe consider supporting me with a dollar a month in case you like it. Cheers!\u003cbr\u003e"
