She also wrote things and some of these things seemed to make other people very happy! She liked making people happy! But she was also very poor and frequently used the same leaves to make 2-4 progressively weaker pots of tea throughout the day, so she started a patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, but really; writing silly stories is never gonna be my full time job, nor would I want it to be. That said, I got a real kick out of How to make Various Teas; Volume 1, and I wouldn\u0027t mind continuing the series. There could be a whole collection of different Teas of Disappointment, alone! But while the writing is quick; layout, getting myself to the printshop, dragging out the sewing machine.... all that stuff takes time (mostly it\u0027s the layout that takes time). \u003cbr\u003eAt some point, I\u0027ll probably get tired of tea recipes. I\u0027ll warn everyone well in advance, and then, if this is actually bringing in some amount of income (even if it\u0027s just a very small amount of income) it\u0027ll morph into the next thing. Maybe the Doves will start writing again, if they think it\u0027ll buy them some fancy seed! Who knows. I suspect that is some time off. In the meantime, I\u0027ll write 3-7 recipes a week as long as someone is paying me to do so (and maybe even if no one is). \u003cbr\u003e"
