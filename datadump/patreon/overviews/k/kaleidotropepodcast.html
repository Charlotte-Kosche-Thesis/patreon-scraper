No archive warnings apply.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKaleidotrope Podcast is a queer romantic comedy podcast set on a slightly magical college campus and playing around with romance tropes, particularly fanfiction tropes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plot centers around Drew and Harrison, two reluctant college radio co-hosts-turned-accidental-advice-givers who find themselves in the middle of the campus\u2019s oldest mystery: Do happy endings really happen at Sidlesmith? Can you really find your trope?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if the magic \u003cem\u003eisn\u2019t\u003c/em\u003e real, what does that mean for two polar opposites who find themselves falling for each other twice a week for half an hour on a suddenly popular radio show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKaleidotrope will premiere on June 15, and new episodes will be posted on the 15th and 30th of every month until we\u0027re done! The series consists of nine thirty-minute episodes, and is a self-contained story. No cliffhanger ahoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho are all of you magnificent tropers?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKaleidotrope is co-created, co-written, co-produced, and co-directed by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bookshop.tumblr.com/\"\u003eAja\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://earlgreytea68.tumblr.com/\"\u003eEarlGreyTea68\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0027s a lot of co-s but so far they still like each other. Aja and EGT are long-time fangirls who are active participants on fandoms of all sorts (their overlap is Inception, but they\u0027ve got fic in Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Sherlock, and various anime and RPF fandoms; check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/Aja/pseuds/Aja\"\u003eAja\u0027s fic\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/earlgreytea68/pseuds/earlgreytea68\"\u003eEGT\u0027s fic\u003c/a\u003e).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKaleidotrope is an homage to the tropes that make Aja and EGT love fic so much. Aja made sure it has a plot, and EGT made sure it has a happy ending, and they both agreed that it had to have a lot of banter, fluff, and unbearably sweet romance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe two main characters, Drew and Harrison, are portrayed by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.jamesevansactor.com/\"\u003eJames Evans\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6251351/\"\u003eMatthew Menendez\u003c/a\u003e. They\u0027re the best and every day Aja and EGT exchange at least one message about how they\u0027re the luckiest writers in the universe that they got these two amazing actors to say their words.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur gorgeous header art is by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://joyyangart.com/\"\u003eJoy Yang\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want Kaleidotrope to remain part of the fannish ecosystem out of which it was created, which means we will never have ads, or join a podcasting network, or market it to an audience that might not understand it. That means that if you love Kaleidotrope, we are relying on you to both get the word out around fandom and tell people that it exists, and to pick up this universe and run with it, make it your own and expand the world by telling all the Sidlesmith stories we don\u0027t have room/time for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that said, we could still use a bit of money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat will you use the money for?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur actors! We think our actors are incredible and we hope you do, too, so right now every single penny pledged on this Patreon is split evenly between James and Matthew. We\u0027ve paid them a standard industry rate for an audio drama, but we don\u0027t think that rate equals the love, joy, and generosity in their performances. That would be impossible to quantify but we\u0027re inviting you to help us try! If you love our actors as much as we love our actors, we\u0027d love for you to show it by subscribing. In addition to supporting two fabulous actors, we\u0027ll give you some presents (see below)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDid you say presents?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eWe did!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve never pledged a Patreon before, here\u0027s how it works: You sign up to support us for however much you want to. Our structure on the Patreon is an amount per episode. You can go as big or as small as you like, and depending on how much you give, you qualify for different rewards. We have rewards like bonus fics and commentaries but also we will be using the subscription total (among other factors) to gauge demand for bonus episodes and a second season. If an ongoing subscription isn\u0027t the right model for you but you\u0027d still like to buy our actors some Samoas, you can make a one-time donation at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/V7V69RYB\"\u003eour Ko-Fi\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThank you for listening to Kaleidotrope!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eWe really hope you enjoy our show and we hope it inspires you to tell your own stories and find your trope!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
