    "summary": "Hello, my name is Kisabel Demure. I am a Professional and Freelance Model in Orlando, Tampa, Palm Beach, and Miami. \u003cbr\u003eThere is so much meaning behind each photo I present to my portfolio of work. In each pose, and each dramatic and intense, yet sultry stare, I feel enlightened once that camera, which I call my best friend, captures me. \u003cbr\u003eI truly believe life is inspired by art, not the other way around, because if it weren\u0027t for cinematic, intense moments, life would not have much meaning. \u003cbr\u003eI have always been an artist, since I was a little girl. I would day dream, draw and paint all day long, whenever I got the chance. I dreamt I would be a famous artist and rock star some day, and drew pictures of me with my band, with our unique fashionionable outfits on. I would draw superheroes, and vigilantes like Catwoman, and Batman, color them in, and cut them out so that they became real. I eventually sold them in elementary school for $2 each, to make some money for my family. \u003cbr\u003eI always was a quiet girl, very sweet to the point where anything would make my chunky freckled cheeks grin very big, because I was always very sensitive to what people felt around me. \u003cbr\u003eThese qualities and dreams, and ideas, never left me. They thrive in me today, and through my photos, so I am told, and I like to believe. I thus encorporated poetry in my lifestyle, recording with words what I felt and saw around me. I knew I saw the world in a very real yet ethereal sense. A slight contradiction of Intellect and Physical. I feel without these qualities, I would not be fully committed to living a lifestyle of an Artist and Model. \u003cbr\u003eMy father was a projectionist at one point in his life for a while, when I was around 7 to 10 years old. He was a direct influence of showing me art. Movies, films, ideas, beliefs, lifestyles.... He took me up to the projectionist room and left me there to watch movies, and told me, that someday, I would be the big star. Regardless of growing up in a poor home where there was not much food to eat, I was going to be fed through movies; that Art would feed my soul, through finding beauty in the sadness, because that is all what it is about. \u003cbr\u003eThrough him, and through my natural fondness of drawing and creating innumerable drawings of people, beautiful women, handsome men, superheroes, a slight false reality filled my mind from a child, and thus never left me. \u003cbr\u003eYou can say I am the girl that never grew up, and I do not have intentions to changing my young spirit anytime soon. I learned respect, honor, and responsibility from a young age, thus leading me to create my own future. \u003cbr\u003eNow I am at a point where I am a Full- Time Freelance Model, and though not International yet, I will not stop until I get where I need to keep going. I love Modeling, and it makes me feel alive, I sometimes feel the camera, the lens, the Iris of the Lens, is the only thing that understands me. \u003cbr\u003eI want to give to the world, and leave an impression that, \"no matter what art will sustain us.\" This is what kept me going through all of my heartaches and woes. The love of music and photos and feelings, have brought me to some sense of perfection. We must embrace our imperfections, because they are what makes us perfect. \u003cbr\u003eI ask you to join me on my journey, to growth, self discovery, and creation. \u003cbr\u003eI love what I do, and I for sure want you to love what I do, because without you, my art would not mean anything; with you, it means Everything. \u003cbr\u003e"
