I will be photographing everything, sketching, painting, and so much more. I want to share the world I find around each corner. I want to show life, beauty, culture, balanced chaos, and how we all are part of one life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jo and I have worked as a freelance artist since 2005. I have studied art as a profession for nearly two decades, during much of which I have also been at university, receiving multiple Bachelors of Fine Art degrees in Sequential Art (minor in Printmaking) and Performing Arts (with a minor in dance.) I am currently wrapping up my Masters of Fine Arts in Photography and have set my sights on an extended, post-graduate project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I will travel internationally, and possibly domestic, spending time to take photos, create live streams on location. When I come back to the states I will create paintings and illustrations among\u00a0other art work. Every 3 to 4 months I spend time at various printmaking studios crafting printmaking series that will be developed into artful collections representing the travel quests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~ Subquest #2: Perks ~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerks of becoming a Patron and part of the adventure:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Be a part of the adventure with me\u003cbr\u003e* Help decide printmaking styles\u003cbr\u003e* Early access to artwork, sketches, videos, and blog stories\u003cbr\u003e* Unique photos and access for download and print\u003cbr\u003e* Sneak peek photo sent directly to your Instagram or Facebook while I am traveling\u003cbr\u003e* Instant photo taken and mailed while adventuring\u003cbr\u003e* Google hangouts and tutorials of your choice\u003cbr\u003e* Prints and original artwork\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons can look forward to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you tweets, \u003cbr\u003eInstagram dedications, \u003cbr\u003eFacebook shoutouts,\u003cbr\u003eand many, many more demonstrations of my appreciation and affection. \u003cbr\u003eMaybe even a silly video or two where you can decide what happens. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause what kind of adventure would it be if friends aren\u2019t along for the ride?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~ Subquest #3: You want to know more? Okay, Proceed ~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my freelance career, I have been involved with community service, charity organisations, performance groups, magazines, newspapers, online publications, and more. My photography, designs, and fine art have won awards on the local and regional level as well as my art selling both nationally and internationally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Summer 2015 I had the opportunity to study abroad in Lacoste, France, immersing myself in my photography, teaching, working and creating.  The experience was overwhelmingly fulfilling personally and creatively.  I knew even before I left France that creating and working in this way was my calling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the spirit of this and my soon-to-be-found freedom, I am taking a giant leap of faith.  I am packing up my life and dedicating myself to traveling the world and creating artwork from the experiences I have over the next two years.  Each month I will travel and record what I find - people, places, landscapes, culture, architecture - and share it all with you.  No matter where I travel, locally, nationally or internationally, the goal remains the same: share the beauty of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe milestones set for this project are designed to help upgrade old equipment and order rare supplies.  The higher we reach, the greater my ability to create through extended techniques in my own studio space.  Eventually, this will lead to exhibitions of the printmaking pieces and fine art photographic prints, as well as bound collections, art books, and other unique works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want the world to experience this ongoing project with me - but I want to make sure they also know how you are a major part of the great adventures ahead!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~ Subquest #4: Quest Guide - join me! ~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent calendar missions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 2017: Spain and Italy with Cristin - Atlanta Trip\u003cbr\u003eMarch 2017: Hong Kong with Christy\u003cbr\u003eApril 2017: Bali with Freya\u003cbr\u003eMay 2017: PRINTMAKING TIME \u003cbr\u003eJune 2017: Exploring America\u003cbr\u003eJuly 2017: France with Jennifer, be in a wedding in the states, SDCC, Florida \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAugust 2017: TBD - Atlanta Trip \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeptember 2017: Germany with Cristin and DragonCon\u003cbr\u003eOctober 2017: PRINTMAKING TIME\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNovember 2017: TBD - Atlanta Trip \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDecember 2017: Hawaii with Rebecca\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJanuary 2018: France for Angouleme Comic Festival\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 2018: PRINTMAKING TIME\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMarch 2018: TBD\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApril 2018: Japan with Calvin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMay 2018: TBD\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJune 2018: PRINTMAKING TIME\u003cbr\u003eJuly 2018: Paris with Cristin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAugust 2018: TBD\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeptember 2018: Dragon Con\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOctober 2018: TBD\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNovember 2018: PRINTMAKING TIME\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDecember 2018: TBD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eReach out to me and let me know if you want to travel with me on any trip or give recommendations for the \"TBD\" months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~*~\u003cbr\u003eJojo"
