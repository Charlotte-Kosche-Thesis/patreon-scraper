    "summary": "Dear friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n did it. I took the leap. I\u2019m doing music full-time now. It\u2019s scary, to \nbe honest. That jump. What if there are rocks at the bottom? What if I \nbreak my leg? What if I, ya know, die? (I\u2019m trying to postpone that \nbit.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut\u2026 What if there isn\u2019t? What if there\u2019s something far \nbetter just waiting for me to finally just let go, throw caution and \nplanning and foresight and fear to the wind and dive into these dreams? \nMaybe, just maybe, there\u2019s a world of connection and creativity just \nbeyond what\u2019s proper and suitable and safe. As a recovering worrier, an \noverthinker, an introverted and shy little scaredy cat, doing this isn\u2019t\n natural. But ever since I was a tiny thing, it\u2019s always been of the \nutmost importance to me that I dive headlong into anything that scares \nme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m in the freefall. A trust fall. And I haven\u2019t died or anything. So far, so good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\n those of you who believe in me and support this dream, I just want you \nto know that all of this would literally be impossible without you. \nThank you so much. You\u2019re beautiful, and you make the world more \nbeautiful, and that\u2019s amazing, and you\u2019re amazing, and one of my degrees\n is in English but I still love run-on sentences and no piece of paper \nis going to change that. But I digress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you have asked how\n you can help me. Y\u2019all know that music is this exquisite, fickle muse, \nworthy beyond words, but the industry side is hard, and a girl\u2019s gotta \neat. (Thank you for getting that, by the way.) In answer to that \ninsightful and pragmatic inquiry, I gratefully accept donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\n do NOT owe me. I know that. I respect that. Any connection in which one\n person owes the other is always awkward, stilted, unnatural. I don\u2019t \nwant that, anyway. I don\u2019t like owing anybody, and I don\u2019t want anybody \nfeeling weird or guilted into this. But I do want to open a door to \nanyone who wants to enter. People \u2013 so many people \u2013 keep telling me to \nallow people to be a blessing to me. I\u2019ve always felt more comfortable \ngiving to others rather than receiving, but I\u2019m trying to learn how to \nbe more open to it. This is a big step in that direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal \nis to keep creating art and personally sharing it with you all, and I\u2019d \nlike to provide an opportunity for you to be a part of that by \ncontributing to the \u201cDon\u2019t Let Kristan Starve\u201d fund, AKA my account on \nPatreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s a safe and secure way to directly contribute to the \ncreation of the songs I write to share with you, to the travel expenses \nof coming to sing them to you in person, to recording full studio songs \nand good videos and all sorts of adventures I can\u2019t wait to share with \nyou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\n if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to go through Patreon, you\u2019re also welcome \nto make a donation through PayPal or in the form of a good meal, a hug, a\n funny story, or some useful advice. Those things are super important \nand useful, too. You\u2019re important and useful whether you donate or not \u2013\n that\u2019s the big thing here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u2019s it. I\u2019m doing this. Trust fall time\u2026 Here goes everything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours with love,\u003cbr\u003e Kristan"
