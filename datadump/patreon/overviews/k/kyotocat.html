A few of you may know me as kyotocat. \u003cbr\u003efull-time\u00a0traveling model / artist / nomad / dreamer / adventurer.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eI travel around the world creating and exploring.\u003cbr\u003eMany fans have been asking me to see more.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cem\u003eThis patreon is a fantastic way for you to support those endeavors, and in return, get access to all of the art and a very intimate peek into my world.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiving into modeling and making the road my home has been such an adventure... allowing me a form of expression and reflection that has been fulfilling and creatively expansive in ways I could have never anticipated. And I am so grateful it has given me the ability to pursue further education in permaculture and sustainability-- from taking courses on a farm in the jungles of Northern Thailand, to helping design a plan for a kung-fu permaculture retreat, to raising earthquake relief funds for friends in Nepal to rebuild their home and education center. Continuing on this journey of constantly learning, growing, and evolving--as an individual, and in turn, collectively--to be more aware in order to more positively and effectively contribute to a lighter, more intelligent, more beautiful way of living on the earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy travels have taken me all over the world; giving me the opportunity to work with artists in Europe, South East Asia, Japan, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Meeting and connecting with some of the most amazing and kind people from all walks of life, whom I may have never met otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e Enlightening each other, cultivating trust and compassion, getting as close as possible to vulnerability. THIS is the sweet stuff of life. This is what draws me in. What motivates me. What inspires me. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what\u0027s been (and continues to be) a profoundly humbling experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is only through the support of fellow artists and fans alike that I have been able to do this. So THANK YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK, ALL OF YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e For trusting and believing.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to give patreon a try because it seems like it is truly revolutionizing art patronage and will hopefully allow me a space to connect with a tighter-knit community on a deeper level. With people who respect and appreciate the nude body in all its beauty and truth. With people who appreciate empowered sexuality, and the freedom of expression.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be a space to breathe. \u003cbr\u003eTo share.\u003cbr\u003eTo create. \u003cbr\u003eTo experiment. \u003cbr\u003eTo be silly and absurd. \u003cbr\u003eTo inspire. \u003cbr\u003eTo educate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA space to be unpredictable.
