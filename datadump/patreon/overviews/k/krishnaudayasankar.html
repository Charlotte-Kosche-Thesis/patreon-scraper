Other than a lot of happy tail wags, you get to read poems, short stories and extracts from works-in-progress that have not been published anywhere, and are not available on any public domain. IE: Exclusive access.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I will also \u0027write for treats\u0027 - that is, I will be coming up with other goodies that you can avail of when you make a particular one-time pledge - think of it like commissioning me to write for you and you alone, but the money goes to a bunch of furry fuzzies. And that, is just the beginning of many exciting things that I hope to bring to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and welcome to\u00a0words for woofs. Happy reading! :)"
