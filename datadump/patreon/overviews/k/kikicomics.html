    "summary": "My name is Kiki, it has always been a goal of mine to do comics. In 2010 I came up with an idea for a comic, and since then I have been working on three comics that will eventually all intertwine together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://demonwings.thecomicseries.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDemon Wings\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://shards-of-the-heart.thecomicseries.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShards of the Heart\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://oceanlabyrinth.thecomicseries.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOcean Labyrinth\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for this Patreon is to give people an early access to pages, they will be uploaded here as soon as I finish them, rather than waiting for them to be released once a week. Another reason is that I have a baby who is formula fed, and that adds up. Right now the comics are a hobby, but I would like to do more with them. Anyone who is a patron will automatically get access to certain artworks that unlock at $1 and up, along with concept art, spoilers, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now the comic I am focused on most is Demon Wings, but I will be posting updates for my other two comics here as well, along with random artwork I do. Once the current arc for Demon Wings is done, it will be available in book form (if you already pledged for a book on my IndieGogo, you will automatically receive a copy).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a very long plan for all these comics, they will not be ending anytime soon. Demon Wings has been going since 2012, and I still have another arc to tell after the one I am working on now. Shards of the Heart is a spiritual sequel, and Ocean Labyrinth is another long story, but will be connected."
