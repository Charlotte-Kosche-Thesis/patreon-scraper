    "summary": "I was exposed to art and creativity at an early\nage.  As a child, my summers were spent\neither at camp or playing around my dad\u0027s stained glass studio. \u00a0Although for many years I worked\nin other fields ranging from managing retail to advertising, my passion has\nalways been for art and nature.  Over the\nyears, I have taught art classes ranging from ceramics, to sculpture, to\npainting and spend my summers volunteering with children\u2019s camps.  For over a decade, I have enjoyed sharing\nmy work at a variety of art festivals, fairs, galleries, and restaurants. My work is in private collections across the US, Europe, and Canada. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0My paintings each explore symbolism thru images of nature, fantasy and geometric\nshapes. Mandalas and trees are both often\nshowcased in my paintings.  To me,\nthe mandalas represent balance, harmony and unity. They are symbolic of the\nuniverse. Trees represent life and growth. They are a symbolic of wisdom,\nstrength, beauty, and protection. Many other images also find symbolism in my paintings.  My paintings combine a variety of\ntechniques and bright colors giving the paintings an energetic and vivid look,\nas if the light is glowing through them. \nThe structured geometric patterns next to the more free forms of nature\nand whimsy invite the viewer to experience the joy I finds in life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons would help me spend more time focusing on my art and less time trying to afford to create it. \u00a0I love painting and creating. \u00a0Although I enjoy painting in public and doing shows, I don\u0027t like the amount of time I have to devote to finding venues to sell my art to be able to continue creating it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;header\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;What Is Patreon?\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt;Patreon is the best way for creators to earn ongoing funding directly from their fans.For patrons, Patreon is a way to pay your favorite creators for making the stuff you love.  Instead of \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pledge a few dollars a month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly, and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.  That\u2019s right.  Imagine \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, in a long frilly white wig, painted on a 10-foot canvas on the wall of a Victorian mansion.  And imagine your favorite creators \u003cem\u003emaking a living\u003c/em\u003e doing what they do best\u2026 because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the right are pledge levels. \u00a0You can pledge to give as little or as much as you want, and you can change it each month. And best of all you get great rewards for you pledges. \u00a0For instance, if you want to pledge just $1 each month, you will get a discount in my online store AND get to see exclusive patron content, like photos of the creation of a painting, insights into the symbolism of the painting, I\u0027ll even tell you where I buy my supplies if you want. \u00a0If you want to contribute $300 in a month you get a whole list of rewards including a painting of your choice up to 24\"X30\" (you can even commission one.) \u00a0And there are many other levels too. \u00a0Do you want a new mandala coloring sheet each month? \u00a0I\u0027ve got that! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, long story short. \u00a0Your funding, helps me spend more time focusing on doing what I love, CREATING ART!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
