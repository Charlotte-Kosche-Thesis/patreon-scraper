    "summary": "Hello all! My name is Rachel, or knighsrachel around here on the interwebs.\u003cbr\u003eSo now that you\u0027ve stumbled across my page here on the wide world of Patreon, why not stay and see what it\u0027s all about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello to my fellow Ratchets, I know that you\u0027re probably wondering what this is all about.\u003cbr\u003e-Why has Rachel started a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e-What could Rachel possibly need money for?\u003cbr\u003e-What if I can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to donate?\u003cbr\u003e-What\u0027s the plan here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is to help me explain to you why I\u0027m doing this and how you can help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for longer than I can comprehend, but I\u0027ve been posting on Wattpad for 6 years now. Through my time on Wattpad, I\u0027ve been experimenting with different genres and storytelling methods, and it\u0027s really helped me to grow as a writer with the feedback I receive from you wonderful people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy niche now seems to be Teen Fiction \u0026amp; Young Adult Contemporary. I find that I enjoy writing about this age group and their daily, life struggles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Have You Started A Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith this Patreon and your support, it opens up the possibilities of MORE UPDATES. I know, a crazy idea. But without the hassle of putting my time and focus into less important things, I\u0027ll be able to create new chapters, more frequently. Which means new stories!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Could You Possibly Need Money For?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt seems ludicrous that writing on a free site to produce stories leads to me asking for monthly donations.\u003cbr\u003eI know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with recent setbacks and hardcore life-evaluating sessions, I\u0027ve come to realize that I can\u0027t do this author thing on my own. I\u0027m going to need some help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a difficult time writing in my home-setting. It\u0027s not that there\u0027s anything wrong with my home, I just tend to experience writer\u0027s block,\u003cbr\u003eThis led to the idea of going to Panera Bread every morning, one of my favorite writing joints. I\u0027d get myself a morning pastry and a drink and sit for the next few hours, writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s the problem?\u003cbr\u003eThis is a very costly habit. My food budget is completely out-of-control due to my daily trips to Panera. And so I wanted to find a better way to put my money to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money from the Patreon will be used for three things (mostly).\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne objective is to hire a professional editor to help me restructure some of my more prominent works. By doing so, I\u0027m more likely to be noticed in the publishing world, giving my works a better chance to be on your bookshelves.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd ultimately, one day, I\u0027d like to start renting an office space. After speaking with several other authors, I\u0027ve discovered that a lot of them rent out personal, office spaces to do their writing in. That way they\u0027re away from home but they\u0027re still in an environment that\u0027s all their own.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eMy main objective, however, is to hire an editor. This is crucial to furthering my career outside of Wattpad. As you may have guessed, my goal in life is to be a published author. And I have to invest time and money to get there.\u003cbr\u003eI have the time, but not exactly the necessary funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money will not be going to my personal, monthly budget. None of this money will be used (for instance) to pay my credit card bills, to buy makeup, or to finance Netflix Account. This money will strictly be used to further my writing career.\u003cbr\u003eJust to be clear, I do not need this money to pay myself a salary. It\u0027s strictly for business purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat If I Can\u0027t /Don\u0027t Want To Donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is absolutely fine! Please do not feel like you have to donate to this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eThis is a completely optional service to help me further my writing career. So please, only donate if you can or if you want to directly contribute to my works being published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support me but can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to join my Patreon, please just continue reading my works on Wattpad. Your comments and votes help me put my name out there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What\u0027s The Plan Here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short term, I\u0027m going to continue updating on Wattpad as usual. Weekly updates will continue as always.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the long term, I have a lot of goals I\u0027ve set for myself that I need your help in achieving.\u003cbr\u003eI want to:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eProduce better quality work\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdate more frequently\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire a professional editor to review my work\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd eventually, work my way into the publishing industry.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaybe even one day rent my own office space.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWorking on these goals alongside my Patreon will allow me to continue to produce works for my Wattpad, where you can access them for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s All Folks!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m incredibly grateful that you came to my Patreon page and heard me out. It really means a lot to me to have such a loving and supporting audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you choose to come along this journey with me as I venture out into the next chapter of my life.\u003cbr\u003eAnd in whatever capacity you support me, thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you donate to the patreon or just read my works on Wattpad, please hear my sincere thanks. You all are wonderful and beautiful people.\u003cbr\u003e"
