Well, all my life I love to draw.. it would be strange if not, right? But you know, my life builded so many obstacles on my my way..\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s start from the very begginig. I don\u0027t try to make myself too importrant, just trying to explain what \"artist\" word means for me exactley. \u003cbr\u003eWhen I was born, my mother and I almost die .. yeah, it\u0027s true ^^ How does this take affect for my \"artist\u0027s\" way? Well, From the very begginig of my life my eyes were injured, and untill 6-8 years around I could not see normally with my right eye. It can not see the perspective and amount of objects. Yeah, sh * t happens ^^ But I started to draw .. Most it was lines and something looks like girls .. with swords .. I never loved princesses xD\u003cbr\u003eAnd my long and hard way to \"artist\" began.. \u003cbr\u003eWhat we have? A girl, who can\u0027t actually use her right eye want to be an artist.. I was drawing so many characters, they all had their own unic story and life, I made some silly comixes, but they were so important for me.. Just some storyes about strange birds and long way to home.. I don\u0027t remmember details, but now I think they were silly xD\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u0027s too much from childhood, right? Let\u0027s go next ^^\u003cbr\u003eSchool, college, university .. That was really fast. Job, Some people just became traitors, some - jerks, and some - dead .. It\u0027s life and it\u0027s almost most of time is a s * ck. Is it like a teenager emo, yeah? XD\u003cbr\u003eHow it connected to my \"artist\u0027s way\" ? Well, not so directly... I didn\u0027t draw really long time, years.. And after last person who belive in me and told me to not quit with drawing died, my life just turned to dark. Well, if be honest, I am really depressive person, and that was the last headshot for me. I lost my job, I lost people who I really loved, and I lost the reason for life. I really was close to bad dicigns.. And I actually don\u0027t know how I solved it. And.. in August last year, it was 2016, I decide to not to stop.Why should I be so weak and depressive? Noone will tell me \"thank you\" if I just push everything away and my life ends like in really bad movies.\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you think that was all my trobles, well.. it\u0027s not ^^\u003cbr\u003e2017 is really bad year xD It\u0027s start with a severe pain in my wrist in the middle of night 16th january. Do you know this date? No xD But I know.. It\u0027s my birthday xD\u003cbr\u003eAnd this day started a long and painfull 3 months I tryed to heal my hand, nothing helped, I couldn\u0027t draw, but I tryed.. And that were really hell months for me..\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the end, after my wrist finally was healed, well, not for forever, just for a few months untill it will hurts again, and again for all my life, (I am so lucky, yeah xD) I finnaly can call myself an artist. And do you know why? No, not becouse of that long and hard way.. becourse i want to be an artist ^^\u003cbr\u003eYeah, so simple. It is my dream to be an artist, so why I can\u0027t?\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you if you read all this strange text ^w^\u003cbr\u003eHave a wonderfull life, never stop dreaming and remmember - No Pain - No Gain xD\u003cbr\u003eAlso, sorry for my terrible English ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--Your\u0027s\u003cstrong\u003e KiJaein\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
