Thanks so much for making your way to my cozy little corner of Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have loved entertaining people through writing and art for as long as I can remember. Recently, I decided to try and branch out to a broader audience than my friends ( politely coerced into reading my material for ages) at their suggestion. That\u0027s what lead me to the creation of this page. I won\u0027t twist anyone\u0027s arm for support, as my over all goal is to enthrall people with magical tales, but any contribution that could be made would be absolutely \u003cem\u003efantastic! \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0With any help from you willing contributors out there, I could take care of some upgrades that would really help the production of my series \u003cem\u003eGods and Dragons\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0run quickly and smoothly. \u00a0That aside, I hope you enjoy the novels and related art to come!\u00a0"
