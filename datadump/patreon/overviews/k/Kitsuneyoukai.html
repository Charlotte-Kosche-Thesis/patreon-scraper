I\u0027ve been drawing for a long time, and I\u0027d like to keep doing it. I can keep making furry art forever, as fast as possible, as long as I can pay the bills with it! This patreon account exists so I don\u0027t have to waste my time doing anything else to make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will your money be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll continue making lots of fun and interesting furry comics, primarily! 5 pages / month + extra pictures whenever I have time.\u003cbr\u003eI have plenty of ideas that I have yet to do, and it would be so good to make them all into comics and share them! I would greatly appreciate anything you\u0027d choose to give.\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions allow me to pay rent and to buy food without a second job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of rewards will you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big thank you! :b It\u0027ll make me really happy to know you\u0027re on board, and each and every dollar helps.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to contribute $8 or more monthly, you\u0027ll also get exclusive access to my google drive, where I store every comic page as a WIP so that you can see what\u0027s going to happen ahead of most people. You\u0027ll get the comic pages in the draft stage, inked stage, character-color stage, and fully-colored stage without text. I also stash WIPs of single pictures in there along with an update list with links to the new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll always continue to upload \u003cstrong\u003eall \u003c/strong\u003emy content for free on Inkbunny when it\u0027s fully completed.
