    "summary": "Content creation can\nbe a time consuming and expensive process. Especially if you\u0027re doing it all\nyourself, which in this case, I am. Before it was simply streaming content as\nit increasingly became easier to simply turn on a stream, play a game and talk\nto my audience. But as time went on I felt it was time to do more and give more\nto the community that has continued to support me over the years. The trade off\nis that maintaining the ability to do this and continue to do it full-time,\nisn\u0027t cheap. A lot of people in the community realize this and have always\nwondered what the best way was to support me in pursuing this full-time and the\nanswer is simple; Patreon\u2026 at least for now anyway.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nI want to be able to\ncontinue to do this full time and expand the volume of the content I create.\nThe community deserves more. And simply put. Patreon is the best option for me\nto be able to pursue the expansion of that content with fewer worries of financial\nproblems taking me away from putting my all into content creation. This also\nallows me more freedom to create the content that I want without worry of being\npunished financially simply because it didn\u2019t agree with advertisers standards.\nWhich is what has happened to so many youtubers these days hence why many of\nthem have either left the platform or chosen crowd funded avenues such as\nPatreon to make ends meet. I want to be able to make great content without\nhaving to pledge loyalty to any corporation just to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis isn\u0027t me trying\nto strike it rich and become the most popular content creator. This is me\nsimply wanting to pursue my dream of taking my love of video games, anime, the\npeople behind them and critical thinking, sharing that love with the world and\nbe able to make a living while doing it. And should you choose to support me\nthrough patreon, you insure that I get one step closer to making that dream a\nreality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: You can set limits for these in case you are concerned about going over budget\u003c/strong\u003e"
