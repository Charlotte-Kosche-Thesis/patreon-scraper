    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi. I\u0027m Kelly King. \u003c/strong\u003eSome of you call me k.k. I\u0027ve been making dances, teaching dances, asking people to dance with me, and performing since I was 15. \u00a0In all these years, one thing remains constant; my work is considered a hobby by many of the people I encounter. (Sad, I know.) Yet, I bring joy. It\u0027s my motto: #walkwithjoy \u003cem\u003eBut this is a job, a creative career.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can bring a lot more joy to a vastly larger audience if I can sustain myself through this art rather than working random jobs that bring zero joy and produce zero dance. Here\u0027s where you come in... this web-site makes it possible for you to support me on a monthly basis. Sounds weird and new, but it\u0027s not a new concept at all. Back in the day, artists had patrons. And patrons supported artists. I\u0027m asking you to support me. Your support is a commitment to the arts, to me, and through me - to Contradiction Dance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou are buying time. Time to create. Time to teach. Time to plan. Time to collaborate. Time to share. What? All that? How?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerformance: \u003c/strong\u003eOften I get asked to perform - as a soloist, or for my company. For free. I love performing, but for free? Do you go to your job for free? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink about this: It takes about 1 hour to generate 1 minute of choreography. It takes about 1 hour to teach that one minute to others. It takes about 1 hour of rehearsal time to get that 1 minute to a second draft. It takes another hour to make that 1 minute worth watching. It takes ANOTHER hour to make that one minute memorable. Let\u0027s see, that\u0027s.... FIVE HOURS of work for ONE MINUTE of choreography worth remembering. For a 60 minute performance, it takes about 300 hours of work. Not to mention the costume design, light design, programs, advertising, marketing, etc. 300 hours. For free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce 2 full concerts a season (600 hours of work); and have for the past seven years. At a minimum. You might say I have an insatiable need to create and share dance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou would be correct.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I also have kids. Three of them. And a husband. None of them (whether they know it or not) want me to work for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I don\u0027t. I teach. I choreograph for others (theaters, films). I work with businesses to bring movement into the corporate culture. I consult with schools and teach academic teachers how to integrate the arts into their core curriculum. I do all these things. And, I love them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYet, at the end of the day. I\u0027m still working (a lot) for free.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis must end.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention the others. (WHAT OTHERS?!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe dancers who want to perform for and with me. They depend on me for opportunity. They, too, need support. Through me, they earn a rehearsal stipend and performance pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support and commitment will buy me time to continue my life\u0027s work and support the work of many others.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing is free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your support, I will give you sneak peeks into my process - that I have NEVER allowed before. See, I don\u0027t like people in the kitchen with me when I\u0027m cooking; and, well, making a dance is a lot like cooking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT, I\u0027m inviting you. I\u0027m inviting you in to see the messy process unfold. To watch me work. To see the creative process unfold, refold, remix, and emerge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will get weekly updates via video dispatches from rehearsal. You\u0027ll see photos. You\u0027ll get to ask questions. You\u0027ll get answers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the least I can do, but the most you can ask. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSharing my process is hard. Very hard. But I need your support. I need you now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease join me. Make a commitment. Help me continue this work. Today.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, let\u0027s DANCE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: right;\"\u003ePhoto\u0027s by Michael J Avilez, Danisha Crosby, Mark Soriano, Paul Frederiksen\u003c/div\u003e"
