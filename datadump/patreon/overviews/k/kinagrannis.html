It has comforted and healed and inspired me throughout my life, and that is what I hope to do for others with the music I create. I want to connect with people. I want to help people feel not alone. I want to help people feel hope. I want to help people \u003cem\u003efeel. \u003c/em\u003ePeriod. If this is something you believe in, something that feels important to you in some way, then this is the place where you get to help make more of that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my last 10 or so years of being a full-time musician I have learned time and time again that the only thing I needed was my listeners. You. Some of you have been with me since the Crash The Super Bowl days, when I won a major label contract, entirely because of YOU. Some of you have been with me since I left said label, started a street team, and went independent, because I had YOU. I have toured, recorded albums, made hundreds of videos\u2026 all because of YOU. In recent years, through the support of individual patrons, I began getting paid for the videos I was putting out into the world for the first time in history. You, You, You.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOU are the ones that believe in me and my music, the ones that support the creation of my music, the ones that allow me to do what I love everyday, and as such, YOU will be getting the credit, starting now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom now on, my patrons = my label. You, my listeners, my fans, my Kinerds, will be my actual label. Together we will name it and make a logo for it. You\u2019ll hear new music before the rest of the world, and you\u2019ll get your name printed on the new album, just like a real label would.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes--new music is on the way! I\u0027ll be releasing one song at a time as they\u0027re recorded (hopefully one a month) and then compiling them into an album when it feels complete--at which point it will be printed and made into a physical CD (with your name on it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are all equally important to me when it comes to my music. My music has purpose because you LISTEN. Because I get to connect with real live humans out there in the world. So if supporting me in this way is not possible or appealing to you, that\u0027s fine! My videos will always be available to you for free, my songs will always be released in all the usual places. (And if you can\u0027t afford to buy my music, steal it. Seriously.) My ultimate goal has always been to make the best music I can and to share it with as many people as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for believing in me and my music. Thank you for making my art possible. Thank you for being my online family, my support team, my beloved Kinerds, and now, my label.
