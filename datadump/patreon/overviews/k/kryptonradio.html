When things get better, we\u0027d also like to pay our DJ\u0027s and the other creative and technical types that help keep everything running great.

When we highlight a book, a film or a piece of music, the creator of that work reaps the benefits. Sometimes it\u0027s just an enhanced reputation, but other times it means they get a boost in the wallet from the exposure. And sometimes they go pro based partly on the work they did while they were with us, and they rocket skyward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe great\u00a0 geeky stuff we enjoy is all made by people who started out writing fan fic, or making fan films, or drawing fan art, or writing their own songs.\u00a0When you help Krypton Radio, you\u0027re helping a community of new creatives blossoming all around us, which means that instead of just being a fan of it, \n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027re helping create it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThank You for Helping\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nIt all starts with a dream, and we are big believers in dreams.
