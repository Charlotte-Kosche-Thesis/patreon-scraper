    "summary": "Knock Once For Yes is a monthly podcast produced by Lil \u0026amp; Fitz. We have both experienced some seriously weird \u0026amp; spooky stuff over the years and would like to both share our stories with you and have you share your stories with us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of our content will be released for free so if you are strapped for cash, save your money. If you want to help another way, share your stories with us. We rely on your input to keep things interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do want to help financially, thank you! Web hosting, recording equipment and all the other things that go into producing a podcast take both time and money. Even just covering the costs of producing and hosting the show would be a great help. We would also love to start doing the show full time, which would mean both an increase in frequency of releases as well as additional content, live and recorded video, interviews travelling to paranormal locations, taking part in investigations and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course we will also be providing some special rewards for our patreon backers from thank you messages in the show, recording bloopers, being able to submit questions to be answered by us either on the show or by personal message or even being able to ask your questions yourself on the podcast! Take a look at the backer rewards to see the most up to date rewards on offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do we need your money? After all, the podcast comes out regularly for free and it seems ok. Well as well as the basic reasons we\u0027ve noted as goals, we are two people working full time with cats to feed! We aren\u0027t exactly living hand to mouth, but there\u0027s not a lot left each month after our expenses come out. Sometimes it really does come down to eating beans on toast for the last week of the month. A few dollars a month from you can cover our expenses of hosting the podcast, and believe us they soon add up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also did not realise that the podcast would become as popular as it has been. We are literally recording the podcast on an ageing PC in our box room. With an increasing audience, we really need to improve the quality of the podcast and that means, to start with, investing in some acoustic treatment for our recording room. However, the PC we use to record on is old and in dire need of an upgrade. It sounds like a helicopter taking off (we need to reduce the fan speeds to record and then boost them up as soon as we finish a section to prevent overheating), we need more RAM, we need more Hard drive space preferably some SSD\u0027s and each time our audio software gets a new release our machine struggles harder and harder to cope with it. We just don\u0027t have the money to spend on upgrading it. When something goes pop, we are going to have a hell of a hard time replacing it and it could mean an extended break from recording.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not all doom and gloom! Once we can cover our costs we want to start bringing you more and better content! We can invest in some video equipment and software to bring you video episodes. We can increase our monthly upload allowances to bring you more episodes and more varied content. Our ultimate aim is to be able to dedicate ourselves full time to producing the podcast on a more frequent basis, visiting haunted locations, going UFO hunting and taking you along for the ride (virtually!), fitting out a proper recording studio to make professional quality broadcasts and even live guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you enjoy the show and can afford to spare the cost of a cup of coffee a month, please think about supporting us so that we can bring you more Knock Once For Yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
