We have provided over 500 hours of original podcast content, over 300 hours of convention coverage, and over 800 articles from a decorated team of bloggers, including prolific Pathfinder freelancers, a hugely successful third party publisher, and an RPG Superstar winner. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to do more. We have plans for additional audio, video, and blog content. We want to get more staff to more conventions. And we want to coat everything we release with a more professional varnish. However, we pay for most of our material out of pocket, and it\u2019s hard to find the funds for these projects when we\u2019re keeping up with our regular Pathfinder purchases, an increasing amount of Starfinder releases, and now Pathfinder second edition playtest material. \u003cbr\u003eHelp us continue to provide you and the rest of the Pathfinder and Starfinder community with the best podcasts, blogs, seminar recordings, and more!"
