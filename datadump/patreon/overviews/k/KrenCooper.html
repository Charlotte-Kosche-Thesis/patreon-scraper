    "summary": "For many years now I\u2019ve been taking photographs at LRP\nevents, and hosting them for anyone to see via my Facebook account. As a long\ntime player at the Lorien Trust, I\u2019m well known at the events there, both\norganised by the Lorien Trust, and at smaller events sanctioned by them. I\u0027ve also taken photographs at other events such as Outcast, Fifth-Season and other smaller scale systems.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have always been happy to take photographs on request at\nevents, and to allow people access to the original high resolution images from the\ncamera, rather than the compressed versions on the website. Images are supplied\nto the Lorien Trust for use on their website, and to faction and guild commands\nfor use in their promotional material. Individuals are also supplied with high\nquality imagery on request for their own personal use.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe stance has always been \u201cyou are free to use the images,\nfor whatever purpose you wish, provided that it doesn\u2019t harm the hobby or bring\nit into disrepute\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, camera equipment is not cheap, and does run the\nrisk of getting broken during combats. Consumables such as batteries and memory\ncards need to be replaced, new lenses need to be purchased for different situations,\nand photos need to be stored somewhere - I\u0027m now closing in on a terabyte of photos and video (70,000 files), stored on an external 6 disk RAID 5 NAS, and backed up to a second NAS at the other end of the house, with additional backups onto single disks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, I\u2019ve decided to set up a Patreon page, so that if anyone\nwants to support my photography at events, they can do so easily. Any funding\nwill help finance new equipment or facilities, and be used to further my\nphotography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re running an event, and would like some photos taking - please feel free to get in touch and we can discuss - depending on the distance from Yorkshire, I\u0027m normally happy to come along and photograph people having fun.\u003cbr\u003e"
