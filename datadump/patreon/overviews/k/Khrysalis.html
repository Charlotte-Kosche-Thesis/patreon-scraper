Raised by an eccentric scientist who is the Endling of his kind, a sentient starship who uses magic to assume a humanoid form, a 7000-year-old wolf-dog, and a haunted warrior-bard, she is a member of a legion of elite child-like agents called the Everchildren of Harvest. Imbued with great power, trained in many skills, and blessed with unlimited life, she has a taste for adventure and has a way of attracting strange friends and powerful enemies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonor Raisa is not only one of the premier Everchildren of her generation, but also she\u0027s one of the few Everkids who has the attention span required to sit still and talk for measured periods of time, as well the patience to fill in small details.

A journey of love, loss, hardship, joy, family, home and adventure\u2014and ever more of it again as the series goes on. This is what I can give you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat you could give me is the chance that I could spend more time doing what I love, which is telling stories. A little support and I could spend more time writing and less time struggling to keep myself in food, shelter, and clothing. I hope you don\u0027t think the Harvest Masters pay me for this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCertainly, Honor isn\u0027t helping me out any. I have to pay \u003cem\u003eher\u003c/em\u003e, in fact.
