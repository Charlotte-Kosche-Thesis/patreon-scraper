    "summary": "I have been a professional knitting designer and author (turned publisher) for over ten years. I\u0027ve written more than a dozen books for major publishers, as well as \u003cem\u003eThe Knitgrrl Guide to Professional Knitwear Design\u003c/em\u003e, the first in its field. I also serve on the Independent Book Publishers Association board, and have presented on niche publishing at South by Southwest, O\u0027Reilly\u0027s TOC digital publishing conference and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith one foot in both the knit industry and publishing industry for many years, both of which have gone through a large number of changes over this past decade, I\u0027ve seen a lot of things happening, and not all of them are great. Decreasing designer compensation is a problem, there\u0027s the recent #FairFiberWage discussion about teacher pay and reimbursements, and then the trickle down effect on everyone else we rely upon to keep things going, such as sample knitters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the designer side it feels as if no one realizes how squeezed we are financially on all fronts. And as a consumer, I want to know that the money I spend is going where I think it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to try a radical experiment in 2017. We\u0027ll release a pattern every single week of the year and document the money side of things from every possible angle. How much the patterns REALLY cost to produce (photography, tech editing, sample knitters), and how much we earned from straight up pattern sales on Ravelry, how much we earned here on Patreon, who got paid and why. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s see if the summer knitting slump really does affect income for designers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s see if hosting knit-alongs or other special events drives up sales!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s see where knitters are actually hanging out and buying patterns these days!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, let\u0027s gather up all kinds of information over the course of a year and analyze it for everyone\u0027s benefit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is set up so that supporters will pay a discounted per-pattern rate of $4 every time a new pattern is released. If we are able to stick to our once-per-week goal, and our target of 250 weekly subscribers or more (keeping in mind that people may come and go as the year goes on), we\u0027ll be able to pay everyone involved in the project fairly, and continue work on additional content for subscribers on top of the patterns themselves. We also hope to continue a conversation about where professional knitwear design as a career is headed, and that will take a variety of forms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a supporter, you\u0027ll have access to all the content we produce so long as you stay subscribed, and information that won\u0027t be publicly available to non-subscribers. If you are a subscriber for 6 months or more, you\u0027ll receive a copy of the book we are planning to write about this experience, a follow up of sorts to \u003cem\u003eThe Knitgrrl Guide\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering lending your support to this experiment! We\u0027re fascinated by the possibilities here.\u003cbr\u003e"
