    "summary": "I\u0027m passionate about writing and sustainability. And that comes in handy if you want to spread the word and be an activist for a better world. I simply do what I enjoy the most and push it into the world wide web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in Sweden means to be inspired by an incredible amount of impressions daily. I sometimes sit by the sea and write poetry. Other days I spend at the Scandinavian caf\u00e9, soaking up impressions and formulating blog posts. But the highest art of producing content to me is an evening alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy elixir of writing is unfortunately pretty expensive. A glass of red costs around 11 EUR / 13 USD. And I best fuel my creative mind with two of those. The perfect amount to be in the perfect flow of writing. And that ends up to be a quite costly hobby. Because by now, I barely make money with my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest project, besides my blog and running the Instagram, will be an eBook. I haven\u0027t drunk enough red wine yet to decide on a title, but it will be covering the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and the fashion industry. This will be a piece to firstly, understandin\u00a0what the Agenda 2030 is all about and secondly, make readers reflect on their fashion consumption. Pretty geeky, I know. But that\u0027s kind of what I\u0027m into."
