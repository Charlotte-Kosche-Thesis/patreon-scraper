A few days after the article appeared, he took a seat across from my desk and sat silent for some minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You do with words, what I do with metal,\" he finally said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written professionally for decades, primarily making a living as a grants expert and writer of grant proposals, but I\u0027ve never stopped writing those projects that fed my soul. At present I have four novels in print with Sapphire Books with another, \u003cem\u003eThe Pyramid and the Painting\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(scheduled for release August 2018). My out-of-print \u003cem\u003eFolsom Boy \u003c/em\u003eis currently selling as a collectible with dealers asking as much as $3,000 online. I have had several plays produced, including taking top honors at the 2015 New Mexico AACTFest for \"Sheltered Women\" which also received a special award for Excellence in Play Writing at the Region VI AACTFest (covering five states). \"Sheltered Women\" was loosely based on true stories from women served by Organization of Women\u0027s Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), a long-time client of my consulting business, Flying Pigs Creative Services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could list novels, plays, articles, and so much more, but, in essence, I believe words are magic. In everything I write, I strive not only to entertain but also to inspire, and educate.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.facebook.com/KaytCPeck/photos/a.862104980527576.1073741827.490397781031633/1480067948731273/?type=1\u0026amp;theater\"\u003eEven as a grants expert, over a third of my time involves volunteering for grassroots groups that cannot afford my services. I\u0027m working on a play that celebrates the unique culture of the\u00a0\u003cem\u003enortenos\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of northern New Mexico, a screenplay about a young man finding his own identity and courage, escaping a family tradition oppressing others, and embracing a new family, poor in money but rich in love and integrity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do what I do best, I need support, and I pray there are those willing to invest a piece of their hope for the future in my work.",
