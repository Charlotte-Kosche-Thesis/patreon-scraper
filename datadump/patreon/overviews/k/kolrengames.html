After years training with her mother, she and her childhood friend Mile are ready to set off but a thunder gets their attention. After investigating the site, they discover a badly injured succubus called Alisa that informs Asus about the plans of the demonic overlords: infiltrated the mortal races and take them over. Now knowing about the demon\u0027s plot Asus makes a pact with Alisa, allowing her to reside inside her, while she and Mile try to uncover the demon\u0027s plans and stop the takeover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Smut\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\nAsus\u0027 mother is a very dominant woman, and as the saying goes, the apple doesn\u0027t fall far from the tree. Since she was little, she was dead set on becoming a woman even greater than her mother. Both in swordplay and in dominance over her lovers. As you can expect, this means you\u0027ll see a lot of femdom in the H-Scenes. But not only that, Asus\u0027 pact with Alisa even allows her to turn into a futa at will, so you can expect a good chunk of futa action if that\u0027s your desire. That\u0027s even some futa-on-male for you that can\u0027t go through a futa product without seeing a guy being owned. But fret not. Just like you\u0027ll have control over how dominant Asus is, you\u0027ll be able to choose how Asus will deal with her bedtime partners. So if you don\u0027t like futa content just don\u0027t choose the futa options. The only exception being the party members romances since those have just a single route in terms of sex, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll notice which one falls on each partner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\nThe Development\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\nThe game is being made with RPG Maker MV. As of now, there\u0027s two members of the team: me, Kolren, as the game developer in general, and Mars, as a mapper in training. We plan to develop the game in a way each update will feature at least two new locations, with each update being patreon only for the first week and them going public. Of course, this also means the full game will also be free to play.\u003cbr\u003eBesides this, we\u0027re planning to look for new team members to take care of eventing so we can hasten the releases. The art is being made by MothKing, his Patreon can be found \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Mothking\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\nThe Campaign\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEveryone that pledges for the patreon campaign will have their name included in the game\u0027s credits as one of the patrons. Those that decide to pledge $5 or more will have access to game content early, like one-week early access to the new release or access to the first location of the new release as soon as it\u0027s done. Those that pledge $10 or more not only have even earlier access but can see the sketch for the next CG while it\u0027s still being made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\nThe Links\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://kolrengames.blogspot.com.br/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://kolrengames.blogspot.com.br\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy development\nblog\u003c/div\u003e"
