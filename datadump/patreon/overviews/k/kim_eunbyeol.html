    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Eun-byeol. I\u0027m pleased to meet you, and I\u0027m thrilled that you have found your way here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Korean-Chinese-American speculative fiction writer who unexpectedly ended up a Rhysling-nominated poet, and I\u0027ve been a freelance copy editor on and off since high school. I am also chronically ill, living with an unclassified connective tissue disorder, POTS, and dysautonomia, all of which have left me disabled and in constant, severe pain. And then on top of all that, my life rewrote itself\u2014not for the better\u2014without my permission in the fall of 2016 (only somewhat for the reasons you probably think).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWords have been my preferred art medium since before I can remember. I love evocative imagery and creative prose and compelling characters, and I strongly believe in the power of the written word to amplify voices that must fight for the same\u00a0platform and regard that others are simply \u003cem\u003egiven\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0Much of my writing focusses on marginalised populations, on disability and ageism and racism, on women whose strength can be physical and blunt as much as silent and subtle. The people who are dismissed, who are brushed aside as fragile, broken things past their expiration date, are my main characters, not least because of my own experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an editor, my goal is not to make someone else\u0027s writing sounds like mine; rather, it\u0027s to\u00a0highlight the strength and beauty of \u003cem\u003etheir\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0words, to help them tell\u00a0their stories. My clientele is varied, but I try to amplify minority voices, many of whom are telling the stories the majority wish would stay silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI sold my first piece in late 2015, just as I was going into my last year of graduate school. Unfortunately, that placed all original fiction in progress on the proverbial back burner amidst my thesis, job hunting, comps, and everything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTechnically, it paid off: I earnt my Master\u0027s degree in Security Studies (translation: National Security) in December 2016. Realistically, it was a large dose of cruel irony: this occurred just in time for my already-unstable health to collapse even further than it already had, followed by the federal hiring freeze.\u00a0The bottom line is, in the interests\u00a0of keeping this post at least somewhat short,\u00a0I am never going to have the chance to pursue my dream job, or even anything related to it. At this point, my medical team and I are no longer certain I am even \u003cem\u003ecapable\u003c/em\u003e of holding a full-time job right now and we\u0027re still assessing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. I\u0027ve returned to freelance editing to pay the bills, but that provides nothing resembling a living wage. Therefore, at the most basic level, you\u0027re helping me to survive: to pay for medications and doctor\u0027s appointments, for rent and bills, for groceries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore importantly, you give me the space to grow as a creator, since I can dedicate more time to writing if I\u0027m not booking clients every day of the month. I learn as much from my own writing as I do from working with other writers, but when that is my sole source of income, I need to schedule myself as heavily as I can and don\u0027t always get to do much writing of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery penny of your support, as a patron, client, or both, goes toward balancing my obligations as an editor and my ideas as a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do \u003c/em\u003eyou\u003cem\u003e get?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eAll patrons get access to my Activity Feed here, as well as a patron-only blog where I\u0027ll talk about life and the creative process, in general and as it pertains to disability and/or being a trauma survivor. I\u0027ll also discuss the editorial side\u2014how writing works for me and how that changes when the worlds at my fingertips are not my own. I\u0027ll post the things that usually remain in my head: worldbuilding; inspiration; plot and character development and background; scenes from characters\u0027 lives that don\u0027t quite fit into the central plot; and a first look at bits and pieces of WIPs, whether or not I decide they\u0027re ever going to see the light of day elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest of my life is equally fair game: what I\u0027m reading or watching, the languages I\u0027m learning, excessive picspam of my horses or DC museums, WIP photos if I\u0027m having a solid enough day to pick up a calligraphy pen or sit down at the beading table, etc. It\u0027s worth noting that I read as much as I possibly can, and I try to promote good fiction and literature, particularly when it comes from diverse authors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, all patrons at $3/month and up receive optional access to real-time ideas, notes, and worldbuilding at my \u003cem\u003ePhantasmagoria\u003c/em\u003e Slack team, as well as a patron-only discount on any editing commissions\u2014higher-tier patrons receive a proportionately higher discount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eThank you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis is far longer than it should be, so let\u0027s move on.
