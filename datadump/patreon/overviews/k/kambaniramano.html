I am an artist?! \u2018yes,\u2019 said God, \u2018you are an artist.\u2019 and He was quite proud of the fact. my life was \u2013 and is \u2013 a poem He had taken great care to love and to write before He founded the earth in the beginning. so I resigned myself to this truth and, in the same breath, resigned from my brief attempt at an office job. then I set off on a journey to discover what exactly Heaven\u2019s High King had in mind when He fashioned me to be a poet and a storyteller and a muso and a creator of whatever else it is that He has placed in my spirit to create\u2014works which, I hope, carry something of the wonder that beautifies our broken and harrowed world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\ntime passed. life happened. I grew a little less na\u00efve, I think. and a few detours later here I find myself. and here you find me. and here we find each other\u2014although, in truth I am not really here and neither are you. as I write this I am in the Russian gem of a city called Saint Petersburg and who knows where in the world you are?! and who knows where I will be eight months from now. I certainly do not. but that is neither here nor there. what matters is that we have connected over the interwebs and can continue to remain so wherever the wind pleases to blow us next.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nso who am I? I am a wayfarer in the world who has been captured by the story of redemption and grace. in spite of the wreck that I have been in life, I have found that Father God really likes me. (and everyone else, for that matter.) and He seems to keep believing in me even on those days when I specialise in being a fumble-bucket at life. I am a writer of poetry and biographical portraits, as well as philosophical meditations on faith and faith\u2019s heroes and the road I have walked so far. plus I love to take photographs of the cities and people I happen upon in my travels, to capture something of the light fantastic that is within them. and sometimes I even compose songs on my guitar and sing them for others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eand what am I asking for? your investment and support. in other words, friends and champions of my art. if you like what I produce \u2013 or simply just like the human person that I am \u2013 with Patreon you get to facilitate the creation of more wonder in the world in exchange for, uhmm, more wonder. that is, I get to make more wonderful creations and you get to enjoy them as soon as they are ready to sally forth from the starshores of my mind.\u00a0think of it in the same way that you would buying chocolate. or a Netflix subscription. (it is closer to a Netflix subscription than to chocolate, if I am honest.) or simply buying a story directly from an author instead of going through a publisher and bookstore, with the added benefit of behind-the-scenes commentary and meditations on creativity included.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tbut why invest? what will the benefit be? in short, we get to leave a trail of beauty in the wake of all of the creativity that your ongoing patronage facilitates. which will make our respective corners of the world a little prettier for it. and maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 one or two hundred years from now\u00a0our children\u2019s kids will read one of these pieces and be glad that you chose to fund my work because together we left a treasure or three behind for them to savour. also, if by some miracle I somehow win acclaim along the way, you will have the pleasure of knowing that you played a significant role in creating a platform for me to shine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tbefore I sign off, let me say this: the world is illuminated in intangible ways by artists in every sphere of creativity. from Miriam Makeba to Streep to Ishiguro, Achebe, Tsvetaeva, Kahlo, Wes Anderson\u2014history is a grander story because these and so many others of a similar ilk chose to master their craft.\u00a0which is exactly what I intend to do with greater focus as your patronage gives me the space and time to do so. so\u00a0thank you for reading up until this point. and thank you for considering becoming a patron. and, if you are already a friend and a champion of my work: a big, big thank you for believing in me. and believing that what I do does indeed make the planet better, even if it is just a little bit. you are stellar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nfinally, to paraphrase the words of Robert Noyce: here\u2019s to not being encumbered by history but to doing something wonderful instead. and, more importantly, here\u2019s to doing it together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nyours truly,\u003cbr\u003e\n\tKambani\n\u003c/div\u003e"
