    "summary": "Hi all! Thank you for taking the time to look at my Patreon page! My name is Katlyn Koester, I am an artist, potter, crocheter, and crafter living in the northwoods of Wisconsin. I love making things and when I was in middle school I realized there was nothing I enjoyed more. After high school and college I decided to make it my life\u0027s work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making pottery since I was 12 (more than 17 years dedicated to pottery now) and have gone to full time art recently after spending 14 years at a part time job. The area where I live is very tourist driven. Summers I pack up all my work, my displays, and my tent into my mini van and haul it all to art shows each week around the area. This creates a somewhat steady business in the summer. In the winter there are fewer shows and less opportunity for drive by traffic. I was fortunate to get my kilns second hand, but that requires regular maintenance and parts. My studio is completely run by me and only me. I live with my parents and it is thanks to them that I have made it thus far as an artist. My dad comes to shows with me and my mom always has an idea or an encouraging word. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, my biggest goal of all is to be able to buy my own place. To have a studio, home and possibly small farm all my own where I could continue to work and play with my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron you will gain access to exclusive Patron\u0027s Only content, discounts on purchases, rewards and surprises along the way. You also get the awesome opportunity to allow me to continue my work as an artist. How cool is that!?\u003cbr\u003e"
