    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Klyigid.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello,\nplease call me Katt!  I am a catgirl that loves to make different types of art and express myself.  In addition to my artistic pursuits, I love\nanimals, video games, reading, anime, and most things nerdy!  Perhaps just as much, I really enjoy\nscientific subjects and general academia. \nI am a full time student and nearly finished with my BA in criminal\njustice and psychology.  I hope to be\nable to continue my education in forensic. I am a Suicide Girl Hopeful as well as a professional and freelance alternative model. \u00a0Additionally, I own and create a lot of the items in a small online shop - Domus Diabolica - www.domusdiabolica.storenvy.com. \u00a0Subsequently, I have decided to take the\nchance to do what I really love and in such a way that I am able to concentrate\non schoolwork and other important aspects of my life that were being put\noff.  I am really excited at the prospect\nof being able to share my art and just having the opportunity to do it! \u00a0All proceeds will go towards funding my art and providing for materials and tier rewards.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QWfHHJ9.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/QWfHHJ9.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Playing\nMario and The Legends of Zelda on Nintendo is one of my clearest and first\nmemories.  The Zelda series is probably\nmy all-time favorite, but my love for games only grew from there!  I really like playing MMORPGs and the Sims on\nPC as well, but JRPG is my favorite genre. \nA few other games and series I really enjoy are Final Fantasy, Fatal\nFrame, Eternal Sonata, Xenosaga, and similar stuff.  Nowadays, I mostly play console games on\nPlaystation or Nintendo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  The\nfirst real anime I watched was Neon Genesis Evangelion and I feel a great\nintroduction into that world!  I was\nhooked after seeing it with a friend as a young teen.  The first anime I found for myself was Tokyo\nMew Mew \u2013 quite a difference in substance compared to Evangelion, but I loved\nthe main character and I\u2019ve been fond of nekomimi ever since!  I also feel like I identify with this type of\ncharacter a lot for a variety of reasons. \nI enjoy a range of anime, manga, and light novels, but one of my\nfavorite ongoing series is D. Grayman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  I have\nloved to read for nearly as long as I can remember, as well.  After being read to every night, I couldn\u2019t\nkeep myself from learning before I started school.  From there, I spent a whole lot of time in\nthe library!  I also spent a lot of time\nin the art room and I\u2019ve always favored painting.  I started singing in choir during school,\nwhere I spent eight years learning formally before performing French opera in\nstate competitions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OxQlNOm.png\"\u003eMy main\nfocus is primarily cosplaying a wide range of characters from anime, video\ngames, and other media, as well as my own original creations with accompanying\nstories.  I like to create photo sets for\na variety of moods, whether playful, dark and creepy, action-packed, and often\nwith a sexy tease.  I\u2019m an incredibly\neclectic person and I like to express that in my costuming!  Above all, I love going for looks that are\noriginal, obscure, or being able to add my own style to classics.  By offering your patronage, I will be able to\nbuy garments or materials for cosplay and photo shoots, a larger range of\nlocations to shoot in, and photography equipment.  I am great at finding a bargain and save\nmoney by creating my own stuff, but assistance will ensure that I can keep\nmaking new and better costumes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PZIDIph.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Another\npassion of mine is writing and literature, which should come across a bit on my\nwebsite.  I love writing in a variety of\naspects including song lyrics, poetry, characterization, and general\nfiction.  The main focus of my released\nwriting so far can be found in the original characters and stories within \u2018The\nBoudoir\u2019 on my website.  Each character\nis unique and more will be added soon that comprise the house of Madame\nDiabolos.  The Boudoir is reminiscent of\na classic harem anime setting, but is set apart with the unique Diabolos style\nand flavor.  Each new album is a\nprogressive chapter in the story!  Though\nit is not necessary to read all albums or in order.  I also plan to release more of my poetry and\nexerpts of fiction.  I hope to be able to\npublish novels someday with an established storyline that is completely\nseparate to the Boudoir.  I prefer to do\nmy writing by hand, so all I really need is paper and pens for now!  Though it would be great to upgrade to audio\ndictation someday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  While\nthese pursuits take up the majority of my creative time currently, I am always\nlooking to learn new things and expand my horizons.  I love to paint, draw, dance, sew, stretch,\ncook, and other forms of art.  Patronage\nwill allow me to obtain and replenish supplies to be able to share and\nintegrate these activities into what I currently have to offer.  Perhaps most importantly of all, patron\nsupport will allow me the time to do the wide range of art that I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HUhp4Eb.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you can expect to see each month:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eAt least one full, professional regular photo and boudoir album - In some cases, this may comprise as one full album or be kept separate. \u00a0This might be cosplay or just my regular \u0027 kitten style\u0027, depending on how far along I am on my current cosplay project. \u00a0Either way, I really like to get creative with my looks!\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular cosplay - In addition to the more \u0027proper\u0027 shoots, I will also still be cosplaying regularly. \u00a0This could be just about anything including characters I have cosplayed before, new characters, new or old original characters, etc. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA variety of self-shot and nude photo sets.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDay to day and social media - Yep, more pictures! \u00a0If the previous stuff isn\u0027t enough, I do post regularly on my social media accounts. \u00a0This includes a combination of selfies, random thoughts, plans, and whatever I happen to be getting up to. \u00a0I post shots from my albums, but I also include \u0027behind the scenes\u0027 type photos and me on a more \u0027normal\u0027 basis.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdate and WIP - You will know exactly what I am working on and planning! \u00a0I\u0027ll tell you about my current project(s), take pictures, and show you how I did it. \u00a0In most cases, that will most likely be sewing garments or creating convention-friendly weapons and accessories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaking all sorts of stuff! \u00a0I\u0027m always designing and creating new things, whether cosplay, jewelry, clothing, crafts, accessories, DIY projects, etc - I\u0027ll be posting my projects, using them in photo shoots, selling items in my online shop, and making tutorials.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the tier system, I will also have unique legacy rewards for patrons that decide to stick around for a while. \u00a0Since we are just getting started, I will add more information about this soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to get to know a little more about me!\u003cbr\u003e"
