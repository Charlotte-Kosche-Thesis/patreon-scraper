    "summary": "My name is Remel Johnson, i am a very passionate anime fan with a crazy imagination. I have been a fan of anime since i was old enough to watch TV, with some of my favourites including; Dragon ball, Naruto, Fairy Tail, Boku no Hero Academia and Samurai Champloo. when i was younger i would imagine and draw my own anime characters but as time went on i sort of lost my drawing ability and didn\u0027t really know what to do with the characters i had drawn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day I had the bright idea to create my own manga, i came up with loads of story concepts, consistencies, character designs, back stories, etc (i have like a notepads worth of ideas and concepts written down and stored in my phone) and tried to add some authenticity by having\u00a0 a friend of mine translate some of the names of people/places into Japanese. the only problem is i can\u0027t draw as well as i used to and its pretty hard to find a good manga artist who would be willing to from a partnership. So i started this Patreon account in order to gather some fund so that i can afford to pay an artist to illustrate my comic for me! I really hope any anime/manga fans (and people in general) can see my vision and help me out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to see some of the character designs or hear about the synopsis and story ideas for my manga then feel free to private message me!\u003cbr\u003e"
