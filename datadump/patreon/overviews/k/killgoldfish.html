    "summary": "When I set up this Patreon the first time, it was to fund Kill Reviews. I wrote it, I finished it, and after that, I was basically done writing about Magic. And I \u003cem\u003ecertainly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0wasn\u0027t going to back and write more in the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, things change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hopping back into Magic writing, but with more of an open goal this time. I feel like a better, more confident writer now, after saying so much about Magic design. Unlike during Kill Reviews, when I would write them late at night or on weekends, not having a job leaves me with a lot of time to work on Magic writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot of things I still want to say, and things I want to accomplish. The goal isn\u0027t as defined this time, but what I can do is a lot more. I\u0027m going to be spending more time on each piece; hell, sometimes I\u0027ll even get people to \u003cem\u003eactually edit\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0it. (Readers of Kill Reviews know this was desperately needed for that project.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut beyond that, I can actually take time to research things I don\u0027t know about, instead of just writing about things I already do. The Great Designer Search 2 is an example: I spent three entire days reading, screencapping, and notating about 100,000 words of Magic design articles from 2010-2011. There\u0027s absolutely no way I could have done that before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... why should you give me money? Because, right now, there\u0027s no infrastructure for Magic writers who want to push beyond the boundaries of, \"here are some decks to play in tournaments,\" or \"here\u0027s a tournament I went to,\" or \"here\u0027s a preview card that Wizards so kindly gave me.\" It would be impossible for me to say what I want to say, and devote this amount of time doing it, if it was for a major Magic site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone that\u0027s been reading my stuff, tweeting at me about it, or even arguing about it on Reddit (eugh). Thank you especially to those of you who supported me on Patreon the first time around, and those of you who will continue to do so in the future.\u003cbr\u003e"
