    "summary": "In April 2009, I published my first nonfiction blog post on writing, freelancing, and the publishing industry. Since then, my readers have supported my weekly Thursday posts through a PayPal donate button. A lot of supporters have asked me to start a Patreon page.\u00a0 So here it is!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI blog weekly about the craft of writing, the business of writing, and the changes in the publishing industry. Except for a much-needed hiatus in 2014, I have not missed a week in eight years. I hope to continue for seven more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften, I blog about whatever hits the industry news sources. Every now and then, however, I write a book on my blog. I started this practice with \u003cem\u003eThe Freelancer\u0027s Survival Guide\u003c/em\u003e in 2009, and continued it with several other books, including \u003cem\u003eThe Pursuit of Perfection\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDiscoverability\u003c/em\u003e. In October of 2016, I published \u003cem\u003eClosing The Deal...On Your Terms\u003c/em\u003e, a book that covers everything from agents to contracts to negotiation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese books wouldn\u0027t exist without the blog. As a thank-you, I always keep the original blog posts up for free. The books are a little different than the blog posts\u2014I organize the books better, and update information that readers often provide in the comments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blog appears for free on my website every Thursday. I believe the information in the blog helps new and established writers better negotiate their careers. Not every writer can afford to support the blog financially, so I ask the blog\u0027s readers to share the blog with their writing groups and other organizations. The blog now has a worldwide readership.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Cost\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMuch as I would love to write the nonfiction blog for free, I\n cannot do so. It\u0027s too research-intensive. I spend time investigating \nthe changes, learning new things, and doing some actual reporting (as I \ndid in 2011 with the changes in royalty statements from traditional \npublishers). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaders have funded these efforts. Honestly, the \nblog would have died long ago if not for reader funding. I am supremely \ngrateful for all of the support. I cannot do this blog alone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon and Crowd-funding\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI initially put off adding Patreon to my requests for blog funding because, as a working \u003cem\u003efiction\u003c/em\u003e writer, I didn\u0027t think I had time to do the extras that would make supporting my blog worthwhile for a patron. However, some blog readers gave me great suggestions (I love you folks!) and I have figured out how to make this worthwhile for all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Rewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSometimes I finish the blog right before my deadline. Generally, however, I finish the blog days to weeks ahead of time. Patreon supporters at the $5-per-month level will receive the blog as soon as I finish it. I haven\u0027t forgotten you $1-per-month folks, though. You\u0027ll get at least one blog post per month ahead of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think the other reward levels are self-explanatory\u2014except for the $500-per-month level. Really, that\u0027s a one-time donation. That\u0027s why I\u0027m calling it the \u003cstrong\u003eJump-in, Jump-Out Reward. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve learned over the past seven years that sometimes my blog makes such a difference in a writer\u0027s business or financial success that they want to share. Generally, I urge them to pay forward, but not everyone wants to do that. So, here\u0027s a one-time opportunity to give, if that works for you. Jump in one month, pay once, and then leave the following month, no questions asked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne other explanation: I only include books published by WMG Publishing or by me. I can guarantee you\u0027ll get those rewards. If I were to promise some of the traditionally published books, I might not be able to fulfill. So that\u0027s why I\u0027ve included that caveat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI can\u0027t do this blog without support. So thank you, thank you, thank you! I cannot express how grateful I am for all that you do.\u003cbr\u003e"
