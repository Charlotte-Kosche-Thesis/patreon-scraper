I hired myself for this mission because I have questions and if I find the answers, I think they can change the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, right of the bat I want you to know that I am not building a spaceship like Elon. I do not live in Silicon Valley and my name isn\u0027t Aaron Swartz. What I am is a developing creative research psychologist looking to answer the core of the question, \u0027how do we learn?\u0027. I have the motivation, now I need the means. I need help to conduct my research. Uncovering how perception work in a variety of contexts. Let me learn how to teach kids to learn faster and easier. This is my story and this is how you can help.\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR\u003c/strong\u003e (Too long; Didn\u0027t read). I am trying to get funding to do my PhD in Psychology on the cognitive processors of perception that we use in early childhood development that assist us in learning the world around us. Visual analysis, spatial mapping, and sequential memory are some of the constructs I will be testing psychologically in children living in South Africa. I will be using LEGO as an intervention to assist the cognitive learning that assist us for the rest of our lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is so exciting and important and I hope you can help me complete my mission!!

I love people and I love learning. Together, the love I have for learning, with the love I have for people, combined in a\u00a0participatory learning experience with the people I engage with has become the core focus of what I want to do with my time. I was part of a team that hosted an international conference on Positive Psychology at the University where I work, and a professor advised me to find an avenue that allows me to follow this passion. This is where Patreon came in. I want to learn, I want to learn with people and I want to follow my passion of research in Psychology and thinking systems. I need help to do this as learning does not immediately let me physically feed myself. As hungry as my brain is, my stomach also needs some attention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eWHO AM I? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJonathan Menno\nKlapwijk is an Intern Research Psychologist at the African Unit for\nTransdisciplinary Health Research (AUTHeR) with a demonstrated history of\nworking in the health systems and human cognition. He is a strong research professional with a\nBachelor of Social Science Honours is Psychology from the University of\nPretoria. Jonathan has completed his first year of Masters of Arts in Psychological\nResearch Consultancy, currently completing his dissertation titled \u2018Further\nValidation of the Visual Perceptual Aspects Test: A bifactor exploratory\nStructural equation modelling approach\u2019. He has received extensive training in quantitative, qualitative and\nmixed method methodology as well as psychological ethics. His primary interests\nlie in\u00a0cognitive psychology, psychological education, public health, child development and pathology, psychosocial well-being\nand community psychology, neuropsychology, M\u0026amp;E and\nprogramme evaluation. He has worked in a multitude of areas including an adolescent ward in a national prison for incarcerated adolescent drug addicts. He then found himself in a unit that worked in collaboration with USAID on the evaluation the 52 Thuthuzela Care Centres in South Africa. These centres were developed to assist and treat rape victims (especially children) in dealing with the trauma, their cases and preparation for court. The evaluation was sent to the National Prosecution Agency to be presented in the South African Parliament for policy change. Through that project, he found his way to the Department of Health where he assisted rural clinics in evaluating and training Primary Care Workers in bringing health care to community member\u0027s houses. After that, he started at AUTHeR where he has been granted the opportunity of exploring health and behaviour in a variety of ways, from nutrition, to DNA analysis in the behaviour of rats and finally the measuring and assisting in people\u0027s well-being and meaning in life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(15, 36, 62); color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eWHY?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a need to learn, a need to help, and I want to show the world what I have found. This is a side project to my five year goal of using LEGO as a learning tool to enhance cognitive ability and perception in early childhood development globally, but more specifically in the South African context. Being diagnosed with ADHD, my cognition has assisted me in finding a variety of knowledge pockets in every direction I look. I need to control myself to not follow every butterfly I find, however, I believe someone should follow that butterfly and hopefully it is you. The topics of this knowledge system are endless, but behaviour, cognition and the mind are central to my epistemology.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eHOW YOU CAN HELP ME ACHIEVE THIS!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life\" (Confucius, 479 BC).

Inside of this bag is a pencil-case, a pouch for cables, 3x USB, 4x written notebooks (each designed for a different purpose) and a laptop. This bag is the goldmine to my research and knowledge packets I have found on my journey as a research psychologist thus far. Each month, I will be publishing the idea(s) that I find needs some dialogue. You will have access to this blog and from there we can exchange comments, thoughts and ideas on whatever we are talking about.\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the Tier, each month, I will submit a private email to you that include links of: definitions, articles, books, podcasts, stories, epics, movies, songs, scientists, art and things that ignite your interest in the world.\u00a0Every month I will send you a personal post card from South Africa. (If you want it sent to someone else as a gift, we can do that too).\u00a0I will host a Q\u0026amp;A with you, answering or assisting with anything I can.
