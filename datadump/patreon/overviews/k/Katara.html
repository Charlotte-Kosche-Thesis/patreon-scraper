Even though I direct\nand edit my videos myself, each video still has hard costs (makeup, wardrobe,\nprops, travel expenses, camera operators, etc.). Additionally, since I also produce\nand arrange much of the music myself, it can easily take 100+ hours for me to go from\nsong production to a complete music video. So, this is really a full time job and I\nneed your help in keeping me employed. \u2665 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RetHZ9Zqbt8\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of my Patreon page is to raise money for my original music videos, but if you also have other content you would like to see or topics for my blogs, please tell me!

I have a degree in Biology (not music). My favorite sound is the sound of snow crunching under your feet when the world is otherwise quiet. If you were to have told me 4 years ago that I would be living in China pursuing a career writing Mandopop songs and making a Patreon page, I honestly would not have believed you. But life is unpredictable. I followed my dreams and they led me here. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePeople ask, \"Why did you learn Chinese?\" It\u0027s a complicated answer with a ridiculously long story, but the shorthand is that Chinese is very musical. Mandarin, being a tonal language, was captivating to me as a songwriter. Exploring writing music outside of my native tongue was challenging and thrilling. It\u0027s like a painter using a new brush. All of a sudden, I could paint pictures with my words in a new way.... look at the world with a new perspective... amplify the ways I could express myself. I fell head over heels in love with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as I started listening to modern Chinese music, I was immediately hooked. One day, I literally searched \"Chinese Pop\" in YouTube and watched video after video. After that, every day I would find myself singing Mandopop songs when I was alone: driving to class, in the shower, doing the dishes... all the time. One day, I wrote my own song in Chinese... I was feeding my fish, and I just started singing and making up some lyrics in Chinese (I was singing a song about my fish to my fish... it\u0027s a little embarrassing, but you got to start somewhere, right? LOL) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut maybe I need to back up a little bit... I actually started writing songs when I was a kid. Neither of my parents are professional musicians, but my Dad plays guitar and inspired me to become a songwriter when he played a song for me that he wrote for my Mom when they were dating several years before I was even born. Listening to that song was like a window through which I could see my parents in a totally different light. Before, I just saw them as my parents, but through the song, I was able to see a young couple in love at the start of their happily ever after. It was so beautiful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started learning guitar, and as soon as I knew three chords, I wrote my first song. (more embarrassing than the fish song, I promise you.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t pursue music as an education or as a career from the get-go. I went to college to study medicine with the intention of becoming a doctor. Even to this day, I still love science and medicine. But through a series of twists and turns in my fate far too long and complicated for this post, I ended up pursuing my dream of being a songwriter anyway after I graduated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to this moment: asking for your help in keeping my dream alive. If you can support me through Patreon, that is equal parts awesome and amazing!!! Thank you. \u2665 But I want you to know that if you can\u0027t, \u00a0I am still so grateful for you taking the time to read this really long post and for sharing my journey with me. I believe our time on this earth is truly precious and you just chose to spend a portion of yours reading my story. It means a lot to me - thank you so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to share my new music and videos with you! I really hope you like them. Thanks again \u2665\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest wishes,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKatara\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
