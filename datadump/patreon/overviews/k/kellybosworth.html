    "summary": "Hey all, welcome to our\u00a0guitar-playing, music-making, harmony-singing community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started teaching Folk Guitar \u0026amp; Singing classes in January of 2016, I had no idea how much joy and fulfillment I would get from the weekly classes. I loved being a part of the amazing and challenging process of learning a new instrument and getting the chance to share my deep love of music and group singing and harmonizing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I have moved away from my hometown of Portland, Oregon to pursue a Master\u0027s degree in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://folkethno.webhost.iu.edu/scripts/index.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEthnomusicology at Indiana University\u003c/a\u003e, I wanted to find some way to stay connected to those of you who want to continue playing guitar and learning in the style of the Folk Guitar \u0026amp; Singing classes. You have lots of resources at your disposal -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://artichokemusic.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArtichoke Music\u003c/a\u003e, YouTube, each other, guitar books, online chord charts - and I hope you will use any and all of those that inspire you and keep you playing. This Patreon page is another resource for you, particularly suited for people who want new material - good songs with simple chords. Each month, I will choose one folky song from my vault of favorite songs, write up a patented* Kelly Bosworth chord chart, and record a video of me playing and describing some of the tricks and skills. I\u0027ll do my best to choose songs that I think will continue to offer new challenges but also be accessible. And there will be opportunities to request songs or vote on options.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is no replacement for in-person gatherings. I do hope that there will be meet ups in Portland among Folk Guitar \u0026amp; Singing students and/or sing-a-longs with family and friends. Hopefully, the supply of new songs can be fodder for meet-ups as well as for personal practice. And certainly when I\u0027m home in Portland, we will have a big ole HOOTENANNY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy most sincere hope for this page it that it will encourage more music in all of our lives. When we make music together, we are vulnerable, we are aware, we are challenged, we are encouraged, we are supportive and supported, and we have fun!\u00a0I believe deeply in the role of music to foster goodwill and build community and I feel like what we\u0027ve all built together is a special thing. This online forum is only as good as we make it, so I appreciate you coming here to check it out and I\u0027m excited for the possibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting me while I go off and explore this new angle to my own music-making. Perhaps the only thing more financially tenuous than performing folk music is studying folk music, and I certainly appreciate the financial support while I pursue this degree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make some music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eKelly\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*My chord charts are not actually patented in any way! Patent pending.**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**That\u0027s not true either. No patent pending."
