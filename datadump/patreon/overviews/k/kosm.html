    "summary": "Hiya, I\u0027m kosm! I write fiction - right now, I mainly write quests, which is basically interactive fiction where I have live writing sessions online (generally at a site called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/user/kosm\"\u003efiction.live\u003c/a\u003e), posting a couple pages at a time, while a chatroom full of readers discusses the story and votes on what the main character should do next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting has been a dream of mine for a long time, but I\u0027ve only really started putting content out there on the internet recently. The main quest I write, a story called Mind Control University Class 420, is a battle royale (with a fair amount of smut) in a supernatural university setting. Reviews have been really kind - people have said that it\u0027s a great blend of feels, fights, intrigue, and smut, and that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m going for! I also have recently started a collection of snippets and side stories that I add to every now and then, just for fun, which can also be found on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/user/kosm\"\u003efiction.live\u003c/a\u003e profile.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started writing MCU 420 over last summer, I had a live writing session almost every night. Nowadays, I\u0027m a lot busier, and have a lot less time I can dedicate towards quest writing instead of working on other things. If you like my writing, please consider supporting me on here! Every pledge goes towards a milestone where I\u0027ll do more live sessions per week, every week, and the financial support really helps me! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to supporting me monthly, you can commission me for short stories, bonus scenes, or alternate paths on quests! Commissions cost $10 per 500 words, and I reserve the right to decline commissions if need be, such as if I\u0027m too swamped to get around to it at the present time. It\u0027s up to you whether your commission will be for you only or if you\u0027d like it to be posted publicly. If you\u0027re interested in commissions, or would like to make a one-time donation instead of supporting me monthly, I have a business paypal you can use - paypal.me/kosmwrites. Please also get in touch with me through patreon\u0027s messaging to talk about the details of your commission so that I know what you\u0027re going for and what you\u0027re interested in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your support! \u0026lt;3 I hope you enjoy my writing!\u003cbr\u003e"
