    "summary": "After spending years in art school and painting what I was told to paint, I was left unsatisfied with  my artwork. Pieces would often go unfinished for days, weeks, months, even years. Until i did a study on modern art and Jackson Pollock. I was asked to recreated work in his style, and during that i found myself feeling freedom in this style. It was much more expressive in ways that I had never found anywhere else. I myself personally see the world, people, and energies much differently than everyone else. Everyone is a canvas and keeps their true picture hidden underneath. Over time what we feel, what we think, what we go through in life leaves bits of color, energy, and light on us all. Each one of these paintings are from different environments, moods and energies I have encountered within the last year. The process in creating each piece is unique in itself as well. To find the colors I scour the clearance sections of \"oops paint\" in hardware stores. So you never know what colors you will find. Many of these paints were mixed improperly so they each react with the other paints differently. Some paint runs thick, others runny, and they all fall from the brush differently. The selections of color for each canvas and the way the paint reacts together, makes each piece very different from the last."
