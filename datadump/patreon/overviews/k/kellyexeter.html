    "summary": "So - the video pretty much says it all in just over a minute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeven years ago I was overwhelmed, depressed and considering an exit from this world because meeting the high standards I set for myself in every aspect of life meant life had gotten too hard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still here, however, so what changed? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I figured out how to balancing striving with life. I figured out how to chase big goals while still being present for my family and friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially my blog and books took readers along on that journey with me. Today, I\u0027m in a pretty good place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich means my book and blog writing\u00a0now focuses on finding out what problems my readers are having right now, and offering up solutions for those problems based on research and my experience of \u0027how life actually works\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY THIS PATREON PAGE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than selling my books, I\u0027ve never monetised my blog in any way. No ads. No sponsored posts. No spruiking of other people\u0027s stuff. And ... I\u0027d like to keep it that way. I love writing in the space I do. I love the people who read my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only problem is, I write a lot in my day job. (The job that puts money in my bank account and pays for things like food and shelter.) And that doesn\u0027t leave a lot of creative energy for writing on my blog, and writing books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to change that if I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love the writing I do on my blog, to fund more writing on my blog. Hence this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy what I do, would like me to do more, and have disposable income to spare, look right and you\u0027ll see some options for supporting me financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have money to spare but would still like to show your support, this page on my site offers some ideas :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
