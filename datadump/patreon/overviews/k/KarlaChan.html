I often use paper textures and brushes using Photoshop to add backgrounds to my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be able to make a living out of my art one day and it is a pretty big dream of mine. So hopefully I can carry on working hard to do that. Maybe Patreon can give me a little step towards that? I do also love socialising and networking with other artists and would love to make friends on here as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
