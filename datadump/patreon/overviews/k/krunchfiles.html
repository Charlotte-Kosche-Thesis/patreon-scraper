    "summary": "My life is crazy. \u00a0Sometimes literally. \u00a0I make awful decisions and have a complete disregard for what people think of me. It makes for some good stories. The difference between most people and I is that I\u0027m not too ashamed to tell them. And for that reason, I started a blog (\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/%E2%80%8Bhttp://krunchfiles.weebly.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://krunchfiles.weebly.com\u003c/a\u003e) about 1.5 years ago. Shockingly enough, The site statistics show that people still visit this site regularly despite my tendency to update the site monthly or less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor that reason, I\u0027d like to give ya\u0027ll a REASON to keep checking back. I have ideas, but unfortunately, they all cost money, and I barely have enough income to pay the bills as is. \u00a0Do I expect to make enough off of this to fund my adventures? Definitely not, but every little bit helps. I did, however, pick up a second job with the on-demand app Favor to give me a little boost. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money I receive from this would be an extra little tip to help fund my adventures and curiosities. Read more details on the site itself! That, and naturally, it would be lovely to actually have a site that I pay for monthly so I can be added to search engines and we can drop the annoying \u0027weebly\u0027 from the URL.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://krunchfiles.weebly.com/what-am-i-doing-with-my-life/patreon\"\u003ehttp://krunchfiles.weebly.com/what-am-i-doing-with...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for everyone who takes the time to read it as it is, even if it\u0027s just so you can laugh at how dumb I am, and how much better in life you THINK you\u0027re doing than I.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u0026gt;"
