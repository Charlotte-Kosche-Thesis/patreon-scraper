    "summary": "So what\u0027s the deal with me? I make games critique, plain and simple. I take a video game and analyze it, sometimes with a specific goal or point in mind, and sometimes as just a general analysis of the product. Lately I\u0027ve been trying to make more videos about current games, but when I can\u0027t find anything to say in that regard, I fall back on my retrospectives. For my retrospectives I pick a game series or franchise, and create a series of videos discussing how each compares to one another, as well as how each game has held up over time. I do this to get a better understanding of how said series could evolve, or in the case of lesser known series, I do it to document the artistic integrity of the work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what you\u0027re getting if you decide to become a patron. I don\u0027t exactly have a lot of free time to offer any crazy rewards for your pledges, but I hope the rewards you see give you enough reason to want to spend money. Just know that even if you can\u0027t spare a dollar, I completely understand. Honestly, all that matters to me is that you cared enough to consider it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much, all of you, for supporting me in my endeavors to make YouTube my career! My name has been KingK, and I hope you have some well-deserved fun today!\u003cbr\u003e"
