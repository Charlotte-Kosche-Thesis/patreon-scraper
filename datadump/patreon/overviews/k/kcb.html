My name is KCB, and I\u2019m a creator and storyteller\u2014whether those stories are in written, comic, or game form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kmcooper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PatreonWriting.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve self-published a novella called \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hub-City-Survival-K-Cooper/dp/0557299861\"\u003eHub City Survival\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027m working on \u003ca href=\"https://www.inkshares.com/books/mushroom-and-anchovy\"\u003ecrowdfunding my next novel\u003c/a\u003e. Writing is my main bag, whether it\u0027s fiction or poetry--most of my work involves writing at its core, no matter what kind of project it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributing to my Patreon means that I get to continue to work on projects such as these with the hope that they may one day reach the light! If you contribute $15 or more a month, I will send you a copy of Hub City Survival.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kmcooper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PatreonComics.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t really expect life would lead me to draw a webcomic, if I\u0027m honest with you. I always wanted to and always \u003cem\u003etried\u003c/em\u003e to, but after some time, I would always fall off the wagon. After several years of trying, I started to feel like I could never make my art good enough to make a decent comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter my\u00a0ongoing webcomic, \u003ca href=\"http://retailhellcomic.tumblr.com\"\u003eRetail Hell\u003c/a\u003e. I had written out the whole plot--a summary in 5 arcs--character descriptions and all. I was ready to go. All I needed was an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted the story to be told in its entirety--I didn\u0027t want it to just be a webcomic about working retail. It was going to be a real labour of love to release 1-2 comics a week for what would most likely be the next 5+ years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027m sure you can guess, there wasn\u0027t really an artist who was interested in devoting that much time and effort into somebody else\u0027s project with no promise of pay. So that was when I decided to pick up a pen and start doing it myself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of June 2017, Retail Hell will be going strong for 2 years of Wednesday updates. With your contributions, I hope to be able to extend that to a 2-day-a-week update!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kmcooper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PatreonBlogging.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI maintain a couple of blogs: \u003ca href=\"http://thisindiegameblog.blogspot.ca\"\u003ethisindiegameblog\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://kmcooper.ca/my-life-in-writing/\"\u003emy personal blog\u003c/a\u003e.
