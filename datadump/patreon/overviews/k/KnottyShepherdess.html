Whether it\u0027s needle felting, hand dyeing, sewing, painting, papercrafting, casting, polymer clay,\u00a0 you name it. I\u00a0don\u0027t think there is a makers art that I\u0027m not interested in. And I want to do so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do super detailed cosplays with a twist, I want to sew while the embroidery machine is working on something else, I want to felt Viking coats, start a line of hand dyed yarn, vend more art shows, start making tutorial videos, and add 3d printing to my resume; just to name a few things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money will go towards supplies, tools, equipment, basic cost of living stuff, feeding and caring for my sheep in the best possible manner. I do have a partial geriatric herd so they require a little extra care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can offer you my knowledge in the form of tutorials, experiments, mistakes, test pieces, photos and anecdotes. Eventually I want to add video tutorials and upload some of my drafted patterns too. I want to keep growing, keep learning and most of all keep making."
