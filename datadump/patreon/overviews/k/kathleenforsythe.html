    "summary": "Hi everyone...I know some of you know me as an artist.  My real passion, however, is writing and I have been working for 20 years, yes, that\u0026#8217;s right, 20 years on a novel trilogy.  I have had the first novel complete in first draft for 5 years but I have been too busy working at my career job to be able to make it available.  I want to share it with you, as first readers, in return for your active support of my creativity to complete the trilogy and publish it online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working in my career for over 40 years and I have just retired from fulltime work.  But my government pension isn\u0027t enough to live and write on so I do still need to work.  But I don\u0027t want working to take any more of my creative vision.  I know my novel trilogy is important to the world especially at this time so I am looking for your help in supporting me to write and make my work available on the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe trilogy is called the Aisling of Gaia ...Aisling is an irish word that means dream or vision. The first novel, the Emerald Matrix is set in Canada, Ireland and China and deals with a deep mystery that could affect the future of our world.  It\u0026#8217;s hard to describe my genre but existential mystery and fantasy might do it.  The second novel is called the Golden Room and the third Star People.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in the multiverse and the many dimensions in which we seem to live, then you may love my stories...the mysteries of Dimensia,  including a dragon called Dera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was really excited when Alexander McCall Smith, one of my writing heroes , serialized his novels in a newspaper and made them available simultaneously as short written episodes as well as podcasts.  I am ready to do this as well and I think people will love to hear the novels read in my voice as much as reading them.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am turning to Patreon to ask for your commitment to support my creativity.  You will get to be one of the first to read the draft 1 episodes of the Emerald Matrix and to give me feedback.  Your input may actually affect and change the novels and I will credit you, if you want, on my website when it is ready.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I am able to attract enough of you to support me and my writing, I will be able to supplement my pension so I can devote more of my time to completing the trilogy...I am hoping to addict my supporters to the episodes  so you will keep funding me and pushing me to continue to finish this amazing story...and to make it available to a world that needs the imagination required to survive...to a world that needs hope!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon\u0026#8230;it is a way for ordinary people to support what and who they love.  If you\u0027re even the least bit curious even the smallest amount will help  $2 an episode is the minimum and you can set your upper limit per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does that help me\u0026#8230;?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I have much of the Emerald Matrix complete, I am starting with this offering and my goals are modest...If I am successful in seducing you and your friends ( yes, please share liberally on social media) then my goals become more ambitious.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am offering is multidimensional as well.  I want to share the episodes of  the Emerald Matrix and then I want to make them into podcasts and share this too.  I will illustrate some of the novel  with my art and I will share this as well.  I want to make a website so these can be accessed. With your support I will finish the remaining two novels and make them available as episodes and podcasts too! \u00a0 Thanks everyone for your support! \u00a0Kathleen\u003cbr\u003e"
