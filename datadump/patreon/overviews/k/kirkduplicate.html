    "summary": "Hello everyone! I\u0027ve been pursuing art as a personal hobby for a long time through personal study. It\u0027s been one of those things where I have had people say I should try taking it to the next level in a career sense, but it\u0027s hard to find where to start with that. One of the wonders of the Internet is the wealth of support and advice that tells you to not only bury yourself in your craft and keep your passion alive but to also not be afraid of sharing even the smallest daily sketch with the world. Patreon takes this and elevates this, so I\u0027m giving it a try and taking a step up to this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve usually engaged myself in character and fashion design sketch work with fanart jumbled into the mix. Recently, I\u0027ve been diving deeper into the massively amazing comic book world, something I didn\u0027t explore when I was younger. As I\u0027ve become attached to different projects and engaged with creators at ECCC and Sakura-con, I\u0027ve discovered that I\u0027d like to push myself harder into my art. I\u0027d like to learn how to set up scenes and backgrounds, build worlds, create the illusion of perspective, and fine tune my grasp on anatomy. I want to improve and apply these skills, maybe someday, to the application of illustrating my own comic in the future. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the fourth quarter of 2016, I\u0027ve become even more serious and have delved into doing art commissions! If you\u0027d like to support me outside of patreon, my art commission information is \u003ca href=\"http://kirkduplicate.dreamwidth.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eover here\u003c/a\u003e!

I have two adorably fluffy pet cats (Maine Coons), and I am united in perpetual cheesy romance a la a legalized union with my partner. As a super queer transman, the LGBTQIA+ community is super important to me, especially not only it\u0027s representation in the arts, but a respectful representation as well. I definitely believe that we need more women and queer people in the comic book industry, among others, because visibility helps empower the younger members of our community.\u003cbr\u003e",
