I never expected myself to meet so many amazing people from all over the world through streaming. I am so grateful for everything that has happened up till now. Although I may have only met some you recently, time is not important. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime does not define strong a connection can be as it really is defined by the love and care that we all show for one another. There can be people that you just met yesterday that will want so much for you in comparison to someone you may have known all your life. You guys are those people to me. It doesn\u0027t matter how long you\u0027ve known me or my stream because we have all impacted each other\u0027s lives in some way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that there are many of you who reached out to me when I was feeling at my lowest points and I really wish I had the courage and time to keep doing the same for everyone. The one thing that holds me back is that I\u0027m scared of showing my weaknesses to everyone because I want to be someone that everyone can lean on. I know that I may not have been able to get back to everyone who has tried to reach out to me or just let me know that they care but please do know that I cherish those messages you send. Instead, I really hope that my write-ups have been able to make up for the time that was lost or the words that were never said directly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that I can continue to impact everyone\u0027s lives in a positive way because your happiness is also mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not plan on giving up my dream of full time streaming for everyone and I hope that this can help us support that goal. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKireiAutumn\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
