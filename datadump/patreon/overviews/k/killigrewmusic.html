I\u0027ve recently moved 1500 kilometers (900 miles) away from my family through oceans and borders to settle at my own little place in the mountains as an independant artist following his heart. If you resonate with this idea then you\u0027re more than welcome to join me!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can read further and see the rewards on the side. It goes without saying that I dont wan\u0027t you feel obliged to do anything. But if you choose to become my Patreon I will be VERY grateful and have a much easier road ahead of me while I keep writing new material so I don\u0027t have to rely solely on one form of income. I hope that you find this a sensible and honorable cause. If not, that\u0027s okay. My music will most likely always remain free to use but I will work hard to do my Patreons proud as your support will keep me going through winter.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eIn the past 12 months I\u2019ve\ncompleted and released three full length albums. Now that\u2019s a lot of work and it\nwouldn\u2019t be possible without your support. For years I\u2019ve made music because\nit\u2019s the love of my life. I discovered that 10 years ago as a boy who couldn\u2019t\nplay a single instrument. I sacrificed a lot small things in my life in order\nto practise every day until I wrote my first piano album in 2011. Later that\nyear I started my Youtube channel and I\u2019ve made seven chillstep albums since then. In the\npast few years Spotify has grown and many of you have my songs in your\nplaylists. I\u2019m so very grateful for that support in an age where very few\npeople buy albums. For over two years this has been my only income while living\nwith my father. Even though I\u2019ve been applying for a lot of jobs I\u2019ve yet to be\noffered anything. Mainly because I lack the education or the experience. Music\nis the one thing I\u2019m proud of. I don\u2019t know what else I should be doing. I\u2019m\nnot joking when I say, if you have an offer for me please let me know. I would\nlove the opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA little more than a month ago I decided to follow my heart and leave my\nhomeland of Sweden for southern Poland. Introduced to the beauty of the Tatra\nmountains by my beloved Aleksandra I knew I would find a lot of inspiration\nthere. My income is just enough to cover my monthly rent but due to the nature\nof being an independant artist I would like to do more and in the process\nhopefully have more than one lifeline and start uploading on a weekly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t want to make anyone feel obligated to\ngive me anything. It\u2019s very important for me that you understand that. I\u2019m\nopening a Patreon as a way for you to directly support me and the future of\nthis channel. I don\u2019t know what to expect. I made a Patreon 4 years ago but I\nnever dared to go though with it. But today with more than 20.000 subscribers if\nonly 100 would support me on Patreon I would be able to pursue music as a full-time\njob. However, I wish to make it worth your while and give back to the\ncommunity. I therefore have some exciting news. Weekly tutorials where I will\nattempt a trial song while carefully taking you through each step and why I do\ncertain things. Weekly or bi-weekly artist spotlight where I hopefully\nintroduce you to a talented but perhaps unknown producer. This could be a great\nway to find new and beautiful music. I will also try my hardest to release\nindividual songs again instead of albums at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll \"Spiritual Journey\" Patreons will\nget my current and future releases in the the highest possible quality of your\ndesire (MP3/FLAC/WAV) aswell as MIDI and FLP\u2019s (I don\u2019t have older FLP\u2019s\nsadly). You will also get the exclusive dropbox \u201dvault\u201d folder where I put all\nmy demo\u2019s so you can hear the newest ideas. I want to add more goodies and\nperks as time goes on. You can request anything your heart desires on the\ncommunity board. If you have any questions please don\u0027t hesitate to let me\nknow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery 1$ raised here helps me as much as 1000 views on Youtube and goes directly to releasing new songs and making educational videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart\u003c/em\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eThank you! \u003c/strong\u003eNone of this would be possible unless someone believed in me.

In the end I enjoy songs with enchanting intros and catchy choruses. It doesn\u0027t really matter what genre it is as long as it\u0027s meaningful for me.\u003cbr\u003eIf I would describe my music in one sentence, it would be \"Finding hope in hopelessness...\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired by symphonic metal I composed melancholic piano music for roughly three years (2009-2011) before I found a completely new side of music in the genre of melodic dubstep and especially in the works of Blackmill. It greatly influenced me to pursue to make my piano songs... something more, something deeper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music has a quite strong connection to the beautiful scenery I grew up in. Deep forests embraced by foggy lakes like pearls in an ocean of trees. My beloved Northland. With my music I simply want to take you there with me.\u003cbr\u003e",
