In Europe, kings, queens, the aristocracy and members of the Royal Court were often patron of the arts, providing artists, musicians, poets, sculptors, and other such talented individuals, with financial support in exchange for the prestige these donations often granted them. These donations were often used by patrons to endorse their own social position or political ambitions. In fact, if you do your research, you\u2019ll find that patronage dates back to the Ancient Romans. It looked a little different then, but the purpose of endorsement still served a similar purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a place where you can be a \u003cem\u003epatron\u003c/em\u003e to me, if you believe in me and my work.\u003cbr\u003eThis is for those of you who would like to support creators like me who consistently create stuff that you want to see more of.  Your much-needed help will allow me to create images on a consistent basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY BE A PATRON?\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBecause you REALLY enjoy viewing what I\u0027ve already created, and believe in what I will create in the future. You recognize the sacrifice and hard work put into my images, and understand that it\u0027s an uphill struggle to be a self-sustaining artist. You pay to see movies, right? Well, this is the same thing- only it\u0027s photos.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://karenjerzykphoto.zenfolio.com/img/s5/v126/p3847190-4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating my images is not only hard work, but at times, very expensive. Travel, equipment, travel, props, materials- all these costs add up, and sometimes makes my job hard on me (after all, creating images is my job, but I sometimes don\u0027t get paid to do what I do). For example, my recent \"colors\" series is quite time and money consuming. I completely re-paint my tiny studio room with every shoot, along with furniture. Each shoot requires 2 gallons of paint, which is around 60-70 dollars total. Furniture and props can run anywhere from 50-100, and wardrobe can run just as much. Most of the time, I lose money creating my art. Every little donation helps me to continue to create images. Even a dollar is much appreciated!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I decided to make this a subscription service of sorts for those who enjoy my work, and would like to continue to see me create it. Patrons will get access to special prints sales, content seen only here, and behind the scenes videos of my shoots, including some of my tips and tricks. I\u0027d like to share the magic exclusively with patrons who support my work. Want to know how I set up my shoot? The entire process? How I come up with ideas? You can also interact with me and ask questions about my shoots, that I will happily answer. Thank you for the support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://karenjerzykphoto.zenfolio.com/img/s6/v145/p1347126657-4.jpg\"\u003e"

     "about": "Hi! I\u0027m Karen.For as long as I can remember, I\u0027ve always had the urge to create art. I was an 80s kid and was lucky enough to have parents that allowed me to grow up surrounded by art- they never put limits on what I watched, read, or listened to. My fondest memories as a kid were from filling my kind with almost every movie imaginable. The Neverending Story, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, Edward Scissorhands, The Shining, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Return To Oz were just a few influential movies I would watch over and over again when I was a kid. I was enamored with the magical worlds that were created, and tried to fill my life with the same dreamlike wonder. \u003cbr\u003eAs I grew older I was influenced by film even more. In 7th grade, one of my close friends had inherited a clunky VHS camcorder that we used to make short stop animation films. We would spend our time after school feverishly building mini sets and clay people, making copies of our movies to hand out to classmates. \u003cbr\u003eI was very athletic and played a sport every season in high school, which didn\u0027t allow for much time to make short films, although I did it when I could (but unfortunately wasn\u0027t very often). This is around the time I had an interest in theater, and took as many theater classes that my high school had to offer. When it was time to go to college, I was only 17 (I had turned 18 only a few short months before my first semester), and financially could not afford film school. I got my BA in English with a minor in Theater. While I was in college, I started to really become obsessed with music. I went to more and more concerts, and started sneaking cameras into shows via my underwear. This led to me building up somewhat of a portfolio, and over time, allowed me to start getting legit photo passes to photograph concerts. I did this from about 2003-2011. Somewhere at the tail end, around 2009, a friend suggested that I \"try shooting people\". I gave it a shot, and took what I now consider terrible portraits (geez, I was so bad when I first started) to start my portrait/fine art portfolio. My pictures were mediocre at best, and really had no rhyme or reason to them.\u003cbr\u003eWhile browsing the internet one day, I saw a photo of the (now demolished) Norwich State Hospital theater. It took my breath away. I couldn\u0027t believe places like that existed. That single solitary photo birthed my obsession with abandoned places. I saw it as a whole new element to my photos- it was 50 percent of the photo- to me, the location became just as important as the person in it. I started shooting models exclusively in abandoned locations. Although, something was missing. Meaning. Feeling. Heart. Soul. \u003cbr\u003eThis changed in 2011, when my father unexpectedly passed away. Being an only child, and very close to my father, this was extremely traumatizing, both physically and mentally. I was a complete mess. My present and my future seemed bleak. Emotionally, I was struggling. I wasn\u0027t doing well at all. I realized I could either crumble and let the grief consume me, or I could pick my camera back up and find meaning in my life again. When I started shooting again (I hadn\u0027t taken a photo for about 3 months after my father died), something was different. My soul was making a connection with my photos. Something \"clicked\", and what had been the most horrible experience in my life somehow turned out to be a blessing- which was very bittersweet. I saw things differently. I felt differently. I was using my photos for therapy- but not just to cope with my father\u0027s death, to cope with EVERYTHING that had happened to me in life. The bullying, the loneliness, the feeling of not belonging. I poured all of this into my work. In my darkest days, when  people awkwardly suggested I see a therapist, I would ignore their recommendations and pour every ounce of feeling into my photos. \u003cbr\u003ePhotography quite literally saved my life. And here I am today, a happier girl learning to channel her feelings into visions to share with everyone who understands and appreciates my work. Thank you for the support- you\u0027re not just supporting my craft, but my entire being as well \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e",
