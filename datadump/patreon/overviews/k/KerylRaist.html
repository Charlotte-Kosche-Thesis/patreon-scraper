Obviously, I want you to choose, specifically, I want you to choose me, and my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what I mean by this is that commercial fiction is a commodity. Commodities get marketed. Marketing means figuring out who wants your stuff and tailoring it as closely to that market\u0027s desires as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is great, if all you want is \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou like epic fantasies. Epic fantasies have a formula. The people who market epic fantasies will make sure that the epic fantasy they are offering you fits that formula. Knights, check. Dragons, check. Fight scenes, check. World building, check. Politics... sure, as least as much as is needed to get the dragons and knights into play, maybe a whole lot more. Love story... um... only in so much as it doesn\u0027t take away from the dragons. Sex... not in any real detail. Mystery... well, as long as it\u0027s dragon-related.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, say you want a serious love story to go with your epic fantasy. Well, romances have a formula, too. And in that formula, the romance is the plot line, and all that dragon stuff is just there to serve the romance plot. So, sure, you can have your dragons, but in a romance, the world building, the dragons, the politics... they only exist to get the main characters together. Of course, since getting Character A and Character B together is the plot of the story, once they\u0027re safely \"in love\" the story ends. But, what if you want the story to keep going after those characters get together?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr, say you want multiple plot lines all weaving into one huge picture? Romances don\u0027t have them, because the story is all about getting A and B together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if you want smoking hot sex scenes? Well, the romance will likely have them. A certain number of them, set at specific times in the story, for the specific purpose of getting those characters together. What if you want smoking hot sex scenes between people who have a fascinating, but settled, relationship. Or not much relationship at all?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what if you want it as part of an\u00a0epic fantasy, with proper world building, behind the scenes politics, and all the rest of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot a lot of books cater to that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what if you want all of that with illustration? If you like pictures, you\u0027ve got the option of graphic novels, which offer beautiful pictures, but tend to skimp on the things a written novel offer, like the thoughts and feelings of the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zBVRuMOWmFM/V8Ra4oyZeEI/AAAAAAAAQXI/6GjgmNJadPojPtPxh5SVfT2hXj6mUStRwCLcB/s1600/DaeGabePromo1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if you don\u0027t want to chose? What if you want it all?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if you want fiction that caters to your eyes, heart, balls, \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003ebrains?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got it for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShape-shifting dragon knights?

In spades.\u003cbr\u003eEvery style and flavor of sex? Oh yeah!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou want an immersive fantasy that caters to all of your desires?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe M\u0027Gy Dragons are coming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOkay, Keryl, you\u0027ve got my attention. What are the M\u0027Gy Dragons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for asking.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe M\u0027Gy Dragons is a serialized epic fantasy, following members of several clans through the rise and fall of empires.\u00a0The full story will span several novels worth of plot arcs and will continue to update for years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOkay, great, what\u0027s the plot?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComplicated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, in a very tiny nutshell: Conquering the world is hard, ruling it is worse, no one is a villain in his own mind, and just because you\u0027re a great hero doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll be a great king, and for that matter, just because you\u0027re a good king doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re a good man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a fight for a crown, for survival, and then, unlike most stories, there\u0027s no happily-ever-after where the wise king rides off into the sunset. It\u0027s not enough to win your lands, you\u0027ve got to rule them, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if the logistics, tactics, and reality of warfare are hard, keeping an entire continent locked together behind your rule is another level entirely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the story of the M\u0027Gy clan, from the battlefield, to high court, to the bedroom, and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
