Treating D\u0026amp;I as a side project is not only detrimental to my mental and physical health (resulting in working too much) but also doing a disservice to this incredibly important subject, hindering the possible positive impact I might have if given the time and headspace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI\u0027d like to focus on creating shareable educational resources that will help advance tech communities, organizations and the industry as a whole.
