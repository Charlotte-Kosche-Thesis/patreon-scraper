I\u0027ve been creating art since I was young and getting frustrated at my dad when he couldn\u0027t draw me a reference picture of a human, and instead drew just a stick figure. I\u0027ve always known art was for me, its as easy to me as breathing, although sometimes I have a coughing fit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve aided in many artistic endeavors; painting murals, portraits, participating in haunted houses and taking trips to see Urban Outfitters HQ and General Motors HQ,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to making tons of art for the rest of my life, I\u0027d love to spend time traveling!\u003cbr\u003eIf you see anything you like, or would like to request a commission, by all means contact me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of my Pre-College work will be available to the public, access to my College and Post-College works is limited to Patrons only. Thanks!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso check out my website, kaitlinlawless.wix.com/lawless\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnyhow, lets get to the point.\u003c/strong\u003e Art supplies are expensive! I will be using Patreon to help cover some of the costs of my artwork and also to get my stuff out there, even if you can only pledge a little, it\u0027s much appreciated."
