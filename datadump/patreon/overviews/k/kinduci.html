I began making online racing videos mainly for iracing in October of 2013 on YouTube and this has since grown to cover many racing and driving titles though iracing is still the core of my content..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do you want my money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer is quite simple. YouTube ad revenue is terrible. This is for a number of reasons. The first being that the advertising market on YouTube is not what it once was. CPM (Cost per 1000 views) has been steadily dropping over the years and it is becoming harder and harder for small channels like mine to make ends meet. The second reason is Adblock. On average two thirds of my viewership use Adblock. This drastically effects my income. In order to continue providing my viewers with content I need to be able to cover my expenses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I get for my money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe satisfaction of knowing you have enabled someone to live their dream, along with some high quality YouTube videos and ensuring the future of the channel.\u003cbr\u003e"
