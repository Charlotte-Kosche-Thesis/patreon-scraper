    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for fun and profit most of my life. I wrote and edited for an arts and entertainment publication in Maine, The Maine Edge. In my spare time, I write fantasy, horror and a sprinkling of science fiction. I\u0027ve been published in several print publications, including \"Cover of Darkness,\" (2007, edited by Tyree Campbell); \"Enchantments: The Many Facets of Magic\" (2009, edited by David Fitzpatrick); and \"Fragments\" (2015, edited by Mark Dupont). I\u0027m also a moderator at /r/SimplePrompts on reddit, a community that posts and responds to prompts that are geared towards simplicity to allow for a more open-ended response. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a gamer, I write for several Skyrim Mods, including Beyond Skyrim: Morrowind; Awake: The Rise of Mannimarco; Black Horse Courier Reborn; and Prowler\u0027s Profit: Immersive Clues to the Stones of Barenziah.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past five years, I\u0027ve included my kids in my craft in some way, shape or form. I had a weekly column about raising triplets in the Edge, and one of my major projects \u003cem\u003eThe Adventures of Vanilla Bean, Mr. Mister, and Miss Pumpkin\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0are fairy tale-style vignettes with triplet protagonists. I find it fun and inspiring to riff off of their view of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere you Come In\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe publishing world is tricky. Making people with specific tastes fall in love with your work is challenging and, at times, frustrating. Many places are happy to take your writing, but not pay able to pay for the content. I believe art should be supported and with your support, I will turn around and support other artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to have an interactive relationship with my audience. Give me your prompts, your Elder Scrolls head-canon, your crazy setting and I\u0027ll tell you a tale. In addition to responding to my Patrons, I will post original content here first, before anyone outside of my alpha readers and editor. I\u0027ll keep you updated if any of my work gets published independently. As my support base grows, I\u0027ll be able to give you my larger projects, including my middle-grade fiction series and my fantasy series. Mostly, I just want to give you quality fantasy, horror, humor and science fiction and hope you get your money\u0027s worth."
