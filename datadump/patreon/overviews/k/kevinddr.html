    "summary": "My name is Kevin Birrell and I\u0027ve been playing, collecting, fixing, and breaking 90s Japanese arcade games, pinball machines, and retro consoles for a little over a decade. In this time, I\u0027ve accumulated a vast amount of knowledge about these games, the history behind them, the hardware that is required to run them, and also a significant amount of skill at many of them. I truly believe many of these games design-wise are miles ahead of anything else that\u0027s ever been released and I want everyone else to have the chance to enjoy them as much as I have. I was thinking recently about the fact that the information on these games (both how to play them and how to find them and keep them running) is pretty sparse or at the very least difficult for newcomers to find without trawling through hundreds of 10-year-old forum posts filled with broken links to supposedly useful diagrams and videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been competitive at many games from music games to Tetris (the first TGM3 Grand Master outside of Japan) to pinball (currently ranked 15th in the world) to Crazy Taxi and many others as well. However, I\u0027m starting to find that I have less interest in playing these games and trying to improve my records than I do for helping others start their own journeys with these wonderful games. With a small decline in my health over the last few years, fighting for world records and grinding away for weeks and months on end for marginal improvements in games I\u0027ve played for more than half my life is not appealing to me as much anymore. However, I feel an obligation to those who are coming into the community after me to help them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my time playing these games, I relied heavily on information provided by helpful people on the internet. I\u0027m hoping I can do the same with the knowledge I\u0027ve acquired and finally put together some interesting and useful videos for everyone ranging from arcade/pinball scene newcomers\u00a0to experts. Additionally, for topics that better lend themselves to blog posts (or topics that lend themselves well to both), I\u0027d like to start writing high quality articles as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll primarily be covering the following areas of knowledge:\u003cbr\u003e- 90s Japanese arcade games (\"JAMMA\" era up to Naomi and early JVS)\u003cbr\u003e- Candy cabinets (Japanese sit-down generic arcade cabinets)\u003cbr\u003e- Pinball game rule information and strategy\u003cbr\u003e- CRT monitor / TV technology, repair, and information\u003cbr\u003e- Video game / arcade game / pinball capture and live streaming technology\u003cbr\u003e- The \"location\" arcade/pinball scene here in Seattle as well as other cities that I frequently travel to\u003cbr\u003e- Anything else that you know I know about, but I haven\u0027t mentioned here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I would like to spend my days and nights making videos and writing about my passion for free, it is realistically just not possible for me. If you already know me you probably know that I don\u0027t really like half-assing anything that I do, so just putting out the occasional rushed video here and there when I have time (see: almost never) isn\u0027t something I\u0027m interested in doing. If I do this, I\u0027m going to do it right, and that takes a lot of time and consequently money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. I\u0027m looking to produce 3 or 4 (or maybe more) 20-30 minute (or maybe longer; we will see how it works out) videos a month and blog posts covering everything I know that others might find useful or interesting. If you think this would be something you want to see come to fruition, your support would be vastly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
