    "summary": "Hi there! \u00a0My name is Kari, and I\u0027m a writer. \u00a0I know, I know, who isn\u0027t, right? \u00a0At the moment, I\u0027m mostly producing fanfiction, but I\u0027ve got some original things in the works, too. \u00a0I\u0027m hoping that if people enjoy my fanfiction, they\u0027ll enjoy my original works as well. \u00a0Ideally, people will enjoy my writing enough that I can do less of the work I don\u0027t want to do, and more of the work that we can all enjoy: the creative stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I have a long-running Kingdom Hearts fanfiction I\u0027m most dedicated to, but I have several other fandoms I have written fic for in the past, or have ideas/unfinished works for currently, including but not limited to How to Train Your Dragon, Wreck-it Ralph, Love Live!, Tenchi Muyo!, Digimon Adventure, Firefly, The X Files, and Dragon Age. \u00a0I also have three original stories I\u0027m fiddling with. \u00a0Genres for my original works are sort of sci-fant or urban fantasy with a focus on magic in a modern setting and/or steampunk themes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, what it boils down to is this: I love to create, but I also have to pay bills and eat and other such obnoxious aspects of being a real live human being, which sadly mandates that I have a crappy full time job. \u00a0If some loyal patrons can help defray the costs of being alive, then maybe my crappy full time job can become a crappy part time job, and i can create things more, and then we all win, right? \u00a0I\u0027m kind of new to this Patreon thing, and I\u0027m not sure what people want, so the rewards system is absolutely fluid, and if you\u0027re hankering for something specific, please don\u0027t hesitate to let me know what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I don\u0027t have a firm specific schedule I can offer, since my job situation has just changed, but I can say I will have a full chapter of my Kingdom Hearts fic available once a month for patrons--each chapter averages at least 4k words. \u00a0Patrons will also have access to fanart and the occasional \u0027deleted scene\u0027, since there have been a few that didn\u0027t make it into the fic thus far. \u00a0All chapters of my ongoing fanfiction works will be posted to Patreon first, along with any additional content, which won\u0027t be crossposted at all. \u00a0If patrons have a request for content in another fandom I\u0027m familiar with or have worked with in the past, I can definitely try and work some of that in as well! \u00a0Requests are welcome, though I can\u0027t guarantee I know your favorite canon or ship your rarepair. \u00a0You never know unless you ask, though, right? \u00a0If you like the way I write, tell me about your faves, and who knows? \u00a0Maybe that\u0027ll be my next new fandom I\u0027m creating 100k long fics for. \u00a0I\u0027m sure stranger things have happened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I also do crafting work, but Patreon doesn\u0027t have the option to appear in multiple categories, so I\u0027m just gonna do what I do best and \u003cem\u003eget creative (eyyyyy)! \u00a0\u003c/em\u003eSome of the higher reward tiers include customized craft/accessory items, all of which are handmade and several of which are one of a kind. \u00a0Even if you\u0027re not here for any of the fandoms I write for, you could still support me and get some cool stuff out of it, so why not have a look at what I have to offer? \u00a0You can see some of my craftwork at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/FindYourWayCrafts\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy Store\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0There are art rewards, too! \u00a0You can see my art at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hikarisama.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDevArt Page\u003c/a\u003e, and more recent pieces are uploaded here as well. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re still here, thank you so much for reading my little manifesto, and I hope you\u0027ll hang around to see what I can create for you!\u00a0 Many many thanks to my current patrons, I love you all and you are like 97% of my motivation to keep writing.\u00a0 \u2665\u003cbr\u003e"
