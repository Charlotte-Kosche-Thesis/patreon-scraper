I\u0027ve published 4 novels and more than a dozen short stories\u2014even a poem\u2014through Warner and Orbit Books USA and various anthologies and magazines. (Two examples of my short stories can be found \u003ca href=\"https://www.apex-magazine.com/enemy-state/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/a-good-home/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.) My first novel \u003cem\u003eWarchild\u003c/em\u003e won the Warner Aspect First Novel Contest, where Tim Powers was the judge. I\u0027m a John W. Campbell Award nominee for Best New Writer and a Prix Aurora Award winner from my home country of Canada. Two of my novels were finalists for the Philip K. Dick Award. A couple of my short stories have appeared in Best Of anthologies. But it\u0027s not enough. Novelists take weeks and months to create a work. In that space of time, we usually aren\u0027t getting paid. Here\u0027s where you come in.\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nIt\u0027s a tale as old as time and the reason a site like Patreon is a \npossible relief for artists of all types. We would love to make a living\n doing what we love. As it stands, I teach and edit, both things that I enjoy doing but writing is my heart and soul\u2014and like many people, I have a mortgage and other monthly living expenses. I would love to travel occasionally for experience and inspiration. It would be cool even to go on research sabbaticals once in a while. But none of that is easy time-wise or inexpensive.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s not like I wouldn\u0027t write anyway\u2014of course I do and will! But what patrons like yourself allow is the ability for a writer to make a living even in the research and development stages of a book, which is the most time consuming part of the process and generally the least compensated.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat do YOU get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nFor those who love my science fiction universe created through \u003cem\u003eWarchild\u003c/em\u003e and its sequels, or would like to be involved in it anew through this Patreon, you will get access to monthly exclusive content: vignettes from the universe, short stories, and an independent serial novel based in the same universe\u2014in other words, you get to read a novel as it\u0027s written chapter by chapter! This is part fun experiment for me and partly a way to give to my readers as close an experience as following your favorite TV show might provide. Familiar characters will appear and hijinks will ensue!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will also be hosting monthly Q\u0026amp;As for a dialogue about any of my writing\u2014the projects specifically for this Patreon or my writing in general\u2014as well as giving patrons sneak peeks to draft content from \u003cem\u003eThe Warboy\u003c/em\u003e, the direct sequel to \u003cem\u003eWarchild\u003c/em\u003e and the return of \u003cem\u003eWarchild\u003c/em\u003e\u0027s point-of-view protagonist, Jos Musey. Other possible rewards like signed book copies are outlined to the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEngagement and dialogue with my readers has always been important to me. Over the years I\u0027ve received countless messages from dedicated readers expressing their love of my characters and worlds, as well as how these characters and their stories have affected or changed them as individuals. Through this Patreon I will give back that dedication and provide the best writing and interaction I can in order to foster this community and make it grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow onto the writing, reading, and conversation!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
