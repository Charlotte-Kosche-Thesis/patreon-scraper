    "summary": "Hi! My name is Goran, a.k.a. Konniver, and I am the creator of Elven Architect: a website that provides tools and information for Elvenar, the popular fantasy city builder game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the site\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a keen Elvenar player, I thought it\u0027d be a good challenge to build a tool to aid with city planning. I started development back in 2015, as a means to learn and experiment new web technologies. My efforts continued into 2016 when the website launched to the player community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTwo years on, the website is now home to many tools, most notably: a city planner that allows players to build and optimize their layouts, and a battle simulator where players can experiment with different army setups to increase their odds of success.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDespite my passion for programming, my enjoyment of the game, and my desire to continue working on the site and develop on additional tools, Elven Architect requires continuous effort (creating new features and improving existing ones); there are overheads that I also need to take into consideration: the main one being hosting and its incurring costs. Several upgrades were needed in order to support the growth in popularity. Pledging towards the site will assist towards its maintenance and growth, both in terms of functionality and capability.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd finally\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat started as a personal project has now become a frequently used tool by many fellow players from all over the world. I take this opportunity to express my most heartfelt gratitude to all the communities of Elvenar for their overwhelmingly positive response and support towards the site."
