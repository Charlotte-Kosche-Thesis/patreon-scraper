    "summary": "Hello and Welcome to the Kitchen Catastrophes Patreon Page!\nI\u2019m your author and Digital Tour-guide through the Modern version of the Medici\u2019s\nFlorence, Jon O\u2019Guin. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got some questions, but I can\u2019t hear\nthem, because the bugs I placed in your house stopped working months ago. So,\ninstead, I\u2019ll answer some general ones, and hope I mostly hit the mark:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you again?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eJon O\u2019Guin. We literally just met. I\u2019m the main content\ncreator for Kitchen-Catastrophe.com, a blog devoted to helping people push the\nboundaries of their cooking curriculum by documenting my various attempts at\nvarious dishes, both successful and failures. We don\u2019t think you should be\nscared of your kitchen. Unless it\u2019s haunted. In which case your fears are\nperfectly reasonable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eA Wise Guy, Eh?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat feels more like a rhetorical question than a genuine\none, but sure. Yeah, I am a wise guy. All the writers for the blog are mostly\ntrained in theatre or comedy. We\u2019re not experts. We\u2019re not professional chefs. That\u2019s\npart of the appeal. I started cooking for fun in High School, after I literally\ndestroyed a bowl burning Easy Mac. EASY MAC. I swore \u201cnever again\u201d, and started\nlearning. We\u2019ve had cakes collapse, lemon curds turn into citrus swamps, and\nhad some actually pretty good meals. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe site is run by myself and my partner Alan Vandegrift. We\nstarted it as a creative project after years of me writing up my culinary\nfailings as Facebook notes, and he said \u201cShit, man, these are tight as SHIT.\nYou GOTTA put that up on the WEB, where peeps can see.\u201d (Paraphrased) And we\ndid. And it did well. The site gets a couple hundred views a week, and people\nseem to like it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u2019s the thing: it doesn\u2019t make any money. See, we\u2019re\nnormal guys. I know I\u2019m personally running Adblock at least 95% of the time I\u0027m online.\nAnd ads don\u2019t pay enough at the level of traffic we have without being SUPER\nintrusive. So we said \u201cScrew it. No ads.\u201d And we\u2019re proud of that decision. But\nwe\u2019re not too proud to beg.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting the site, you\u2019ll be covering the costs of what\nwe do, and supporting us to do more. Since I started writing, people have\nwanted a cookbook. Since I started the site, I\u0027ve wanted to get the team together and make jokes over Julia and Julia or something for you guys. We can get these things done, together. And you can get the sweet taste of victory first. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo check out the reward tiers on the right, and the goals on\nthe left, and if you see things you like, please feel free to contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to give you my\nmoney, but I want you to beg a little more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAha, a little digital power trip? Sure thing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, the schedule for Kitchen Catastrophes is one post every\nMonday and Thursdays. That\u2019s 8 posts a month that you can support for as little\nas $1 a month. That\u2019s twelve cents a post. That\u2019s the cheapest entertainment\nyou can buy outside of outright stealing it. (Or, you know, supporting someone\nat $1 a month that posts 3 times a week, but hey, I asked first.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions are scheduled once a month, every month,\nuntil you choose to discontinue supporting us. \u201cDiscontinue supporting us\u201d is\nbusiness speak for \u201cThrow our ass out the door to save up for some Twizzlers.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eRight now, my partner and I have agreed, if the site isn\u2019t\nmaking at least $30 a month by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have to close the\nsite. We just can\u2019t afford to invest our time and resources for something the\npeople don\u2019t want. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOur site lives and dies by your magnanimity. And wouldn\u2019t it\nbe cool to be the kind of person who HAS magnanimity? That\u2019s some \u201cDuke of Orleans\u201d\nlevel swagger. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo find it in your incredible, gracious, and I-hope-I\u2019m-not-being-too-forward\nbeautiful heart to keep us out of the poor house, and on the internet, telling\njokes about Corn, where we belong. \u003cbr\u003e"
