With your contribution, I am able to visit more artists and galleries, that way bringing the art scene into everyday peoples everyday life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.kunzt.no\"\u003eKunzt\u003c/a\u003e is the video blog that gives you a direct insight into the art world. Kunzt is for those who are curious about and want to learn more about art. Kunzt is also Scandinavia\u0027s first art vlog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that good art can improve people\u0027s quality of life and perspective. Therefore, I believe it\u0027s important to make art available to several, on their premises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKunzt prioritizes video and photo rather than heavy, analytical and academic texts. Kunzt prioritizes short videos rather than long. Kunzt prioritizes content for those who read a bit about art rather than those already well-versed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more of you that support Kunzt, the more episodes I can make.\u00a0I really want to keep this channel going, it\u0027s growing rapidly with more and more subscribers every day.\u003cbr\u003eYour help is a vital part of the mix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be forever grateful for any amount you\u0027re able to contribute with. All the money I receive will be used for costs associated with travel to and from artists, art buyers and galleries. Everything helps! Thank you :-)\u003cbr\u003e"
