    "summary": "Hey there! This whole, \"pay for art to support the artist\" is the stuff of dreams. My biggest challenge was figuring out what people would pay for since I wear so many Art-Hats: Painting, sketching, self-publishing stories and coloring books, as well as making sculptures. So, instead of figuring out what people want, I\u0027m going to start by making what I want. I figure if you donate a dollar, you get to comment and vote on what you like to see more of, as well as get first pick of new art and sketches. Then, hopefully between you, me, and Patreon, we\u0027ll figure this out together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to create. A lot. I also work full-time as a creative director for a badass agency called Home Brew. I\u0027ll be making this stuff after work once I put my bebbeh to sleep. I am also creating an art brand,\u003ca href=\"https://www.bringontheart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Bring On The Art\u00ae\u003c/a\u003e, but I still want to maintain my personal art at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://krisztianna.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKrisztianna.com\u003c/a\u003e and stay connected to my supporters. I\u0027m thinking Patreon is a great way to hear your voices and your artistic interests, then I can make my brand better, but still create my personal art separately from it and post about it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not sure how much I\u0027ll be making at first, but I can promise that I need to rework and re-vamp my studio, and get it ready for a whole new batch of work. That means: \u003cstrong\u003eStudio Sales!\u003c/strong\u003e Basically, art offered at cheaper prices to clear as much of it off my walls and out of my shelves. \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon supporters will get first pick of the work. And yes, that includes Muertitas.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThen I\u0027ll get to create my new studio I\u0027ve been planning, and show you that whole process when some other things in my life fall into place, like my plans for a new location.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s hoping Patreon is the best way to communicate with supporters and give you an inside look into my process and challenges. I hope it can serve as the first heads up when my sculptures, drawings, and sketches go on sale, as well as get feedback on what you are hoping to see next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s burn the midnight oil!"
