    "summary": "Hey there bird lovers! if you are reading this, it is because you and I are birds of a feather. We love all animals but in particular our feathered friends and we want to do our very best to support those who are a little less fortunate than others. It is my passion, my god given calling to help those in need... and this is my journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is astonishing that there are so many animals that need help, yet absolutely no where for them to turn. It breaks my heart to see so many beautiful creatures that are treated like disposable items, neglected, mistreated, thrown away and put down because they are no longer loved by their owners or because they are depressed, misunderstood, injured or even just because they are a little bit weird. I could no longer stand by and watch as unwanted pets and injured wildlife were being destroyed all because no one chose to care or could be bothered spending the time and money to rehabilitate these amazing creatures. Someone had to step up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began in 2015 when I rescued 2 unwanted budgies from an incredibly small cage and moved them into my first little aviary that I paid $300 for. I had no idea I was going to start a sanctuary at this point, but God had different plans. Since then I have rescued, rehabilitated and re-homed well over 200 birds, saving the lives of many that were just waiting at the vet for the inevitable or were trapped in tiny little cages for years and years on end with barely a perch to stand on. I have rehabilitated feather pluckers back to perfect health and created a beautiful, relaxed habitat for birds suffering behavioural issues or anxiety with close to 100% success rate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of my 20K Instagram followers, we have managed to achieve amazing feats such as raising $500 to pin the leg of a fledgling wattle bird that had been attacked by a hawk, when most people would have just had him destroyed, and provided funding for the monthly beak filing of two of our birds with a beak deformities who once again, would have been put to sleep because no one wants to wear the cost. I am so grateful and humbled by the generosity of others who share my passion and love for those less fortunate but there are still so many more animals who need our help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have learned so much about wildlife since I began and am constantly being asked questions on how to do things like trimming talons, growing sprouts, creating habitats, hand taming birds etc. I also have followers that are wanting to get to know me better, would like the ability to chat to me in real time and to be able to spend more time online with my flock instead of little 60 second Instagram clips. I decided to take this opportunity to not only get to know all you beautiful people better but to be able to help you with any of your bird related questions and issues, whilst we work together to grow my sanctuary, providing refuge for the ever growing number of animals who are hopeless and desperate for our help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to finish by saying how grateful I am that I am not alone in this world. That there are incredible, amazing people like you that are prepared to make a small sacrifice to help these beautiful creatures have a second chance at life. Saving just one bird may not change the world, but it changes the world for that one bird. Thank you and God bless xo\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hi, I am Katie, I am an independent self funded bird wildlife carer based in Perth Western Australia. Originally when I got into caring for birds 3 years ago, I was taking in unwanted pet birds that people wanted to surrender, I built a large 7 meter long flight aviary enclosure \u0026amp; freed many birds from tiny miserable cages. All my birds currently share the one large community aviary enclosure. I have made the choice to forgo breeding any of my birds, sheerly because I know how many pet birds are being surrendered to me \u0026amp; many I have to turn down on a weekly basis as I do not have appropriate aviaries for the breeds that people are wanting to surrender, so I couldn\u0027t justify breeding more birds and adding to the problem of excess birds in Perth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eby a twist of fate, around 2 years ago I was contacted by an elderly gentleman that had just found a baby rainbow lorikeet that had fallen from a recently pruned tree. In Perth Western Australia Rainbow lorikeets are considered pests. unless a wildlife centre is willing to collect \u0026amp; domesticate the bird, it is euthanised, so I took in this tiny grey fluff ball in and with no prior knowledge on hand rearing a bird, I successfully hand reared this lorikeet and found it a forever home. my passion for helping bird wildlife then became apparent and I started taking in more and more injured bird wildlife \u0026amp; baby birds needing hand rearing. It is extremely rewarding and something I absolutely love doing. however the Rainbow lorikeets are my highest priority as many wildlife centres won\u0027t take them in now as they are not native, so my need to step up and help these poor birds is at its highest right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emy goals for 2018\u003cbr\u003eI am looking to move to a bigger property, where I have plans to build some new BIGGER aviaries which will allow me to take in more bird species. I\u0027ll be able to build a complete lorikeet enclosure for all my young rescues, which means being able to give them an amazing habitat in which to recover and call home, and allowing me to continue my work as a wildlife carer for lorikeets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also receive a lot of messages from people around the world, asking whether they\u0027d be able to come and meet the birds if they ever visit Australia. This is definitely in my plans. Aside from being incredibly beautiful and intelligent (and cheeky!) creatures, birds can also be extremely therapeutic, particularly for individuals suffering from anxiety and/or depression. With this in mind, part of the plan for the sanctuary is to hold regular morning teas for people to attend, to spend time with the birds, participate in feeding and general care, and meet other like-minded bird lovers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to this, I am also planning future sponsorships/adoptions. For a small set fee, purely to go toward feeding, care and maintenance of the birds and aviaries, you will be able to \u0027adopt\u0027 one of the birds; in return you would receive a photo of your bird, opportunities to visit, help in feeding and generally spend time with your feathered friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
