I make zines because moving fluidly between media allows me to tell my each of my stories in the most meaningful way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy zines explore themes of (a)gender, sexuality, disability, trauma, and healing from a radical perspective. I use personal experiences of oppression to resist the limited and limiting representations of people like me in the media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always looking for ways to make my zines more accessible, from font choice to image descriptions to access statements and transcription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m on Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy writing is an essential part of my healing process, and I\u0027ve been told it\u0027s transformative for others, too. Now that I\u0027ve found my voice, there are endless topics I want to write about. Funding for artists is scarce but essential for sustainability. Regular income means less concern about per-article payment from other websites, which would mean more options for sharing my content at no cost to readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding artists is funding liberation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support my work on a one-time basis, my zines are available on etsy: kaylarosenzines.etsy.com"
