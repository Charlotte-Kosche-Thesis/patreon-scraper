I LEARNED MY LESSON FROM KICKSTARTER- i\u0027m thinking rewards through from now on (-:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eobviously, i\u0027m not going to stop creating and i\u0027m certainly not going to stop making music no matter what. you guys will just make it faster and easier. (: \u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING! have a beautiful day."
