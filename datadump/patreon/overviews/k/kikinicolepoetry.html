    "summary": "Hello! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is kiki nicole and I am a yung negro artist currently based in Portland, OR. My pronouns are they/them/theirs and I am Queer, Blk, Agender, and attempting to thrive, by any means necessary. Welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI begun primarily writing poetry and doing musical and theatre performance based work. I am a Pink Door Fellow, a semi-finalist with Corporeal Voices\u0027 first annual \"The Voice is a Muscle\" grant for Oregon writers of color, a 2017 Oakland artivist with the direct action production of \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf,\" and a 2017 cohort of Destiny Arts\u0027 QEAR (Queer Emerging Artist Residency). I participate in slam poetry, do multi-genre burlesque performances, musical theatre, digital text based artwork, painting, and video work based on the intersections of my existence as a Black, chronically ill and depressed queer genderless person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am growing older, I am realizing the necessity of interdisciplinary art within my personal practice. It does not serve me to just focus on one being one kind of artist. However, I often do not have the means to explore creating the art I am nurtured by. This is where your patronage comes in. I have lived independently for the last 4 years and have often used crowdfunding to survive as a marginalized yung artist. I come from a line of incredibly hardworking black femmes without a savings account and I have been in debt from various institutions. Patronage will go to support both rent ($333.00) and bills when necessary, healthy food, transportation costs, supplies (postage stamps to ship out Etsy orders, printing costs of prints and zines, high functional webcam \u0026amp; lighting for video production,) and costs for writing workshops, classes + entry fees for submissions for various publications, contests, and fellowships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read about me and/or give/promote this work. Supporting living Black Trans \u0026amp; Queer Artists is incredibly important work and I am so grateful for all of my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith luv,\u003cbr\u003ekiki\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite: kikinicole.com\u003cbr\u003eEtsy: etsy.com/shop/yungnegroartist\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: kikinicolepoetry.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
