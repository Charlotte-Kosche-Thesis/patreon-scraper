The name\u0027s Klotz, or as some of you know me, Shadowpelt. As you can probably tell, I\u0027m an artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince as far back as I can remember, art has been my passion, my drive. It\u0027s kept me company when I had no friends, it\u0027s made me laugh while I\u0027ve been down, and most importantly, it\u0027s help me make new friends and earn a living for myself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried my hand at what you might call a \"real job\". I\u0027ve worked retail, I\u0027ve tried working for my parents in their office, I\u0027ve even moved away to try some different jobs out of the area. Not a single one paid as well as art. I\u0027d slave for 7-9 hours a day just to barely make enough to scrape by. But thanks to all of my wonderful commissioners, I\u0027ve found a \"job\" in art but it\u0027s fun and relaxing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, as much as I love working on commissions, it doesn\u0027t leave me with much free time for things like comics, free to use bases, and personal art time. Not to mention learning to drive and returning to school. There\u0027s so many things I want to do and try, and a great part of it is things I want to make for the community. One way I can have the time to try these new things out is if you consider supporting me through patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://puu.sh/yLJGE/7a7ef1a6dc.png\" style=\"width: 272px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now now. I\u0027m not just asking for your money! I fully intend on giving back to you as much as you are to me! With things such as art giveaways, free to use bases and refs, heck you could even be featured in my comics or commission examples!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit counts and means the world to me.
