    "summary": "Many small independent artists struggle to make a living. You can only make so much money from Cons and your deviant art page, and with, 90% of the money spent on comic art going to big established artists that doesn\u0027t leave much for the guy struggling to make a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow would you fancy having your art displayed in a small independent comic shop? Alongside a card with your details, website, facebook etc. They would also  be happy to take orders for your prints. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the pitch. Owning a comic shop these days is hard. Sales are down, the pound is struggling against the dollar meaning costs are up, and apps like comixology are encouraging people away from printed comics. They don\u0027t have the same collectable value as they used to so people either get them digitally or wait for the trade. It\u0027s a hard time for a comic shop owner. I laugh as much as anyone when you see Stuart on the Big Bang Theory laughing about sleeping in his shop and being able to eat meat this week when he makes a sale. The reality is that not far off the truth. Some months I scrape by. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m proposing is to set up a Patreon wall. For \u00a32  a month I will hang a print in my store in a prominent position, with all your details alongside in the hopes of driving traffic to your site and garnering some sales. You can cancel at anytime and I will continue to display the print for as long again as the agreement lasted up to six months. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as this I will seek to promote your paintings through my own website and pages. Sharing your work and helping to drive traffic towards your site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a32 a month. It\u0027s not much to get your work hanging in a retail environment with the chance of making some sales. Certainly less than  you would spend hiring space for a show. Considerably less for a year than you would spend for a day at a convention. And if you keep the agreement going for twelve months I will hang a second print up for you at no extra cost. \u00a32 a month and you can cancel at any time if you don\u0027t think it\u0027s helping your sales. \u00a32 a month to keep a local independent comic shop open and perhaps help to delay the slow takeover of all retail by giant corporations like Amazon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not trying to make a living off other people\u0027s work (at least not anymore than any retailer is), I\u0027m just trying to make a minimum wage income so that I can continue to offer the service of a local comic shop in my local community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink about it, if your Interested the Patreon details are below. If it\u0027s not for you then thanks for taking the time to read this anyway and you could still help by sharing this with friends to see if they or anyone they know might be interested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks\u003cbr\u003e"
