    "summary": "Well hello there, fellow comic connoisseur. I can only assume that you came here in search of the very best in internet entertainment. I assure you, despite the conspicuous lack of goat videos, you have come to the right place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a lady-loving ladynerd from Melbourne, Australia who longs to spend her days making comics. I currently work full time at a demanding day job in order to pay rent and living expenses for myself and my rather needy Japanese rescue cats. My dream is to one day move down to part time work (or *gasp* full time! But hey, baby steps), so that I can spend more time working on my comics. This is a dream that I hope to achieve by supplementing my income with the help of you, generous friend!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently working on two ongoing comic projects: \u0027I Do Not Have An Eating Disorder\u0027 and \u0027Polyamory Isn\u0027t For Everyone\u0027, which can be found on my \u003ca href=\"http://www.khalemchurstcomics.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e and update on a weekly basis in an alternating fashion. These comics deal with some pretty heavy subject matter such as eating disorders, depression, anxiety, suicide, self harm, long distance relationships and polyamory. Because these comics often trigger sensitive issues in my readers, I also run a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.misspixnmixanswers.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esupport blog\u003c/a\u003e where people can post (anonymously or not) their questions about these matters. I post this content for free for the whole of the glorious internet to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo wait, if I get these comics for free, why would I pay you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so glad you asked. You see, there is no obligation to pay. That\u0027s how the amazing machine of the gratitude economy works. My hope is that, if you like what I do, and want to help me wrangle more time to keep doing what I love, that you\u0027ll take the opportunity to throw me a dollar or two. Think of it like a tip jar that motivates me to keep doing my thang.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait, there are treats! Of course there are treats, because I love you endlessly. Whilst I Do Not Have An Eating Disorder and Polyamory Isn\u0027t For Everyone are immensely rewarding to make (and have helped me to process some huge parts of my emotional journey), they often seem to make people cry. But did you know that I also write comics that are actually funny? I love writing autobio, and a lot of weird things have happened to me in my life. I even occasionally pump out the odd fictional comic. These short stories don\u0027t really have a place to live, so I\u0027d like to make a home for them here on Patreon, for the very special people who help me to make my comicking dream a reality. I am so excited to finally share some of these joyful stories and show that I can write jokes as well as feelings (though let\u0027s be honest, I will still also be writing a lot of comics about feelings).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, dear friend, if you\u0027d like to be an integral part in this comics-making machine, check out the tiers and pick which goodies you\u0027d like access to. And for everyone who has ever read my comics, THANK YOU, you are my superstars.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
