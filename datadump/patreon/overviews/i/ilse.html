    "summary": "Hello Friends! Welcome to my Patreon page for my cello videos. I work freelance around Cork, Ireland, and sometimes around the world, but my real passion is arranging and composing music for cello and particularly for solo cello. If you enjoy my videos I hope you will become a patron today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eAbout the Cello Videos\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI live in Ireland and I am inspired by Irish music, film music, improvising and rocking out on the cello. I am on a quest to expand the solo cello repertoire by creating pieces that are satisfying to play and wonderful to listen to. I make videos of these pieces and post them to YouTube which you can see on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOJL5QGOmv-Xc7h83oqxuww\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. I have nearly 6000 subscribers who enjoy these videos. I want to grow and develop my music, use better quality equipment and spend more time making arrangements and videos. You can help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eHow your support makes a difference\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI spend weeks making each arrangement and composition. I like to make creative, beautifully playable and harmonically satisfying pieces. I record a piece with Logic Pro and video myself recording it. So each piece is one take. A live recording with no drop ins, overdubs or miming. It is real music. It takes time to practice. I love putting the music up on video. If you like my videos, and pledge just \u20ac1 or more each time I make one, it helps me to spend more time on this project and helps me to produce higher quality products, eventually get a proper video camera. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eAre you a cellist?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eIf you are, you know this scene; someone gets excited that you play the cello and asks you to play... and you pull out the Bach solo suites. As wonderful as they are, it\u0027s great having something \nfresh to play. Something fun or popular but still juicy and substantial. A piece that sounds great and is a \ngood workout on the cello. That\u0027s what got me motivated you make my own solo music. I wanted to be able to play concerts with pieces other than the usual. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003ethis is how you benefit...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWhen you pledge \u20ac5 or more each time I release a video, I also send you the mp3 AND the sheet music for the piece. This will help you build a new repertoire of pieces you can play in concert,\n for friends, or just when you want to play something enjoyable. \u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge \u20ac5, you can also ask me to make an arrangement of something you love and if it works on cello it will go on my list. I also will give you advice on playing any of the pieces and let you know of any sales going on at my online store\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://playcellomusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlay Cello Music\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge \u20ac1 you will get the mp3, the first view of my videos and get a warm feeling inside that you supported me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003ePatreon charges and rewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon lets you become a patron of a creator on your own terms.

I have been making solo cello videos and publishing the sheet music for many of the pieces I play, to make available on my shop website \u003ca href=\"http://playcellomusic\"\u003ehttp://playcellomusic\u003c/a\u003e.com\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago I produced a film with filmmaker Maarten Roos, called Living the Tradition, where I travel around Ireland playing Irish airs where they originate and interviewing people about the ancient stories behind the songs. It was taken on by Aer Lingus for their in flight entertainment and won Best Feature Length Documentary in the Erie International Film Festival.

I love solo cello and am passionate about finding new ways for the cello to be heard and to inspire people, for people to partake in the wonder, the joy, the beauty, the depth of sound, and to express oneself through the cello!",
