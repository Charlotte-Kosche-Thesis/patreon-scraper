    "summary": "Hi! My name is Imani Josey, and I am the creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2saAnT9\"\u003eThe Blazing Star books, a new YA fantasy series.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy mission:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo write and produce high quality YA fantasy novels starring\nteens of color, and release all of The Blazing Star novels within 18 months of\neach other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe books are about African-American teen girls who travel back in time to ancient Egypt and the adventure of a lifetime they embark upon! In The Blazing Star, we met sixteen-year-old Portia, a modern girl who had been searching for the talents that make her unique. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen she\u0027s zapped back in time and finally discovers those skills and abilities on the banks of the Nile, it\u0027s very much a case of be careful what you wish for. The Blazing Star\u00a0has resonated with my fantastic readers who loved the beautiful cover as well as Portia\u2019s biting wit,\nand were thrilled to read a YA fantasy starring a black teen protagonist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI released the first book of The Blazing Star series last year, and the sequel, The Falling Star, is slated for release in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0In The Falling Star, we get to meet Portia\u0027s twin sister, Alexandria, whose been heralded as a genius in modern Chicago, but has less luck navigating the ancient world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about my writing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m an author of YA fantasy novels and short stories, and I have\nbeen published by Crossed Genres, the Young Adult Review Network, and Wise Ink\nCreative Publishing. I won the 19th Annual Young Playwrights Festival hosted by Pegasus Players Theatre Chicago. I also attended Howard University and Northwestern\nUniversity, getting writer-y degrees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eTotally unrelated,\nbut fun facts about me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was a professional cheerleader for the Chicago Bulls, and\nMiss Chicago for the Miss America Organization. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I started this\npage:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy novels are completely indie-funded, and though I love my\nbooks, producing them is kind of expensive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOkay, producing them is really expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have a full-time day job, and a writing career, which\nmakes book production difficult. I\u2019m also a Virgo and a perfectionist, and I see\nindie book production like house flipping. People can tell when you cut\ncorners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI refuse to let my books look like one of those rushed\nproducts, so I invest my time, energy, tears, and paycheck into my writing.\nThis includes all forms of editing, cover design, production management, book\nprinting, PR, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLike any small business, my writing career is hungry for the\ntime, energy, financial devotion that goes into my day job. Currently, I\u0027d say\nit takes up about 50-60 hours per week. The day job is 40 hours. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI think you see where I\u2019m going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a patron:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause this series is indie-funded, this a great time to be part of the magic! And when I say that, I mean I want your name in the books. Like immortalized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany patrons of The Blazing Star series will be acknowledged in The Falling Star book (check out the tiers for more info). This is an awesome opportunity to show the world that you are part of a unique story with an incredible intention!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, while patronage is building, I\u0027ll provide monthly content to\npatrons. This includes character profiles,\nnewsletters, and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eLevels:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is my first time working with Patreon, so let\u2019s make\nthis easy with four levels of patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$1/month level and up = patrons will receive a monthly\nnewsletter.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e$5/month level and up= patrons\u0027 NAME IN UPCOMING BOOK + receipt of newsletter.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e$10/month level and up= patrons\u0027 NAME IN UPCOMING BOOK + receipt of newsletter and character profiles.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e$20/ month = patrons\u0027 NAME IN UPCOMING BOOK + receipt of monthly newsletter, character profiles, and a\nsigned copy of The Blazing Star.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNEW--- $50/month = patrons\u0027 NAME IN UPCOMING BOOK + receipt of monthly newsletter, character profiles, a signed copy of The Blazing Star, and a signed copy of The Falling Star.
