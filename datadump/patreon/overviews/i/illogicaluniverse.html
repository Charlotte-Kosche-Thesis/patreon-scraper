    "summary": "The Illogical Universe follows the inane ramblings of two crazies sprinkled with a hint of comedy, a dash of movies and comics, and just a pinch of everything else. From the minds of Kyle Barrows and Jimmy Schmidt, the guys who\u0027ve brought you nothing of value before this, the Illogical Universe hopes to be a final bastion for total free speech and artistic freedom. Or at least the Alamo of immature fart humor and irreverent discussion, video game play-throughs, and hilarious web shows. Over the last 2 years, The Illogical Universe has brought you an insane weekly podcast and a few random sputterings of video content. In the coming eons, we hope to start producing more and more video content and podcasts working with local, undiscovered talent in hopes of bringing that sweet, sticky spotlight to the truly deserving. That plus Pringles and Squirt! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Pringles, Squirt, and A/V equipment cost the monies. Instead of selling what little of our souls we have left, we thought we\u0027d turn to you, the fans and cult members that we seek to entertain in these dark times. With your support of anything as small as a dime, you will help us grow and bring you more and more of what you... as well as keeping those greedy corporate fat cats out of our kool-aid! You\u0027ll also be helping us help other talented, up and coming artists in a wide variety of genres but giving them exposure and face time with you! Now, what\u0027s not to love about that? So, IF you feel like sending a few bucks our way, we and our guests will love you long time. Like forever long time. Plus, sweet rewards! Thanks so much and enjoy the ride... or else."
