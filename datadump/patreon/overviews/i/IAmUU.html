It is a tough job, because we have a very complicated tradition and theology.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe do this by breaking the complicated stuff down a little at a time, talking about the small ideas and letting people add them together to get to the big ones. By sharing quotes from a wide range of sources and thinkers, by making sharable images to help ideas spread, and by writing essays and meditations on our blog we allow people to uncover liberal religion in an inviting way. We reach tens of thousands of people every week, and over a hundred thousand each month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur work can look like this:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IAmUUPage/photos/a.640305182661620.1073741826.136062183085925/1404643842894413/?type=3\u0026amp;permPage=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone aligncenter\" src=\"http://iamuu.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12919714_1404643842894413_3634131673339038404_n1.png\" style=\"height: 350px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e,\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t...or maybe...\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IAmUUPage/photos/a.640305182661620.1073741826.136062183085925/1253340381358094/?type=3\u0026amp;permPage=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://iamuu.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/11960044_1253340381358094_414435155838044022_n.jpg\" style=\"height: 350px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t...or...\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IAmUUPage/photos/a.640981735927298.1073741828.136062183085925/675205482504923/?type=3\u0026amp;theater\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone aligncenter\" src=\"http://iamuu.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/945267_675205482504923_1165167977_n.png\" style=\"height: 350px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlong with helping Unitarian Universalists start conversations with their friends, we\u0027ve had success in encouraging people to visit their local congregation. We are also told that we are helping people feel more connected to Unitarian Universalism during the week and while they are unable to attend Sunday services. We think all of that is important, and we really want to keep doing it. Can we count on your help?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat kind of help?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn short, we need your money. We are a lay-led operation that isn\u0027t tied to the UUA or any member congregation. While our administrator and volunteers are all UUs, they are members of different congregations in different regions, some not even in the US. We don\u0027t rent an office, and we don\u0027t have a lot of overhead, but we do have expenses and a project that requires a huge time commitment. Like any lay-led congregation, we have to pay for utilities, office supplies, and we are hoping to be able to pay for professional quality work in the future. That depends on your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSure, we could be offering to help congregations fill their social media for a price. We could focus on selling t-shirts and tote bags. We could be doing other things to make money, but what we want to be doing is sharing liberal religion with the world and helping to make Unitarian Universalism easier to understand and share. If you think that\u0027s a worthy goal, we could use your support in making it happen. Plus, you get access to some cool extras."

Why didn\u0027t I know about this place, this community, and this liberal religion sooner?\". That thought struck me when I connected with Unitarian \nUniversalism back in 2008. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat thought is why I started the I Am UU \nproject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of the I Am UU project is to make it easier to share Unitarian Universalism, and to make it easier to understand for those who are learning about it. The mission of the I Am UU project is absolutely no less insidious than \nto change the world; to invite people into these communities of \npassionate and engaged people and inspire them to join in the work of \nchanging our culture and our politics to permit everyone the right of \nconscience and the use of the democratic process; so that every person \nis treated as a being of inherent worth and dignity; so that the world \nis, little by little, more just, equitable, and compassionate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to be a part of fulfilling that mission, one of the simplest ways to do so is to pledge a single dollar to help keep this project going. The best way to create stability is to have a large base of supporters who are giving from the heart.\u003cbr\u003e",
