For us, art has always been more\nthan just a means for entertainment, but a way for humans to further explore\ntheir experiences through several mediums. Art is used to evoke emotion and\nconnect us to the things that make us most uniquely human, and we dare to\nconstantly remind our audience of those things in an effort to combat those\nthat would have you forget them. It is to our understanding that staying connected\non a much more human level is how we learn to exercise compassion, love,\nempathy, etc. And so, we believe it to be quintessential to our survival as a\nspecies. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe also do this for ourselves, as each creator\nwithin our ranks finds the utmost happiness in expressing him/herself through\ntheir talents, and we can only hope that what we produce is well received.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd now, I\u0027d like you to meet our members!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMichael Flowers (A very talented artist/writer from America)\u003cbr\u003eTends to write poetry and sketch things in his spare time.

In a world that promotes the consumption of\nartistic endeavors for seemingly nothing in return, Patreon allows fans to\nsupport works of art by restoring the balance between consumer and producer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re an avid consumer of manga, you know all about scanlation sites.\nThese are websites, created by \"fans\", that produce scanned\ntranslations, or just scans, of comics from around the world in an effort to\nshare amazing stories with everyone for FREE!! Sounds awesome right?!\nWrong...The problem with this is that it literally takes money out of the\ncreator\u0027s pockets, especially since we\u0027re booming in a self-publishing age\nright now. A lot of scanlation sites MEAN well, but if they could stop and\nrealize the harm they\u0027re doing, they might rethink their actions. Or maybe they\njust don\u0027t care...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith Patreon, you can get back to the roots of supporting the things you\nbelieve in. Instead of reading chapters of your favorite manga for free, if\nyour favorite creator is here, you can directly support them through small\nmonthly donations! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eAnd what\u0027s more? Well...you get\nsomething back!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are a number of rewards that are offered depending on how much you choose\nto pledge, and those can be found on the right hand side of the screen. Also,\nit\u0027s important to remember that you ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE to pledge. No one here\nis going to make you support something you don\u0027t want to support, and if you do\nchoose to support, you can always cancel or change the amount AT ANY TIME. We\nunderstand more than anyone else that money can get tight sometimes, so don\u0027t\nput yourself at risk for us, although we appreciate you either way! Remember,\nhow will you help anyone else if you can\u0027t help yourself?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur focus for rewards are going to be through lots of creator/fan\ninteractions, sneak peeks of character designs, concept art, cover art,\nscripts, chapters, etc. And then, with the higher rewards, we\u0027ll look to\nactually send prints of cover art, promo art, shoe designs, and even a pen pal\noption that could be highlighted within the manga itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing, I\u0027d just like to say thanks for reading all of this...I\ntend to ramble, but I hope I stayed on topic and didn\u0027t bore you much. If you\nlike what we do and would like to see more, please don\u0027t hesitate to support\nus. If for whatever reason you can\u0027t support but still love what we\u0027re doing\nhere, you still have my gratitude.
