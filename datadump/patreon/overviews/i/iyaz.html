I\u0027ve gotten bitten by the independent spirit again and want to put together some more video podcasts. First up, is a proper relaunch of the entertainment review podcast \"\u003ca href=\"http://killingtime.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKilling Time\u003c/a\u003e.\" It was my first podcast, started 10 years ago.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need some help. Finding a good place to host a video podcast is a bit costly. Then there\u0027s the equipment costs like getting a beast to handle video editing. If you\u0027re up for it, I\u0027d appreciate your help in updating all kinds of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next show on the slate to be revived is \"Dinosaurs: Before They Were Fuels.\" The video and audio podcast featured what\u0027s new in dinosaur news (and yes, that\u0027s a thing). You can watch an old ep of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3bam3TjLc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Dinosaurs\" here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll keep making shows for free pretty much no matter what. If you support this Patreon, you\u0027ll see higher quality video and audio from the shows I produce. Depending on what\u0027s raised, we can relaunch some older shows and maybe even launch some projects I\u0027ve been kicking around in my head.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming by!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
