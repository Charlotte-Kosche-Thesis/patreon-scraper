We love making open source games, toys and models, and we\u0027re going to keep doing that, but with your support, we can do it even better. Funding our artists and developers for their time and resources will allow us to spend more time designing models and growing our ever-expanding product range, and will give us access to better programs and technology to help us keep up with the cutting edge in home game fabrication. Whether you\u0027re using 3D printers, paper craft, or proxying with your own collection of game supplies and miniatures, we have free games that you can use and a growing online community to which you can join and contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note: we do a lot of designing and are pretty prolific posters here.

Having cycled through traditional tabletop mini painting, mixed media, junk building, and many other artistic expressions, he discovered 3D design in 2011 and hasn\u0027t looked back. By designing his own game pieces, printing them himself on his Replicator 2, and working at a record pace, he\u0027s now changing the way 3D printing influences game design internationally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeremy Larsen is a renaissance man, creating art through woodworking, music, bike maintenance, and exceptional parenting. Once Arian awakened the long-dormant gaming beast within Jeremy, he embraced the 3D design, the painting, the 3D printing, and all the game developments in between. \u003cbr\u003e",
