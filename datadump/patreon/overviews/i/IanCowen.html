    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there! Whether we know each other from family, friendship, or a mutual acquaintance, I\u0027d like to thank you for taking the time to hear about how you can travel with me to Europe in 2018! On a recent trip to Germany I became involved with the Atlantic Bridge, a brilliant missions organization based in the Netherlands. Their mission for the past 30 years has been to reconnect the\nyouth with the church.  Atlantic Bridge has been breaking\u00a0down the old walls set up around prejudice, ignorance, and indifference, and replacing them with bridges of friendship, faith, and understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mssEILM.jpg\" title=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my sincere desire with your gracious support to relocate overseas in early 2018 to the Atlantic Bridge Headquarters in Kruiningen, Netherlands, to help further this mission! One of my larger responsibilities will be leading \u201ctours,\u201d or mission trips where groups of international youth will have the opportunity to explore their Christian heritage and minister to the local youth. This is of great importance to the ministry, as to many in Europe the church is simply an old relic of the past, and people have completely detached themselves from it. These tours have had great impact across various communities in not only leading the people back to their spiritual roots, but in many cases also repairing the fractured infrastructure of the community. Here\u2019s a short message from John Oostdyk, founder and director of Atlantic Bridge:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cDear Friends of Ian,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been impressed by the initiative and energy Ian has shown to jump into a missions adventure with Atlantic Bridge. If you have never heard of us, it is probably because we spend more time and money on the ground level operations than on advertisement,  and because we are an out- of- the- box mission.\u003cbr\u003eThere are always a couple of things I tell Christians from up front.  We are not an evangelistic, but more a \u2018pre-evangelism\u2019 mission, ploughing the fields, removing the stones.  In that sense our semantics may not reflect very well what our heart is about. All because we need to be careful about how we communicate in a setting where atheism is closer to the heart of people than the Christian faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am happy to welcome Ian in our mission. From his desire and abilities he will be a good fit for our Circuit Riders project. We need someone willing to travel and accompany Circuit Riders (artists, teachers, etc. on ten day to two week tours of schools in predominantly Central but also in Western Europe.\u003cbr\u003eCircuit Riders and those coordinating this mission cannot live from the wind, as we say in Dutch. Support is needed and I ask you to consider supporting Ian on this mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA budget for the coming year would include\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$  10000,-  room, board and living expenses at $ 830 p/month\u003cbr\u003e$  2000,-  insurances, visa,  and administration, office cost, mailings\u003cbr\u003e$  4000,-  travel expenses within Europe traveling almost 50% of the time throughout Europe\u003cbr\u003e$  2000  emergency fund\u003cbr\u003e========\u003cbr\u003e$  18,000.-which is monthly  $ 1500\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of this modern age is that you can follow us from up close. Follow us and follow the KARAVAAN, a project to mobilize European youth to remember, recall, revisit, rekindle the faith of their forefathers. That is the Christian faith Europe was founded on. And Europe is not such a bad place if you think of the many people that would like to come here and enjoy  the system of living our forefathers created and fought for often at the expense of their own lives. So we need to get back to those values that came into being after WWII. So we do not forget and so we continue to live according to the measures of Christ, honoring God and being a blessing to our brothers and sisters.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Christ,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn Oostdyk\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z4vLzDs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis mission and purpose has been brought to me for a reason, and it is my wish to see it through.
