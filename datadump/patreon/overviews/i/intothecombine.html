    "summary": "Hey guys welcome to Into the Combine Patreon page! This is where you will be able to get access to extra perks, options, and bonus content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve done the podcast for over two years without asking for anything in return because as 3 passionate metal heads we love to do it. The amount of new friends and metal heads we have met as well as all the positive feedback has kept us going strong. The only problem is it actually costs us a decent amount for yearly hosting fees, equipment, etc and we also put quite a bit of time into prepping for episodes/interviews, and editing. Were hoping that by creating the Patreon page we can at least cover our yearly costs which amount to around $200 for our hosting site and website per year. Anything beyond that would just allow us to do more with the cast. If you are unable to donate no worries you can help us by sharing this page, the podcast, telling your friends, and by continuing to listen to the free episodes each month! We will continue on as long as we are able and will attempt to keep pleasing the metal gods by preaching the metal gospel and sharing all the amazing metal we can find! Thanks for listening and supporting us three idiots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay metal out there,\u003cbr\u003eStan the Man, Jason, \u0026amp; Shadie\u003cbr\u003e"
