I am a musician trying to live from my music. I always wanted to materialize my own personal project. After some years in which I\u0027ve been growing a family and busy in developing my life in a foreign country (I am a Spaniard living in Germany), I feel my moment just arrived to put all my ideas together and make a coherent work with the music I love.I write and play all my music, I do my mixing and mastering, all with a quite limited equipment and therefore I need your help to be able to offer a progressively better work. How? YOU becoming a supporter of my work through this platform: Patreon. With your support I will be able to release one or two songs monthly. As long as some money milestones are achieved I can improve my gear and so the sound of the music I make. Actually I am asking you to be part of my \"executive-production team\" or, why not, even as a kind of band mate who could give me some ideas. I will reward your support according to the pledge level you are willing to offer me. All my patrons, no matter how much they spend on my work, will be the first ones to listen to my new music. My patrons will also be exclusively able to listen to some half-cooked ideas, access to some parts of my creative process or materials that will not be formally released and I can use their feedback to improve my work. \u003cbr\u003eWhat do I do I like progressive-rock and related music. I sing in Spanish, my mother tongue, mainly because I cannot separate my music from my way of thinking. My songs are based upon my personal feelings, emotions and stories and I don\u0027t feel comfortable transmitting them in a language I don\u0027t fully control. They are part of my memories and thinking process. Even sometimes part of my dreams. I\u0027d also like to support and promote the music in my mother tongue. This doesn\u0027t mean that I wouldn\u0027t eventually sing in English (or German, why not?). Anyway, I can provide my supporters with translations of my songs by request.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does it more exactly works?If you want to support my work just click on the big red button \"Become a Patron\" at the upper right side of the page. If you don\u0027t have a Patreon account, create one (as a supporter), enter the pledge you want to offer or select it according to the reward you want for your pledge and that\u0027s it. You will be charged only when I create a paid content and this could be one or two times per month. If I don\u0027t create a paid content you won\u0027t be charged at all.\u003cbr\u003eThe system is absolutely transparent. You can look up some reviews and inform yourself about how this works and its reliability. You will see at any time how many patrons do I have, how much are paying them and how much I am getting to reach my goals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not? \u003cbr\u003eIf you like what you hear, why not spending just a bit in order to be part of it? Maybe you smoke, or you can afford to have some drinks regularly... why not tipping me to keep me working and improving my work and give you the satisfaction of making it possible? I\u0027d be thankful forever. It is just you and me: no intermediaries, no labels, no agents. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
