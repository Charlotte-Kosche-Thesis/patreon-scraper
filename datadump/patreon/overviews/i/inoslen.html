This would create opportunities for local artist to be discovered by listeners who would be outside of their immediate area, we would make it easily accessible via our website podcast.inoslen.com by streaming right from the shows location. This new style of radio is more than your local stations. This is a world wide movement, where everyone joins in around the world to unit each other with music, interviews, news, artist spotlights to name a few but it is still much more; its a stream of entertainment fueled by you the listener.",
