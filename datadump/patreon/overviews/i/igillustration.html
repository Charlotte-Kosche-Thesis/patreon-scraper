    "summary": "Welcome to Inner Glow Illustration\u2026 Well, the Patreon page for it at least. My name is Myke and let me give you a rundown on what I\u0027m about, then you can decide whether or not you want to pledge to me. All I want is a way for me to get content to you without having to pay much (just a dollar). I know you can probably just pledge to me, receive my rewards, then leave and that\u0027s OK. I\u0027m planning on moving forward regardless of if you help me or not, but in the perfect world you\u0027d like me and my content enough to stay and contribute to my overall growth as an artist. I\u0027ll be honest I don\u0027t consider myself to be a pro digital artist but I do know I\u0027m pretty good. I have the skills, and above all else I\u0027m always pushing to better myself. Right now I have a fair amount of people consistently asking for commissions and I feel this is a way I can get content to you guys for cheap while making sure I can still eat (eating is kind of a thing). I have big plans, I have big dreams, my content will be ever improving, and above all else I will never stop moving forward. So what do you say\u2026 Help me in my journey?"
