You may have heard of Tudor\u0027s \u003cem\u003eAppaloosa Summer \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eObjects in Mirror\u003c/em\u003e, and Mara\u0027s \u003cem\u003eStay the Distance\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eFinding Daylight\u003c/em\u003e. Between the two of us, we\u0027ve written ten horse books for young adults. We\u0027re also equestrians ourselves--Tudor likes to jump and Mara finesses dressage horses through lots of circles--so you know the details in our books will always be true-to-life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsually writing is a solitary lifestyle, but this is a rare instance where it won\u0027t be. Welcome to our new project! This is where we\u0027ll be coming together to write our first collaborative novel, and you\u0027ll get to see it all unfold in real time. Right here. From first draft to finished product!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.maradabrishus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/whypatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we decided to write a novel, we kicked around ideas with how best to share it with the world. We could just write it, edit it, and publish it the normal, boring way . . . or we could share it with our readers as we go along and let everyone in on the fun. Because writing is a weird process full of chaos, and our novel will involve throwing it back and forth to each other to see what we come up with next, we figured this would be plenty entertaining to watch as it happens, so here we are. Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.maradabrishus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/thenovel.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNormally we write young adult novels. We\u0027re not doing that here. No, this novel is a full-blown romance. Yes, you read that right. Romance readers, assemble! But not only are you going to get a romance, you\u0027re also going to get a companion novel to both \u003cem\u003eAppaloosa Summer\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eFinding Daylight\u003c/em\u003e. Meet \u003cstrong\u003eCam \u003c/strong\u003e(who makes his debut as Meg\u0027s \"fit, outdoorsy, and a bit wild\" brother in \u003cem\u003eSix-Month Horse\u003c/em\u003e) and \u003cstrong\u003eLynsey \u003c/strong\u003e(the bejeweled, party-planning, thoroughbred farm heiress of \u003cem\u003eFinding Daylight\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven before they meet, Cam and Lynsey have something in common. They\u2019re both searching for the good life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as Cam hates to admit it, the fun of getting over-educated, while being under-committed, is wearing off. Sure, he\u2019s made an impression \u2013 his research is published and his name is cursed by a trail of dumped and disillusioned women \u2013 but it\u2019s time for something more. If only he could figure out what that is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLynsey is adrift. After years of floating through college, never fully deciding what she wants to do with her life, her dad cuts the purse strings. Left to her own devices, Lynsey knows she has to dedicate herself to something, but after a life of floating, Lynsey\u2019s not quite sure how.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Cam and Lynsey stumble into running an old farm, they find themselves struggling to keep their heads above water. Both are sure this can\u2019t be the good life \u2013 on a falling down farm or with each other. But what if the good life is something that sneaks up on you? What if it\u2019s the quiet and chaotic adventures of the every day? And what if the only thing Cam and Lynsey need to live the good life, is to acknowledge how happy they already are, and admit it to themselves \u2026 and to each other?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.maradabrishus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/aboutyou.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get out of all of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this Patreon, you\u0027ll be getting a novel, that\u0027s true. But you\u0027ll also get far more than if you\u0027d just downloaded it to your Kindle from Amazon. You\u0027ll get the opportunity to talk to us as it happens, read our blog posts as we question each other\u0027s sanity, and even shape the story. Yes, that\u0027s right, we want your input! Name the horses, name the barn cats, name the farm! Suggest story lines, ask us questions, get involved in the crazy venture that is writing a romance novel. Normally, writers toil to put a sleek, finished product in their readers\u0027 hands. This time we\u0027re pulling back the curtain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackers of this Patreon will get to read this novel before anyone else, plus there are additional rewards at various backer and \nmilestone levels. Some of those rewards are about access, some are digital, and some of them are tangible. We\u0027re hoping to produce two installments a month, along with additional blog posts about the novel. You\u0027ll also be able to chat with us and, well, decide how involved you want to be! Join the community or just read our updates--it\u0027s all up to you!\u003cbr\u003e"
