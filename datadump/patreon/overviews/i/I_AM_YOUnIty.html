Which has produced a body of work which I have christened \"The She Series\" ... Unpublished and unshared up until now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to energetic shifts on the planet which many of us are feeling ... I have now been given the \"Green Light\" that it is time to begin to present some of my Life\u0027s Works in the form of writings, images, and videos ... All of which present the values that most matter to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work will eventually be presented on a website on the Shimalaii domain ... Which has been secured ... Although the official website is still in process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I have prepared an introductory website to announce my work and to give interested parties a \"taste\" of what I have to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis website is located at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://familyreunitednow.weebly.com/\"\u003ehttps://familyreunitednow.weebly.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will currently find two different downloadable PDF documents on this site. One is under The Next Step sub-tab (Quick Links) and is called \"The Domino Effect\". The second is found under Heart Documents sub-tab (New PDF Documents) and is called \"My Reflections from withIN mySELF\". The second document includes an offering called \"Once Upon A Time ... Before the Beginning That Never Happened\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI AM also launching this Patreon page, as a temporary platform to give people the opportunity to help me develop my work by choosing various levels of patronship. However, eventually I prefer to have more flexibility than Patreon offers, so I hope to provide alternative ways for people to support me on my main website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The IMpossible dream becomes \nPOSSIBLE, when enough people connect to their I AM presence.
