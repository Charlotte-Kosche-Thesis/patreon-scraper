    "summary": "Most of us have been using IIWiki for years. We know the problems it has had. We\u0027ve had at least three host changes trying to find a cost effective and stable provider, and on our most recent host, we\u0027ve had to negotiate several upgrades without incurring extra costs. IIWiki has been supported by ads and our owner\u0027s wallet, and the expense is as much as those two things can be expected to handle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite a decline in ad revenue consistently over the last several months - primarily due to adblock and server downtime - we hope to have the site up and on a more stable, dedicated server with our current host. That will cost almost double what we\u0027re currently paying, thus our $60/month goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can get above that, then we will have wiggle room to scale operations as needed in the future, and keep IIWiki going indefinitely. Any buffer can also be put forward toward changing hosts in the future if need be, including running a new site side-by-side with the old one for awhile to ensure no one loses the content that they care about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChoosing to donate simply increases the longevity of the site, and earns our gratitude. We aren\u0027t doing reward tiers because ... well, you\u0027re all part of the community; there isn\u0027t a reward to be had besides having a site that isn\u0027t going down all the time. With your help, we can dramatically improve the site and our community, and for that I think everyone will be grateful.\u003cbr\u003e"
