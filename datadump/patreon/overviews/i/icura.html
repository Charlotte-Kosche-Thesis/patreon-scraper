I do this by creating a technical symbolic map of your soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are being invited to become \u003cstrong\u003emuch\u003c/strong\u003e more creative with how we communicate.

The symbols and connections are based on your personal roots. Original art and information describing the energies in \nyour life and where your energy may be needed collectively at this \nmoment. Essentially, I investigate you as a person via Skype or email and then I decode what you have given me into an archetypal game-plan that employs quantum activism at it\u0027s core.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBased on your astrology and personal history, you may be contacted for further participation in collective healing events.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese events are flexible and will usually consist of remote space holding and spiritual/physical participation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: This\n type of collaboration is only for those who are prepared to take a \nserious leap into their conscious evolution.

Mayan Astrology will also be included, along with a minimum 1 hour Skype session exploring the contents of the 7 page booklet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith\n any contribution above $40, you guarantee email communication\n from myself for the purpose of assisting in your awakening process.
