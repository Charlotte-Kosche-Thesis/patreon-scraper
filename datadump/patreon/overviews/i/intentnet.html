By opening lines of communication and sharing resources, we hope to provide strategic support and development to ministries that would not be possible otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe emphasize identifying and developing potential in young Christians, by providing support, mentorship, and community, and by then offering ways that their gifts can be used to serve the churches and community at large.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur efforts include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdentity, a young adult inter-church ministry that currently meets at Life Bridge Christian Church at 8pm on Mondays. Our young adult community is our flagship community and represents our deep roots in the demographic that is otherwise the most likely to leave abandon organized religion entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDust, an outreach community with one foot in Christian tradition and liturgy, and the other in the post-modern and the provocative. Dust seeks to build community in the wilderness and explore the art of the Gospel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaving Throw, a gaming ministry that seeks to rally people around the community of board, tabletop, and video games. Meeting on Thursday evenings at 8pm at Valparaiso Mennonite Church, Saving Throw is out to save the world, one dice roll at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFounding one or more live-in intentional communities to operate as discipleship experiences and missional outposts.\u003cbr\u003e"
