    "summary": "Would you like to learn English from an experienced native English teacher? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name is Lorraine and I teach English from my home office in the beautiful city of Edinburgh. I am a native English speaker and I have been teaching English since 2010. I have lots of qualifications in teaching both business and general English. These include the CELTA and a Diploma in Teaching Business English. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many of my students ask me to recommend a good British English podcast that they can listen to while they are commuting to work, walking their dog or driving their car. This got me thinking that maybe I should create a podcast of my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe the most effective way for you to learn English is to enjoy your English lessons and feel inspired to improve. I have lived in several countries including Germany where I studied German for 3 years, so I know what it\u2019s like to be a language learner. You need a friendly, patient teacher who inspires you to continue learning every week. I have students from all over the world, including Japan, Colombia, Germany, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Over the years, I have developed my knowledge of English and I would like to pass this on, in my easy-to-understand British accent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to create a podcast, but I need your help. Firstly, I need you to tell me what areas of English you would like me to talk about. Secondly, I would love it if you could become a patron and contribute towards the cost of setting up the podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are looking for a native English teacher to help you to improve your speaking skills, prepare for an English exam or you want to feel more confident speaking English with international colleagues and business partners, I can help. Maybe you would simply like to talk with a native English speaker who can correct your mistakes and explain why it is a mistake. If you would like a trial lesson with me to talk about your learning needs, or to ask ANY questions, please contact me. I look forward to meeting you soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLorraine \u003cbr\u003eOwner and Founder of Intrepid English\u003cbr\u003e"
