None of the bands have broken even so far. A typical record release on Iron Man Records may cost more than \u00a38,000 and take up to ten years to recover the costs of producing it. Some record releases may take even longer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEverything that the label creates is produced with care and attention to the highest standards\u003c/strong\u003e with the available budget. Iron Man Records is a complex manifestation of risk taking, personal and professional financial suicide, insanity and making independent music against impossible odds. Iron Man Records works hard to give music value.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIron Man Records has never chosen to seek financial support from Arts Funding Organisations, Government Projects, Academic Institutions, Banks, Advertisers or any other groups\u003c/strong\u003e. The label would rather seek help and support from the consumers of the end product (that\u0027s you) or drive itself over the cliff trying to do something worthwhile. The label will remain independent by any means.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOver the past 18 years the label has run up massive debts\u003c/strong\u003e trying to make new and interesting music accessible. I\u0027m still waiting for the first few releases on the label to break even on their initial production budget. If things carry on the way they are, I may have to do something sensible and give it up. That would be a shame after all the hope, trust and patience invested in the label, and myself, by all the bands it has worked with. \u003cstrong\u003eIron Man Records has released some fantastic records by some amazing bands and artists\u003c/strong\u003e, but it has also become a dangerously expensive past time that makes most Class A drug habits look pitifully cheap. All of the bands are struggling against impossible odds too so \u003cstrong\u003eany help for the label, also helps the bands\u003c/strong\u003e it works with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe label is not finished yet and most of the bands it works with aren\u0027t either. If you can imagine what it\u0027s like \"to be clinging by your finger nails to the last cliff of hope,\" this is where the label\u0027s at. A little help from you could make a big difference at a critical time. \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBy supporting Iron Man Records with a monthly donation, the Label will be able to remain Independent and release more records on Vinyl.\u003c/strong\u003e The money generated through your support will not solve all the problems, but it will reduce the upfront costs of producing the next record release on vinyl, as well as on CD, and making it available through digital platforms worldwide. I will continue to use my own money to finance the label but \u003cstrong\u003ea little bit of extra money each month, from you, would be a great help and makes planning the next release on vinyl a bit easier\u003c/strong\u003e.

Iron Man Records wants your \n\t\u003cstrong\u003ehelp to raise additional funds to make all new releases available on Vinyl \u003c/strong\u003eas well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMany people assume that because I run a record label, I must make loads of money and rip off all the artists and don\u0027t care about the music. This is wrong. Last year alone I lost more than \u00a317,000 trying to release a number of records and one of them got incredible reviews across all the major music press and national newspapers. But press is press, it\u0027s not record sales. \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eI put a lot of time and effort into helping bands with something to say\u003c/strong\u003e, either in their lyrics, or in the music. \u003cstrong\u003eI work hard to release their records properly\u003c/strong\u003e. Doing it yourself is easy, but doing it properly and giving bands the chance to generate a sustainable future is something completely different. I try to help them reach a wider audience and I do it as cost-effectively as possible, on a budget you can stick under a glass. And I do it because I love seeing good bands, good artists and good music getting an audience. Vinyl appears to me to be one way to remain independent, to give music a proper release in a beautiful package. \u003cstrong\u003eVinyl is a format that enables the music and words it contains to be valued as a serious body of work. Vinyl helps the work remain independent.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ironmanrecords/22050644795/in/dateposted-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"435\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5780/22050644795_926215a42d.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI would like to invite you to help. Iron Man Records can\u0027t help everyone, but the number of records the label can release on vinyl, and the number of bands that the label can help, is directly related to how much money I can assemble upfront, to initiate a release. I might spend \u00a35,000 sometimes \u00a310,000 before the first record even goes on sale. I don\u0027t want to have to consider going \"cap in hand\" to local \narts funding organisations or anyone else who might spend their time trying to \nre-arrange the record label\u0027s priorities to suit their needs. \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eI have to generate an independent source of money to release records myself. I have to do that through the work I do as a tour manager, through the stuff that the bands and I sell, and through the donations you might give. That\u0027s it really. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIron Man Records stands to live, or die, based on the money it can assemble to start a new record release, the work it can complete before the money runs out, and the income that the work generates once it has been released.\u003c/strong\u003e There will never be a funding application form or local government arts project involved in any record release, either now or in the future. That\u0027s a promise. But \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d like to audition for your help. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMusic is not just a file on a portable electronic device, it\u0027s somebody\u0027s life\u0027s work, their heart, the highest expression of the human mind, it\u0027s hours of work, years of peoples lives, it has value, it has meaning\u003c/strong\u003e. It should remain independent in an age of digital. Help me release music on vinyl and \u003cstrong\u003ehelp me release vinyl at a fair price and give struggling bands and artists a chance to be heard.
