Follow\nthese steps. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou pay me \u003cem\u003enothing.\u003c/em\u003e I\u2019ll email you a\njpeg of the drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst, find @irisytian on Instagram.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThen, email \u003ca href=\"mailto:tianiris13@gmail.com\"\u003etianiris13@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e with the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour dog\u2019s\nname and you or your dog\u0027s Instagram handle.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs many pictures of\nyour dog as you feel like sharing (at least 4).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA \u003cem\u003edetailed\u003c/em\u003e dog bio.\nThis can consist of your dog\u2019s quirks, weird habits, backstory, dreams, goals, or anything that would\nconvey his/her personality. It doesn\u0027t need to be long, but it does need to be specific. Please don\u2019t tell me your dog is a good boy who likes\nfood because there are a lot of good boys out there and they probably all like\nfood. The power is in the story so please take a little time to write it.\u00a0 If you tell me something that is specific to your dog, I can make the drawing extra special.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will respond within\n48 hrs and let you know when you should expect a drawing. If you need to send multiple emails, please reply to your first email instead of starting a new one. It helps me see all your dog\u0027s info in one thread.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the large volume\nof emails I get, you will likely need to wait a few weeks, but I really do get to every one of these drawings. When I post the drawing of your dog, his/her photo will be posted as well, hope that cooool.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nFrequently Asked\nQuestions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy is this free?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhen I draw your dog for free, you are my friend. When\nI draw your dog in exchange for money, you become my client. Artist deserve to\nbe paid for their work, which is why I cannot design your logo or album cover\nfor free. However, this is my hobby. I love dogs and I enjoy sharing my art\nwith you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo I don\u2019t have to pay you?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNo, you don\u2019t, but some of you have asked how you\ncould support me, which is why this Patreon exists. Alternatively, you can\ndonate to a rescue of your choice. Whatever you want to do is cool with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan I DM you on\ninstagram instead of emailing?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYou can, but I might not see it. Having\neverything in my email is how I stay organized\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan you draw my\ncat, lizard, bird, etc?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eUnfortunately, I cannot. I am passionate about dogs\nbecause I\u2019ve had them all my life and they have shaped who I am. I feel a deep\nconnection to them and hope that you can see that in my drawings. Humans can feel a connection to any animal, but I\u0027m just the most comfortable with\ndogs. I have drawn a lizard in the past and found it really challenging. I\u2019m\nso sorry if I have disappointed you and hope you understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003eI have 2 dogs, can\nyou draw them both?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYes, but I save the double dog drawings for weekends when I have more time, so you may have to wait a little longer than usual.\u003c/div\u003e"
