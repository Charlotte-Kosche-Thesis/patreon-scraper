     "about": "Ismael Cavazos is an artist hailing from Austin Texas since 1994, via Houston. \nCavazos\u0027 unique way of seeing the world began with seeing images in \nclouds. Introduced to the Scribble Technique early in his art career, he\n believed the images he was finding were a kind of super power - the \nresult of much comic book reading. The year was 1988 and at least a half\n dozen drawings exist from this period. Contributing to the rich history\n of the Scribble, Ismael went on to innovate in the field, creating a \nvocabulary where there was none. Unlike tea leaf reading which has a \nname (Tasseography), the reading of scribbles had no title, simply a \ndescriptive - the scribble technique. Thus, Scribblism was created: the \nart and practice of the scribble - and now that there was a name for the\n piece of pie of art he was working within, the artist realized there \nwas no meta-label for the pie - thus was born Extractionism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\n exciting new terminology, along with an update to Alexander Cozens\u0027 \n\u0027The Cozens Method\u0027 called appropriately, The Cavazos Method, has \ncreated a new pair of glasses through which to see the world. The theme \nthat has risen is one that concentrates on resemblances, their \nrecognition and subsequent utilization; with the most exciting example \nbeing the Old Man in the Peanut.",
