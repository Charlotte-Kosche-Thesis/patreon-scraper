     "about": "I\u0027m a Brit who has been living in Philadelphia for the past 10+ years. since I married my wonderful wife Sharon. I have been writing on and off for the past decade and a half and have been podcasting for the last 5 years and I have over 300 episodes to my name. My current main project is the podcast It Came From the Indies and it\u0027s the most excited I\u0027ve ever been about an online endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a huge fan of movies, big, small, old and new. I have a special love and respect for b-movies and low budget film, I love the passion that goes into those films in place of money, it\u0027s inspiring and exciting. My podcast reflects that by talking to amazing awesome people who love what they do and love talking about it, which is handy because I\u0027m a lousy interviewer! I hope to match their enthusiasm with my own and to shine a light on these talented folks who don\u0027t normally get the attention they deserve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also play video games, drink the occasional fancy craft beer and I am partial to a whisky or two also. Let\u0027s be buddies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have a Patreon because, well, right now I\u0027m not working. So the good part of this is that it gives me more time to do the things I love like interview awesome creative people. The downside is that I have to pay for stuff like web hosting, Soundcloud, Skype, oh and food and stuff like that. So if you like what I\u0027m doing and have a buck or two to floating around not doing anything..... I hate asking for things so hopefully this is fairly obvious what I\u0027m going for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive me money. I\u0027m asking you to give me money. I\u0027ll make it worth your while. Money. For me.\u003cbr\u003e",
