We are witnessing the birth of an inevitable blend of creature that is both flesh and machine. ILL INK seeks to illustrate in a gonzo light an AI positive atmosphere where visions of space colonization and enlightened living coexist. A singularity is a near inevitable absurdity so let\u0027s get this party started. It\u0027s a BYOT - bring your own thing - and I\u0027m bringing editorial cartoons and other unpredictables. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently this comes in the form of coloring book pages collectively titled Tweeting Me Softly: Illuminated Tweets of Elon Musk. It\u0027s an homage to the person that has re-ignited my hope of humanity getting off our host planet and online into the intergalactic-wide web of consciousness. Musk has opened me up to a worldwide collective of millions and millions of fellow passengers on this exciting adventure where humanity\u0027s development departs the womb of Earth. If we\u0027re all just ants working towards greater and greater ant hills, we all know who the queen ant is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be offering a few pages per week of Tweeting Me Softly here on Patreon at the $10 Colonizer support tier and higher. I will publish and print a limited run of only a few thousand copies of the first edition of the coloring book (there will be more editions in the future if the first book goes over well). I don\u0027t intend to stop or run out of source material unless of course, I am threatened with my life or lawsuit. Rather than either of the those scenarios, I kindly ask that you join the community and provide critical feedback to help me better steer this ship. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a more complete look at the ILL INK business plan you can read through my Goals, but for the love of space, have a beverage first. Unless of course you\u0027re already pretty spaced out in general. ;)\u003cbr\u003e",
