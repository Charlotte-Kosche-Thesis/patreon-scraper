Because the theatre, art and even\nalternative club scene were putting limits to our experiments with erotic imagery, we have decided to create a new project dedicated entirely to this subject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014\nIF started collaborations with various fashion\ndesigners, including Barbara Bologna, Leonard Wong, Alice Auaa, Majesty Black,\n0770, Creepy Yeha and others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n Also in 2014 Nick Knight used a selection of\nIF short videos for Nicola Formichetti\u0027s DIESEL fashion show in Venice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nINSIDE FLESH  has worked so far with fashion\ndesigners, musicians, performers and models in Europe, US and Asia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ARE YOU PAYING FOR?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll IF videos are made entirely by one person\n- BFV. \u003cbr\u003eFilming, editing, special effects, 3d animation, soundtrack\u2026 It all\ntakes time. \u003cbr\u003eThey say time is money. In that case - your money will give us the time we need to produce new videos.\u003cbr\u003eThis means you will\nget more of our work and won\u2019t have to wait so long for new videos. \u003cbr\u003eWe will\nbe able to finish the videos that have been in post-production phase for far\ntoo long (BLACK LAB to name one), create more short videos and photo shoots in\nnew interesting locations and with more guest performers. \u003cbr\u003eWe will also be able to\ninvest in new equipment which will improve the quality of our work and\nspeed up the post-production process.\u003cbr\u003eSo far all our video were made with zero or close to zero budget.

The last one is in post-production.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u2019s\nkeeping us from completing this project is our limited budget.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you help\nus reach this goal, we will finish the triptych and publish it on a DVD together\nwith full photo galleries from all SILVER AGE sessions. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nApart\nfrom a regular edition, there will be also a limited (30 copies) \u201cSilver Edition\u201d\nin a metal box with 3 signed photos (1 from each part).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://sukaoff.home.pl/silver_box3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd what\u2019s\nin it for you?\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf\ncourse all videos and photo galleries will be available on our website.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut also\u2026\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs soon\nas we finish the DVD,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- every\n$30+ Patron will get it before anyone else \n\u003cbr\u003e\n- every $50+\nPatron will get the Silver Edition DVD with signed photos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://sukaoff.home.pl/silver_box1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn SILVER\nAGE we combine elements referring to baroque painting, strongly transformed by\nour aesthetic interests. Once again we mix medical fetish with fashion, and\nthis time also with alchemical symbolism. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach\npart is based on the construction of the altar composition.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the\n1st part it appears only in the form of scenographic layout - the central\nplatform.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the 2nd part this concept will be expanded. At this point we are still\nmaking additional photos and the final design is not yet fixed. You can see\nsome fragments in our photo gallery in the series titled ADORATION.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the 3rd part, starring \n\u003ca href=\"http://skno1.tumblr.com/\"\u003eSKNO1\u003c/a\u003e, both video and action are divided\ninto triptychs. \n\u003cbr\u003e",
