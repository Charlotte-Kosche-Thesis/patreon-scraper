    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello everyone,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page! I am known online as InfinitySign.\u003cbr\u003e For years I have been creating TG comics and art, both hand drawn and 3D rendered. When I first started out I never imagined that thousands of people would read and enjoy my work, and yet here I am, still creating art with the support of my readers. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work! More specifically, \u003cstrong\u003emy free comics and art\u003c/strong\u003e. I have plenty of comics that I give out for free, they are supported by the sales of my premium comics but once sales go down, I have to put the free comics on hiatus. By supporting my Patreon it would mean that I can work on free comics more consistently! If I don\u0027t have to worry about the sales of my premium comics, I can alternate between free and premium comics, making sure i can pump out free comics more consistently.\u003cbr\u003eNot only will you be helping in the creation of free comics, but also the necessary items I need to keep creating such as, PC components, 3d models, and editing programs. I am running on old tech at this point, if I get enough patrons, I will finally be able to upgrade my system or even make a new build.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will this effect Premium Comics?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePremium comics will still be sold on TGcomics.com. They take a lot of time and effort \u00a0and I eventually rush and panic to try to get them out. With your support, I won\u0027t have to rush and panic, I can concentrate on quality without the sense of urgency and deliver a better product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about Deviantart?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs many of my readers know, I dabble in both 3d and 2d art. One of the reasons I want this Patreon to succeed is so that I can start drawing again. I have projects I want to go back to work on and new projects I want to start. So if you are a follower of mine in Deviantart, this will benefit you the most!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do Patrons get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to see how this goes before I commit to big rewards. But if you pledge 2 dollars, you will get access to teaser images including upcoming projects, unreleased projects, even premium comics.\u003cbr\u003ePledging 5 dollars will get you free comics early! You get to read it a week, even a month, before anyone else does. Keep in mind, that the comics will be unedited, which means that there might be minor visual and spelling errors. Don\u0027t worry, it won\u0027t ruin the comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to look through my Patreon. Whether you pledge or not, thanks for the years of support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
