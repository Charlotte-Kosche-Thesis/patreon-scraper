I stream 6-7 days a week, with my schedule posted up on my Twitter each week and on my Twitch profile. I also create Youtube videos, like the fun Elder Dragon Hoedown with Tom Delia and Archie Owen, the Full Force draft series, and Eternal Deck Techs weekly!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWHY THE PATREON? \u003c/h2\u003e\nI love creating content, but I can\u0027t make everything I want to. I recently lost two part-time jobs and I\u0027ve been testing out the waters for going full time, but I need help to make it work. Magic drafts and building new decks in MTGO and Eternal can cost a fair bit, plus the costs of buying/maintaining equipment and other games for the stream. I\u0027d like to continue to make content 7 days a week, but I need your help to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n Check out our goals to see my plans for how Patreon can support me in making better content!\u003cbr\u003e"

Once this reward is reached, a percentage of all Patron money will go to the co-hosts of EDHoedown to help pay for their time and effort in making EDHoedown a success. Why is this a reward? Because it\u0027s important to me that people who help me make content get paid for their work. Period.\u003cbr\u003e",
