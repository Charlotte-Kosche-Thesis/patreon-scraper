Semura here, though some of you may know me as Icy-Marth, as that\u0027s my artist handle I\u0027ve had since 2009. As of now, I\u0027m just a freelance/hobbyist artist, who loves drawing dragons and animals :)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tRight now, I\u0027m still experimenting with my style through \u0027experimental\u0027 commissions, but my main style is what you see throughout my galleries. No matter where my art takes me though, I know for a fact that I want to work on my stories and characters as much as I can!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t_____________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I choose Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe main reason I chose to make a Patreon is so that I can work on my own content more often. Be it character designs, comics, stories, etc. I have a passion project called Chasing Fate that I\u0027ve been working on ever since I was 12, and I\u0027d love if Patreon could help me dedicate more time to working on it \u0026lt;3\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHowever, because of my current situation, I need all the income I make to go toward keeping our place, and we barely scrape by as is, so I can\u0027t dedicate much time to working on things for myself.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t_____________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI want to eventually fully flesh out my Chasing Fate world(s), and make something people really enjoy. It\u0027s hard to dedicate time to do this if I spend most of\u00a0 my time doing commissions. I don\u0027t want to stop doing commissions altogether, but I would like a little more time to do some things for me. So, if I can make Patreon pan out to where I don\u0027t need to take as many commissions to get by, you can expect a lot more of these things;\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWIPs of commissions and personal art\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\n\t\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\u003cem\u003ePSDs of almost every drawing \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/del\u003e\u003cem\u003e.PSDs are on hold until I can get a better computer that can handle large files.
