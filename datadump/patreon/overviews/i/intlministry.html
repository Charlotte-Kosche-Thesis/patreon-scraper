We have been called by God\u2019s grace to serve the lost in multi-faceted ways. We have been privileged to serve people as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn Evangelistic Ministry\u003c/strong\u003e that preaches that salvation is by grace and faith in Jesus Christ alone. As God leads us, we go into the \u201chighways and hedges\u201d to preach the gospel with signs following us. The Lord has consistently confirmed His word by healing the sick, delivering the captives and saving the lost. Often we have been able to demonstrate the love and Gospel of Christ in a tangible way by distributing food, clothing and other essential items to local needy families.

(I Corinthians 12:1-11, Ephesians 4:11-15, I Timothy 4:14)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Teaching Ministry \u003c/strong\u003eto help believers become rooted and grounded in the faith and to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. We teach believers how to appropriate by faith those things that relate to their divine inheritance as heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ. We also warn of the dangers of false teaching and legalism that would lead believers away from Christ and His grace. (Romans 8:16-17, I Peter 2:2, II Peter 3:18, II Corinthians 3:6).

The answers are all there, all we have to do is seek his truth. Either you believe through faith, or you join the world in mocking God. God is not mocked, what we reap we WILL also sow.\u003cbr\u003e2 Timothy 3:16,17; 2 Peter 1:20,21\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is one God, existing eternally in three persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. All three are all one in three parts. Only the spiritual mind can discern how this is possible. Ask God for discernment today.\u003cbr\u003eJohn 10:30; John 14:26; Philippians 2:5-7\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod is truth and God is Love and He loves all people. It is His desire to reach out to those who are poor, oppressed, widowed or orphaned, and to heal the brokenhearted. He is calling out to humanity to seek his face.\u003cbr\u003ePsalm 68:5,6; 1 John 4:16\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMan is created in the image of God but separated from God by sin. Without Jesus we cannot have a relationship with God. What Jesus did on the cross is unique as showing the Love of God for his creation.\u003cbr\u003eGenesis 1:26; 1 Timothy 2:5\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of gospel is this:We can have a personal relationship with God through salvation, God\u0027s free gift to man. It is not a result of what we do, but it is only available through God\u0027s unearned favor. By admitting we have sinned and believing in the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, and accepting Him as Lord, we can spend eternity with God.\u003cbr\u003eEphesians 2:8,9; Romans 5:1; Romans 3:24\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe in water baptism, as taught and demonstrated by Jesus, as the way for believers to identify with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.\u003cbr\u003eMatthew 28:19; Romans 6:4; Matthew 3:13-17\u003cbr\u003eThe Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a gift from God. And a seperate event from salvation. As it says in Acts chapter 2, they were all saved, then the day of Pentecost had fully come, and the Holy Ghost came and dwelt in them. He helps empower the believer to develop the character of Christ and live every day in God\u0027s will.\u003cbr\u003eMatthew 3:11; Acts 2:4\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod gives all believers spiritual gifts. There are 9 all together. They are for the strengthening of God\u0027s people (the Church) and proof of God\u0027s existence and power to unbelievers. The gifts of the Spirit are active and relevant today. Not one is greater than another, as they all form the Body Of Christ.\u003cbr\u003e1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 1 Peter 4:10\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSanctification is the ongoing process of allowing God\u0027s character to be developed in us. Crucifying the flesh takes time, but if we have the desire, God will start and finish that good work in us.\u003cbr\u003eRomans 6:19; Galatians 5:22-25\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDivine healing is active in the lives of people today through Jesus, who is the Healer. Healing includes physical, mental, emotional and spiritual restoration. Just as Christ died for our iniquity to save us, he died for our infirmities to heal us. Infirmity has no power against us unless we allow it. Just as we believe Jesus has saved us, we must also believe he heals us as well.\u003cbr\u003eLuke 9:11; Matthew 9:35; Acts 10:38; Matthew 10:1\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to Luke chapter 16, The Bible describes hell as a real place. It is a place of suffering and a place of permanent separation from God for those who die without accepting Christ. God\u0027s desire is that no one be separated from Him for eternity, which is why He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. Jesus died on the old rugged cross so that we may be with him forever.\u003cbr\u003eHebrews 9:27; Revelation 20:12-15; John 3:16-18\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon, Jesus will return and take all those who have accepted Him as Savior to be with Him for eternity. Eternity is a very long time, Knowing and obeying Jesus can mean the difference in eternity in paradise of eternity in eternal damnation. Man was appointed once to die, but after that, comes the Judgement. If we have followed Christ, we will be with him forever and always.\u003cbr\u003eActs 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17; Hebrews 9:28\u003cbr\u003e",
