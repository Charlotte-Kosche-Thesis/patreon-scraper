    "summary": "Though I have had many, and will likely come upon more, the name that fits me best, as of right now, is Shannon Grey. \u003cbr\u003eI am a lot of things; I have been what I\u0027ve needed to be. A creative, an artist... a survivor, a martyr, a mother... a plumber, at times, oddly enough. Really, I\u0027m just me, just like you are you -- and I am all too aware that life rarely comes to us in terms of black and white. My blog, my photography, and all that follows is intended to be a celebration of that fact. I will, no doubt, touch on subjects that are light and fluffy and beautiful and fun, but I will also likely touch on things like death and feeling listless and lacking direction in a yet more directionless world. It won\u0027t always be easy. Some nights, it will feel like pulling bones from my own body, only to glue them back in the next day. Then, there will be days in which sharing will be a catharsis like no other, a catharsis I have never truly allowed myself to have. Ultimately, I pray that, no matter the length of your visit, when you go, you will go with a part of me. And, if you stay, I hope that this -- that \u003cem\u003eI \u003c/em\u003eam enough... I mean, if I\u0027m honest, this is probably (totally) just an elaborate way of convincing myself that it is.\u003cbr\u003e"
