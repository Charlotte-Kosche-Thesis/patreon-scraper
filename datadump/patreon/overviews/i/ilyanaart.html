So I\u0027ll do my best to make my promise a reality.\u003cbr\u003eI do this as a sign of love, for that woman with whom I lived so many joys, because I want her story to be heard, because I want everyone to know how wonderful she was as an artist.\u003cbr\u003eI want to finish the story she started, and publish it as a web comic.\u00a0I left my job and bought a pc and a tablet, just to be able to make her dream come true.\u00a0I want to dedicate myself to this full time, I do not want to stop until I fulfill my promise.\u00a0Because this is my only way to honor her memory, and the only way to show her that even though she is no longer in this world, she will be the owner of my heart for the rest of my life. Write and illustrate my love letter for her with more than 2000 pages,\u00a0and I hope that our story makes you appreciate and enjoy the beauty of love and life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe manga is named \"Welcome to Hoz / Us\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIs a story set 300 years in the future, tells the story of four protagonists who seek to face a totalitarian government called Eden that slave to all humanity, they as rebels will do everything possible to leave the system, and give freedom to World around them. And as the Eden Foundation will do everything possible to stop and hunt these rebels.\u003cbr\u003eIt is a beautiful story that will tell the fragility of life, the sense of loyalty, and above all the immense value of love and memories.\u003cbr\u003eThis story belongs to the genre of sci.fi/ Thriller / Drama.\u003cbr\u003eI regret not being able to share more details at the moment, but I want to keep you surprised for when I publish it.\u003cbr\u003eI plan to publish it in 2 languages, English and Spanish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that there are many artists with a lot more experience out there who could make this manga very easily, but no one will do it with more passion or with more love than I will, I will put my soul and life in it, I do not want anyone to do it for me, that\u0027s why I\u0027m learning to draw, and that\u0027s why I practice and write every day. Because I want to be good enough to make the story she wrote with so much love, the most beautiful story of all, so that her name will never be forgotten.\u00a0This will be a work done with love and dedication for a single person, but even though I do it just for her, I want to share it with all of you, I want everyone to know how great and wonderful she was,\u00a0And share our love with all of you\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003ebeforehand, thank you very much, for taking the time to read my story\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod bless you all.\u003cbr\u003e"
