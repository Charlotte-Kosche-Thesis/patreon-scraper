I have a passion for words and language, and my dream is to make a living off of doing what I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been a dreamer, living in my head and imagining places very different from this one. I remember, even in elementary school, when people thought I was too strange, I found solace in writing. I was able to experience things that aren\u0027t possible, even if it was through the eyes of my characters. As I\u0027ve gotten older, writing has still been one of the most healing practices for me, and it\u0027s driven my self-discovery and recovery. It has continued to be a place of comfort and safety to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough it is very difficult for me to do at times, I want to open up through my poetry and through my fiction and share this safety. Because writing has been a tool for me to sort through toxicity, my work tends to center around darker imagery and themes, and naturally, I am nervous about sharing such a private part of my mind. However, I am excited to set it free, so to speak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy choosing to subscribe, you will be unlocking access to exclusive content, including short stories, process videos, first drafts, and more.
