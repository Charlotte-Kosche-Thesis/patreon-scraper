And, in a time when economic devastation is threatening us all, I am engaged in visionary work that might help contribute to shifting the ways that capitalism dictates our entire life.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI see this work around race and power as part of the work in bridging with radical difference. \u00a0We will not achieve collective liberation without bridging with one another in light of our deepest differences. \u00a0I think the stories of the center of our own difference helps animate bridge building and is the process through which our differences are illustrated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to do that work with you and develop a deep partnership in this work. \u00a0I want to think with you and strategize with you on how to faithfully dismantle the logics of dominance and the logic of white supremacy that has framed our entire ethos. \u00a0Will you join this work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the Director of Public Theology Initiatives at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.faithmattersnetwork.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFaith Matters Network\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0We are building \u00a0communities of radical difference on a global scale that are committed to the radical act of justice-making practices, and we are doing that one story at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you join me?"
