We tell their stories. \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://intercontinentalcry.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIntercontinental Cry\u003c/a\u003e (IC) is a growing network of volunteer journalists, editors, professors and students from around the world. For the past 14 years, we have been working to bring you to front lines of climate change, and introduce you to the cultures, the histories and the challenges that face the world\u0027s Indigenous Peoples.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince we started out on this journey, we have published stories for more than 650 Indigenous Nations. Our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws, it has  helped catalyzed movements, it has exposed hundreds of human right abuses; and most importantly, it has given Indigenous Peoples a secure and independent platform driven by people who respect indigenous rights as much as they demand journalism excellence.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy we are on Patreon\u003c/h3\u003e\nAround the world today, there are hundreds of struggles like the Standing Rock Sioux\u0027s fight to stop the Dakota Access pipeline. These indigenous defenders depend on IC  to  carry out interviews,  coordinate with local journalists, conduct fact finding missions, collect evidence, put a spotlight on environmental threats--and above all, make sure their experiences are fairly and accurately represented.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWith the threat of climate change bearing down on us, this kind of fearless journalism has never been more important; \u003c/strong\u003ebut we can no longer afford to cover the cost of running a nonprofit newsroom. We also urgently need to hire more staff so that IC can continue to meet the growing needs of the world\u2019s indigenous peoples. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter two years of research and experimentation we have identified a clear path to achieve that goal and ensure IC\u0027s sustainability. We need your help to get there!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat we will do with your money\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nHIRE ESSENTIAL STAFF:\u003c/strong\u003e We need to extend IC\u2019s capacity with the addition of a ful time Development Officer, and a part-time Associate Editor, Spanish Editor, Investigations Editor, and Video Editor (to produce viral videos for you--our Patrons).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nCREATE A JOURNALISM PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM:\u003c/strong\u003e Establish a new program to build strategic partnerships with non-profit organizations, universities, newsrooms and indigenous governments to ensure that indigenous voices are fully understood and fairly represented in the media and other influential spheres.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nINCREASE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING:\u003c/strong\u003e   We will expand our network of journalists, increase our reporting and fairly compensate contributors who head out into the field.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce we have reached these three goals, we can extend our mission with:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE K\u00c1:NEN SCHOOL OF INDIGENOUS JOURNALISM\u003c/strong\u003e: Bilingual journalism courses on digital security, ethics, research methodology and a unique range of other subjects while offering aspiring journalists the skills necessary to produce effective journalism in their own communities.
