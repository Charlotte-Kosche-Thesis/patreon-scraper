    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHere we are. Together. Hello.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rookes. I\u0027m looking to move into the next stage of my work, and I\u0027d like you to come with me. Rookes is my indie-pop solo project based out of London UK, but on the regular I also go by Jenny Bulcraig. If you\u0027d like to hear something of what I sound like, you can hear it on the video above; this is a track I\u0027m currently developing, called \"Signs\". If you\u0027d like to hear what I sound like, here\u0027s my debut EP, The Game \u0026amp; The River:\u00a0http://hyperurl.co/gameriverep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been here since October 2016 and it\u0027s been BRILLIANT. So, if you want to get on board with our merry band of Patreon Patrons,\u00a0here\u2019s some solid projects that I have in mind:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Collaborations\".\u003c/strong\u003e I love to develop creative relationships with others. While this would include live performances/ videos/ records with some diverse and incredible creatives (including actors, spoken word artists, coreographers, burlesque artists, and - of course - musicians). Through Patreon support this has already manifested a fantastic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_kgB6S6mbU\"\u003eMusic Video\u003c/a\u003e and has begun to slowly generate a special EP record featuring amazing artists like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://omemorie.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eO Memorie\u003c/a\u003e; this record\u00a0will be bootleg, raw and unique, \u003cem\u003eand available to Rookes Patreon Patrons before anyone else.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe release of \"The Game \u0026amp; The River\" EP. \u003c/strong\u003eHaving recently been signed to the little-but-fierce indie label\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.weareseahorsemusic.com/\"\u003eSeahorse Records\u003c/a\u003e, I have gained access to better promotional platforms and I want to release my first EP in style. It\u0027s recorded, packaged and ready to go - and after Patreon Patrons helped power the successful release of my debut single \"The Heel of My Hand\",\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/and-write-ups-in-15024487\"\u003elots of folks are excited to hear what comes next\u003c/a\u003e - \u003cem\u003eand you can make this happen!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe making and release of the coming EP2\u003c/strong\u003e and all that this entails in terms of marketing/ PR. As it stands, I\u2019ve been a bit trapped between London and the Midlands, so I would also like to create a wider tour to promote this next record, so that as many of you as possible can actually see me perform - starting with UK - and then seeing how far we can get. Additionally, the recording is already underway.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/jenny-bulcraig/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAKA ROOKES Podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- this will feature stuff about music/ culture/ feminism and LGBT topics. I also want to keep getting relevant and interesting guests on this podcast. This is really important to me because I believe that part of being an artist is that we absorb our world, filter out the parts we see as important, or interesting or beautiful and offer them back to the world. I want to offer a commentary. I want to get people discussing things and sharing ideas. AKA ROOKES is an easy way to do this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis is new to many of you, but I\u2019m also writing a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eFolk Opera\u003c/strong\u003e based on one of my favourite childhood stories. This has been a dream for years and I have some serious work to do on it (it\u0027s a long-term goal), but I want the getting it off the ground eventually to be at least POSSIBLE.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eI would love to welcome you into this wonderful musical journey, so if you want a slice of all of the above - check out the packages and sign up!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMUCH love...
