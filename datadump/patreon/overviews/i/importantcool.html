You can set the news agenda, communicate directly with journalists, and observe and influence every stage of the newsmaking process. Welcome aboard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonate to ImportantCool and you will receive full access to our Artefacts Cave and Engine Room, as well as editions of our print digest, Paper Fetish. You\u2019ll become part of the team deciding the editorial agenda. We all want quality journalism. This is your chance to have a say in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur model depends on a community of conscientious patrons who can help us set the agenda. We don\u2019t just want your money, we want your time and ideas too. Help us change the media. Help us change the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Care\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are giving you the chance not only to access some of the best independent journalism from around the world, but also the opportunity to be a part of every stage of the news cycle.\u003cbr\u003eWe want to change the way that news is produced and we need your help. Have you ever wondered why some stories don\u2019t get covered in the world of ivory-tower journalism? Ever been annoyed by the bias displayed by some news organizations? Ever wanted to shout at your screen because of the easy rides handed out to people in power by the fence-sitters of the global media complex? We have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraditional media, by failing to give people the power to alter or influence its output and by refusing to divulge its processes, is keeping secrets, be they protests that go uncovered or clandestine government deals that go unexplored. Too often it fails to perform journalism\u2019s most basic functions: To inform the public and to hold those in power truly accountable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe in a fundamentally inclusive media model, where people hold sway, and where the little man or woman find their voice represented in print. This is why we believe you should care about ImportantCool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond the public interest justification for the new website, there\u2019s also the fact that being able to interact with the journalistic process can be deeply engaging, and even a lot of fun. By exploiting the power of the Internet in ways that have never before been imagined by any news organization, ImportantCool puts unprecedented power at the fingertips of paying users \u2013 patrons and those who operate a digital wallet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing the Writelines to make associations between stories and between artefacts, making RemICses in their own time, and commenting on items published on the website, we hope that readers get the type of experience that regular, flat online stories do not deliver. We think ImportantCool will offer a mind-altering, radical, step-up experience that will keep readers coming back for more and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eImportantCool is a worker-owned journalism collective which will radically change the way the news is gathered, presented, and consumed.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will give readers, not editors, control over stories. Patrons will vote on which projects get funded and which get dropped. We are even giving readers the chance to vote on which stories and pictures are included in our dead tree digest, \u003cem\u003ePaper Fetish\u003c/em\u003e, and it\u2019s bi-annual photo-special insert,\u003cem\u003eRadical Transparencies\u003c/em\u003e. At ImportantCool, you will control the news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn line with our core philosophy of radical transparency, ImportantCool will feature the Artefacts Cave, containing transcripts of interviews, documents, audio recordings, and any additional original source material behind our journalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we do not believe that paywalls or other subscription-for-access news sites really do justice to the democratizing power of the internet. Because we believe in your right to know, at ImportantCool our articles, films, cartoons, podcasts, and photo-essays will always be free to access for everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who go the extra mile and support us will enjoy access and influence even beyond this unprecedented level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead more -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://importantcool.com/about/our-philosophy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://importantcool.com/about/our-philosophy/\u003c/a\u003e"
