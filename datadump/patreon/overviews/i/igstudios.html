    "summary": "Welcome to the Inked Geek Studios Patreon page! \u00a0IGStudios was founded in June of 2014 by Nate Ward. \u00a0It started as a small little studio with a single podcast called Geek Access. As the viewership and desire for podcasting grew, Nate wanted to do more. In December of 2015 Nate started his solo interview project called Mind of a Geek. Mind of a Geek kicked off great as a solo-interview adventure with such guests as J.F. Dubeau, Garrett Weinzierl, and Amy Frost. \u00a0As Mind of a Geek was approaching double digits for episodes, long time friend of Nate\u0027s from high school, Brandon Raymond, took partnership in the studio. \u00a0It was there that the Inked Geek Studios we know today began to be born. \u00a0Within a short amount of time after joining forces, Mind of a Geek became a dual host show, Sonics \u0026amp; Sabers was created and added to the network, and Nate and Brandon\u0027s love for 80\u0027s and 90\u0027s professional wrestling poured through That Was Awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the few years in existence, logos have changed, show times have changed, formats have changed, but the love for doing shows and communicating with our fans has never been stronger. \u00a0Now with a couple additional guest hosts and a couple artists \u0026amp; creators on board, we are very excited to have our studio family growing even further and we have more ideas and also new shows in the pipeline. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo follow our feeds, buckle yourself down, and enjoy all the content provided to you by Inked Geek Studios. \u00a0And, if you feel like IGStudios is something you would like to help support, as one of our biggest fans Annaliese would say, \"Give Em A Dollar!\". \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting our Patreon page and taking the time to read a little about us. \u00a0We hope to hear from you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe IGStudios Crew\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Current Podcast Schedule* (all times in Eastern time)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaturday - 8pm -\u00a0Mind of a Geek\u003cbr\u003eSunday - 8pm - Movie Busters\u003cbr\u003eMonday - 8pm - Indie Case Files\u003cbr\u003eTuesday - 10pm - Solutions To Fix the Universe (Starting April 3rd)\u003cbr\u003eWednesday - 10am - All Geek\u0027d Up\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
