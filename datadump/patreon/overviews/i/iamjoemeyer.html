While my day job (retail worker and occasional sign artist at a specialty grocery store) pays for the essentials, there are other things that I\u0027ve neglected that I want to promote my comics with and enhance the process!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eInitially, I\u0027d be using the money to help pick up the slack from my job. But, I want to do other things as well. I want to give my current website a facelift for starters. It really needs it. I\u0027d like to be able to start streaming doing art (further promoting my work). And eventually I would like to get a new computer and scanner altogether.\u003cbr\u003eThese are small goals for now, but in time, there could be more, such as doing different comics, like finishing old projects and/or starting new ones outside of autobio! And who knows? I wouldn\u0027t mind making a living off my comics, but hey, you gotta start somewhere!!\u003cbr\u003eWith how things are working out, I could potentially produce a page about every week. \u00a0There are times where my life gets very busy with taking commissions, as well as dealing with what life throws at me, so it might wind up being less than 4 pages a month! I want to eventually get to more than that. I\u0027m hoping that if I see I have people that will pay me to see more comics from me, then I think it could ultimately inspire me to do more. If I somehow can come up with enough content for more than once a week, then I\u0027ll change things here.\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for supporting me on this journey, hope you enjoy what I create!"
