First of all I want to let you all know that I have been using this page as a bit of a blog - anything that doesn\u0027t fit on a tweet tends to wind up here. So, even if you\u0027re not one of my patrons I want you to know that there is still plenty of content here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you\u0027re looking for\u003cem\u003e Pursuers\u003c/em\u003e chapters or \u003cem\u003eOcularis\u003c/em\u003e pages, the featured tag is below and to the left. That will display a list of all \u003cem\u003ePursuers \u003c/em\u003eor\u003cem\u003e Ocularis\u003c/em\u003e posts that you have access to view. Not sure what \u003cem\u003ePursuers \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eOcularis\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0are? Continue reading, friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uDycpWK.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBasically everyone calls me Purge, except my family, and you can too! Due to a mix of geographical, medical, and family issues, I am unable to get a typical job. Therefore, I have been struggling financially for a number of years. I\u0027ve tried a handful of different avenues of earning revenue online and they really haven\u0027t panned out at all, mainly because my ISP, who has a monopoly in the area, is only consistent in their inconsistency. I then tried to make a name for myself on Youtube. Stuck with it for about 2 years before I got frustrated with many changes and the all but total lack of growth and I stopped. I do still occasionally make content for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally I tried my hand at Twitch streaming back on August 15, 2015, when Empyrion Galactic Survival became public, and I\u0027ve been streaming as regularly as I can ever since! In December of that year I decided that I wanted to become more professional than the casual \"Streaming every waking hour\" that I was up to that point, and that has led to the channel you see today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a writer. I first began enjoying writing when my 7th grade English teacher Mr. Rice explained things in such a way that it just... clicked. I managed to become one of 5 or so students that year that got a perfect writing score on the FCAT (Florida state test), and the only one not in high school. I\u0027ve been writing scenarios, short stories, or novel pitches ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently serializing a story called \u003cem\u003ePursuers\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which can be found both here on Patreon and on Wattpad. I may eventually compile it into a digital book (or more!) and sell it for a small price if the people wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VZxsw55.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI am a variety streamer, meaning I play any number of different games. From new AAA titles to retro games to indie titles and everything in between. I play RPGs, Shooters, Strategy games, and basically anything but MOBAs on various platforms. I try my best to stream 6 days a week for 3+ hours each. I tend to play a fair amount of multiplayer games that allow me to play with you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love giving back to you guys. You\u0027re an amazing community and I only wish I could give back more. I like to do weekly and monthly giveaways for my community. I also do occasional events, such as my \u003cstrong\u003eXmas Eve MEGA STREAM\u003c/strong\u003e, where there are giveaways, collaborations, and the opportunity to donate for charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE TO PARENTS\u003c/strong\u003e: There is a significant amount of coarse language in my streams. We do try to keep the inappropriate topics to a minimum, however, so I do not use the \"Mature\" tag on Twitch. I leave the decision to you as to whether you find my content appropriate for your children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/H5093B3.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs of this writing (HA!), I am currently writing a story called \u003cem\u003ePursuers\u003c/em\u003e and serializing it monthly right here on Patreon. What does this mean? The first Monday of every month, I release a new chapter of the story to the public via this page and my Wattpad account. \u003cstrong\u003eTHIS PUBLIC RELEASE IS COMPLETELY FREE!\u003c/strong\u003e My Patrons always receive the story chapters before the public does, typically 2-3 weeks in advance, as well as exclusive access to any bonus content related to the story and its universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a webcomic (strip) in production called \u003cem\u003eOcularis\u003c/em\u003e which is being released every Wednesday for Patrons and every Friday publicly for \u003cstrong\u003eFREE\u003c/strong\u003e! Patrons also get exclusive access to bonus content like side comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have another webcomic that I\u0027ve been trying to get started for a number of years. My artist, however, tends to get very busy, so progress is slow at best. No estimate available on releases for this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have various other story ideas that I would like to go with as well, however I lack reliable proofreaders in order to begin taking them seriously. If you\u0027re interested, please say something in the \u003cstrong\u003e#writing\u003c/strong\u003e channel of the community Discord.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ivoHZKL.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eConsidering becoming a patron? Thank you very much for your consideration! If you\u0027re new to the process, you\u0027ll see a list of tiers to the right (on desktop) ranging from $1 per month to $20. These are in USD. Each tier has its own set of rewards, and also includes all rewards for previous tiers. \u003cstrong\u003eThis means a $20 patron gets every single reward listed on this page\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I want to say that the majority, if not the entirety, of the funds received from your patronage go right back into services for my Twitch viewers, and any potential costs related to publishing any of my stories. Essentially, your patronage goes right back into making my content better for you guys!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quick note: the Patron-Only Stream ($3 tier reward) is a special stream that is done \u003cstrong\u003eseparately\u003c/strong\u003e from my Twitch account, and is strictly for $3+ patrons and my Community Admins. A recording of those streams will be available exclusively to the $3+ patrons if you were unable to attend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, I wish to say thank you to all of you. You guys are the reason I continue streaming and writing.\u003cbr\u003e"
