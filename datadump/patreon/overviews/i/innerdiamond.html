I had no real sense of self-care or peace. Exhaustion led me to leave my full-time management position and I began learning a new way of being. I\nresearched chronic illness, addiction, healing, nutrition, spirituality, meditation. I read \u003cem\u003eThe Artist\u0027s Way\u003c/em\u003e by\nJulia Cameron, began painting and joined a gallery. Drinking, smoking, drug habits fell away. I saw a naturopath and a\npsychologist. Two decades later, tremendous healing has taken place. I\u0027m uncovering more every day a place of stability and goodness within me. And a few years ago,\nafter adding natural medicines and supports to my routine, I tapered down on my\npharmaceutical meds and then dropped them totally. Dis-ease in my case has\nbeen fairly severe, and so there is on-going attention to symptoms that may\narise. I\u0027m still learning how to best care for myself. And to be able to\nexperience, at times, such exquisite joy and peace -- even in the midst of pain\nand disability -- this is a treasure beyond price. In the big picture, the\npeace and joy are ever-deepening. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat People Are Saying\u003cbr\u003eAbout Inner Diamond Insight Cards \u0026amp; Readings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmy B., counselor, says\u003cem\u003e \"The\ninspiration and direction I receive from Inner Diamond Cards has been\npriceless.

I am-\u00a0 of course - myself still growing into the wisdom of\nthe cards, as they came to me from the highest part of my consciousness.

You are\na superstar! Don\u2019t believe it? Give it a chance. The truth is that you\nhave accomplished good-enough things for the moment and it\u2019s important to allow that to sink in.\nStep back, fold your arms, and survey the treasures of your kingdom. Are you\nstill alive? Something to celebrate! Have you learned anything lately? More\ncause for revelry. What about your friends, or others around you\u2026 anything to\napplaud there? It\u2019s time for a thanksgiving party, no matter what\u2019s going on in\nyour life right now. Blow off some steam, play some music, do some dancing,\nnotice the colours around you, the vitality pulsing in all things. Hopes and\ndreams can indeed come alive -- some say that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. So there\u2019s\ntimes when attention to detail is important, times when persistence pays off,\nand times when it\u2019s wise to pause and enjoy what you have created for yourself and what grace has bestowed.\nSkipping the pause for gratitude and self-satisfaction guarantees that you will\nfeel the treadmill effect at some point, or frequently. Not necessary! The Lord\nof the Dance formally requests your presence at the festivities.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eIndulge in the appreciation of\nthe miracle of You, and of all Life.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe INNER STRENGTH card:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003eHow to tell the difference\nbetween glass and Diamond? Strike glass and it shatters. But Light can\u2019t be\nharmed. Listen carefully: You are not alone, and you have more power than you\ncould possibly imagine. Faced with conditions that confuse, frustrate, or seem\nto confine you? You signed up for this remarkable situation, and it\u0027s\nabsolutely happening for a good reason. If it feels like things are going wrong\nor slow, you are being asked to adjust your pace, invoke curious patience, and\nopen to the situation for you are attaining mastery. Deep lessons are being\nlearned, and all will come to light in time. Sometimes Life says \"do you\ntrust me or not?\" And you have a choice, an opportunity. You can run away,\nshut down, point fingers, become helpless\u2026 or you can take one step into the\npart of yourself that is so resilient, so intelligent and so loving that it\nhandles beautifully whatever comes, no problem. Step into the heart of the\nDiamond. Feel its powerful white-gold light shooting rays out from your center,\nsaturating your aura, forming a peaceful and protected space for your being.\nFrom this secure place, you can take appropriate action when the time is right.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003eBeneath the surface, things\nare shifting.
