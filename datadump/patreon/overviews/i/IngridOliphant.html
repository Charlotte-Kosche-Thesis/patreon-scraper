    "summary": "I am a former law enforcement professional turned shaman and healer--sort of. I didn\u0027t actually choose to \u0027turn\u0027; I was \u0027turned into\u0027 by forces much larger than me. In October 2013, three years into the process of becoming the who and what I am now, I chose to become homeless to bring the healing work I do across the country and follow visions shared with me by Ancestors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike many modern healers, I have chosen to follow in the path of those that have come before, to work with those who live in poverty and cannot pay for services as well as those who have financial stability.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ingridoliphant.com/Im_on_a_mission_to_love_and_serve.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI\u0027m on a mission\u003c/a\u003e to change how we define healing and the holy. To that end, there is no set fee for the healing work--I\u0027ve been paid in pickles and paintings.  I truly believe that it is invaluable and priceless for those ready for it. I also believe it should be available to everyone regardless of their checking account and that shifting our view of economies and systems must begin at the grassroots level; at the place where real-life rubber hits the road. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to traveling the US to heal individuals, I work with those that most cannot see: ancestors, elementals, the elements themselves and others identified as \u0027of spirit\u0027. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe visions they share and directions they point are the source of true stories and, when words won\u0027t flow in prose, poetry brings my relationships with the invisible to life in a way that others can share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs travels and travails unfold, one of my support team, Jayme Hopkins, shares messages from spirit in the form of poured paintings. Her art is both guidepost and a reminder of the beautiful way I walk through the world. \u00a0 Each piece of writing in the book will be accompanied by the painting connected to the story. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work is richly rewarding in many aspects, however there is no paycheck from the universe (and the winning lottery numbers have not been included with the visions!) and we struggle to meet our own needs as we help others meet theirs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support of Patrons will allow us to continue to follow the vision and direction given by the Ancients as well as self-publish this collection of stories about how--any why--I\u0027ve come to be this wisdom-keeper and magic-weaver.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporters will help keep Tater (my 2006 Mini Cooper named so because when I took her off the lot, I hollered \"Let \u0027er rip, Tater Chip!!!\" and it stuck) on the road and Jayme in paint. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
