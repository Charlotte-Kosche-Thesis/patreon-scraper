We are also offering our full releases free to our higher tier patrons.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe need this funding for numerous reasons.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn Online Website (to look proffessional and attractive)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePromotion/Ads (to get the word out that we are making great things)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSteam Greenlight and other Developer License Fees (getting our games on platforms like iOS and Steam can be pretty expensive if you have little to no budget)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTeam Members (Artists, Musicians, Designers, and other programmers need to be paid for their work and I need the help)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopment Hardware (such as a mac, dedicated linux computer, servers for hosting, and console dev kits ; all very expensive)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd Most Importantly so we can work on games full-time. Which will not only dramatically speed up development time, but will make our dreams come true.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout In-D Gaming:\u003c/h2\u003e\nIn-D Gaming is an indie publishing company that I have been trying to build for years (Formerly Known as \"CZ Games\" or \"Condition Zero Games\" prior to November 2011). It started back in 2010 when my interest for game development peaked, before that I tampered with software development and writing batch scripts, I was barely figuring out that I can be making games. I was a nerdy kid, which I am grateful for because I know more than I would otherwise at a young age. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince In-D Gaming started (2010-2012) we have worked with a lot of other developers and people from around the world. One of our biggest achievements was our collaboration with Caleb Roberts to make\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CZGames.CHaxBeta\u0026amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCHax\u003c/a\u003e (now removed from the Play Store), a physics sandbox game (like GMod) for Android. It gained a really good reception but then development came to a halt for several reasons. We have since then, been working on the belated sequel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indgaming.CHax2\u0026amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCHax 2\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have teamed up with others over the years and have gone through various loops and we then realized in order to overcome our struggles we need to limit who we work with. Now that it we are just a few close friends, we can carefully decide who takes apart in the action, and with your help we can have the budget to acquire new team members who we can trust to do a good job and stay in it for the long run!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur team now consists of 3 people right now, not including those who are not officially part of the team but occasionally do some work with us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eProgrammer\u003c/strong\u003e - Caleb Zepeda: That\u0027s me, I also make art sometimes but so does everyone else who\u0027s on the team, but programming is my specialty. I put the game together, and I\u0027m the only one who works with the game engine right now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMusician \u003c/strong\u003e- Joshua Zepeda: My very talented cousin.

     "about": "I was born May 19th, 1996, and ever since I was young I wanted to work with computers. I even wanted be a member of the Best Buy Geek Squad . Then when I became 12 and got my own computer I started to learn to write batch scripts that would mess with the computers at school, then I turned over a new leaf and used my powers for good by learning to write useful software in Visual Basic. Using knowledge I would learn in school like how to find your Target Heart Rate, or how to balance your checkbook, I wrote applications which I was too nervous to ever show to my teachers. Then I started learning C# because I knew it would be more relevant with uses such as XNA and Unity3d. Shortly after that is when I found out about Unity3d and started pursuing my game dev dream.\u003cbr\u003e",
