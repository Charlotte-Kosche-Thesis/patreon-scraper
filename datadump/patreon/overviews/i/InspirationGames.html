I want to draw our societies back to the traditional social spaces and create tighter bonds of families and friends. No, I Mean It! With screen time replacing our social atmospheres in and outside of the home, we wanted to put something out into the world that let family and friends sit down and say hi to each other. Ideally, this greeting would be said over the fantastic clash of swords or growls of imaginary zombies emanating from your nearest [IG] board game box.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Why am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom this completely self-less goal, I turned inwards and asked myself, what do I get out of this? The answer... every step of the way to achieving that goal, is for me. Making games? Totally selfish. Talking about games with some of my closest friends on Youtube? completely narcissistic. I\u0027m just glad that with my abundant self-interest I could take time to eat in all of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAaaaand this is where you come in. With every dollar, every yen, peso, or cryptocurrency \u0027space credit\u0027 given to me, I can buy that essential can of spam, herring, or sauerkraut to keep me breathing another day and getting me the chance to bring everyone closer together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have endless idea\u0027s, from educational games for schoolkids, to team-building games for corporations I have a plan. Ideas are cheap... its the work that counts, and boy, am I putting the work in. I want this to work so bad it burns. Everyone is rooting for me, and I think if I can show you the stuff I got going on under the hood then I think you will too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am on Patreon because it offers an easy way to do two very important things. The first is it gives me a chance to make my dreams come true by producing amazingly fun games through your generous donation. Second, it gives me yet another chance to reach out and interact with those who enjoy what I am producing. This is a great opportunity for content-creators like myself to meet up with people who really like what we are doing. The Patreon crew is so good that their\u00a0content is 100% uncompromised, payment is more predictable. This means I can focus on the work I can do while they, and you can watch my back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelping me help you\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor every month of your continued support of my dream, my vision for our societies, you get access to all my Discord content. Its just me in fifty shades of way to much me, but I\u0027m there for you guys!\u00a0I will be having weekly discussions about my games and ideas, and you can grab a seat on our discord to listen in and participate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as always you have my thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Jackel\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspiration Games\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
