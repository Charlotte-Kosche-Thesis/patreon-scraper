But in art projects, I am the person to ask for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIn the past, I\u0027ve done some illustrations in book covers \u0026amp; children\u0027s books in Mexico and in Texas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFour years ago , I was introduce to coloring books for adults. This is a perfect way to share my art with others. I decided to return to drawing \u0026amp; illustrations and make this my full time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI am very exited to be part of this new Trent, there are so much talents artist all around the world ! I will love to coloring some of theirs illustrations.\u003cbr\u003eI am an author of a Coloring books \" A Coloring Feast , A Carnival of Delights \u0026amp; The Carousel of Utopia. \u201c These books  to me are a great way to share what I love \u201cArt\".\u003cbr\u003e* I am an Artist with Dyslexia \u0026amp; ADD, is this a curse or a gift?\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was little I was incharge of drawing all the birthday cards and Christmas cards for the family. Everybody loved it. At school my grades were average, but my parents believed I was mentally disabled, because they did not to know I was dyslexic and have ADD.\u003cbr\u003eYears pass and I had the opportunity to learned how to live my life with this condition, and something that was a shadow became like a caterpillar to a butterfly; an incredible light for the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow, I see this \" condition\" as a GIFT that I can open every day!! I understand things visually, by finding them in paint/illustrations. I don\u0027t know if my dyslexia causes me to be this way, but Art helps ME to convey messages that are difficult to put in words.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I tend to think in images as opposed to words, that make my life a crazy experience. If you are talking to me, I may look I am listening but in reality I am doing more than that, I am creating a whole movie inside my head....\"\u003cbr\u003e**************************************************************************************************************\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Have you \u00a0ever asked yourself , why we need Art ?\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003eArt is all around us. It\u2019s in the clothes we wear, it\u2019s in the tv\u2019s we watch, it\u2019s in the houses we live in, it\u2019s even in the chairs we sit on. \u003cbr\u003e*We need Art to keep us connected.\u003cbr\u003eArt is everywhere and\u00a0\u00a0introduces us to diffrent cultures and new knowledge. I think that it makes us smarter and expands the mind.\u003cbr\u003e* We need Art to keep us healthy.\u003cbr\u003eI think that we definitely need art in our lives. It is a form of self-expression that can help people get through a lot of problems. \u003cbr\u003e* We need Art to understand and and share our individual history.\u003cbr\u003eViewing art enables us to look inside other people\u2019s stories and to look at the world in different perspectives. Since the beginning of civilization, people have used art as a way to communicate and tell stories. It opens up our minds in many different ways and creates an environment that allows us to be more culturally aware and think more critically.\u003cbr\u003e*************************************************************************************************************\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eHere is how Patreon work, You can give a pledge to support me ~ then I will have budge and totally focus on drawing for you guys everyday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere are also rewards and gift for each pledge, such as, bookmarks, illustrations,books,discounts, original Prints.
