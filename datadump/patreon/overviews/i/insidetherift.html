I initially started the site with the intention of interviewing some of my favorite artists, but quickly found that it had far more potential and shouldn\u0027t be limited to just that. It has since evolved into a place where I can showcase my own art (Music, Photography/Videography, and Photoshop Hyper-collaging) and build relationships with individuals from several disciplines by way of interviews, DJ mixes, and podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSounds cool, but what intentions do you have for this project in the future?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my dream to segue the website into an entertainment network featuring in-studio podcasts, a magazine. I want ITR to be a thriving community for like-minded individuals to explore, expand, and educate themselves and others. I\u0027d also love to get into philanthropy as I have a soft spot for the underdogs who are also trying to make a living doing what they love but may have fallen on hard times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLofty dreams I know, but if you\u0027re going to dream, I believe that you should dream big.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why do you need my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love what the site has become, it is extremely time consuming to scout for interviews \u0026amp; mixes, produce videos, write/edit the blog posts, and make sure that the site is functioning properly. I handle everything alone, and unfortunately, ad revenue just isn\u0027t enough to allow me to create comfortably. If I want to create a platform large enough to make a real difference, your support is critical.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love the website and I want to support you, I really do, but I don\u0027t have the financial means to do so at the moment; Besides, how do I even know you\u0027ll appreciate it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very grateful for every single artist, musician, intellectual, and/or creative who has been kind enough to share my work or be involved with the site in any capacity. Your shares, views, subscriptions, and other forms of patronage are immensely appreciated and you are by no means obligated to donate, nor should you feel bad if you are unable to. If you don\u0027t have any money to spare, sharing content from the site with everyone you know and asking them to do the same is just as valuable. If content goes viral, eventually, patrons will find this page and the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou could also do a one-time donation using the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/donate?donatePageId=556f27bbe4b08923f83da37f\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edonation tab\u003c/a\u003e on the site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a million and please drop by if you haven\u0027t already!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInside the Rift:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.insidetherift.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.insidetherift.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayPal:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/insidetherift\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.me/insidetherift\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMixes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/insidetherift\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/insidetherift\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
