If you are sensitive to energy,\nif you are an empath, a healer, or a guardian, welcome.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFar too\noften, I encounter articles, discussions, and resources that describe in detail\nthe difficulties of being energetically sensitive or of being an Empath. There\nare many resources that describe why it is difficult to function as someone who\nis sensitive to energy or to coexist with an Empath. We often hear about healers\nwho become drained, overwhelmed, or sick from their work. Guardians definitely\nneed to maintain courage, strength, and endurance. I wholeheartedly believe\nthat being energetically sensitive is a gift to the world. We can thrive and\nengage in a healthy way with the world around us, even in our current political\nclimate.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are\ntwo essential components to incorporate into our daily living if we are to maintain\nbalance. First, we must build a connection to the land that we live on. The\nEarth is our foundation, our safety, and our support. Secondly, we must embrace\nour darkness. We cannot achieve balance without understanding our own darkness\nand the darkness of the world around us. My primary focus will be to share\nresources for connecting to the Earth for support and guidance to help you\nunderstand your own darkness.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a\nmember of the Patreon community, you will have access to a range of rewards: patron-only\nguided meditations and a monthly online discussion group, the Embracing\nDarkness Podcast, consultations, distance healing, and discounts for online\nclasses.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nA little bit about me. I am a Certified Medical\nReiki Master and Soul Guide (a fancy new word for Psychopomp). As a healer, I\nwork in the darkest of places, specializing in healing soul wounds caused by trauma,\nPTSD, and addiction. I frequently work with clients who have autoimmune\ndisorders, adrenal fatigue, and other stress-related health issues. Using Reiki\nand soul healing techniques I work to create a safe space for others so that they\ncan begin to engage in the deeper work of healing past wounds. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
