    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://inthestillministries.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIn the Still\u003c/a\u003e is a meditative worship band seeking to bring people into the presence of the Creator with our music. We recently finished recording our debut EP \u003cem\u003eI Wait for You\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and we\u0027re currently raising funds to have it produced and released. We want to bring you into this process with us and give you some great music along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we\u0027re releasing soaking worship music each week. Usually, this is going to be a live recording of a worship event we lead at a local church. Sometimes it might be something different. You can stream and download these tracks completely free! Plus, if join at the Full Digital Catolgue level or higher, you\u0027ll get a CD every month with the soaking worship from those 4-5 weeks. That\u0027s 7-10 hours of music every month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first single, \"Arrival,\" is available now, with the second coming soon! But Patreon supporters get access to a bonus track not available anywhere else. Join our Online Backstage Pass for just $1/month and you\u0027ll get a live version of \"Reflect.\" Not to mention another exclusive bonus track for every future release!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Online Backstage Pass is your access to our process of writing and recording. We\u0027ll tell you about songs we\u0027re working on, ideas we\u0027re having, and give you first access to what\u0027s coming next for the band. Plus, your name will be included on the \u003cem\u003eI Wait for You \u003c/em\u003eEP!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpgrade to the next level, and you get all of that, plus our Full Digital Catalogue. We\u0027ll send you a download of our most recent release (currently, that\u0027s the upcoming \u003cem\u003eI Wait for You\u003c/em\u003e), and you\u0027ll continue to get early access to full downloads of all future releases for as long as you\u0027re on board!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you add a VIP stamp to your Backstage Pass, things start to get really interesting. At this level, you get a monthly video chat with the band (maybe all of us, maybe just one or two, depending on the month), sneak peaks at new songs as they\u0027re still being written, and a physical copy of every new release for as long as you\u0027re a patron\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is your chance to see what goes into our music and be a part of bringing it to life. We can\u0027t make \u003cem\u003eI Wait for You\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a reality without your help!"
