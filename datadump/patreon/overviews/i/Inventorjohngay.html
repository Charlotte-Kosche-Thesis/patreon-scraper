    "summary": "John C. Gay is the inventor of a specific method for improved electric motors and generators which he calls the \"waterwheel\" method. Mr. Gay lives and works on an off-grid, solar-powered homestead in northern Louisiana. He acquires his creative materials by recycling used or broken items, such as old TVs, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens, and used stereo equipment that he finds at road-side garbage sites, or items donated by friends and Facebook followers. Mr. Gay is a retired homebuilder, and a former digital electronics engineer. Once a computer interface hardware designer; John Gay went off-grid to spend more time doing the things he loves. He has  a deep love for Mother Nature and a passion for: the environment, for organic gardening, and for his two cats- Monkeygirl and The Fat Man. He is especially passionate about his newest motor inventions and his dream of building advanced, ultralight, magnetic motors and generators. Mr. Gay does not own a car and does not use nor burn any fossil fuels. To learn more about his environmental activism and his dreams of ending carbon combustion and replacing ALL internal combustion engines with electrical or magnetic motors, we can read excerpts from Mr. Gay\u0027s personal motor blog:\u003cbr\u003e     \"It seems that i have lucked-up again with a well-balanced rotor that has excellent resonant properties, and seems to get a beneficial, gravity-assisted bounce at times. My waterwheel design is noted for stable but adjustable speed/timing, so this is the first time in a while that i have seen clear evidence of the \"swing-set\" effect that Tesla once described in one of his patents. Knowing the theory doesn\u0027t always make it easy to reproduce, however; especially if you DON\"T WANT an uncontrolled, magnetic, chain reaction. The series configuration of armature windings that i used before, more similar to regular motors, seemed more likely to incur the phenomena of resonant speed/power amplification, or run-away acceleration under \"no load\" conditions. It must be, as with the last motor (which flew apart at high speed), a result of the light weight and extremely well balanced rotor made of composite and high-tech materials, which also have the tendency to come unglued at high speeds. Anything much over 3000 rpm begins to put tremendous inertial and magnetic forces on the rotor, which must be made of solid steel plate or carbon fiber composite. Aluminum bends and breaks, and it is not practical for high torque electric motors or electric vehicles. Structured steel or composite materials should be used. The wood, epoxy, glue, Scotch tape used by a poor inventor like me just isn\u0027t strong enough to avoid disintegrating into an explosion of wire and magnets, so builder beware! I have decided that seeing is believing (i had thought Tesla\u0027s claim to be false); but i think now that if i want to sell my motor ideas to the public (instead of letting them get stolen by industry), i should go ahead and risk taking some my shrapnel in my arm, and try to \"blow-up\" another one of these high-speed, resonant rotors. I can make a really cool Youtube video out of it...\"\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a writer, artist, and the inventor of \"virtual reality\" (first person to patent a complete system of virtual reality, US Pat# 5394029). My first invention was completed in 1979, a robot that i named \"Hector\". I have also designed many hybrid digital/analog circuits, high gain amplifiers, invented the first electronic inclinometer, the first electronic compass, several toys and other devices, like a robot arm Halloween costume. I am currently inventing anomalous or \"free energy motors and generators that have exceptional characteristics and superior performance over publicly available electric motors and generators. I am fighting against the lies in the MSM, the influence of big oil in academia and the dumbing-down of America\u0027s educational systems. For several years now, i have been trying to help expose the truth about the suppression of free energy devices, such as the ones i am currently building and using for my personal, electric transportation, and using for my customized, my off-grid home. I enjoy organic gardening, and spending quality time with my two cats: Monkeygirl and The Fatman. I have zero income, and no family, and i do not use fossil fuels. Because of this, I am known locally as \"the crazy bike guy\", in spite of my high level of education, and my history as a \"Hall of Fame\" inventor, a former BBB accredited business owner. Because of this label imposed by the local oil and gas industry, i am forced to rely on the kindness of strangers: and for the past four (4) years, i have depended entirely on donated materials and items that i find in the ditches and dumpsters, garbage and litter which i recycle into my arts and inventions.\u00a0",
