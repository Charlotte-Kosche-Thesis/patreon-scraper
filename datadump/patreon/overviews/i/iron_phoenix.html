I\u0027ve been arting for a good 15 years now, and after several years of people telling me I should sell my art, I\u0027ve decided now is a good time as any to see if people like my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream has always been to be a professional artist; after becoming disabled and having to stop studying, I thought that dream was as good as gone. Now, however, there is a chance that I may be able to go down a different path - this one! Each payment will mean I\u0027ll be able to concentrate on doing what I love best rather than simply doing it out of boredom or what have you - and on top of that, more than what the payments will mean physically, it will go a long way to helping me feel a lot less useless and anxious as drawing is my go-to for destressing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been featured in an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://asexualartists.tumblr.com/post/136346019818/interview-christian-de-mohun\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003einterview about asexual artists\u003c/a\u003e which also showcases a lot of my varying styles as well as some of the processes behind my art and how closely it ties into my beliefs and mental states. I\u0027m also a published author - a couple of poems, nothing big, but still - it\u0027s something :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance if you do become a Patron!"
