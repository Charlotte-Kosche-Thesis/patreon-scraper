I\u0027ve always had a great passion for storytelling and through the years have found that comics are my favorite way to share said stories. Because life is as it is and we have to have money to pay the bills, I spend most of the time working on various freelance projects so as to support myself and my family. I\u0027d like to be able to spend a greater amount of time working on my passion project: \"Variants\". To do this, I need to have the support of my loyal fans like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tRm5oMN.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Variants: Stripes\" is the first graphic novel of the \"Variants\" series. It is a 130+ page female friendly and LGBTQIA+ friendly superhero comic created by myself, Annie Erskine, written by Clint Waters, art by both myself, my wife, Joy, and Joe Davis. The comic will be available online 100% for free. Our goal is to be able to upload 2-4 pages a month once we get a decent backlog of pages completed. The story revolves around\u00a0Samantha Johnson or \"Sam\", a top secret military agent who\u0027s been out of the superhero game for 10 years. She is suddenly thrust out of her retirement when a mysterious adversary begins wreaking havoc, only to vanish without a trace. With the help of her ally Technologic and another unlikely ally, she must take down this villain and discover his true origins before more innocent lives are lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can start reading the comic for free today here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://variants.thecomicseries.com/\"\u003ehttp://variants.thecomicseries.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://variantscomic.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://variantscomic.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/w7YeGH3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no great aspirations of fame and fortune.
