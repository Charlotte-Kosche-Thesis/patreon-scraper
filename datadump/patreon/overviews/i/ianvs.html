But until that day comes, we\u2019re\nhappy and satisfied producing these tales as a labor of love. Because after\nall, if we didn\u2019t love doing it, we wouldn\u2019t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat We\u2019re Making\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe want to be very clear: We\u2019re making stories, not games. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nA lot of adult fiction attempt to gamify itself by giving\nyou status bars, wallets or other mechanics that players must attempt to manage\nwhile enjoying the story. We avoid this entirely. Our stories are about the\nstory telling experience. We won\u2019t distract you from the immersion by requiring\nyou to shift focus to torturous mechanics\nthat don\u2019t add to the experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are writing true interactive fiction. Our stories provide\nchoices and dialogue options that don\u2019t penalize you. We want you to enjoy the\nstory regardless of the decisions your characters make. Your choices change the\nflavor of the tale, not the outcomes. Using an \u201call roads lead to Rome\u201d\napproach gives you the freedom to influence your character without fear or\nworry that you may lose access to something down the road. In this way, you\nmake the character yours by influencing the way he behaves. And it\u2019s not up to\nuse to tell you what is good and bad behavior. It\u2019s your character and you\nshould be free to play him as you choose. We believe that in fiction, all\nchoices, good and bad, should lead you to a reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor example, if you choose to sweet talk your wife, then\nlater she may buy something sexy and put together a romantic evening for the\ntwo of you. Alternatively, if you trash talk your wife, she\u2019s not going to go\nout of her way to do anything sweet, but she has needs too and will still\nengage in a rousing round of hate sex. Either way, you get what you came for,\nan adult oriented outcome. Your choices merely changed the flavor of it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe want the replay value of our stories to arise from a\ndesire to experience the tales from a different perspective via the decisions\nyou make in the story. The incentive to replay the game lies in making\ndifferent choices that impact your relationships and ultimately change the\nflavor of that relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we want the visual style of the game to be of the\nhighest possible quality. Our goal is to produce life-like renders to really\naid the reader in becoming fully immersed in our stories. We want you to look\nat our images and question whether it is computer generated or a photograph.\nThe technology to do this is comparatively inexpensive, but what most\ndevelopers lack is the experience. This we have, and what we don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll\ngo out of our way to learn if it produces the best possible renders for our\nstory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy We\u2019re Making It\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eBecause we\u2019re fans of adult fiction. And as fans, we\u2019ve\nplayed a great number of them over the years. Many of them right here on\nPatreon. But for one reason or another, we always felt some of the best fell\nshort of expectation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSometimes the problem was game mechanics that made you\nreplay again and again until you found the exact combination of actions that\nlet you unlock the carnal scene you were longing to see. Unless you\u2019re offering\na walkthrough with your game, all you\u2019ve successful made is a long slog through\nhell.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOther times, it was a developer dangling the carrot for far\nlonger than we had patience. You know the type, you drop them some money on\nPatreon and after a year the story is still slowly building towards that sex\nscene you originally signed up for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSome games have a great story, but the images and renders\nare so poorly done that you have to visually choke down the images to progress\nthrough the narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, some are just bad. The writing is bad, the\nscenarios absurd and the dialogue is a grammatical fucking train-wreck.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAll of which leads us to why we are making our fiction: Because\nwe believe we can do better by holding ourselves to a higher standard of\nentertainment. We believe we can make interactive fiction that is laid back,\nenjoyable, fun to read, fun to watch and fun to fantasize about without having\nto save scrub your game to get to all of the good parts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere We\u2019re At\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe first story in our upcoming library is still in pre-alpha.\nWe\u2019ve begun writing the text itself and doing preliminary work on the renders,\nbut we still have a long way to go. We\u2019ve mapped out a production schedule and\nhave set milestones for version releases to keep everything on track. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe plan to release a sample of the pre-alpha in the coming\nweek as a proof-of-concept. The current renders for the story are placeholders\nand set pieces. Most of them are missing props and none of them have proper\nlighting effects. It is more of a storyboard than work of art. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are still building our catalog of characters, sets, props\nand materials, but step by step we are sourcing or building the required\nassets. We have an acquisition schedule in place so we know what pieces we need\nat the various stages of production.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur release dates are tentative based on the hardware\nlimitations that we are currently overcoming, but we hope that soon, and with\nyour help, we can get this train up to speed and hit every stop on schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHardware. That is our Achilles-Heel at the moment. Our\ncurrent system designs are optimized for code composition and compiling, not\ngraphics rendering. What we need is the funding to upgrade the graphic\nrendering capabilities of our rigs. These upgrades will reduce the amount of\ntime required to produce high quality images and allow us to release superior\nquality content faster. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u2019t need your support to put food on our tables\nand pay our rent. We have jobs for that. We need your support so that we can\nacquire the hardware and assets we feel are required to write, render and\nrelease the stories we are excited to write about.
