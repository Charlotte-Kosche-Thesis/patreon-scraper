     "description": "This goal is the creme de la creme! It gives us money to invest in a better studio set up. It would mean we could start to put savings towards things like buying Nick a great acoustic and electric guitar. Record in proper studios. Pay for wonderful musicians to come and record with us. Have our music professionally mixed and mastered. Money to make lovely physical CDs. Make great videos. Make an album and get a producer on board! (We haven\u0027t worked with a producer since we worked with original Ilya member Dan Brown, on They Died For Beauty). Basically this goal would give us breathing space to spread our creative wings and take on some interesting musical challenges.
