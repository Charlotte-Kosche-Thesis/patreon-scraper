    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eInsideCroydon.com has been reporting on news and events in and around Croydon, on the fringes of London, since 2010. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we started, there were two local newspapers based in the borough, and a dedicated reporter working the beat for BBC London. All have long since moved away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we remain, and with your help, we\u0027ll continue for some time yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is how you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating the compelling content which has seen more than 1 million iC pages read in the first nine months of 2017 is taking an increasing amount of time, and some other costs. Until this year, I had provided all of the resources for the site, but to continue to do so, and to expand and improve our coverage as I would like, needs greater resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarlier this year, to fund a legal defence of our coverage - we were right, and we won, but it still cost hundreds of pounds - I was humbled at the response of our readers to our #BoxparkBallsFund. You raised \u00a31,600 required inside 24 hours. The comments which accompanied the financial contributions were really heartening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have rolled out some on-site advertising on a trial basis, and have redoubled efforts to find sponsors for the site. But colleagues elsewhere suggested that, with the co-operative model we aspire to having for our publication, Patreon might offer a suitable funding source.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I apologise, but I am asking for your help again - but this time on a much more modest, though regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be hugely grateful if you would consider supporting InsideCroydon.com with a monthly donation. The more people support the site, the more time\n I can spend looking at the documents and the issues that affect and interest you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We will be having some benefits for our donors: our Talking Inside Croydon events, so popular in the summer, will be returning with an entry fee. Inside Croydon donors will get free entry. Special offers and competitions will in future be provided exclusively for Inside Croydon donors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can afford to give \nhalf-an-hour of London Living Wage each month, then you\u0027ll be registered as an InsideCroydon.com donor, and qualify for the regular benefits, as well as having a little warm feeling inside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease do your bit to keep real, and professional, local journalism alive in and around Croydon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSTEVEN DOWNES\u003cbr\u003eEditor, \u003ca href=\"http://www.insidecroydon.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einsidecroydon.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
