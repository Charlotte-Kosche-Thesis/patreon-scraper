They strive to increase the popularity of clients\u0027 work by writing press releases, setting up book signing tours, scheduling interviews, and designing marketing campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBook publicists can work as independent agents or as staff at larger publishing agencies. The upper-level positions often involve long business hours and overtime.  It is a satisfying profession, except for that recurring haunting question that always seems to pop up in one\u2019s mind: \u201cDoes anyone in the publishing business really know what we actually do?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople in this business still assume that the only good thing a publicist does is book appearances on Oprah, The Today Show or The Late Show. Even though this circuit is outdated \u2014 Oprah\u0027s show has been off the air since May 2011.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an era where lack of publicity is repeatedly cited as a major reason books fail, so many publicists, with years of experience, are struggling to keep their jobs? Many blame it on the disrupting digital revolution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe publishing industry is changing. New devices and means of consuming content are disrupting old established models of doing business and forcing book publishers, publicists, authors and chain and indie bookstores to rethink their long established models.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew technologies are entering the market with better, faster networks and new devices, such as e-readers, smart phones and tablets, are changing the face of the industry as we know it. Publishers are providing content for these devices and advertisers are exploring how to communicate with prospects and customers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world is becoming connected and print is having to reassess its position in the market as new alternatives are being presented with much marketing support. It is time for a major rethink.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet and the democratization of the publishing industry have made it easier than ever today to publish a book. With so many people publishing material in so many different formats, the competition to sell one\u2019s writing has never been fiercer.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is a solitary pursuit but when it comes to promoting, an author does not want to be alone. Wise authors and savvy indie publishers are investigating what book publicists can do for them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublicists can both directly and indirectly skyrocket book sales through their marketing and promotion efforts, book tour, securing author interviews and leveraging the author\u2019s website and social networking profile. One thing is certain: the book with the extra marketing push will always do better, even if a similar title is as good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInternational Book Publicists Association (IBPubA)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are establishing the first, and only, International Book Publicists Association to facilitate online communication and interaction among authors, publicists, publishers, journalists, booksellers, indie bookstores and the media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIBPubA will also offer offline communication and networking opportunities to its members through the organization of meetups, conferences, educational seminars and workshops, around the globe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will work with IT professionals to develop a state of the art enterprise scale secure communication system for members so they can communicate smoothly across geographic and time boundaries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe publishing industry has gone global with wireless eBook delivery and Amazon delivers everywhere, so why not the book publicist industry? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIBPubA will also include authors, journalists, small indie book publishers, booksellers and independent bookstore owners to further widen the scope of collaboration and communication along the book publicity value chain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncorporation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIBPubA will be incorporated as a non-profit non-governmental organization with the mission to promote and protect book publicists and to raise awareness of book publicists and their praiseworthy work, in the context of current and future economic, cultural and political development. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIBPubA will represents the interests of book publicists at the international level and will also function as an online, and offline, meeting place for publishers, authors, journalists, booksellers and publicists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMembership\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIBPubA membership will include a broad spectrum of publishing colleagues: publicity, promotion, marketing and sales professionals within publishing houses; freelance book publicists and marketing consultants; literary agents, authors, media escorts, journalists, trade associations, wholesalers, independent bookstore owners and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGovernment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe International Book Publicists Association (IBPubA) will be steered and governed by you; our esteemed member.
