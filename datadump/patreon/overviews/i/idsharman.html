Because, presumably, you like what I do and want to help me make more of it. And what will you get in return? Well, for now a weekly piece of flash fiction, which I\u0027ll be writing with the aim of putting out a follow up to Words On A Wall. I\u0027ll be sticking firmly to science fiction stories for this though. I\u0027ll also be posting updates on the various graphic novels I currently have in the works. Also, my most generous Patreons will be rewarded with signed copies of every new book I put out. And...I have a few other ideas, but feel free to suggest things you\u0027d like to see me offer on here.\u003cbr\u003e"
