Bookbinding is a wonderful craft (and a hobby) that has almost two millennia of history. It is a life long task to study bookbinding and I do it along with readers of my website and my students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sure that by becoming patron of iBookBinding you would support not only the website itself, but the whole bookbinding community, that would get more tutorials, reviews and posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, bookbinding (writing about bookbinding and teaching bookbinding) is only one of my jobs. I hope to devote more time to iBookBinding.
