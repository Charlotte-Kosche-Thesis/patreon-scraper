Funding it out of my pocket. From the money saved while I had a steady job from 1999 to 2010. Those savings are gone now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do freelance video projects and license my footage. But those are very few and very far inbetween that i\u0027am in a constant state of anxiety about my finances. Getting a steady stream of income through Patreon would ease my situation a bit. Even a few hundred dollars a month would make a big difference and let me focus on creating more videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will you use your Patreon contributions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start off, I\u0027am just looking for some basic financial support for my travels. I travel cheaply in the Himalaya. Simply because of the reason that I can camp and hike in the mountains for free. With more contributions coming in, I can travel to other parts of India and abroad to bring you more interesting videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other pressing need is to upgrade my photography equipment and invest in new gear to expand my cinematography skills. My 8 year old Canon 5D mark II is on its last legs. I need a good camera for video and I\u0027am excited by the possibility of using drones to incorporate aerial footage into my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are your plans for the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime-lapse videos are just the beginning. I want to create videos that tell the story of my travels and also of the people and places that I encounter along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will name the series \u003cstrong\u003eTribeless\u003c/strong\u003e after my blog. And what better way to start it off than in Ladakh. The place where many of my other journeys began. I\u0027am heading there this winter (of 2017) and hope to come back with some interesting content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTill then here is a short teaser for you on what to expect from the new series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SyLjjAnZ9Hg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for staying till the end. Do consider sponsoring my videos. However little. Coz every bit helps."
