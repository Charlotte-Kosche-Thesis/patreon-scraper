    "summary": "Hello! We are Josh Flanagan and Conor Kilpatrick, and together we are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ifanboy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiFanboy, the comic book website and podcasts\u003c/a\u003e. (Ron Richards just left us to go work at Marvel.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might also know us from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://goodfellasminute.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoodfellas Minute\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like comic books. Every week we read our stack of comics, and one of us picks their favorite book and we call that the Pick of the Week. Then we grab our microphones and we get together for one hour a week to talk about that book, other books, some other comics stuff, and maybe read some listener mail. Who knows? We try to have as much fun as possible for ourselves and our listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s called the \u003cem\u003eiFanboy Pick of the Week Podcast\u003c/em\u003e, and we\u2019ve been producing it since November 2005. That\u2019s right \u2014 we\u2019re one of the original comic book podcasts and we\u2019re still going strong into our 11th year of fights, insights, and dumb jokes and call backs. And even some useful analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u2019s not all! In addition to the flagship show, we also discuss the big comic book-related films and TV shows in our \u003cem\u003eiFanboy Special Edition Podcasts\u003c/em\u003e. And every once in a while we interview a comic book creator on \u003cem\u003eiFanboy Talksplode\u003c/em\u003e or review a classic trade paperback, graphic novel, or collection on \u003cem\u003eiFanboy Booksplode\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eiFanboy is almost entirely listener supported. If everyone who listens to our various shows contributed the average price of a comic book every month ($3) then we\u0027d be well-positioned to not only keep making the shows we always have, but we\u0027d be able to add all kinds of fun new shows to the mix. That\u0027s less than one dollar an episode! But not everyone can contribute financially and that\u0027s okay. Keep listening and keep telling your friends about our podcasts--that helps too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been so thankful to our loyal iFanboy Members who have made the show possible over these last 11 years. Without you, iFanboy would not be where it is today. We hope that our awesome iFanboy Patrons will\u00a0help ensure that we can keep the iFanboy network of podcasts going well into the future! Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
