To make it worthwhile and also to cover the costs of things like domain hosting, I need these podcasts to bring in some money every month. When you support the Into It Podcast network, you\u0027re supporting independent queer art and criticism, which I like to think serves some kind of important function in times like these.\u003cbr\u003e"
