    "summary": "Well, here we are. The\nnext frontier toward creating a bold \u0026amp; new,conservative, American revival.\nAnd here I am asking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe video above tells you what I want to do with my Music and News Channel. So\nwhat\u0027s Patreon? If you\u0027re just showing up here for the first time ... here\u2019s\nthe lowdown: If you\u0027re a fan of mine and want to support me in the creation of\nnew songs/webcasts/videos/writing/performance-art and more inspiring\n\u0026amp; InspoNews casts, this is the place, as you can see.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd the feedback from the patrons gathered here has been \u003cem\u003eGREAT\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s working. I read comments we discuss, I love\nfeedback, I am figuring this system out\u003cem\u003e\nas I go\u003c/em\u003e, with the help of the people here. \u003cbr\u003eInspoNews CONTACT: 1-407-961-9480\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy backstory: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve been happily struggling since I got off my record label in 2015 to find\nthe right platform for ongoing support, through which I can release constant\nmaterial (and get paid). I\u2019ve gotten to know myself. as a news cast\ncreator, a singer-songwriter. As a recording artist, I thrive on a direct\nmainline to my audience without having to go through labels, distributors, the\nleft wing, establishment media machine.  I love making things and instantly\nsharing. I know my community: you\u0027re smart, kind, patriotic, supportive,\nfuture-platform embracing people and you are loved and so appreciated!. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI think subscription sites like Patreon are a new revolution in\nnews-music-release and art patronage. What I\u2019m doing flies in the face of\nmost conventional approaches: I try to release pretty much \u003cem\u003eall of my artistic content\u003c/em\u003e for free: the songs and videos live FREE\non YouTube, my site, wherever. THAT IS HOW I LIKE IT. Not everybody wants\nto buy it. That\u0027s fine. It\u0027s yours, it\u0027s everybody\u0027s, you can take it, you can\nshare it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eI NEED YOUR SUPPORT VERY MUCH:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut to do this: I need support, true patronage and those of you willing to be\nthe driving engine to pay for the continued production of more content. \u003cbr\u003e\nAlmost 20,000 of you have subscribed to my channel since this past January 2017.\nPatreon is more of a commitment: Without your support I simply cannot continue\nthe work I do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou get a road test to\nPatreon if you\u2019re hesitant. You can cancel before you\u0027re charged at the end of\nany month, so it\u0027s risk-free). By being a Patron together we can change this\ntroubled world and make it a better place \u2013 and do this as partners and\nfriends.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI really believe in the future of \u003cem\u003e\u201cWE THE\nPEOPLE.\u201d  \u003c/em\u003eI believe in\n\"crowd-power\" and what Patreon is doing to help\nindie voices in the \u201cPEOPLES PRESS\u201d like me. It isn\u0027t making world news\n(yet), because it is what it is: a quiet, underground network of artists\nconnecting directly with their fans, bypassing the entire commercial system and\nbiased establishment news media. This is incredible. In these days of artist\nnegativity, Patreon is the bright side of the net: it is how the web can really\n\u201csave indie artists\u201d like myself in an art \u0026amp; news economy that is\nfloundering with so many sites offering free music streaming. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd it means you need to step up and support the artists you love, the conservative\npolitical newscasters like me that you want to see bravely challenging the\nsystem, the art work you want to see reflecting the realities of this\ngeneration, the musicians you want to fill your hearts and your stereo\nspeakers, the journalists you want to see writing about the state of the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the key: \u003cem\u003eTHIS IS A HUGE\nEXPERIMENT.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you guys know me, you know I \u003cem\u003elisten\u003c/em\u003e.\nAnd together we can make this a better nation and world for our children and\ntheir children. (Proverbs 13:22) Whatever you feel led in your heart to give, I\ncan\u0027t thank you enough for your being a patron here. We love America and desire\nto promote and preserve her freedom with all the abilities God has given us. We\nuniquely report the news in word and in song and will do so with the sharp edge\nof truth always. With your help, you have made our \"pen\" mightier\nthan the sword. For conservative, patriotic and faith based news please\ndonate or comment today! God bless you and God bless America! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo together, let\u2019s \u003cem\u003edo this for ourselves, for our families\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u2019s DO THIS FOR AMERICA! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKeep the faith \u0026amp; never, never give up!\u003cbr\u003e\nFederico\u003cbr\u003e"
