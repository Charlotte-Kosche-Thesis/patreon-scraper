     "description": "At $1500 a month, I can live out my dream of quitting my day job\nand doing YouTube and content creation full-time. This has been my dream since\nI was a child, and if this goal is reached, I will be the happiest man alive. I\nwill be able to stream multiple times a week, make higher-quality content, and\nspend the time necessary to make all the content I would like to for you guys\u2014such\nas a podcast and a daily show. This goal encompasses my hopes and dreams and\nwill enable me to live the life I have always wanted.\u003cbr\u003e",

This way, I will free up a significant chunk of my daily time as\nediting takes much longer than actually filming and posting the videos. With\nthis spare time, I will make content that requires more preparation like\ntutorials, lists, behind-the-scenes, tips and tricks, theories, news, skits,\nanimations, and more! These will all be on top of the content that already\ncomes out and will not replace anything I already do. If we reach this goal, I\nfeel that we will be one step closer to creating the greatest community in the\nworld.\u003cbr\u003e",
