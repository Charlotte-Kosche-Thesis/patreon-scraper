I had already finished one that I was pretty proud of, but I managed to close my tab and loose all my text the first time around. I hate introductions but here we go! \u003cbr\u003eI am Ibelinn Cosplay, from the land of vikings! (Norway). I\u2019ve been a creative person for as long as I can remember. From drawing at a very young age, to painting, taking photos, photomanipulation, graphic design, etc. Then around 2012 I discovered cosplay, which doomed me to forever spend money and time on costumes. I finally found an outlet that fit me perfectly, where I felt I belonged, where I could show off my love for games/movies, and where I could hone my skills. I\u2019ve never found a hobby before that combines so many skills together, and it was just love at first sight. From having to let my grandma almost sew my whole first costume of Neliel from Bleach, to making elaborate and big costumes later years all by myself. I just love how cosplay gives you a reason to explore so many paths and materials. I\u2019ve gone from sculpting clay to working with leather, worbla, sewing (which i sucked at so much when I started but have come to love these later years with a passion), foamwork, casting, and now recently 3d modelling and printing. The sky is the limit, and I really want to bring you guys with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhy patreon??\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, with facebook and instagram getting worse and worse I\u2019ve decided that having at least one platform where I can share things without the horrible algorithm could be smart! It\u2019s a place where you can actually see all the content I post.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFor now my plan with patreon is to just update with whatever I do. My dream is to be able to give you guys more interesting content like making of videos, patterns, tutorials, etc. I\u2019m still building my collection of equipment which will allow me to create more stuff efficiently for you guys, with the quality I want. It\u2019ll be a work in progress, but I have a lot of plans for the upcoming months. My goal is that I can give you guys content you would actually like to support with a subscription, as I see it fit that you pay for something you actually want. I also just want to create a community and be in contact with you guys! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve met so many amazing people through cosplay, and I appreciate all of my followers so incredibly much! You support, likes, shares, comments helps me keep on going, love you guys!\u003cbr\u003e- Ibelinn\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://facebook.com/Ibelinncosplay\u003cbr\u003ehttp://instagram.com/Ibelinncosplay\u003cbr\u003ehttp://twitter.com/Ibelinn\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mDxbJLegT8m4jVQiyn6ZqjYbJHuWaDhiKMzY0rTyYV46n7MV2NHvjdiskN1JtbXTdMCwPHpK38Ev4ve_Lwy-ZhCQVlXjI9MbNKiA_lEYMb-t5L4XNpn6uI9UXnzW95r1fzJNAlFR_bq_xluFPaet4Pvu6zLQ2brJFnzBPIDTmD3zSuLsTD7Rn2upGSQWWmhWwd1nc8SXb58km1zDh9Tbs6EoJnie81iY2ew0aMM91udxrn6m0wtKtR7Mf99L0ckBap19dBHapYREyeWOqjlEMQUOTkNMZIDbpQ7_CFewoHklmeLoMP5tvxsCL1snkrnPY_hfk_TBMvtHTL10-ZzGlAqf9VMtX5aBTBdLwx_SJ5EUoiRpN2rcbFZ2zEuKY-oVu8dhVQaCA1C-GfqlxVXr5tB40Z49myIdffzT9YvWbv3zsSWGys4ueyohQNeYc8PvRx1i63KPDz6fOVTNDOUGG_IgpN3zstRMTezgLV_0B2lKfKiblPsaT-MWhziEugT6N_M1ipp-RvPS8jbQnqZxq1hRQmxL2AC4Abvu9m0cFmiK53diBWe5B9d5sbeOqb_vux5ZTDSXYhqbAcQVyOUoIJgLc0UekUmSNxblpkg=w550-h974-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
