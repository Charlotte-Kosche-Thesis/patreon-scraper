    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eAttention is our spiritual currency. Energy flows in the direction of our thoughts and awareness.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that if we change the quality of our attention, we can change our world. Entertainment doesn\u0027t have to be empty, we have the ability to make better choices and ultimately improve our lives by exploring new avenues of thought, knowledge and imagination outside of the boundaries of self-limiting belief structures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, \u003cstrong\u003eInnerVerse \u003c/strong\u003ehas several meanings. It is the infinite internal reality that is expressed through each person. A verse is also a line within a rhyme, and each life is like an instrument that plays within the grand symphony that we call the universe. Verse can also mean to turn or to change, and the InnerVerse is where we go to imagine and create change, but we often require inspiration to break through the filters on our individual visionary capacities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my intention to provide you with diverse new sources of insight from creatively inspired humans that I meet in my journey, to provide you with a positive outcome for your attention. And simply by listening, you are energizing my efforts to do just that. However, we currently live in the paradigm of exchanging Federal Reserve Debt Notes (dollars) for shit we need. With as little as $1 a month, you will be sending energy towards my personal quest to discover and share truths that can help us collectively evolve into more harmonious super-creators, and I\u0027ll share my daily art with you. There are many rewards, and at the $5 level you will even get extended episodes with up to double the content! There are many more rewards so check out the page and let me know what you think!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish you all the freedom that can be imagined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI totally love you,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Chance\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5987d897cf81e0278ec5322e/t/5990d0f0914e6bba68ba7b76/1502662905535/?format=300w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
