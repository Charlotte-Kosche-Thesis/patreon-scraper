I will continue to do my videos and my hobby anyway for as long as I can. I would be crazy not to say, would it be cool if through various means, I get paid to work with Lego everyday. But also the money will go to buying Lego, that you watch me build, but it will be shared with you in videos. I will continue to keep giving you access to my videos and try not to get to big or forget where I started. I\u0027m just feel a bit like, I\u0027m stuck with not meeting the requirement for the YouTube Partner Program that gives access to some money without asking the subscriber/viewers of the Channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Now in the beginning, it will possibly be one or two items; a minifigure, blind bags, cool parts, for example. It might not have a theme at first or ever, but it will be more affordable than most of the Lego Subscription Services out there - which are hundreds over the course of a year.
