For higher tier supporters \nthere\u0027ll be cool freebies offered, such as a free commissioned work per\n year of your own choice for your own personal use, limited signed artworks, or if you prefer, the chance for \nsome one-to-one Q\u0026amp;A/teaching about art (or you can request tutorials\n on something specific if you\u0027d like to know how I do things). You will also automatically receive signed 1st edition copies of the printed volumes of each of these mangas when printed if you become a top tier supporter.
