    "summary": "ItsBreadTime, to put it simply, is a dream:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo games have always held a special place in my heart. I grew up an only child, happily. When you grow up as an only child, you often find yourself needing to use your imagination to entertain yourself. Legos, Hot Wheels, Action Figures, and of course Video Games let me delve deep into other experiences -- Other worlds. I still remember my first gaming experiences - Jumpstart/Fisher Price Computer games, A simple snowboarding game on my mother\u0027s Nokia cell phone, Pinball on longhaul roadtrips with my dad, my Super Nintendo, and of course my Gameboy. I will never, ever, forget opening my birthday present with Pokemon Red and a purple Gameboy Color.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I aged, my tastes did as well. I played sports. Football, and baseball taking up more of my time. School, and friendships, too. But no matter what was happening in my life, games were ever present. I played Goldeneye on N64, and Agent Under Fire/Nightfire on the PS2. I loved sports games like ESPN 2k5, and SSX. In high school I found myself caught in the Call of Duty craze, even fielding a team to #1 on the gamebattles ladders a few different times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn college my roommates could tell you one thing about me in full certainty: I played a TON of games. To the probable dismay of my professors, I found more comfort in the stories of LA Noire, and Mass Effect than I ever did in my studies. School started falling by the wayside. I felt aimless, I didn\u0027t know what career path felt right, or where I belonged. I left school to pursue a business in making clothing, another fork in the road that left me passionless, and misguided.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere do I fit in this mess of a world? What is next for me, and where do I find the drive I\u0027ve lacked in my other pursuits?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day a roommate of mine introduced me to Twitch. I could see a light. I saw communities of people gathered around games. I imagined myself as a kid again, huddled around small tube tvs with my best friends, talking about how to solve the next puzzle in Ocarina of Time. I\u0027m sitting in a fort we built playing Vice City. I\u0027m LANing in highschool, playing Halo on a Friday night, cans of soda (and beer - sorry mom), and bags of chips littering the table. I knew what I wanted to do. This whole time, my whole life, I\u0027ve been engrossed with Video Games and now is my chance to create a community of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need your help.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday I humbly ask you to donate to my dream. My goals before the end of the year:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Expand my Twitch channel (twitch.tv/itsbreadtime) and gain partnership\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Quit my full-time job to focus solely on content creation and streaming\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Introduce new and fresh content (game reviews, let\u0027s plays, previews, etc) to my Youtube channel every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Expand upon my podcast and show series\u0027. So far I\u0027ve launched and maintain \u0027The Vertical Slice\" and Coffee Beer Bread\". Two great shows hosted on twitch, youtube, soundcloud, and coming to iTunes soon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Launch ItsBreadTime.com - Your hub for all my Reviews, VoDs, Cached Podcasts, and all other Content I create\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNormally, I am your hostiest host, with the toastiest toast... but today I am your humblest host serving humble toast in asking you to support my ambitions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-August\u003cbr\u003e-ItsBreadTime\u003cbr\u003e"
