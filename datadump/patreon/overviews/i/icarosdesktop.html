    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDid you love Amiga computers? They were revolutionary, user-friendly and very funny to use. Since 2007, Icaros Desktop is providing a modern Amiga-like operating environment to PC users. If you got sick of Windows or Linux... Try Icaros Desktop!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.icarosdesktop.com/img/220/220-patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can this be possible?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.icarosdesktop.org\"\u003eIcaros Desktop\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eis the most known AROS distribution. The \u003cstrong\u003eAROS Research Operating System\u003c/strong\u003e is a \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eopen source\u003c/strong\u003e re-implementation of \u003cstrong\u003eAmiga OS 3.1\u003c/strong\u003e, written from scratch but improving on it in many areas. It\u0027s actively developed since 1995 and has now been ported to many architectures, including i386 (32 bit PCs), x64 (PCs with 64-bit capable processors), ARM, PPC and even Motorola 68K (original Amiga computers!). At every release, Icaros Desktop selects, tests and per-configures available AROS software, letting you use it without messing up with preference files and old, long-forgotten Amiga habits (like editing the startup-sequence, creating Assigns and so on).\u00a0Many AROS complex tasks (like running Amiga software almost \ntransparently, properly configuring the Amiga emulator and making the \nright scripts every time) are just \"two clicks away\" on Icaros Desktop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you and what do you do exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Paolo Besser and I am a long-standing editor of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thegamesmachine.it\"\u003eThe Games Machine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, the oldest, still running printed magazine about video games all over Europe. I started my \u003cem\u003ecareer\u003c/em\u003e with my Commodore 16, 128 and Amigas back in the 80s. Since 2010, I\u0027ve been working as Windows sysadmin and VMware technical expert for IBM Italy. Icaros Desktop is a project I work on my own, in my spare time, choosing the right AROS software and making it interact in a transparent and sometimes creative way. It seems an easy task, but it really isn\u0027t: creating a distribution can be trivial, but keeping it updated is a highly time-consuming effort. I have to download AROS system files on regular basis, check for software updates without any automatic tool, test everything to avoid regressions, keep everything up to date and stay in touch with app developers to submit bugs and keep sure everything still works properly. Icaros Desktop is now getting 10 years old. With countless nights working on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait... did you say \"running Amiga software\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes! With Icaros Desktop you can play your games (once converted to ADF files) or run your old Workbench applications: you just have to learn some basics written in the Icaros user manual. Because there is a PDF manual I keep updated too! :-) But the best of Icaros still has to come: AROS is source-level compatible with AmigaOS 3.x. This means that if you compile on i386 PC a old program written in C for AmigaOS 3.x, it will work natevely on the PC architecture, taking advantage of its faster and more powerful processor. So, Icaros provides i386 builds of historic Amiga software like DirectoryOpus, Audio Evolution, NoiseTracker and many others, along with ports from Linux (MPlayer, BigBand, Ghostscript) and other modern Amiga-like systems (OWB, ArosPDF and others). You can manage your file, play your video and music, browse the web, keep in touch with your friends in a modern, amazing Amiga environment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I help you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause all the contents of Icaros Desktop have been properly authorized for distribution, and you can download them for free! I am doing my best, and all I can do, to make the best of AROS and provide the most amazing Amiga-like experience, at unbeatable price ($0). I\u0027ve always been an active donor to AROS related projects as well. But I just can\u0027t keep this going all by myself: monthly bills and expenses are rising, and the more I work to pay them, the less spare time I have for Icaros Desktop. With your help, I can keep this crazy, Amiga-devoted project alive and kickin\u0027. \u003cstrong\u003eSo thank you very much for your pledges!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
