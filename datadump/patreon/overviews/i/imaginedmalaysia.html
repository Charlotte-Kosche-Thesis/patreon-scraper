We hope to participate in the efforts of creating public awareness and education about the differing narratives and stories that may be omitted from official/master history.  This is to not only change our understanding of the nation\u2019s history, but to also deepen and evolve it to have a more inclusive and rich discourse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe crucial point for us to organize this project is to address some of the present concerns regarding historical literacy in Malaysia. There is a lack of contestation in the perspective of historical events taking place at the current moment in the public sphere \u2013 whether in the form of writing, lectures or even debates. Hence, we wish to \u003cstrong\u003ere-popularize interest in attaining knowledge\u003c/strong\u003e by drawing means of what the region\u2019s intellectual history has to offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the long run, we hope that this will be a platform that promotes the role of activist-historians in public education as well as a source of encouragement and inspiration for Malaysian youth to have a \u003cstrong\u003ecritical appreciation for history\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e",
