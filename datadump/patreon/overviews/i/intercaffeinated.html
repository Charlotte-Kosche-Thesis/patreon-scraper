    "summary": "Have you ever wondered to yourself, \"just the hell am I doing with my life? I work a billion hours a week even though supposedly there are only 168, I keep getting older, I\u0027m not really doing stuff I more than halfway like, the earth is twirling and hurtling through space like a madman, and why can\u0027t I be more like Amy Schumer with a twist of Stephen Colbert?\" If you have, then you can probably relate to my decision to say \u003cem\u003esbohem\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(goodbye in Czech according to Google Translate) to standard American life and \u003cem\u003eahoj\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(hello) to a different kind of American life. The different kind is where you\u0027re not living in the states but instead are an American living abroad.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027m out in this world of ours, I\u0027ll be using my nifty GoPro to record things. I\u0027m not the best at this, but I\u0027m learning and hope to make some videos that would just make J.J. Abrams shrug his shoulders at instead of puking (I consider a shrug from J.J.A. to be a compliment, because it could mean that there\u0027s a slight possibility that he not only doesn\u0027t hate it\u00a0but kind of likes it). I\u0027ll also be recording music and writing things in my blog at intercaffeinated.com, which of course, you\u0027re more than welcome to visit and bless with comments and shares if you feel like doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I on Patreon? I admit it, I need you! I really do. With your help, whether it be a dollar or just some comments on the blog, or even some constructive criticism, I can make some rad videos that travelers on a budget can appreciate. This is a living documentary of sorts, and hopefully, I can make a lot of the mistakes for you before you go and do something similar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this, and seriously, thank you if you decide to become a patron. No pressure, for reals. I live to create, so I\u0027m going to do this regardless, but any help is totally appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKay\u0027, I\u0027m done for now. Thanks for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeremy Nickel"
