    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m a 26 year old male homo sapiens. I have a BA in History and am currently mastering in IT. Yeah, I know that transition doesn\u0027t seem logical.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing city builders/management games for many years, and been fascinated with urbanity and the politics and narratives of cities since I was a teen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mainly create Cities: Skylines content for YouTube, and like to add nerdy narratives and occasionally non-funny commentary to them.\u00a0I started creating content for my YouTube channel in early 2017 and have since added more than 85 videos consisting of American, European and recently Japanese themed cities and builds. With a conservative estimation of 6 hours of work per. video, including planning, recording, editing, scouting for music, rendering, uploading, filling YouTube upload info - That\u0027s some 500+ hours spent while also getting my Bachelor\u0027s degree, starting on my Major, and for a period of time occupying a part-time job. I have also expanded into streaming where i have done a handful of streams, initially on Twitch but later on YouTube. Lately I have also been allocating some of my spare-time into asset creation, where I am trying to fill in some content holes for my projects - for now, I have been making a handful of very crude and simple US themed 1960-1980\u0027s styled detached houses, of which I share progress and screenshots. I also intend to release them as very early-access prototypes here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately i can\u0027t seem to get enough of Cities: Skylines nor the themes of infrastructure, architecture, urban planning \u0026amp; design as well as the historical narrative of cities, and while I already feel that I have created a large amount of content within just one year while also studying - \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eMy dream is to one day be able to live off my creative work, and produce\u00a0content for YouTube, Cities: Skylines and potentially other future city builders on a full-time basis\u00a0if given the opportunity financially one day! \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThank you for stopping by and considering supporting me here on Patreon!
