    "summary": "I am embarking on a journey through writing. This is a book about the life and death of my son, Sgt. Gabriel Guzman, who was killed in Afghanistan on March 8, 2008 by a roadside bomb. It is also a story about me, his mom, the exploration of his life and mine, and the journey through my grief. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has taken me eight years to come this far, to be ready to write. My hope is that my story will touch others who are experiencing loss, those with a loved one who died in the wars, or a fellow soldier who sat beside him. Anyone who has lost a child, regardless of how, can relate to the way it tears at your soul. This story is about healing, for myself and for all those who it touches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting takes time.
