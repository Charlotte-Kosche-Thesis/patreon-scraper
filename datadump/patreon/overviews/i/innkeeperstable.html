By becoming one of our patrons, you can not only help us to provide better content in more formats than ever, you can also become more directly involved in the process. As we gather more patrons, we will add new features, from weekly polls to determine which games we review next to live streams of our weekly game nights, and even additional reviews each week that give an in-depth analysis of long-form games that take multiple sessions to complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blog at www.innkeeperstable.com is the beginning of a personal quest to become the eponymous innkeeper by opening a local board game cafe. But before that, I want to build up additional experience and credibility within the board gaming community. This includes regularly posting reviews, as well as hosting several game nights each week. As my library grows, so will the number and quality of reviews on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also considering creating a forum where our Patrons can gather for in-depth discussions and even an occasional call-in stream where Patrons can ask our reviewers questions directly."
