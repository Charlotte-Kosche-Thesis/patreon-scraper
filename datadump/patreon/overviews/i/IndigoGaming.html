    "summary": "I am a small but growing YouTube creator who creates video essays on video games. I have a unique mix of audiovisual production value, analysis, opinion and historian-style research. My videos cover anything from brand new games to classics from the 1980\u0027s. I try my best to create the most compelling presentation with an even-handed approach on the games and topics I cover, and I believe that ethos is perpetuated through my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhere Your Patreon Dollars Go\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been humbled by the response to my work I\u0027ve received so far, and if the world is willing, I\u0027d like run this channel full-time and give my viewers much more content to watch and enjoy. Several of my viewers stated they\u0027d be interested in supporting me in some way through donations, so I opened a Patreon account. I currently work as a full-time graphic designer and cannot realistically produce more than a couple videos (of my expected quality) a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve invested nearly $2,000 of my own money into my channel so far. Stock video and audio, microphones, sound equipment, webcam, green screen, soundproofing, computer hardware, video editing software and other such tools so that I can create the best product I can. Patreon is a way to recoup that money, lower my cost of living through paying off debts and eventually support me so that I can make this channel my one and only job. Anything you can donate is appreciated more than you know, but of course I\u0027ll never hide my primary content behind a paywall and will always communicate to my audience whether a Patron or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am offering Patron-only perks such as behind-the-scenes articles and videos, Patron update vlogs, a Patron-only Discord channel to chat with me and others directly, as well as occasional events I may do in the future like Patron multiplayer matches and the like. I try to focus as much time as possible on creating video content, so as to not spend so much time promoting to neglect the thing I am trying to promote, and I hope that my audience understands that. If you feel you can spare even a couple dollars, please do so!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little History On My Channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndigo Gaming is a solo YouTube project I started in May of 2016 with some video game-related guides and \"let\u0027s plays\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGears shifted when I made a short retrospective of the DOOM series, later to be followed up by a much longer series which detailed the history of one of the most innovative developers in computer game history. Originally meant to be a 10-minute one-off, Retro-Spec: Looking Glass Studios ended up being a documentary-length 3-part series detailing the formation of one of the most influential game developers in recent history. The response was equally huge from Redditors, forums, and even some Twitter nods from the current IP holders (Stephen Kick and Nightdive Studios) as well as the new development studio formed from several of the original Looking Glass staff \u00a0including Paul Neurath, Warren Spector and others (OtherSide Entertainment).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired by finding a new and interesting direction, I then went on to create several retrospectives, game commentaries and analysis videos for games new and old, as well as starting a review series of Cyberpunk-themed games (a longtime favorite niche of mine). Leaving the Let\u0027s Play format behind, and instead moving toward mini-documentaries and video essays, I decided to invest in the equipment to do professional livestreaming as well to get to know my audience better, and to accent my content with a little extra personality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndigo Gaming\u0027s real explosion onto the public scene was my successful Diablo and Elder Scrolls videos, which to date have garnered a over a half a million views alone. Further along I started the \u0027Not Forgotten\u0027 series which I cover the history, development, reception and features of games that were underappreciated or flawed enough to not get the attention or success they deserved. This proved to be incredibly popular, with the likes of Hellgate: London even getting attention from David Brevik, one of the original designers and the creator of the Diablo series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday I make videos on whatever topics or tangents I feel motivated to do. Whether it\u0027s forgotten would-be classics like Advent Rising, to explorations of gaming trends or design philosophies, or in-depth explorations of a game or franchise such as my retrospectives on Fallout, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to drop me a line if you have any questions or have any ideas of perks you\u0027d like to see as a patron. Thanks for reading and have a great day!\u003cbr\u003e"
