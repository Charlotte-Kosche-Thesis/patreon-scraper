The focus is on quality conversation and laughs grounded in discussion of current events, real-life issues and sharing knowledge. I\u0027ve found it an amazing opportunity to be able to sit down and have two-hour conversations with people - some of them close friends and some of them relative strangers - without any of the normal distractions and with the freedom to follow wherever the conversation leads. As an example, some topics I\u0027ve touched on in the past have included: the history of beer; mixed martial arts; mental health issues; and ocean conservation. I generally publish one to two episodes a week.\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I\u0027ve begun speaking to some potential sponsors, my podcasts are currently ad-free. All of my content is free to listeners and viewers, but as I have so far been self-funded it does cost me time and money to make. As I want to continue to expand and develop the Iamkaypee Podcast, it is now time for me to ask for help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a relatively new and small podcast, my immediate goals relate to upgrading equipment and offseting running costs until those aspects of the podcast can start to take care of themselves. I love making this podcast and I want to give it its best chance to grow up big and strong. \u003cbr\u003eBriefly, these are the specifics of what I hope Patreon will help me to do:\u003cbr\u003e- Buy a mixer in order to enrich the podcast\u0027s content and offer better quality audio\u003cbr\u003e- Help with the cost of website/audio hosting, and of promotion e.g. on social media\u003cbr\u003e- Lights and backdrops for a professional look and the option of using different effects while live streaming on YouTube \u003cbr\u003e- Expanding my reach to even more diverse and interesting guests\u003cbr\u003e- Help produce the merch that I\u0027ve created\u003cbr\u003e- Expand my YouTube content \u003cbr\u003e- I will continue to self-fund (with occasional generous donations from guests) this podcast\u0027s institutional alcoholism \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith any contributions you make, you will be responsible for cultivating this podcast at a grassroots level and directly effecting its reach and quality. Your support will help me maintain something that I love to do and which has become a huge part of my life, for which I can\u0027t thank you enough. \u003cbr\u003eAs the above goals are met and the podcast expands I will update this page with its changing needs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
