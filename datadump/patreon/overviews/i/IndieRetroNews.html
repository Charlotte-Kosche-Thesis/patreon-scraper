    "summary": "Hello everyone and welcome to Indie Retro News!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to believe that this site was formed in September 2012 with an official starting point in the early part of October as an idea to give you the most interesting of gaming news from Indie games to our speciality retro.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why if you\u0027ve been following through the years apart from those awesome Indie Games our main priority has always been the Amstrad, C64, ZX Spectrum, NES and many other interesting retro systems with homebrew games coming in thick and fast from every part of the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNearly every day apart from most weekends and even through ill health we have tried to fill the page with as many eye opening games as possible so you the reader has a smile on your face every time you visit the website. Indie Retro News really has no interest in AAA games such as Battlefield, because we as a site want to feature the little guys, those who put their heart and soul into doing something different.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn interesting fact is we do not use adverts and never will, so with Patreon, we aim to grow even further through the years ahead by helping our staff writers, pay for server hosting and continue our goal of being one of the best retro based sites on the internet, which as you\u0027ve seen by our top rated awards is a great achievement so far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus there is nothing more to add as we love PC gaming, we love retro gaming, and we want to keep you the readers coming back from more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite: http://www.indieretronews.com\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: https://twitter.com/Indie_RetroNEWS\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/IndieRetroNews\u003cbr\u003eEmail: admin@indieretronews.com\u003cbr\u003e"
