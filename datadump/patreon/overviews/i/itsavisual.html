    "summary": "Hi! Thanks for stopping by! My name is Helen M. Waters (the \u201cM\u201d being very important) and I create illustrations. All kinds, black/white\nand color, for children\u2019s books, greeting cards, poems, and anything I can\nthink of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve been drawing since I can remember, when and wherever I\ncould, and over the years developed several different styles. One of them was spawned from\ndoodles in my school notebook margins, and grew into greeting card designs like\nthese:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://itsavisual.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/_Hummingbird__gr_4b9d572cc93d4.jpg\" style=\"width: 333px;\"\u003e \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"http://www.itsavisual.com/images/stories/POG-fig3-upl.jpg\" style=\"width: 288px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThen I started doing a few cartoons for websites and greeting cards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.itsavisual.com/images/stories/cartoon-worldends-upload.jpg\" style=\"width: 328px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"http://www.itsavisual.com/images/stories/cartoon-birdcage-upload2.jpg\" style=\"width: 304px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen one day a persistent little fellow popped into my head\nand refused to leave until I drew him down on paper. His name is \u003ca href=\"http://itssprout.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSprout\u003c/a\u003e, and\nhere he is as he first appeared:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cimg src=\"http://itssprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HP_PROJECTS_story1.jpg\" style=\"width: 284px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you can see, I have a LOT of varied projects going, and this is\nwhere the Patreon site comes in.\u00a0 Patreon is set up so that you can make\n a monthly contribution to support an artist whose work you like. For me, Sprout has a whole world that I want to\ndiscover, I have a couple of children\u2019s books in the works, new greeting card\ndesigns, and I need more time!\u00a0 Your support will help me dig in and get my projects\nmoving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have so much in store for my patrons! You\u2019ll get a first look at everything\n- works in progress, ideas, sketches, stories and more - before they go on any website or public forum, PLUS some great rewards and opportunities for us to interact. I\u2019m very excited to share everything I do, - I\u0027ll be uploading new stuff at least every week, more if I can. Your appreciation of my work means the world to me, and your support would too. THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e"

Reaching this goal would give me one more afternoon per week of concentrated drawing time, rather than spend it working for someone else. It would make a huge difference to me, and would mean you get to see more stuff! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e",
