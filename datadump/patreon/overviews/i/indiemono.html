We work daily to bring you the most special stuff we find, those hidden little gems that still can get you all hyped up and kept unnoticed all the time. Indiemono started as an independent Spotify profile where we hosted different playlists from our curation, frequently updated and focused in different music genres and moods - now it\u0027s the base channel you need to visit to understand who we are... \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/sanik007/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou may find a playlist for your exact mood today!\u003c/a\u003e   \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen we began our journey, we started receiving hundreds of messages from artists and bands, undiscovered and with the need of help. So we decided to focus our path on them, as the music industry nowadays has a really small pool of artists and there is enough highlight for them. There is a lot of work done and in progress like \u003cstrong\u003ecreating a solid community of independent curators\u003c/strong\u003e to give a boost to the talent, a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://indiemono.com/music-submit/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emusic submission system\u003c/a\u003e for us to sort, review and feed playlists with those songs and the \u003cstrong\u003eeditorial power to display and show all of it\u003c/strong\u003e through our site.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, our new path is \u003cstrong\u003ebuilding the best and fairest digital label of all times\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0027re considering artists and establishing a solid network of promotion. Our future will be promoting them and introduce them to the world, so stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWe\u0027re a small team of two\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarlos\u003c/strong\u003e, who is the curator and the builder of Indiemono\u0027s music ecosystem vision - He\u0027s filled with discipline and real passion for music.

What we can promise you is that you\u0027ll find amazingly talented artists and bands that are eager for you to take a listen and give them feedback. You\u0027ll find some tiers where you can support us monthly with $1 or $3, but we\u0027ll open better rewards in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWe appreciate your support and love even if you can\u0027t contribute as a patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eSo welcome, we hope you like it here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
