Any Patreons, or support get invested right back into the channel to bring more content, and continue the circle.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ------How will this help you?-----\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is solely to give back to those who believe in my channel and enjoy what I do.
