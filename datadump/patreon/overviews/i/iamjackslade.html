Regardless of whether you become a patron or not, thanks so much for stopping by and seeing what\u0027s up\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a drummer. I just like to play and the way I actually practise is by playing other people\u0027s songs. If there\u0027s a song that I think would be a challenge, I try to learn it and improve my playing that way. I\u0027ve never filmed and published the finished product so thought this could be a cool way to get some interaction going on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a bit of everything here. I\u0027m not doing these videos to make money. However, it does cost a fair bit of money and time to produce a video (practise rooms/studio rental/video editing/breathing etc...). I don\u0027t want to come across like, \u0027Hey, give me money and I\u0027ll just play drums and have some fun\u0027 - That\u0027s why I have these tiers going on! I\u0027m new to this Patreon business so, if you think you have a cool suggestion for a reward tier, get in touch! I\u0027m more than happy to listen and improve this whole thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, many people don\u0027t realise that you cannot monetise covers on YouTube. If the number of views were to suddenly explode, all the money from ads and clicks would go to the original artist (and rightly so!) - So, this Patreon project is a great way to support me and those that help me directly\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to prove to you that I am actually a drummer, here\u0027s a video from when I helped out my boys in As Lions by filling in for their US tour last year:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QZKYJr_s-A\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003eJack\u003cbr\u003e#2Sweet\u003cbr\u003e"
