I\u0027m born in Singapore, and have recently lived in Singapore, London, Kuala Lumpur, and at this moment about to move to Melbourne, Australia. I was Classically trained as a pianist, and fell steadily in love with playing worship keys (keyboards in church) ever since I started playing 16 years ago. I\u0027m also a Music and Education enthusiast, having graduated from Boston University and King\u0027s College London with Music-related degrees. In 2014, I married all of my passions together and birthed the Inspired Keyboardist YouTube Channel.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://inspiredkeys.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can read more about me here\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.inspiredkeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-10-14-at-10.19.33-AM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S THE MISSION OF INSPIRED KEYS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI started the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/inspiredkeyboardist\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInspired Keyboardist YouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e in September 2014 to help worship keyboardists from all over the world play worship keys skilfully and in an inspired way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy mission is to help as many worship keyboardists and churches learn to play worship songs and master worship keys skills as quickly and easily as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI want the Inspired Keyboardist YouTube Channel to be about helping worship keyboardists (both now and of the future) to \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e- get started, \u003cbr\u003e- learn and apply skilful techniques, and \u003cbr\u003e- serve their churches by ministering on the keyboard in a spiritually confident and powerful way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON, AND WHY DO YOU USE IT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited to use this platform to connect with you on a deeper level!

Each time I do so, I share that video here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of videos I publish that month determines how much you contribute.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFor example, if you pledge $1 per video and that month I publish 5 videos, you\u0027ll contribute $5 for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $9 per tutorial / cover video, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $9, thus supporting 1 video that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either.

You know how I\u2019m lacking the quality in some of these tasks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that by being able to hire a team, I can focus on the main thing - teaching worship keys through tutorials, and recording worship song covers that will benefit those who need to learn the songs. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy having a team, I can also increase the number of videos I can produce, creating even MORE tutorial and cover videos to help you learn even faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes, it is my dream to be able to teach worship keyboard full time. At the moment, in order to supplement my income, I\u0027ve been teaching Classroom Music in schools, as well as giving private Classical Piano lessons. It is my desire to be able to devote all my work hours to teaching worship keys to keyboardists and blessing churches all over the world, without having to split my time teaching other kinds of music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired Keys is 100% subscriber, follower, and member supported! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelping me reach my patreon goals keeps production costs low, content quality high, and ultimately allows me to\u00a0help you succeed faster on worship keys! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to serve YOU and help you grow as skilful worship musicians!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping me with my goals.
