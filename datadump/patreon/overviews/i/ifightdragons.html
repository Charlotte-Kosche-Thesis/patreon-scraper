To be 100% clear, you\u0027ll only be charged when we actually finish the album - no ongoing monthly charge! \u00a0Many other Patreons release paid content very frequently, so Patreon has a lot of lingo about only charging your card once per month, but because we will release paid content very infrequently (only once per album) you don\u0027t have to worry about that. OK back to the Patreon info:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, we\u0027re I Fight Dragons! You may remember us from such albums as \"KABOOM!\" and \"The Near Future.\" \u00a0Or perhaps you know us from our theme song for The Goldbergs on ABC. Or maybe you thought Imagine Dragons was doing a Patreon and you ended up here by a cruel twist of fate only to find out that we\u0027re a completely unrelated transitive-dragon-verb-named band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Exactly Is An Album Adventure?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA few years ago we did a Kickstarter to make an album. It was an amazing, humbling experience in many ways, both in terms of the amount of support we received and in terms of the myriad twists and turns on our multi-year journey to write, record, release, and fulfill the album and rewards. Honestly we all kind of collapsed in a heap for a solid year after it was all done. \u00a0We were a bit burned out, and we weren\u0027t really sure what was next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, inspiration struck. Maybe it\u0027s because Brian had a daughter, maybe it\u0027s because we\u0027re all growing up in obvious and not-so-obvious ways, but last year we started kicking around some new joyful songs that we really love, and it\u0027s gotten to the point that we felt we needed to find a way to work them up and share them with you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, how to do it? We tried the whole major label thing (whoops), we tried the Kickstarter thing (awesome in certain ways, very frustrating in others), why not try something new?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Didn\u0027t Actually Answer The Question. WHAT\u0027S AN ALBUM ADVENTURE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked! We made it up. It\u0027s a little like a Kickstarter campaign (we\u0027re making an album and there are rewards), but with a few significant differences:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e1- There\u0027s no set \"Funding Period.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople can join us on this adventure at any point, and no one is charged a penny until we release the album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e2- There\u0027s no set \"Delivery Date.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe album will certainly be finished at some point, but it\u0027s more important to us that it be done right than on a strict schedule, and as we said, no one is charged anything until it\u0027s done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e3- It\u0027s just as much about the journey as the destination.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur current plan is to release one \"Adventure Thing\" per week to our Patrons throughout the entire Adventure, every Monday at 8PM US Central Time. The initial Adventure Things will rotate through 4 categories:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e1. Acoustic Demos - Brian\u0027s first version of a song, usually recorded on an iPhone\u003cbr\u003e2. Live-streams From Band Practice - Exactly what it sounds like, see the sausage get made\u003cbr\u003e3. Works In Progress - Rough full band scratch recordings, album art drafts, etc.\u003cbr\u003e4. Written Posts - Who knows how this adventure will go? We\u0027ll write about it along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis is the meat of what makes this concept so different from a one-and-done crowdfunding campaign, since you\u0027ll be right there for the entire journey, seeing how an album goes from concept to reality, and what the creative process is really like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Said There\u0027s Rewards Right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDefinitely - and there\u0027s an emphasis on rewards that make you a part of the adventure, everything from written credit to your voice on the album to joining us in the studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat If This Adventure Is Lame?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of the awesome things about Patreon is that you can join or leave at any time. You aren\u0027t charged up front, only when we release an album, so you\u0027re free to come and go as you please.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, Bill\u0027s Back???\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, the illustrious Bill Prokopow has officially returned to active dragon fighting duty, and we\u0027re elated to have him back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Does Brian Mispronounce The\u00a0Word\u00a0Patreon Throughout The Entire Video?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe\u0027s a dingus. We\u0027ll be sure to dock his pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs There Anything Else We Need To Know?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMostly just that we\u0027re incredibly grateful that you\u0027re reading this and considering joining us on this adventure. \u00a0Also, kudos to you for reading all the way to the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCowabunga!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Brian, Chad, Hari, Packy, and Bill\u003cbr\u003eI Fight Dragons\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - the gorgeous footage of us recording \"Never Go Alone\" was shot and edited by Brendan Leahy of Studio Skylight, who also made the video for cRaZie$ He\u0027s amazing and ideally we want to make more music videos with him if this adventure goes well.\u003cbr\u003e"
