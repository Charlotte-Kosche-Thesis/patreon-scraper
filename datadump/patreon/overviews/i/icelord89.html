    "summary": "Thanks for stopping by my Patreon page! My name is Enzo. I go by Icelord89 on Youtube though. Video game reviews are something I\u0027ve always wanted to do. I feel I have so much to say about the video game industry and how games are made today. I present my own unique (albeit a little extreme!)\u00a0perspective on video games. This has been my passion since I was a small child. Luckily for me the internet is a powerful tool. With it I\u0027ve been able to begin to create some of the content I\u0027ve always wanted to. However it\u0027s not without it\u0027s roadblocks. Video games aren\u0027t cheap. Neither is the equipment I use and need to create my videos. I work a minimum wage job in a deli just to pay my bills. Needless to say this paycheck leaves little to no room for recreation and more importantly my passion. My dream is to become a professional game reviewer different from all those big shots that you know so well. I want to tell it EXACTLY as it is without any thing getting in the way of my better judgement. With any pledge you could make, you would be helping me to actually living my dream. On top of just reporting the news and reviewing new games, I\u0027d also like to continue making Let\u0027s Play videos as I do now. Just a way for me to share my own personal game experiences with all of you. So as I said earlier, any contribution you could make would earn my eternal gratitude. Even if you can\u0027t pledge anything, that\u0027s cool too! The fact that you\u0027re reading this right now is contribution enough to my cause! Either way you can count on me to press on and continue making my reviews and other videos. Maybe share this with all of your facebook friends or twitter followers. Get the word out there. Either way, thank you so much for coming by!\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px;\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ~Enzo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
