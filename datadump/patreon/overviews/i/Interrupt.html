As a visual designer, I\u2019ve done work for some big companies and brands. Now I\u2019ve created this Patreon page as a place to work on self-directed projects. Instead of designing brand elements or solving visual problems for clients I\u2019m going to be making the kind of stuff I want to. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love designing logos, interfaces, print materials, and helping clients communicate visually, but here on my Patreon page you\u0027re going to see animated GIFs, digital wallpapers, time-lapse process videos, sketches, poster prints, stickers, illustrated card games, paper \u0026amp; dice roleplaying games, and any other project that captures my attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4ff3a85dc4aaee93616cb8b0/513a6c1ce4b0a3a65dd9173b/561f4b9ce4b05fb7f592e54c/1444891549412/CJM15-0823_Patreon_Rhuss.gif?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRobots have always fascinated me. My art is riddled with ninjas (if you can see them). I\u2019ve been known to throw down and bust electric boogaloo, battling fools. I dig optical illusions, sacred geometry, ambigrams, and logic puzzles. You\u2019ll find all of these \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4ff3a85dc4aaee93616cb8b0/513a6c1ce4b0a3a65dd9173b/55e374a8e4b0539aea90b092/1440969899945/CJM15-0823_Patreon_Home_Robot.gif?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs long as I can remember I\u2019ve been drawing and designing. When I was a kid, I would make copies of \u00a0my illustrations to sell at school to buy better art supplies. Well, this is kind of similar. I\u2019m going to post the things I create and if you like what you see, you can kick some cash my way through Patreon, which would make you an extremely awesome person.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4ff3a85dc4aaee93616cb8b0/513a6c1ce4b0a3a65dd9173b/561b2db2e4b0e976ee313e0b/1444621750210/CJM15-0823_Patreon_Shayla-1.gif?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m lucky to be married to Shayla Maddox (who is currently featured on the Patreon home page.\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/shaylamaddox?ty=h\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIf you haven\u2019t seen her page, check it out\u003c/a\u003e). We love traveling to new places, trying foods, experiencing culture, and art. I use photography from those travels as the basis for much of my digital art.

It\u2019s an ongoing crowdfunding service that connects Patrons with Creators. You can choose any amount you want to give and change your mind at any time. But it goes beyond just a transaction system, it\u2019s an amazing way to build a community of people who appreciate and support art and the artists who make it. This level of connection creates wonderful opportunities for collaboration and makes it so much easier to find people making amazing things you love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith Patreon you can contribute directly to the creation of art, culture, science, and games. Now the funds go past the middlemen and straight to the people making the work you like. No more do we need to physically mass-produce products or make annoying ads to try to scrape a living out of the margin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore importantly, \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon is good people!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4ff3a85dc4aaee93616cb8b0/513a6c1ce4b0a3a65dd9173b/561963f9e4b058853bdd5ce9/1444504575955/CJM15-0823_Patreon_Peeps-1.png?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve had the good fortune to visit the Patreon HQ in San Francisco several times and can honestly say the people who work there are some of the brightest, most passionate, dedicated people I\u2019ve ever met. (Not to mention witty, attractive, and obnoxiously good at drinking games.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon has completely changed our lives while changing the way people get paid for creating. Patreon represents a major shift in the economics of being a creator trying to make great work in a world built for an outdated model. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Sort of Stuff Are You Doing Through Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is where I can focus on work that\u2019s not client-driven. I get to make the kind of art I like that\u0027s not designed for advertising or business. As this grows I will spend more of my time focusing on this audience and making the stuff you want to see. I\u2019ll be able to travel and use the photography and videos as fuel for my digital art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4ff3a85dc4aaee93616cb8b0/513a6c1ce4b0a3a65dd9173b/561c4a0ae4b0ece054ca4ca3/1444809031144/CJM15-0823_Patreon_Japan.gif?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe freedom and flexibility I gain through Patreon will allow me to work on projects I\u2019ve had in mind that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to support me. Like a series of games and books featuring my designs and art. I also plan on developing an interactive game played directly through Patreon itself.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to connect directly with the people supporting me. If you contribute to my Patreon account, you and I will be exchanging comments and you\u2019ll have access to my work in ways that weren\u2019t possible before. I plan on incorporating your interaction into the work itself, whether that\u2019s doing custom pieces, getting feedback, collaborating, or playing new game systems as they develop.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4ff3a85dc4aaee93616cb8b0/513a6c1ce4b0a3a65dd9173b/561c16e8e4b00619270c8e5c/1444809031238/CJM15-0823_Patreon_Hummingbird.gif?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally I want to connect with other creators and people making awesome work.

For me it\u2019s much more fulfilling to make art that people love than to make more advertising.
