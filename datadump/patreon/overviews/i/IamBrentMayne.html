I am Brent Mayne and I am scientist with a creative mind. I have been studying the Biomedical Sciences for the past 6 years and will be earning a Master\u0027s degree in Biomedical Sciences in May. However, for the last 12-13 years, I have been making youtube videos in my spare time in my parent\u0027s basement and my last couple of apartments while I have been at college. Making content, and most importantly, singing, is my passion. My favorite thing to do will/ has always been to lock myself in my room, with my thought and to sing while writing music. Each month, I am trying to make 3-4 pieces of content, whether that be music for my original project or a cover/ a vlog for my youtube channel. You can check out some of my content here at these places!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/IamBrentMayne/\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/IamBrentMayne/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook page=\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FIamBrentMayn\u0026amp;redir_token=RZql2odb5708Y1O5m1bKi8VJWzh8MTUxODI5NjI1NkAxNTE4MjA5ODU2\u0026amp;event=video_description\u0026amp;v=rj3OKcMK3s4\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/IamBrentMayn\u003c/a\u003e...\u003cbr\u003eYounow= \u003ca href=\"http://www.younow.com/IamBrentMayne\"\u003ewww.younow.com/IamBrentMayne\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSoundcload=\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/iambrentmayne\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/iambrentmayne\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eInstagram= @iambrentmayne\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo, where is your money going?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eI want to be honest about what your money is helping me do, since you all are financially backing my hopes and dreams, so I want to give you a few places to where your money is going\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Pay my bills so I can live life making content for you guys/ becoming my occupation\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, at every job that you give service to, they pay you...
