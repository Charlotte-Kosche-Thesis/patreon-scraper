    "summary": "Welcome to the Indie Syndicate, a podcast focusing on Indie Tabletop games, mostly focusing on discussion and theories behind Indie RPGs, but we\u2019ll discuss just about anything you put in front of us. I guess first, we should introduce ourselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEloy Lasanta: Eloy Lasanta has been called \u201cthe hardest working man in RPGs!\u201d He is the owner and operator Third Eye Games (\u003ca href=\"http://thirdeyegames.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethirdeyegames.net\u003c/a\u003e) and creator many of his own RPGs: Apocalypse Prevention, Inc, Wu Xing: The Ninja Crusade, Part-Time Gods and AMP: Year One, as well as family RPGs Mermaid Adventures (ENnie-nominated), Camp Myth: The RPG (ENnie-nominated) and Infestation, an RPG of Bugs and Heroes. Eloy is active in the RPG community, always encouraging positivity and working together, and is a fan of discussing theory and game design. He is always working on new projects and finding new concepts to bring to life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrie Sheldon: Brie Sheldon is a budding game designer and writer at Daedalum Analog Productions (\u003ca href=\"http://www.igdnonline.com/members/daedalumap.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edaedalumap.com\u003c/a\u003e). She is an active blogger on her site Thoughty (\u003ca href=\"http://briecs.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebriecs.blogspot.com\u003c/a\u003e) and occasionally writes for Gaming as Women and Imaginary Funerals. She has written for Firefly: Smuggler\u0027s Guide, Onyx Path, and The Fate Codex. Her current projects include Firefly, her own games Clash and Blockbuster, and a blog series called Five or So Questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSarah Richardson:\u00a0Sarah Richardson works as a freelance graphic artist, providing illustration and graphic design for RPGs like \u003cem\u003eLamentations of the Flame Princess\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eRunequest\u003c/em\u003e. She plays far too many games and goes to way too many conventions, and has begun dipping her toe into game design. \u003ca href=\"http://www.scorcha.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.scorcha.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we want to do with this Patreon for Indie Syndicate\u00a0is deliver Season One of our show, which will last for 12 episodes. Each episode will have the two of us chatting about a new indie gaming related topic, usually with a special expert guest or two. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: Patreon is for people who want to help us out, but if you don\u2019t want to or are unable, it\u2019s all right. The episodes will still be available free of charge! We\u2019ll be starting recording soon, and releasing the episodes to anyone who wants to hear them. \u003cbr\u003e"
