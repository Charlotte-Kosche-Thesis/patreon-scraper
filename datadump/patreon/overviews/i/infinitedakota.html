While the word for spirit, heart, emotions, truest knowing is hinalom \u2014 or the thing that is inside. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI can feel my insides, my ancestors, and my teachers urging us to be in unity with nature and what is sacred and I work hard so that (I hope) everything that comes from within me surges with this oneness. I work towards bringing my awareness to this healing so that we can feel what is already always available to us. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe form depends on what needs to be expressed, I listen to the ancestors voices and work with them to play music, write essays, (\u0026lt;re\u0026gt;learn to) think and speak my ancestral tongues (and those shared with me), I visualize and trascribe lineages, mix mixtapes, embody dances, compose scores and soundscapes, create archives and educational resources, and whatever is needed to further our collective vitality. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe ancestors survive through inafa\u2019maolek \u2014 a system of reciprocity and generosity \u2014 that maintains balance and harmony with the natural world. I envision a way of living with each other that honors this kind of relationship making and maintaining with each other. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis page is an invitation for us to be in spiritual relationship with each other, to give to each other what we can so that our spirits can be friends for generations. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis year, I have many aspirations to give what is in my heart. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBelow are the visions I will work on this year in an indigenous world tour. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease see the itinerary below and the descriptions for the work I will be producing in the next seven months. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCONFIRMED ITINERARY FEBRUARY-AUGUST 2018\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 18-23 \u2014 \u003cem\u003eFirst Nations Exchange at Australian Performing Arts Market\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nin Jagera language group land, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 20th \u2014 \u003cem\u003ePerformance at Original Peoples Party @ Australian Performing Arts Market\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nin Jagera language group land, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 24-25 \u2014 \u003cem\u003eI MOVING LAB Cultural Exchange \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nin Bundjalung Land \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFebruary 28th \u2014\u003cem\u003e Lukao Fuha \u2014 Pina\u2019ok Gual\u00e5ffon in T\u0101maki Makaurau, Aotearoa \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMarch 1-17th \u2014  \u003cem\u003ePerformance Research W\u0101nanga\u003c/em\u003e with I MOVING LAB in preparation for performance at Commonwealth Games \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMarch 1-30th\u00a0 \u2014 \u003cem\u003eComposing Sound Score for H.O.L.Y.

We do not discriminate and seek to empower the space of healing and transformation for all. Our priority and love goes towards the First Nations peoples of the world and addressing how we heal together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSince 2016, I MOVING LAB has been traveling the world connecting with indigenous communities and building spaces for collaboration that supports local and global creative solutions.
