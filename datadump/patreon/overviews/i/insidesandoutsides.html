I am your host, Caroline Moore-Kochlacs, a Ph.D. neuroscientist and a metastatic breast cancer patient. I am interested in people\u0027s invisible coping strategies, the lives they build atop their illnesses and disabilities, the cracks in the medical system people get lost in, and the equitable and patient care focused medical system we can build.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will begin the podcast with my own story, interviewing family and friends to tell the story of my incurable cancer diagnosis three years ago and how we lived and coped through the difficult early days. The shared theme of the first set of episodes will be Quality of Life and what it means medically and to patients. I will be speaking to friends and from my own experience about chronic incapacitating conditions that lack a clear diagnosis and the struggle of slogging through the medical system to find some treatment or stability.\u00a0Another early episode will explore the experience, causes, and treatment of nausea.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney is great.\u00a0Insides and Outsides is currently supported by me and my time.* The more funding I receive from Patreon while I\u0027m in the start up phase, the more time I dedicate to the podcast.\u00a0 You can sign up here on Patreon to give as little as $1/month or give me\u00a0one time donation to offset start-up costs at \u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/caromk\"\u003epaypal.me/caromk\u003c/a\u003e.
