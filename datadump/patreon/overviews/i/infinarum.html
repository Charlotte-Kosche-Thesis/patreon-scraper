You don\u0027t have to read it, but hey, if you want to know who I am, here it goes:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0I got started in middle school, when it comes to actual work I\u0027ll be presenting here. \u003cem\u003eInfinarum \u003c/em\u003ecame of a simple design I doodled in the margins of my math workbook. It featured six ghostly felines, each with a power and a symbol on their faces. \"Like My Little Pony, but cooler,\" I told people, when describing it. A friend suggested I make it a story.\u00a0So I started drawing cats and came up with a strange little story idea, one I\u0027ve since expanded on. A simple enough tale to the starts of a story, and it\u0027s lingered at the back of my mind, dying to be written or elaborated upon since its conception. I pull from Lackadaisy, Warrior Cats, and yes, some My Little Pony, when it comes to character design and concepts. I don\u0027t know much about \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of those things. I just know they\u0027re sort of cool. And I have my own story to tell, so it isn\u0027t as if it\u0027s a derivative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0As for\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSongs of the Traveler,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI was a freshman in high school when I had a dream about a girl named Felicity, going to rescue her friend Sybyl. I didn\u0027t have a name for it, at the time, just \u003cem\u003eClairvoyance, \u003c/em\u003ebut it didn\u0027t really need a name.\u00a0I could say the rest is history, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s honest. \u003cbr\u003e\nIt wasn\u0027t until after my freshman year had come to a close, and the red binder the dream had been recorded in had long since been abandoned. On a steaming summer night in July, out of impulse or loneliness, but possibly both, I reconnected with someone I\u0027d met in school. J was not someone I thought I\u0027d fall in love with - but I did. Yes, the start of \u003cem\u003eSongs of the Traveler \u003c/em\u003eis a love story, sort of. Sue me for being a smol cheese puff. But it happened - he turned out to be one of the best mistakes to ever make.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0At the time I was real into roleplay on forums and message boards. He had gotten into them too on Neopets, but I threw Felicity at him. I had this character I didn\u0027t know what to do with, and he offered up a character who had been lost in another story a long time ago too. Felicity and Kaara. They stuck when it came to writing... and I think it was then I actually, really and truly, fell in love with J. I hadn\u0027t anticipated that. We wrote in off moments of school. One hundred fifty thousand words later, we plotted the end of Clairvoyance. And I cried.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0I had never finished anything before in my life, or even outlined the ending to anything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0We\u0027re still writing Clairvoyance, now \u003cem\u003eSongs of the Traveler. \u003c/em\u003eWe\u0027re still working, still weaving the timelines of our own little world so you can enjoy our story of rebellion and triumph. We\u0027re still polishing our high school stories into something you\u0027ll love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
