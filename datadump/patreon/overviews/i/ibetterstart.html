I\u2019ve wanted to start a podcast for a long time now. It was just a matter of coming up with an idea, something that felt original, but at the same time, made sense in a way that people could relate to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Once I came up with the idea, it was a matter of finding the time and the support. Besides being a writer, and a creative writing teacher, I\u2019m a SAHD\u2014a Stay At-Home Dad. My time is precious; my daughter, more so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. I\u2019ve been working \u201cprofessionally\u201d as a writer since 2007(ish). It\u2019s simultaneously the loneliest and most exposing thing I do. It\u2019s also something that mostly results in failure\u2014failure to finish, failure to be accepted, failure to make any real money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. I want my daughter to be creative and to place value on the creative process, as well as creative output. Art for art\u2019s sake is wonderful, but it happens inside of the vacuum that is Real Life. And the hardware of Real Life runs on monetary support. The software, the warm sensation of love, the soft embrace of your family and friends, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking to chronicle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI Better Start Writing This Down\u003c/em\u003e, right now, will be a monthly show. I\u2019ve got four episodes in the can. I\u2019m writing, recording, producing, and editing this show entirely on my own. Your support will go towards every aspect of that process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou provide the hardware, I\u2019ll provide the software. We\u2019ll all be better off for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
