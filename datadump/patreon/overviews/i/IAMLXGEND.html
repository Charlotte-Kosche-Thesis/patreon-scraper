    "summary": "What\u0027s up guys!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is LXGEND (pronounced Legend) \u0026amp; you already know, I have an extremely huge love and passion for \u003cstrong\u003emusic creation\u003c/strong\u003e! Since you\u0027ve gotten to this page, I\u0027m guessing you share a very similar passion!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Patreon and why do you use it?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/what-why.jpg\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited to use this platform to connect with you on a deeper level! This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support what you\u2019re doing: doing what you love, making music, and growing your YouTube channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s music videos, instrumentals, and tutorials on how to make great music and optimize your YouTube channel for growth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping creators (like you and me both!) bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per YouTube video that I create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gears.jpg\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I tend to publish at least 4 YouTube instrumentals and 1 tutorial to the IAMLXGEND channel. Each time I do so, I share those videos and mark them as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube videos I publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, \u003cstrong\u003eif you pledge $1 per YouTube music creation / tutorial and that month I publish 4 videos and 1 tutorial, you\u0027ll contribute $5 for that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, \u003cstrong\u003eyou can easily set a monthly contribution limit\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $10 per video, you still get access to the rewards at that tier, but you\u0027ll cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 1 YouTube training that month. You will spend no more than your monthly cap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my YouTube videos even if I publish additional YouTube videos that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing all of the free YouTube videos for the YouTube community of creators and listeners who have a big mission behind their work online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes a lot of time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, whether it\u0027s the upcoming singers who dream of creating that 1 viral cover video that launches them into the YouTube spotlight or the make-up artists, vloggers, \u0026amp; gamers who want to tell their story to their audience with compelling background music, I want to support these messages and the creators behind them. I know you do, too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me replace any broken \u0026amp; outdated equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like investing time into my family! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eShoot, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem at all! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. I know what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos and instrumentals that I hope will help you not only change lives, but even earn a bit of extra revenue from YouTube to alleviate some of your financial pressure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003eMy name is Lxgend and I\u0027ve been active in creating music since 1997 (I was 7). For a few years prior to YouTube I was a Semi-Truck Driver (18-Wheeler), I worked in retail at Old Navy \u0026amp; Target, and in a boring office job. During those times I used YouTube to publish videos about my life and original music I was creating. At the time I was just having a good time. Now those videos are known as \"vlogs.\" (My first vlog was filmed in 2006...I strongly believe I am the originator of the vlog, lol)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2952738?hl=en\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/youtube-certified-dark.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 25px 15px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eToday I have created and published over 100 YouTube videos, amassed 3,500,000+ views, and gained the attention from many prominent artists such as Justin Bieber, \u0026amp; Kirko Bangz who have both used my instrumentals as well as a shout out from Janelle Monae \u0026amp; The Wondaland Arts Society. I have produced for and featured songs with Grammy award winning artists Tonex and Grammy nominated artist B.Slade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeeing the unmatched potential of video to reach and influence musicians \u0026amp; music lovers, I decided to quit all of my jobs and focus solely on helping YouTube creators make music, videos, and effectively spread their message to reach people online. In 2013 I launched the YouTube channel, \"Lxgendary Beats\" now known as \"IAMLXGEND\", to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! I really does mean a lot to me. I really appreciate it!"
