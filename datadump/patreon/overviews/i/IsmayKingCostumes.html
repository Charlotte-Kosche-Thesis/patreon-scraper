    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the desperate pleas of a broke and overly ambitious costume maker!\u00a0As you may or may not know, I am Ismay Hutton, aka \"Ismay King Costumes\", a one-woman costume-making team with a name that is a (highly looked over) pun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making costumes for a fair wee while now, but always on a shoestring budget. And while people have been kind enough to pay for the material I use for their projects, there are certain things I don\u0027t feel comfortable charging them - such as thread, bits of ribbon, miniature plant pots (don\u0027t ask), etc.\u00a0I also have projects I want to create for my own use, or for others as gifts. These things would not have someone to pay for materials that isn\u0027t...well...me. And as I previously mentioned, I am really rather broke.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where this handy website comes in. Patreon allows me to ask if you wonderful people would be the kindest people in the world and donate money per project I work on (or \"Thing\" as Amanda Palmer so wonderfully put it.) As little as $1 per \"Thing\" would make a wonderful contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea is simple: I make something, I receive a donation. I don\u0027t make something, nothing happens. Plus, you can put a cap on donations. If, somehow, I manage to make 100 things in a week, you wouldn\u0027t have to pay for all of them. You\u0027re able to put a limit on how much you spend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you get my unwavering gratitude, the knowledge that I probably cried a little bit when you donated, and some extra little goodies you can see below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would even consider helping, that would mean the world to me. One dollar from you could mean I don\u0027t have to choose between lunch and sewing supplies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, in the name of rainbows and unicorns and nerd shit,\u003cbr\u003e-Ismay Hutton."
