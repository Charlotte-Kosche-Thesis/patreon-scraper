We amplify the talent in our community to help make Indianapolis a greater part of the national arts conversation by promoting four tenants: \u003cstrong\u003eCollaborate, Learn, Share, and Teach.\u003c/strong\u003e These ideas aren\u2019t abstractions for us. We believe in art as a tool for bringing disparate communities together and as a harbinger of change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur focus stays practical because we know that building business and community means curating public spaces where people gather and commerce happens. It means putting every dollar to work to capture the power, insight, and creativity that art and artists bring to communities everywhere.\u00a0By cultivating the talent that already exists on a local level and facilitating our residency program to bring in new voices, we work to both inform and stimulate community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s all that mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGood question!

Getting to this goal will help us start to fix all the little things that inevitably misbehave in a building that\u0027s over 100 years old. We\u0027d like to slowly replace our windows, fix the gutters, and start to turn our scary basement into a not-so-scary green room for performers. $2,000/month will help us tackle these small tasks one at a time while still keeping 2611 W. Michigan open, lighted, staffed and full of inspiring artists.\u00a0",
