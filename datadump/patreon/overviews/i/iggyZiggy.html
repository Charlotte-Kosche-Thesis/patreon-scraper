    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Iggy, and that\u0027s not my real name. The reason for using a nickname is due to a bunch of hate mail that I\u0027ve received, mostly coming from an online multiplayer game that I\u0027ve created. And just to clarify, it comes from people who get banned for reasons like nationalism, \"jacking off\" on web cam and that kind of stuff.\u003cbr\u003e(nice intro, huh?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eA bit of history\u003c/h1\u003eI have tried multiple times to start my own business; hiring artist, buying music from other indies and every time I would just ran out of budget and had to get a job as a software developer, saving money for my next try. It has become an endless loop which I would like to break with monthly subscriptions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eAbout my most popular game\u003c/h1\u003eMy most popular game is a variation of \"Ludo\" called \"Covjece ne ljuti se\". It was created for players from the Balkan area or better known as former Yugoslavia, mainly because of the popularity of that game in those countries. Advertisers don\u0027t have much interest in that part of the world so ad revenues are next to nothing. Also internet banking is pretty much demonized over here so it\u0027s even harder to make money with in-app purchases. The only thing that seems to be working are SMS payments, but that brings in a whole new set of problems. The biggest one is that from every payment I\u0027m happy to earn 30-40% of what users pay. So let\u0027s say a player pays $1, in most cases I earn $0.3 and have to pay taxes afterwards. So that would be the main reason for me signing up for Patreon. I hope for support from people who understand how hard it is to have a proper breakthrough and getting f***ed by the system at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eGoal\u003c/h1\u003eI just want to make enough money to help friends. Finding work is pretty hard, and doing something you actually love for a living is even harder. I was lucky enough to discover that early in my life and now I want the same thing for my closest friends who are willing to work with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you enjoyed the read and looking forward to seeing some new patreons.\u003cbr\u003eThanks\u003cbr\u003e"
