The answer\u0027s easy: it\u0027s fun! There\u0027s nothing like digging into\na game engine that\u0027s been around in one form or another for fifteen years and\nwrenching something completely new out of it, and the fact that there are\npeople who eagerly wait for the next ridiculous creation is pretty awesome,\ntoo. In fact, I liked this enough that I quit my job to pursue it long before\nthe business made enough money for the decision to look anything like a\nrational one. I\u0027m determined to make this work, make a career of it, and leave\ntens of thousands of pages of the weird, unusual, and just plain fun behind\nbefore I expire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you can say,\n\"I don\u0027t always try a new class, but when I do, it has its own\nspellbook,\" then we\u0027ll get along splendidly!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Problem\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOf course, given the\nlingering business model of the pre-internet roleplaying game industry, it\u0027s a\nbit of a struggle to get established in this day and age. Let me explain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the 1980s and\ninto the 1990s, the roleplaying game industry revolved around the distributors.\nThe internet was still in its infancy, and the best ways of learning what was\nnew in the world of roleplaying were to look over the shelves of the Friendly\nLocal Game Store or to ask your friends. The store owners, for their part, were\nat the mercy of the distributor\u0027s catalogs, and those game stores tended to\nfill with what the distributors tried to push. The fact that distributors\nneeded to look after their own bottom line meant you would be more likely to be\npushed by them if you were A: already popular, B: had a large rulebook to give\nthem a large margin of profit per unit sold, and/or C: expanded like clockwork,\nand creators of games were compelled to follow B and C in an effort to court\nthe distributors to become A. This led to an entire subset of the industry that\npowercrept or otherwise bloated their systems into oblivion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith the advent of\nwidespread internet access, this monopoly on information broke in rather\nspectacular fashion as communities for the sharing of roleplaying game\ninformation began to pop up like towns during the gold rush. We roleplayers\nlove to share our ideas. We homebrew and we tinker. We create and we improve.\nAnd when it\u0027s all over, we head over and talk about it. Today, a successful\ncontent creator is expected to have an established home for their fans, and\nsuccessful collective storefronts are built around models that grab as much\ntraffic as possible, but restrict the outward flow of that traffic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving started\nInterjection Games in one of those collective storefronts, my attempts to grow\nhave been thwarted several times now by a signed document that makes meaningful\ninteraction with half of my customer base almost impossible. The only way to\nmove forward is to build a new business model that cuts out the middleman and\nallows for direct contact between creator and fan. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd isn\u0027t cutting out the middleman and establishing a\ndirect, symbiotic rapport with your fanbase what every artist wants?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow this Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is like a subscription. In my case, it would be you giving me the\nthumbs up and saying that you\u0027re comfortable enough with the Interjection Games\nbrand to commit to slapping $X down for each new sizable chunk of content I\nmake, be it a base class with spellbook, a new items compendium, or whatnot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreators of content have the option to ask for monthly payments or \"per\ncreation\" payments from their patrons. With the latter, backers can set a\nmonthly limit, say max $10 per month if the creator really gets gung ho for\nsome reason and spits out multiple products. Given how I can sometimes fight a\nconcept for a month, and other times I get a fantastic idea written and out the\ndoor in four days, \"per creation\" is the method that Interjection\nGames will use.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe huge benefit here is that an established Patreon creator can treat each\nof his releases like a mini-Kickstarter and have a project budget of\ncrowdsourced dollars in hand that can be used to add art to the product, or\neven just give the creator the assurance that he won\u0027t end up homeless if he\nspends another week making sure all the mechanics line up. Further, as Patreon\nis effectively neutral ground, for they have nothing to gain by finding ways to\nsquelch my interaction with those who enjoy what I do, the ever-so-important\none-on-one interaction between creator and customer base becomes possible\nwithout restriction.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat I Promise to Deliver\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFun, Unique Content\u003c/em\u003e - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am the\nsingle most-nominated game author for reviewer \u003ca href=\"http://www.endzeitgeist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEndzeitgeist\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s top 10 of 2014, and I\ndon\u0027t see that quality dipping anytime soon.
