    "summary": "Our players have crazy ideas, and responding to them takes a lot of skill. Most of us are forced to railroad the players to keep them within the content we prepared. My personal projects are designed to take the weight off of gm\u0027s shoulders by giving them high quality tables that allow for quick generation of dungeons, cities, buildings, rooms, npcs, and so much more. If your players take off in the \"wrong\" direction, the generators allow you to follow. Because these generators are embedded inside of a virtual table top, they automatically record their results and allow for a lot of organization.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the content Incarnate Gaming LLC has had licensed to it is released for free (https://incarnategaming.github.io/download/). If you wish to support this company in general, you may do so here, but this is separate from any content we release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page covers the buisness expenses for Incarnate Gaming LLC (web hosting, YouTube analytics, software subscriptions, legal fees, etc.).

     "about": "I\u0027ve played video games for as long as I can remember. They have just always been there. They allow for a form of creativity that is unique and brilliant. When I was first introduced to tabletop games I found a place where this creativity could reach new heights as there are no limits to human creativity. As I became a GM I found that my players would always go in directions I did not expect... so instead of learning how to railroad them to a path I decided to build a module that would allow you to quickly create a new path with cities and npcs fleshed out for them to encounter. As this hobby grew a few people noticed it and requested that it be published. I read through the legal pages of some publishers and found that I had to essentially sign over all my rights to them. Furthermore the method of paying once for an item leads to a plethora of plugins and confusion over what content is in each. I decided to do something different. Instead of insisting on payment, I release it for free* and ask for help to keep the project alive and growing. The goal is to build two primary modules 1) that generates a world and everything in it that is designed to last and be encountered multiple times and 2) a generator that throws reasonable fights at you and can be set by terrain, race, and difficulty. The first of these just launched to beta today. The second is still pre-alpha but can already generate some encounters. There is still a lot more to do in both, but after 300 hours of working on it I need financial help to be able to continue. So please join in. From broke college students that are willing to have one less pizza this year ($1 a month) to middle class workers who want a bit more influence in where these modules head, even to companies that want to piggyback off of this for advertising, there is a multitude of people I can imagine will want this software and by working together it will be much cheaper than if I licensed it through a major corporation... and WE get to decide what direction it goes. We get to vote with our time and our money and grow this like we want it to be, not like some big wig in an unknown office decides.",
