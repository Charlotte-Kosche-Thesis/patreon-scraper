I have\u00a0been developing Adrayvia, a unique action RPG\u00a0since July 2015, and I need your support to create this beautiful world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU EVEN BOTHER READING FURTHER?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply making it to my page is very much appreciated, but even if you\u0027re not inclined or able to donate funds at this time, it\u0027ll mean the world to me if you could take a minute to imagine the world I\u0027m creating, one in which every action begets consequence, where you FEEL like you\u0027re actually your character.

After 2 more years of untamed, unrelenting and absolute chaos, the 5 Great Countries sent their representatives to form a parley which eventually led to a truce. The Round Table, a body tasked with maintaining order and diplomatic relations amongst the participating countries was founded, and thus the Advent Age began.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGame Mechanics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCombat Design: The combat in Adrayvia is designed for fluid transitions and extensive customization. Players can switch combat styles and weapons during combat, as well as configure their personal moves through the respective interface even mid combat. Moves can be acquired through a number of ways like learning from NPC Masters or purchasing special scrolls from stores. A select number of very skilled players can also reach the Master rank, and these players can also take on a number of disciples to share their secret techniques with.\u003cbr\u003eFeints, parries, melee and ranged attack tiers, launchers, special techniques, and evades form the core of combat, with deep RPG elements and trade to personalize and develop characters. \u003cbr\u003eTeam Combat allows players to fight as allies in co-op or PvP against other groups on missions in multiplayer, and also allows switching among up to 4 characters in single player.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRPG Elements\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePlayers select a play style at the beginning of a new campaign - Expert, Specialist or Generalist. Each of these styles has a direct effect on the number of classes available to their character(s), and the amount of potential they are able to draw from said class and/or adjacent classes. Level ascension brings with it several options for upgrading and developing characters. Apart from combat-type upgrades, as the characters level up, their gear options become a lot more specialized. Rank (status of experience in combat, leadership, support, skill), Reputation (net status of consequences of actions in-game) and Bounty (status as assassination target as a result of reputation and rank) can be increased or decreased through various actions and can all affect the kinds of alliances that can be struck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEconomy\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWar is bred on economy, and that is an entire war on its own in Adrayvia. Management can range from combatants that manage simple gear to lords that manage entire cities. Different locations have different economy types. For example, Gregoria is mostly desert and so the controller of perishable items is often targeted, but it also is the center and history of civilization in Adrayvia, with the highest ranked scrolls available. Deltic areas are difficult to traverse, and even more so for outsiders, so the deltic often go for a more defensive approach. And there is good reason too - their much coveted superior technology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacters\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe characters from Adrayvia\u0027s lore are very detailed and diverse, from the egoistic \u0027tsundere\u0027 to the pervy lunatic. There are three main factions to side with - the Meridians, the Morlocks and the Renaissance, each having its own special perks, available options, and faction techniques. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorld\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAdrayvia is a 4,000 year old world with a harsh history and diverse climates scattered across its countries. There are 5 major countries in Adrayvia - Alwinter, Olgaria, Gregoria, Argos, and Delta. There are also several isles complimenting the countries, most of which are floating islands. The countries are mostly separated by three major expanses of water, the Feighan Ocean, the North Sea, and the Aryk Ocean. There are other important history markers - the Aurelia Lake in Alwinter, Mount Koza in Argos, The Mer Falls in Argos, The Sphinx in Gregoria, The Empty Oases in Gregoria, and The Everglades in Delta. World exploration is designed to be very rewarding and adventurous for the brave few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.adrayvia.com/\"\u003ewww.adrayvia.com\u003c/a\u003e for more details on the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eABOUT ME\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now,\u00a0I\u0027m a freelance game programmer. I am also very well versed and experienced in game design, combat design, sound design and game writing. As long as I\u0027m earning enough money through Patreon, I can continue to work on\u00a0Adrayvia in a full-time capacity instead of looking for freelance work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eADRAYVIA\u0027S EVOLUTION\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the summer of June 2015, I had an epiphany. It was a dream. Yet it felt so real I could taste it. The clash of metal, the stank of old blood in the air. A story\u00a0determined\u00a0to be told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had no money, and no other resource to speak of. No stable electricity, even, and of course, no labor force. Except myself. I always wanted to be a game designer, and fueled by this singular, insatiable passion, I began tinkering with the Unreal Engine 4, and by September 2015, I began iterations in the engine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout Adrayvia\u0027s development, I met several extremely talented people from all around the world - concept artists, 3D character artists, UI designers, environment artists, sound designers, programmers, writers, game designers - all of whom have been incredibly supportive and have gently helped me hone my skills, as well as steer Adrayvia in the right direction. And as the sole developer on the back-end, I\u2019ve been responsible for the game design including combat design, RPG element design, level design and systems design, game and AI programming, technical animation, VFX and art pipeline, game writing, sound design and engineering. \u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8R12eOMU9o\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\nNow, after 21 months, Adrayvia finally has incredible gameplay mechanics, and now it\u0027s time to proceed to the next phase of the project.

I don\u0027t have the resources to tell the story, yet, in terms of funding.
