It started in 2012 as a weekly podcast hosted by Kenny McIntosh and Robert\nDuffin. The show has grown and changed over the years, and we now offer\nmultiple shows per week covering news, Raw, Smackdown, and other wrestling goodness!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you want money\nfor a free podcast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnfortunately, producing a free podcast costs money. Web\nhosting, bandwidth, audio equipment, Internet connections\u2026 none of these things\nare free, and as much as this show is a labor of love, we could use your help\nto keep it going and make it even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOther than the\nsatisfaction of helping out the show, do I get anything for pledging money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOf course! While we\u2019d never turn away money given out of\npure generosity, we feel our VIP patrons deserve some extra content. You\u2019re welcome to give any amount you feel\ncomfortable with (anything helps!), but we have some rewards laid out for\ncertain donation amounts. The reward categories are always subject to change\u2014for\nthe better! We\u2019ll never take away rewards we\u2019ve given in the past, but plan to\nadd more content as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAre Patreon donations\ngoing to affect the free content we\u2019re used to receiving every week!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNO! We have no plans to take away any of the content we put\nout now. You\u2019ll still be able to hear the Raw Rundown, Smackdown Summary, Retro\nRAW Rundown, and more absolutely free. Any content for our patrons is above and\nbeyond our normal output as a way to say thank you for your generosity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I change the amount I pledge from month to month or am I committed to stay at a certain level?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe nice thing about Patreon is that it\u0027s super easy to change how much you want to give from month to month. You can even pledge for a month and cancel altogether if you just want to make a one-time contribution; we appreciate anything you\u0027re willing to give!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means if you normally pledge $5 per month but want to request a VIP special, you can change to the $50 level for just one month to get your reward and then go back down to your normal $5 the next month.\u003cbr\u003e"
