    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello everyone! I\u0027m Brave Dave.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe chances are that you found this page from a link on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bravedaveempire\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IAmBraveDave/\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e, so you already know who I am. However, if you don\u0027t know me, well, I\u0027m an English guy who likes to go on little adventures and then make videos about them for YouTube. Here\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.iambravedave.com\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e where you can browse my backlog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.iambravedave.com/images/10-3-1468002358.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m up for going just about anywhere and doing just about anything, but the majority of my videos so far have been up and around various mountains, often bivvying or camping up there overnight. This is mainly because mountain videos are relatively low cost and straightforward to make (and also I love mountains). However, I do occasionally go off on big adventures, travelling to foreign countries and roughing it for days or weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos are pretty raw. I don\u0027t bother with fancy post-production (mainly because I use a really crappy video editor), rather I focus on getting exciting footage and engaging with the camera so that viewers are taken along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.iambravedave.com/images/10-3-1468002225.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I On Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePreviously I\u0027ve treated my YouTube channel as an occasional hobby. I hadn\u0027t put much effort into growing it and I just added new content whenever I happened to be going somewhere already, rather than specifically going and making content for the channel. However, I have always wanted to try and turn it into something bigger and whereas I don\u0027t have a huge number of subscribers I do have a lot of people telling me how much they enjoy my videos and -best of all- how my videos inspire them to go out and do things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the situation is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI really enjoy making adventure videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m good at making adventure videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA decent number of people enjoy watching my adventure videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI don\u0027t have the time or money to go and make adventure videos very often.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eSo what\u0027s a guy to do? I came to the logical conclusion that I should try something like Patreon, giving my fans the chance to generously contribute a small amount of cash on a regular basis so that I can make bigger and better content for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.iambravedave.com/images/10-3-1468002473.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money that you pledge to me on Patreon will be put towards making more frequent and higher quality adventure videos. Even if I am only receiving a small amount on here it will help me with my travel costs. Any excess money will go towards either essential kit or savings for bigger adventures (think \"Big Fat Freight Hop\" as an example).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e Money is taken from Patrons on a monthly basis. The idea is that by pledging just a few dollars a month you will massively help me to increase my video output without any financial risk on your part. You can opt out whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully I\u0027ve earned people\u0027s trust when it comes to giving me money. In September 2016 I made a video explaining that I wanted to go to Canada to spend 2 weeks riding freight trains across the country, but that there was no way I could afford to do it. I asked if anyone would like to donate some money so that I could make a big fat adventure video. Some awesome people responded and within 1 week of raising the required amount I was sat on a plane with a proper adventure ahead of me. I like to think that \u003cstrong\u003eBrave Dave\u0027s Big Fat Freight Hop\u003c/strong\u003e (the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAV_vbwr_d0\"\u003e4 part, 135 minute video\u003c/a\u003e that I edited once I got home) is proof that I keep my word and that I take donations seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.iambravedave.com/images/10-3-1486572872.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow To Pledge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d like to become a patron, that\u0027s awesome! Thanks a lot. I really do appreciate it. It\u0027s because of people like you that I will be able to make bigger and better videos for your entertainment. In order to pledge, you will firstly need to create a Patreon account. If you haven\u2019t already got an account, you will prompted to set one up during the following steps:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eClick \u2018Become a patron\u2019.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChoose the amount you wish to pledge (pledges are on a \u2018per month\u2019 basis).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt this point you will be prompted to sign up if you are not already logged in. You can do so via Facebook or by entering your email address.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will land on the confirmation page, where you can review your pledge. (If you wish to use PayPal instead of a credit card, this is also where you can connect your account.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClick \u2018Confirm and Pledge\u2019 - a box will appear on the screen where you can enter your card information (if you have not connected a PayPal account). Click \u2018Pledge\u2019 and you are now officially a patron of Brave Dave!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.iambravedave.com/images/10-7-1468941843.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making adventure videos and I love the feedback that I receive for them, especially from people who say that I\u0027ve inspired them to get out and do something! My ultimate goal is to be able to focus on making adventure videos full time and with a close-knit community of people helping me out by offering feedback and discussion, as well as funding. The content I make online will always be free, but if you\u0027d like to support its evolution I would be really grateful. Any donation, no matter how small, is appreciated but if you do not wish to or can\u0027t make a pledge then I hope that you still enjoy my content regardless and that you instead add to the community by joining the discussions over on the YouTube channel or Facebook page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a lot for taking the time to read my Patreon page. See ya! :)\u003cbr\u003e- Brave Dave\u003cbr\u003e"
