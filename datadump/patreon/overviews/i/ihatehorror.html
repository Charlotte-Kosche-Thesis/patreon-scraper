Thank you all so much for checking this page out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have never heard our show before check us out at \u003ca href=\"http://ihatehorror.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ihatehorror.com\u003c/a\u003e or directly on iTunes at \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/horror-show-horror-movie-podcast/id954193758?mt=2.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/horror-show-ho...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started the podcast in late December of 2014 and we\u0027ve been having an absolute blast doing the show and talking to all the people who have joined us over the last year. We never, EVER, expected to receive the following that we have. We love the show so much that we\u0027ve put in a ton of money into updating equipment, websites, servers, etc. without hesitation, because it truly was for the love of horror and podcasting. But now were looking for a little help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much more we want to do for you guys, and we want to make this show as big as possible as well as do tons of fun stuff. The only way we can do that though is by asking for some small donations from you, our awesome fans. We\u0027ve got plans for updating equipment, more stickers, t-shirts, video shows, live events, and trips but we just don\u0027t have the money to cover all of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, you can pledge on a per month basis. You can choose any amount you want and we have rewards starting from the $2.00 tier. As a donor we will be offering you exclusive content such as bonus content and episodes, online group hangouts (maybe we can all watch a horror movie together!), and some other awesome ideas I have floating in my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThank you all SOOOOO much for even giving this a read. If you feel inclined to help a couple weirdos out please donate whatever you might be able to afford, I know times are tough so we TRULY appreciate any donations we get no matter the amount!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay weird everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSean \u0026amp; Joe\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eNew to Patreon?
