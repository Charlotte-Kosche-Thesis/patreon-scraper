Pixiv is preferred if you will follow me but any is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m self-teaching to become an illustrator of both anatomy and landscapes primarily, as my primary goal for the long future is to become a fully-fledged illustrator of things such as visual novels, doujins, and other similar works. \u003cbr\u003eEventually once I become more comfortable with that, I intend on poking my nose into animation; I have always found the media especially beautiful and would like to eventually be capable of creating my own works within it, at least to some degree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the time being, my drawings typically include anime style(oftentimes fanart), and occasional attempts at settings; my banner being one of those. \u003cbr\u003eI tend to work fairly inconsistently as I find myself doing a lot of things at once (right now, I often end up spending upwards of half of my waking hours studying another language.) so I may not post things regularly, however I will make an effort to offer at least something once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I go through these growing pains, I greatly appreciate any and all who appreciate my works, you keep me going even as I constantly second guess myself and beat myself up mentally. Even as that is, I still need to eat, and that\u0027s largely; perhaps even entirely what this funder will be providing me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(In the future, I hope to be able to translate this into Japanese once I have the abilities to.)\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d for some reason like to give me something between 1 and 5 or a random donation from the good of your heart, I have a kofi: https://ko-fi.com/itsukarine\u003cbr\u003e"
