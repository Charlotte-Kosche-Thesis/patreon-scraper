He\u0027s \ndeveloping a five-string acoustic violin design with my input and \nassistance from two master violin makers who also make five-strings.  \nHe\u0027s going to use Master-grade Bosnian maple for the back and the scroll\n block; aged Apine spruce for the top; hand-split willow for the \ninterior blocks and linings; an ebony fingerboard; pegs of my choice; \nand an L.R. Baggs Violin Pickup with a Carpenter jack.  He has each \npiece of wood already hand-selected, and he has put some of it in my \nhands so I can look at it.  It\u0027s going to be a 14-inch scaled-down \nversion of a Brothers Amati viola with Carlo Bergonzi-style scroll and \nf-holes, and I am already in love with it.
