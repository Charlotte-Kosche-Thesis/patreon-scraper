I write about medical anthropology and the wandering womb, secular humanism and recovering from religious abuse, creating a culture of consent, a novel I refuse to speak of aloud, and secular prayers of encouragement for staying human. I write about what the living do, my own wrestling and work with dismantling the kyriarchy\u00a0which oppresses and destroy life, all the ways there are of falling in love with humans, and sometimes I write about violence and sometimes I write about lilacs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a lot over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/faith.abbott.921\"\u003e facebook\u003c/a\u003e , (soon will begin writing on medium) and other online and in print publications, and I am the author of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Honey-secular-prayers-hedonistic/dp/0692723439/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1512067596\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=salt+%2B+honey+secular+prayers\"\u003e salt + honey: secular prayers for the human and hedonstic hearts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make visual and performance art of cartography, medical x-rays, and large wearable wings composed of feathers and ripped pages and lost and found discarded things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e*******\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u2019m not writing and creating, I work with individuals and groups as a sexuality and intimate justice educator and a consent culture radical, and I offer sanctuary and support for those recovering from cults and religious abuse.

I want to see that change, to continue to create and write in a way that is sustainable and serves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be supported in my creating is to be given the time and space needed to be in the quiet of creation and the mad love of the language born into being.

You don\u0027t have to remember to redo it every month or go searching for Paypal links. There is no complicated overhead and as a patron you get to be here in this community and receive access to all the cool stuff that happens in the making and creation itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy being a patron of the art, of a patron of yours truly, you directly support my art and activism and allow me the time and space and resources needed to continue in the creation of art and language and a culture of consent. I cannot and will not promise you certain outcomes and products as if my work here in the world is to be a producer of things to consume and discard. But I can and do promise that my work is to be faithful to the art itself and to the process of creating and unapologetic writing. I am here to show up fully, with all of me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was a time when I thought I could do everything. That if I just worked hard enough or long enough or continued to push through every limitation and no my body screamed at me, that I would be able to do all the things. That is no longer true for me. I have come to live and love, to accept and even embrace, that I am corporeal and temporal and finite. This gives meaning and spaciousness and pressing reality to my days. I know now that I cannot do everything, and so to write and create requires sustainable support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I am here.\u003cbr\u003eMy gratitude is oceans deep.\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003eYour support is what allows me to continue my work and my service and my art and offer it to you and to the world, through creative heat and sustainability, which is a kind of completeness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn love and defiance,\u003cbr\u003eIsabel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I am currently working on\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI write and offer education and encouragement on staying human over on facebook and Instagram, and I write essays and articles for a variety of online and in print publications.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBeing supported in my writing will allow me to write longer-form essays and articles on a consistent basis, write here on patreon regularly, and continue to offer all kinds of writing over in the land of facebook where I engage daily.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo move toward my writing and art being sustained with patron supporters also allows me the time to begin two books: a novel I\u2019m not ready yet to talk about and a collection of essays that are really love letters to being human.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWings of Desire:\u003cbr\u003eThe making of an entire collection of large-scale wearable wings and interactive performance art for all the fallen angels, misfits, outcasts and humans whose bodies remembers adaptation and desire: what it felt like to come from water, what it was to fly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDamaged Goods: the good body broken\u003cbr\u003eAn art series of images and writing from maps and medical x-rays."
