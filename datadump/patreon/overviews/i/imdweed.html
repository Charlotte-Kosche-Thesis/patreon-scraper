    "summary": "Kelly and Jessica met like most good friends do nowadays \u2014 wasted at a Halloween party. Kelly, dressed as Bjork, and Jessica dressed as Raggedy Anne. They bonded over their love of\u2026well I guess just partying. Later on, when they began hanging out, they also began bonding over their love of karaoke and smoking weed \u2014 which they did on the regular every Monday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne fateful night, sitting at home or maybe on the patio of Bigfoot Lodge, Jessica and Kelly were complaining about the hardships of life. How difficult it is to make your way and find success \u2014 Jessica in the television production industry and Kelly in comedy, when suddenly one of them, I think it was Kelly, was struck with a new, never been thought of, super original  idea: \u201cLet\u2019s start a podcast!\u201d because we all know there aren\u2019t enough of those right now. For some reason, the concept actually came to them easily. They bounced back a few ideas but they kept coming back to one \u2014 getting stoned and watching movies. It was a frequent event Jessica and Kelly would do by themselves, most recently going to a cheap theatre wearing onesie pajamas to see Moana post-edible eating. It\u2019s a great escape from personal tragedies and your day to day life and just get lost in the movie world for a bit and Jessica and Kelly loved and connected with that, why not make it into a podcast?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJessica and Kelly also realized something else, in a world where marijuana-culture is heightening in entertainiment, there wasn\u2019t really many funny female stoners. Sure there\u2019s Seth Rogen, Doug Benson, Cheech and Chong \u2014 but where are the ladies at? They felt this was another reason why they needed to make this podcast, just prove ladies can have as much fun and get as high as your average Joe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, IMDweed was born. Each week Jessica and Kelly bring a guest to get stoned and go to the movies with and then discuss the film after. It\u2019s fun and funny. Sometimes they can get pretty in depth with the analysis and other times they\u2019ll have a guest they\u2019ll accidentally get too high and have to take a nap to prep for the podcast  \u2014 either way, it\u2019s always a great listen. Tune in every Tuesday!\u003cbr\u003e"
