Our goal is to sail all the way around the world, visiting as many \"off the beaten track\" places as possible, and to film these interesting places as well as some of the people we meet, and things we do on the boat in order to share this with our viewers. We hope\u00a0to\u00a0take you with us from the comfort of your desk or arm chair, to experience this journey with us, as if you were on the boat with us,\u00a0 through the videos we will create, as well as through our pictures\u00a0and written\u00a0articles and content we share with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining our supporter group here, on Patreon, you will receive first access to all the content we create, and any special offers we make. Right now, our financial circumstances dictate that we need to take on paying crew to help us make ends meet in maintain the boat, camera equipment, and our operating expenses to keep the boat sailing. Later, depending on if and how our Patreon supporter base grows, we hope to offer crew spots to those Patreon supporters who have stood by us for the longest, and in order of support levels provided over time. We think this will be a cool way of \"giving back\"\u00a0something to you, our greatest supporters. Until then, we are currently putting our heads together to come up with other ways to reward our Patreon supporters here. Stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for joining our support team, and welcome you to the Sailing Island Pearl II supporter group."
