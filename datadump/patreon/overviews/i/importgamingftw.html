for the PS1, Microsoft\u0027s beautiful action hack n\u0027 slash Magatama for the original Xbox, and the PlayStation fantasy RPG set in the Victorian Era, London Seirei Tantei-dan...I love telling people about the overlooked gems, and there are so much more I want to create videos on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv7EkhoP6lU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do videos covering gaming-related merchandise called \"Gaming Beyond Games,\" but these are few and far between, though I do plan on adding more of these to the channel when I get access to better filming equipment.\u00a0 Here\u0027s a short video talking about the contents of an impressive box set of soundtracks of 8-/16-bit era Ganbare Goemon games that was released in 2017:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTVRjVeIENM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE REASON FOR STARTING UP A PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and that\u0027s where this page and service comes into the picture.\u00a0 Up until now, I\u0027ve only treated the whole YouTube thing as a side hobby, a perhaps less-than-simple way of passing time.\u00a0 Over the years, I\u0027ve met so many great people because of it, both viewers and other video makers, and although I have a full-time job, in the short time I\u0027ve been doing it, Import Gaming FTW! has become a pretty big part of my life.\u00a0 Along the way, there have been plenty of ups, and a fair share of downs, but I honestly don\u0027t see myself quitting any time soon, nor would I want to.\u00a0 While I don\u0027t have access to the sophisticated filming equipment that many of my peers do (except for a Framemeister), nor do I use fancy editing or effects software, everything used to produce my video series has been acquired on my own.\u00a0 I think it\u0027s all been worth it in the end, but I can\u0027t even fathom just how much I\u0027ve spent on this hobby of mine up until now...which is fine, since it is MY hobby.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut because crowdfunding is such a big part of the YT scene now, I figured I might as well start a Patreon account to see if I can get a little extra help--and justification--in upgrading my equipment and software, as well as in obtaining materials to use in videos.\u00a0 Of course, I will never require a paywall to view Import Gaming FTW! episodes, and I don\u0027t expect many people to support me with their hard-earned money, but any help I can get, I will appreciate greatly, and I will use whatever I receive to make the channel better by stepping up production and investing in its future.\u00a0 I\u0027ll try to set up some interesting Patreon goals and rewards, but whether you give or not, thank you for reading up until this point and for your support, as a viewer or a patron.\u00a0 I am so blessed and grateful for all I have in this strange little YouTube game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I think this has gone on for far too long...I hope your eyes don\u0027t hurt.\u00a0 See ya around on the channel and on the next episode of Import Gaming FTW!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is Jimmy Hapa--take care.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
