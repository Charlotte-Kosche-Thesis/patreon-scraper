I have been a model for about 4 years; collaborating with fellow photographers and models to create something unique and unseen is something\u00a0I have enjoyed immensely. My other hobbies\u00a0include\u00a0DIY crafts as well as any props or sets for my photo shoots,\u00a0I also hope\u00a0to get back into cosplaying, even if it\u0027s just small characters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMy patreon is for fans who would like to show their support to help fund my creations while receiving rewards as a display of my gratitude. With my son only being a year and a half, working full time; even though Iove what I do, I wish I had more time to spend with him and on my crafts/prop requests. A big goal of mine by this next year\u00a0 is to be a stay at home mom so I can go back to school and finish my last semester in order to graduate with my BA (I\u0027M SO CLOSE!) So to my awesome supporters, those who contribute even as low as 1$ will have rewards such as tutorials of my pole, craft and prop work. Professional prints and surprise polaroid\u0027s, pics and vids of BTS shenanigans and much more! Even if your not a pledge, I greatly appreciate all my fans support!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
