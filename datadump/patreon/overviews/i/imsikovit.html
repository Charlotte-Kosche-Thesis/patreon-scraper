I don\u0027t expect to make a living off of this but you can help me make this more sustainable so I can at least make more videos regularly and more importantly, MORE QUEST GUIDES! This also helps pay for the programs that I use to make my videos (Adobe Photoshop and Premiere), as well as RuneScape membership for a few accounts (Sikovit, SikovitQuest, and SikovitOSRS). I am hoping you can help support my videos so I can continue doing what I love more frequently. Be sure you check out the rewards you can get for pledging to certain tiers on the right!\u00a0You will be contacted through Patreon messages to get your rewards.\u003cbr\u003e"
