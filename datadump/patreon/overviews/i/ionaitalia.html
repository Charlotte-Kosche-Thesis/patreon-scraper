    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a writer all my life and a obsessive, passionate dancer\nof Argentine tango for a decade and a half. Just over seven years ago, in January\n2011, I decided to combine my two passions and write a blog about my tango life\nin Buenos Aires, where I have been living and dancing for more than ten years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTango is an\nephemeral experience. So many things can happen in the three minutes you\nspend in someone\u0027s embrace -- and yet, afterwards, there is\nnothing to show for it, nothing you can hold onto and treasure. So I began to\nwrite, to keep a record of the places I danced, the way I felt while dancing,\nthe blissful and sometimes heartbreaking experiences I had with partners. I\ndanced to forget -- but I wrote to remember. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt first, I was primarily\u00a0keen to capture the \u003cem\u003efeel \u003c/em\u003eof dancing: that elusive sensation difficult\nto convey in words. I wanted to find language which was poetic enough to\nconvey its nuances and yet avoid exaggeration and clich\u00e9. I was wary of\nromanticising the dance and wanted to remain scrupulously honest about the\nexperiences I was documenting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGradually, the blog\u0027s readership increased and,\na year later, I opened a Facebook account under the rather\nunwieldy pseudonym, Terpsichoral Tangoaddict. I began supplementing my longer,\nautobiographical sketches with regular postings in\nwhich I mused, argued, harangued, satirised and even bitched -- on such topics as the challenges of learning and teaching dance, the joys and frustrations of working in a partnership, the tricky politics of partner choice and how to help a young tango community grow. I explored everything from the exactly how long to sustain eye contact during cabeceo and how to interpret the triplet beats in Fresedo\u0027s \"Buscandote\" to how dancing tango can change your personality, priorities and entire life in the profoundest of ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, in 2018, I\u0027d like to continue writing about our dance and bring my writings to as wide an audience as possible: through articles, talks and two new books, which have been completed and are awaiting publication the first of which (and perhaps both) of which I plan to publish with Michael Lavocah\u0027s Milonga Press UK. I hope to counteract the stubborn clich\u00e9s about fishnets and ferocity, pouty faces and fedoras that have infested the popular imagination. My writing is informed by the personal experiences I\u0027ve had, dancing in Buenos Aires, Europe, America and mostly recently India. But it\u0027s not about me. It\u0027s an attempt to create a pen portrait of our dance: vividly, precisely and without a trace of kitsch. I deal with questions almost every dancer has mused on and describe experiences everyone can relate to. I\u0027m an Everywoman Tanguera.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you\u0027ll be able to get benefits like a copy of my forthcoming book, \u003cem\u003eOur Tango World\u003c/em\u003e, as well as my guide to Buenos Aires, and my talk on tango music. You\u0027ll also be able to suggest topics of discussion and commission pieces of writing. Together, we\u0027ll help the world fall in love with our dance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
