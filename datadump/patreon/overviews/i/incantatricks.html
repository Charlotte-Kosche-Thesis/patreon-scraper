    "summary": "Okay, so here\u0027s why I joined Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Situation\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been living off of scholarship money for the past few years, but that money is about to run out in a few months. (I don\u0027t know exactly when, due to continued administrative miscommunications and adjustments.) When those checks stop coming in, I won\u0027t have that much income between then and graduation, since my accelerated STEM program does not leave me with enough time for a full-time job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many Millennials, I had to move back in with my parents, but with graduation on the horizon and a new-ish long-term significant other, it will soon be time to move back out on my own, especially since the area in which I live does not have many nearby job opportunities for a programmer \u2014 I would have to commute for the better part of an hour every day to get to the city center, but even then, this area ranked in the top ten \u003cem\u003eworst\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0places in the United States to start a new career. That\u0027s\u2026 not good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Can Do\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhenever I end up having spare time, I can produce content! I\u0027ve been thinking about getting into YouTube, but I don\u0027t really have filming equipment, so I suppose that could be a goal for this Patreon, if things go well enough. In the meantime, I could take patron requests for tweets or long-form Tumblr posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a more personal level, the more spare time I have, the more emotional labor I can perform: Checking in on people, talking them through problems with which I have firsthand experience, helping them process through trauma, et cetera. (Obvious legal disclaimer: I am not a therapist! I am not licensed to provide counseling in any way!! It\u0027s strictly just friendly advice!!!!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and since the 2018 election season is coming up, I could potentially campaign for politicians \u2014 preferably DSA, but I could settle for Democrats\u2026 maybe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many possibilities!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Can Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney, obviously. But aside from that, I would love some programming help, since my classes are becoming increasingly difficult. Also, if you\u0027re ever in the Hampton Roads area, let\u0027s hang out! I\u0027m a huge extrovert, so seeing friendly faces gets me through.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really appreciate that you read all this! Please don\u0027t feel bad if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to become a patron! I understand that the economy really sucks right now. Thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cem\u003eLegal disclaimers\u003c/em\u003e: I do not have any trademarks. The \u2122 and \u00ae symbols are purely stylistic. Also, I do not own the images that I used to decorate my reward tiers list, so they should not be considered original content. Finally, all of my advice is strictly personal \u2014 I currently have no relevant professional certifications, and I do not purport to be officially credentialed in any of these fields.)\u003cbr\u003e"
