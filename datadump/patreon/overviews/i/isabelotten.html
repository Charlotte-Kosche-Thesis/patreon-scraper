    "summary": "Greetings, patrons. I\u0027m Isabel, an illustrator with a love for creating weird and wonderful characters and stories for your eyes to enjoy. This patreon page is dedicated to the story of Woeburger, the local fast food joint in the small town of Muck, a place rife with petty crime and violent debauchery and populated by a motley crew of pathetic inbred creatures who gave up on their hopes and dreams long ago. This will hopefully be the longest comic I\u0027ve ever worked on, and a community where you guys can tell me what\u0027s working, what\u0027s funny and what\u0027s not, so I can prune this into the glorious saga it was meant to be. Your donations mean that I can spend my time doing what I want to do, which is draw, and deliver you a hearty comic that will make you chuckle. Any contributions are an incredible help for keeping me creating and I am eternally grateful. I\u0027ll be uploading a double page Woeburger comic weekly, and occasional character pages and drawings in between. (Etsy shop coming very soon stay tuned)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE let me know if there\u0027s anything not right with the page so I can fix it. Thank u!"
