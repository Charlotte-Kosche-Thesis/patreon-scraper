Help so I can grow and learn as an artist, and I\u0027d like to share that with you. As you can see, video making is really not my fort\u00e9, but well such is life. :-) \u003cbr\u003eThe art of playing is crucial in developing skill as an artist - time MUST be available to play with drawings and sketches if one wants to become better. There is no way around it. Your support helps me put part of my work day aside just for that, and in good weather to actually go outside and sketch from life.\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your trust in me, your support, at least once a year (in December) I send you free stuff: cards, a card with an original sketch on it, whatever I\u0027ve accumulated during the year. \u003cbr\u003eAS WELL, you also get a promo code you can use as many times as you wish, good for the whole year, that can be used in my store for anything. It also applies to Ebay auctions on Artist Proof cards (I will apply the code manually). The codes are for 10%, 15%, and 20% off whatever you purchase.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will give me, Drawn and Divided your trust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou are able to refuse at any time either temporarily or permanently.
