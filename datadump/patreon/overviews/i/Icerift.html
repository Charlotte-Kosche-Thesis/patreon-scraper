After all, taking the time to work on \ncommissions or standard work eats away at the time I could be working on\n the series and results in a much longer wait time between episodes. \nThis means that instead of an episode taking a few months to animate, it\n could potentially take a year or more - something that is a bit lengthy\n time-wise.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, however, gives creators the option of turning \nambitious dreams like this into a reality. People like you can chose to \npledge a certain amount of money per month in exchange for various \nprizes (which are listed in my reward tiers), meaning you get something \nout of it and I also have the chance turning my projects into my main \nsource of income so I can actually get them released in a more timely \nmanner if I\u0027m able to focus all my time and energy into it rather than \nother things to get the money needed to survive as a professional artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Webseries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig07.deviantart.net/e5e2/f/2017/145/5/f/darkrevolutionlogosmall_by_iceriftfyera-dbadyz9.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on \"\u003cem\u003eDark Revolution\u003c/em\u003e,\" the first of the two arcs in this series.
