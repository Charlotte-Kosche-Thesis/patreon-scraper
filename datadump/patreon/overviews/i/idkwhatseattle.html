    "summary": "First off: THANK YOU for taking the time to check out IDKwhat. Dozens - \u0026amp; dozens - of Pacific Northwest drag queens thank you, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Jenna St Croix, the founder of IDKwhat - a Seattle-based project designed to do three things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. We want to create profitable platforms for our local drag performers - \u0026amp; other queer artists!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrag is expensive. Did you know that you can work a full-time day-job \u0026amp; still be a starving artist, pinching pennies \u0026amp; living on ramen to pull off your next gig? There are many factors that contribute to the starving artist status quo, \u0026amp; even in the most progressive communities, creating change has all the usual limitations of time \u0026amp; space.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIDKwhat believes that well-paid artists will produce art that is not only just as good as the work they produced at minimal to no compensation, but \u003cem\u003eperhaps even better\u003c/em\u003e. No, \u003cem\u003eprobably\u003c/em\u003e better. No, \u003cem\u003edefinitely better\u003c/em\u003e, \u0026amp; for oodles of reasons. Our goal is to be able to provide our artists production stipends - in addition to a healthy performance fee - offsetting the cost for things like wardrobe, make-up, \u0026amp; props. These funds\u00a0mean that artists won\u0027t have to cut corners on their biggest \u0026amp; boldest ideas. Stipend money will support \u003cem\u003eeven\u00a0more queer artists\u003c/em\u003e: Wig stylists \u0026amp; costume designers will get commissions. Make-up artists will be called in to work their magic. Editing geniuses will be solicited to build tracks \u0026amp; playlists. Dollars will get passed to back-up dancers \u0026amp; stage kittens. Everybody eats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. We want to create platforms for artists \u0026amp; performers who are underrepresented \u0026amp;/or exist at multiple intersections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDrag has\u00a0achieved mounting pop culture success over the last decade - however that mainstream exposure only represents the rainbow-sequined tip of the genderfucking iceberg that is drag. Seattle is lucky to have a rich \u0026amp; complex community of drag performers of all forms, identities, \u0026amp; configurations. We prove that gender isn\u0027t a spectrum; it\u0027s a sandbox.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIDKwhat aims to boost the visibility of trans, nonbinary, \u0026amp; genderfluid artists. Reserving safe \u0026amp; financially profitable spaces for PoC is a privilege as much as it\u0027s a responsibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. We want to deliver all this opulent queer art directly to you. We want to make it easy for you to not only support a local (if not \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0local) scene, but to engage with it on your terms.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are part of our community, too, person with kids \u0026amp; person who has to work in the morning. You are our fam as well, underage person, \u0026amp; person who lives in the suburbs, or out of state, or without dependable transportation. We love \u0026amp; need you, too, person who can\u0027t or won\u0027t attend the show physically due to social anxiety or zero spoons or any other reason that is none of our business. We value you \u0026amp; want to accommodate you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, IDKwhat will post regular content from the local scene, as well as post - \u0026amp; eventually stream - our monthly live show, which kicks off May 11, 2018. As patronage grows, we have a whole series of goals designed to increase profit \u0026amp; opportunity for artists while upping the range \u0026amp; caliber of content for the patron. We want to create \u0026amp; provide a variety of content that allows you to not just see these artists\u0027 works, but to interact with \u0026amp; get to know them. Candid video segments \u0026amp; interviews will give casual patrons a deeper look into individual artists\u0027 process. Higher level patrons will have opportunities to vote their favorite performers into special guest spots/interview segments/webseries \u0026amp; participate in livestream AMAs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut who is Jenna St Croix, though?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJenna is the former fairy godperson \u0026amp; freelance archivist of the Seattle drag scene. (Our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JennaStCroix\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e features over 1,400 numbers from over 100 different shows \u0026amp; events; our drag\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenna_st_croix/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInsta\u003c/a\u003e is thousands of photos deep.) After attending \u0026amp; documenting hundreds of shows, we have been searching for ways to create more \u0026amp; better opportunities for performers \u0026amp; audiences, \u0026amp; IDKwhat is the brainchild of that ambition.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinally:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, thank you, thank you again for reading/watching.
