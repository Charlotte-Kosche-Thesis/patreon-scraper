Thank you for visiting my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Furfur, a latex and alternative fashion model and just a girl who loves to create beautiful imagery. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce images and video on the edge of fetish fashion and all the things from \"real life,\" and I sincerely believe, most of the things we consider as fetish are entirely acceptable and have to take place in our daily lives. It\u0027s too short to limit yourself to anything \u2014 expression, social requirements, thoughts of people you don\u0027t even know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLatex is a marvelous material, which makes any detail look hundred percent better. It works fantastic for photos, working like an instant eye catcher and it works even better for video, where it could show all the shine and play of the light. And it\u0027s just very comfy and pleasurable to wear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere, on \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027d like to talk about all things fetish that has place in my life. I want to share my experience of adding fetish items into your life, from the very beginning, to share thoughts, plans \u2014 everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral moments pushed me to create a Patreon page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to tell you, those who interested in latex and fetish fashion, what is it and why is it good for your \u003cdel\u003ehealth\u003c/del\u003e everyday life;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/imfurfur/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e where I share my work, but you can\u0027t find high res images anywhere, only if asking me. Here\u0027s for all the shy guys who haven\u0027t done it yet \u2014 this is a place where you can find the high res images and things that I haven\u0027t share on my Instagram page.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m spending more and more time and resources to make the pictures look better, trying to update the gear we use for it, and it\u0027s pretty hard to do that without your support. So now, with Patreon page, I hope to invest in more ideas to provide more quality content for you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you, everyone, for supporting my work. Nothing I do now wouldn\u0027t exist without you. I genuinely appreciate it and hope to develop all the ideas and dreams to something very cool. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
