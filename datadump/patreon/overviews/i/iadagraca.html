These characters will be made freely available once completed and can be used in your personal projects if credit is given. The ultimate goal is to stimulate the gamedev scene with quality models for people to use either for testing purposes or their full games, art, or other content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe characters will be made available publicly through .fbx (or other formats depending) and image files (for textures) but Patreon supporters will exclusively get access to the full project folder and all related files like reference drawings and the like.\u00a0The first of these characters will be announced soon. The time frame to complete each model will start at a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon supporters will also get access to\u00a0full-res\u00a0psd files from my personal 2D paintings, drawings and other work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this Patreon expands to ultimately funding a game development project I\u0027m planning, the tiers will be updated to include demo builds and models used in the game. But this is much further down the line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Teirs with drawing/painting requests include PSD files at minimum 3000x3000 resolution and only factor in one character.*\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
