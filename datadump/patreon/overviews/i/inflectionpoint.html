Your support helps them be heard. Thank you!\u003c/div\u003eEvery week I talk with women who have risen to a challenge, stepped up to create change and are ready to tell their stories. Every show offers experiences and ideas you can apply to your own life. And every show costs real money to make--about $1500/episode to be exact, and that is just \"out of pocket\", no profit yet. So your support makes a huge difference!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we launched \u003ca href=\"http://inflectionpointradio.org/\"\u003eInflection Point\u003c/a\u003e in 2015, I\u0027ve interviewed hundreds of world-changing women about their innovative work, their victories and their challenges as leaders. We are at an historic moment for women and power\u2013a true inflection point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron (Matron!), you are part of bringing the voices and views of world-changing women to the ears of everyone! Your contribution is not tax-deductible but it all goes to cover our production costs. This IS how women rise up. Thank you."
