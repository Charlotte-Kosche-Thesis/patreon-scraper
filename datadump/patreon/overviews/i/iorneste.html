I highly encourage everyone to check it out!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat makes this different than any other dragon story? \u00a0Well, in this case Iorneste is a type of dragon called a \"Drac\", and as a rite of adulthood, all Drac must spend 25 years in disguise as a human before they can rejoin their people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is called the First Exile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo it\u0027s a dragon story, about a dragon masquerading as a human, learning how to be a human, and bringing his own unique dragon personality to the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m writing a chapter of the story each week, according to some rules I set up for myself (see the link at the bottom). So far it has worked tremendously! Over 15 chapters have already been written, 400 pages of content, some 120,000 words!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach chapter also includes an original work from a DeviantArt artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m writing this for free on my own time, alongside my full-time job, so this is being done entirely at my expense.\u00a0There are artists to commission, chapters to revise, editors to hire, publication costs, promotion costs, you name it! In fact, we\u0027re talking about a year\u0027s worth of effort, just to publish a single book, in addition to holding down a full-time job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me monthly to keep writing this, as well as other stories in the future, I\u0027d surely appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read the entire story, the work-in-progress at \u003ca href=\"http://www.iorneste.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.iorneste.com\u003c/a\u003e. Please do, and tell me what you think!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n( For a larger discussion of how this all works, see \u003ca href=\"http://www.iorneste.com/how-this-works/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.iorneste.com/how-this-works/\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr\u003e"
