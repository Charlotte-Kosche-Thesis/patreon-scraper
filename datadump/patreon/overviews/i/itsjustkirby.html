They can be accessed under the pen name\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/~itsjustkirby\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u0027itsjustkirby\u0027\u003c/a\u003e on FanFiction.net.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few reasons why I\u0027ve decided that Patreon is the best way to progress with my writing. Firstly, I\u0027d eventually like to write some original content (as well as fanfiction) and attempt to publish and distribute it digitally. \u00a0I\u0027d like to use this service, as well as my FanFiction profile to establish a connection with my readers and to turn my ideas into a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I\u0027d like to pursue writing as a career. I am currently majoring in English at university and would love to use this opportunity to gain experience. I believe that a long running Patreon is a good way to maintain motivation and to hone creative skills that can be applied within my career. I believe that utilizing Patreon will demonstrate my dedication to my work, an ability to meet deadlines and to interact with my readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all else, I love writing. I want nothing more than to one day have the financial freedom to write all of the time. If you think my work is worth the pledge then that\u0027s where the money will go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for allowing me to put a pen to paper, and my dreams to sheets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
