I\u0027ve been doing webcomics for almost ten years now, since 2005. I graduated with a Bachelor\u0027s of Fine Arts in Sequential Art from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2011, and I crowdsourced and self-published three books in 2012, 2013 and 2016. Currently I draw a webcomic, CROSSED WIRES\u003cem\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ethat I post for free on the internet. WOW!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCROSSED WIRES: OUR CURRENT ENDEAVOR\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCROSSED WIRES is a black and white comic about two queer hackers in college who get into cyber-adventures. In a more abstract, English-class-metatextual sense, it\u0027s about growing up with your identity and means of self-expression linked to technology, and how that can affect your real life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt currently updates Mondays and Thursdays on \u003ca href=\"http://crossedwires.irisjay.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://crossedwires.irisjay.net\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s intended to be episodic in nature, with each chapter running about 100-150 pages each. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMONEY: OUR PLANET\u0027S EVIL, EVIL LIFEBLOOD\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDrawing comics is fun, enriching and culturally important, but I\u0027d like to realize more elaborate projects-- new minicomics, new full-length publications, new cool merchandise, and additional time and attention lavished on current projects. In a post-scarcity society, I would be doing this kind of thing already, but since we don\u0027t live in some kind of dope Star-Trek-Earth-style utopia, I have to make sure my bills are paid before anything else. Right now I can reasonably make ends meet through contract work, commissions and occasional conventions and online store sales. I can squeak by, but it\u0027s not ideal. If I had the time and income to focus 100% on comics, I\u0027d really be able to make some magic happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in!

Every Monday and Thursday I\u0027ll be posting a handful of new sketches, process art, deleted scripts, and other things I might be working on. For a minimum of one dollar a month, you can support an independent comics creator, and watch Crossed Wires (as well as whatever other pursuits I might be working on at the time) grow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time and attention! With your help, we can make comics the likes of which no one has ever seen before! COMICS, PERHAPS, THAT MANKIND WAS NEVER MEANT TO SEE. But that\u0027s too bad for mankind, because nothing\u0027s stopping us now! \u003cbr\u003e"
