    "summary": "The\nInventioning Story\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen\nI began working with Jon Anderson in 2007, the journey it would take me on\nwas a mystery at best. At the time, YES was preparing for their\n40th-anniversary \u2018Close to the Edge and Back\u2019 tour, featuring Jon, Chris, Alan,\nSteve and Oliver Wakeman.  All I knew at\nthat time is that we were going to make some great music and that I had free tickets\nto my next YES show.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJon\u2019s\nfirst request for me was to create music for a Chinese-themed project with the\nintent to perform the songs at the World Exposition 2010 in Shanghai. Together\nwe produced some very cool material, but the project was halted when Jon fell\nill in 2008, derailing the planned YES tour as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf\nyou know the history, you know that the remaining members of Yes went on to\ntour without Jon in November of 2008, and after recovering, Jon went his own\nway as a solo artist. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\nJon recovered, we resumed working on new songs.  From the China project to acoustic reworkings of YES tunes\nto meditative pieces\u2026 We created and explored a variety of styles.  Jon asked me to create a song in an\nEthiopian Amharic style and Walking Talking was born.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\nwas during this time that I began to see the possibility of writing songs that\ncould shape the next chapter of Jon\u2019s legacy, and perhaps even the next chapter\nof Yes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nbegan to categorize the works that fit into a more modern, for a lack of a\nbetter term, \u201cprog-rock\u201d style, under the name \u2018Affirmation.\u2019  And in 2012, with one of our best songs\nin mind, I reached out to Jean-Luc Ponty and after listening; he agreed to\nperform on the piece. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nDuring\nthose years, Jon and I had become close friends, talking by phone or Skype\nalmost daily. I spent most of 2013 producing songs for Jon\u0027s next solo\nrelease.  Finally, in November of\nthat year, during one of our conversations and with YES being nominated for the\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame, I discussed the idea of touring with a band that I\nwould put together for us.  Jon\nagreed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nbrought in a manager who met with Jon and within a matter of a few weeks, the\nband plans became a reality.  Jean\nLuc Ponty agreed to join the project and I was asked to be the music director,\nguitarist and producer for the project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nfirst order of business was to choose a name.  We ping-ponged hundreds of ideas and finally agreed on Jon\u2019s\nfavorite: Inventioning.  I\nsecured the rights to the name, and the manager began shopping the band to\nlabels using some of the songs I had been producing. Plans were made for tour\ndates and the filming of a live DVD.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy\nthe end of April, through a series of misunderstandings, my relationship with\nJon came to an abrupt end. Jon and the manager moved on with the foundation we\nhad built, forming the Anderson-Ponty Band, and I was left with Inventioning; a\nproject I had funded and invested everything I had to bring together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nOnce\nI recovered from the blow, I began to realize there was no need to give up on\nmy vision, I even held rights to the name which I had paid for, so eventually I resumed the work of producing the songs I had\nwritten.  I still had all my pieces in place and the original players who had worked on those projects with\nme.  We just needed a new vocalist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy\nthat time, Bridgette Lewis and I had been out performing on a regular basis,\nmostly as a duo but for some band shows as well.  She was the studio vocalist who had sung Jon\u2019s parts on all the original demos\u2026 There\nwas no question, she was the natural choice to be the new lead vocalist of the\nband and she accepted the invitation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAugust\nof 2014 I announced that Inventioning would continue on and we decided to\nrelease a song I had written with Jon entitled \u2018Walking Talking.\u2019 In 2015, we\nheaded to the Oregon Coast to film a music video for our follow-up single,\nwhich was a cover of Chris Squire\u2019s song \u2018Onward.\u2019  Chris passed away on day two of our four day filming trip so\nwe decided to turn it into a tribute and release it on the anniversary of his passing, a year later.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn\n2017, shortly after Yes\u2019s induction into the Hall of Fame, the winds of\nfriendship miraculously cleared the air and reopened the doors of communication\nbetween Jon and I. After a series of emails, Jon and I spoke by phone again for the first time in years and it was just like old times.  The\nfuture remains a mystery\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJon\nhas been busy with Anderson, Rabin, Wakeman, a new studio project and their 50\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;th\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\nanniversary tours.  Meanwhile, I\u2019ve\ncontinued to work on the next Inventioning single, working around my busy schedule as a record producer and in what little spare time\nI\u2019ve had available...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter\nreceiving feedback from you, the fans, it became clear that you wanted to see\nmore than just singles, you wanted the release of a full album and many\nexpressed a willingness to support us so that we could complete what we had\nstarted.  The time is now and it\u2019s\nright for us\u2026 we\u2019re asking for your support to empower us to continue this\njourney.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nnow know that Inventioning is not just our dream, but a dream shared by those\nof you who have stood with us since the beginning and those of you who have\ndiscovered us along the way.  We\u2019ve\ncome this far and with your help, the music of Inventioning will be finished\nand released.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur\nnext single, featuring Jean-Luc Ponty and Oliver Wakeman, is on the verge of\ncompletion. Several more songs are partially finished, and one of our goals is\nto produce a music video to accompany each track; another substantial\nexpenditure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\nsoon as the album is released and marketed, our band is ready to tour, with the\noriginal Inventioning players who were slated to tour with us and Jon Anderson\nin 2014.  We\u2019ve also been honored\nto include the talents of Oliver Wakeman on keyboards. All the logistics are\nin place and we have a big vision for the future. And now, with your help, Inventioning will be everything it was meant to be.  Thank you for joining us on this\njourney!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMichael\nLewis\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCEO of the\nInventioning Band\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nP.S. One of the most\nexciting plans we have now is to host our first annual convention for all our\nPatreon supporters.  It will be in\n2019 at a beautiful lake resort in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho.  More info will be coming for everyone\nwho joins the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
