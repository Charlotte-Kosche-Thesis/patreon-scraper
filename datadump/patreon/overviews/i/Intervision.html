    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eIntervision\nEntertainment is a small group of artists entertaining the world with stories\nthrough the conduits of live events, film, theater and other media.  Together\nunder the guidance of visionaries Ghislaine \u0026amp; Ryan, the Artists and\nArtisans of Intervision are building an artistic community in order to live,\nwork and create impactful, entertaining productions. As we continue to gain\nsupport, we are creating a core group of dedicated professionals, working\ntogether in harmony.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\nare also the first and only Entertainment Company\u2026without a catch phrase.  ;)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd\nmore importantly, we have a plan that inspires us, and we are making it happen.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003ePhase One: Build Support \u0026amp; Local\nAwarenessThis\nis where we are now. We currently tell stories through the mediums of theater,\nfilm, live events and podcasting. Over the last 7 years, we have steadily built\na core group of like-minded Artists \u0026amp; Artisans, whom we lovingly call Muppets,\nas we are greatly inspired by the artistic genius that is Jim Henson.  We have also found (and are looking for more)\nsupport from those who have enjoyed our art: both moral and financial. If you\nlike what you see/hear, please drop a few bucks in our Patreon, and more\nimportantly share our art with the world. \nBecause that\u2019s the goal.  ;)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPhase Two: Intervision House\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\nwill be the first concrete step in building our Community. Many talented Artists\nand Artisans have trouble establishing a career that can support a healthy\nlifestyle without getting \u201clucky\u201d and \u201chitting it big\u201d.  This has practically become a worldwide\naccepted notion; the idea that most performers will be broke or extremely\nwealthy and that there are very few that can truly make a regular income at it.  At Intervision Entertainment, we tend see\nthings from outside the box.  (Wait a\nminute\u2026there\u2019s a box?  lol)  The past few years of creating and producing\nhas inspired us to create a home in which artists live together for the sole\npurpose of making films and shows in a positive and safe environment. As we\ngain more visionary patrons, we will be able to increase the momentum needed to\npay those involved with our projects at a level where they can actually live\noff of their art.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nPhase Three: Intervision Studios\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\nis where we go from a house to a full studio community.  Imagine Universal Studios back in the day\u2026with\nartist bungalows and apartments intertwined amongst the film sets as well as\nthe administrative offices.  Now add a\ntouch of Aloha and treat everyone that works on the show as well as the \u201cstars\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPhase Four : Intervision Arcology\u003cbr\u003e \n\nI\ndoubt any of us that have been part of Intervision Entertainment from its\nhumble beginnings will live to see this phase: going from a self-supporting\nbusiness to a self-sufficient community. That hasn\u2019t stopped us from planning\nit, though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat\u2019s\nan Arcolgy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKQ94DtS54\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKQ94DtS54\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePhase Five: Intervision O\u2019Neill Cylinder\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJust\ngoogle it \u003c/div\u003e\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
