Career Questions. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a follower on YouTube you know that I.T. Career Questions helps answer questions for those whom are looking to get into the Information Technology field. \u00a0On my YouTube channel I spend a lot of time answering and giving tips for career and education questions as well as advice for interview preparation, resume help, and general need to know advice about business environments of the I.T. Field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few area\u0027s where Patreon will benefit us is by providing unseen content for Patreon eyes only, such as:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReal World Business Examples, Scenarios, and Tutorials\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTroubleshooting, dealing with users, day to day examples\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComputer, Server, and Networking Basic Tutorials\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrivate live chats\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrivate Facebook group\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA behind the scenes look into I.T. Career Questions and Zach\u0027s Life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course you will have top priority to asking questions, video requests, behind the scenes, and much more. \u00a0Take a look at the Rewards area for more details.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love creating YouTube videos and answering your questions. \u00a0I truly feel as though my life\u0027s purpose is to help people. \u00a0Just as you all need help with getting into I.T. or learning more about the technologies I need help creating these in depth videos that are always being requested. \u00a0They take time to do and I would love to sit down and take the time to do them right. \u00a0Please consider supporting my work with a dollar(or two) each month so that we can continue this path of learning..\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow this Works\u003c/h2\u003e\nEvery month I will publish Patreon specific content and plan live streams for the tiered members.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease be sure to read each tier to decide which plan might be best for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have questions please feel free to reach out to me and ask!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cdel\u003eI.T.

Baby is well taken care of!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the support that I get from my Patreons goes right back into creating more content. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only do some of the videos that I create take a long time just to make they sometimes take just as long to edit/produce, export, and upload.\u003cbr\u003eI currently have someone that I pay to help edit some of my videos from time to time to help me get caught up with my que. \u00a0I would be able to give her more videos to edit thus be able to publish more videos. \u00a0This would be a huge help to me and a huge benefit to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditional funds go into any equipment, hardware, computer peripherals, audio/video needs that are required to maintain consistent video production. \u00a0These replacements are not needed often but when they are required they are not cheap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the opportunity that I am given to help you. \u00a0Your support is truly appreciated with all of my heart. \u00a0I have stated many times in many of my videos on YouTube that I love doing this and I love to help people. \u00a0My biggest restraint in all of this is always time. \u00a0I have a fiance, 2 girls, and a little boy on the way soon! \u00a0My time is definitely very limited and I am often up very late at night getting videos recorded, edited, and uploaded so that I can help anyone out there who needs it. \u00a0Even if you can\u0027t help support this if I have helped you in some way please at the very least send me an email and say thank you."
