I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eili104\u003c/strong\u003e, a \"self-taught\" (as much as one can say that with the internet available) aspiring illustrator. Since late 2015 I\u0027ve been churning out a painting each week, a tempo I hope to keep. I make digital paintings focusing on characters I like from games and anime. Mostly girls. 99% girls, with the rogue male thrown in at odd times to keep people on their toes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron you help keep me afloat and able to spend the time continuing making art even while life does it best to get in my way..I paint roughly one painting per week, and s a patron you will get access to the full-sized versions of the paintings as well as the original\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePhotoshop\u00a0files. I also post about drawing and painting in general, trying my best to put into words what I\u0027m feeling and thinking about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I paint?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe easiest answer to this would be to just look at what I\u0027ve created before, by googling my name or finding me on DA or Tumblr. I refuse to paint something I don\u0027t feel connected to, and my hope is that we\u0027ll find some overlap between what you enjoy, and what I do. You won\u0027t see me painting Rem from Re:Zero just because it\u0027s a popular character, for example.\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to games I\u0027m deeply into the Fighting Game genre (Street Fighter; Tekken etc.) along with games in general (with a slight Japanese bias). Animewise my taste rarges from Aikatsu! Stars to Berserk, and everything inbetween. I\u0027m also into Touhou and Love Live! among other groups. I enjoy a wide range of artists, leaning towards western 18th-19th century art and the modern Chinese digital masters. I also enjoy many Japanese artists that work within the anime industry. I don\u0027t like to nor do I want to be pigeonholed into one specific style, but rather make a very concious effort to keep all of my paintings apart, trying to make them stand out both in style and quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am no Vofan and definitely no Ruan Jia -- but I feel like I\u0027m making really good progress. It\u0027s  a bumpy ride with it\u0027s ups and downs, but at least I\u0027m moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime however, is running out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince late 2015 I\u0027ve been living in a bubble. That year I finally felt motivated to start drawing again -- after having been burned years back from high school. I told everyone I would become an illustrator but I was too scared to send in any portfolios to any art colleges, and frankly -- the pressure I felt when painting made me nauseous. I never strayed outside of my comfort zone but comforted myself by saying \"well, at least you are putting down the hours!\". Hours doing the same thing over and over, too scared to show to anyone and too afraid of trying anything new. During this time I didn\u0027t really improve at all. No surprises there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring 2016 I decided to put down the time -- I was going to see how far it would take me, and in the middle of the year I said to myself that by 2017 I would start a Patreon. I don\u0027t want pity money, I want you people to feel like you are actually getting something out of the bargain, hence why I waited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year is also the last year I\u0027ll be able to spend the time needed to paint. I\u0027m graduating this autumn, getting my degree in a profession unrelated to art. While I\u0027ve been living in this bubble my life has slowly been moving forward, but I don\u0027t like the direction it is going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0want to paint. I don\u0027t want to become just another face in the crowd. I have no idea how far I can go, or if I\u0027ll ever be satisfied with where I am with my art. But I\u0027d be damned if I went down without fighting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with the bubble bursting I\u0027m looking to get onboard any ship that can keep me doing just that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am \u003cstrong\u003eextremely\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0thankful to the small group of fans I\u0027ve amassed on tumblr, DA, pixiv and instagram. I read all the comments I get and you\u0027d be surprised by how much they motivate me to keep on going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do more for you guys, and this site gives me the opportunity to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
