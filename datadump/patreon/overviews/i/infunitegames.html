It\u0027s almost a compulsion, and if I\u0027m being honest- I\u0027m going to keep making games- even without support. I do it constantly, and often subconsciously. The difference that your support could make is that instead of the prototypes living in my garage, I might actually bring the game to print. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like this to be an interactive community where anyone can chime in. I\u0027ll run ideas by the hive mind, so if you have any input, please don\u0027t hesistate to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very much in the James Earnst (of \n\u003ca href=\"http://cheapass.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheapass Games\u003c/a\u003e) school of thought that I want people to play my games, for me that means prioritizing play over pay. As far as a release strategy I am planning on releasing a free/low cost pdf or self-print version of the BARD system. I\u0027d like to release these to my patrons for free, and before anyone else so you all can provide feedback on the game. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you aren\u0027t interested in giving me money, that\u0027s cool too- You can still chime in as a follower, and I\u0027d love to hear what you think. I still want to share lots of content and work in progress reports, so please follow along if you have any interest in the games I\u0027m working on."
