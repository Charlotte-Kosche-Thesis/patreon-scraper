    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWelcome to the Inner Yoga Revolution!\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s so much more to Yoga than Downward-facing-dog. Millions of people practice Yoga every day around the world, but relatively few are able to enjoy the deep, life-changing fruits of the \u201cinner\u201d practices of Yoga such as meditation, chanting, ego work, and self-inquiry. David Harshada Wagner is on a mission to change this and offer the practice and teachings of Inner Yoga to people all over the world. Inner Yoga practices and teachings are rooted in the mystical tradition of yoga, but presented and taught in a very contemporary and relevant way. Many modern Yoga practitioners are ready to go deeper, to learn more, to root their practice in the traditions of yoga and dive into the next level of personal transformation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe use the term \u201cInner Yoga\u201d but really it\u2019s just traditional yoga. The heavy emphasis on physical postures that we see nowadays is a modern thing. For thousands of years, yoga was known as a deep and personal path to God, to freedom and inner illumination. The physical work is great for many things, but I am super committed to get people into the deep stuff. I\u2019m so excited to see what happens when the wider yoga world embraces Inner Yoga."

Of course, the deep experiences and innermost growth happens in a solitary way, but those movements are best supported when we also have a community or sangha to practice with and be a part of. Traditionally, spiritual communities have teachers, students, and newer members who are just checking it all out. Our community has all of that. Along with David, we have a range of Inner Yoga Teachers, senior students that have been working with David for many years, and all kinds of other people who connect to the teachings and practices and various levels.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this sangha (spiritual community), you will get exclusive content by David Harshada Wagner.
