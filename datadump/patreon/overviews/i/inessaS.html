Similarly, we are living through a time in\nwhich a unipolar world is reluctantly transforming into something new. One tool\nat the disposal of the elite is the manipulation of the media.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInessa\nS, Journalist\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBachelor\nof Arts in Political Science, 1st Class Honours\u003cbr\u003eVictoria University of Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube channel, Inessa S, is for everyone who is interested in being\nable to understand \u003cem\u003eprimary sources\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as well as short docos and features on\nRussia\u2019s foreign policy.

Levels start at $1 and can be\ncancelled at your whim. Sometimes, YouTube\u0027s subscription method can be\nunreliable, but if you sign up via Patreon, you will be notified directly when\nI upload a video.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs I learn more about how Patreon works, I will have content exclusively for Patreon subscribers.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the majority of my content will remain accessible for everyone, not just\nthose who are in a financial position to go above and beyond to help me with\nmy work.

This is because where I produce more content than is standard for me, you don\u2019t get an unexpected amount billed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can change your monthly amount at any time or cancel should you want to.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI currently release 2 to 3 subtitled videos per working week, and about the same over the weekends. It depends on its complexity and the research time taken for the accompanying article.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe videos differ in theme and nature \u2013 some are serious and others are just a bit of fun.
