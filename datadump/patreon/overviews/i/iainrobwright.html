    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eOne of Horror\u0027s most respected authors, \u003c/strong\u003eIain Rob Wright is the writer of \u00a0more than twenty books, many of them bestsellers. A previous Kindle All-Star and a mainstay in the horror charts, he is a prolific producer of unique and original stories. From his apocalyptic saga The Gates to his claustrophobic revenge thriller ASBO, Iain writes across a broad spectrum of sub genres, creating both beloved series and standalone titles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith work available in several languages and in audio, Iain Rob Wright is one of the fastest rising stars in horror, but when not writing he is a dedicated family man. Father to Jack and Molly, and husband to Sally, he is often seen sharing his family memories with his fans on Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA MESSAGE FROM IAIN\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi there reader. Depending on how familiar you are with the current machinations of modern day publishing, you may or may not know that being an author is as hard as it is glamorous (okay it\u0027s not that glamorous--I\u0027m writing this in my pyjamas). Getting a steady income is the holy grail for most authors, and a majority of us spend each month wondering how well we will feed our families in the long term. While I have certainly been luckier than most, I still seek that stability of providing for my family with a predictable income. Patreon facilitates that by allowing my most loyal readers and super fans to help me out with a dollar here and there. It\u0027s not so much the amount that matters, but the \u003cem\u003eregularity\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of it. When sales are good over on Amazon, then life is rosy, but there are lean months too, and it is then that getting a steady stream of income/support from my readers will really help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, it pains me to have to speak of money when the act of writing is such a joy in itself, so all I will say is that you have my gratitude, and by supporting me on Patreon you will truly be helping me to continue doing what I love--providing you all with terrifying reads! :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove Iain\u003cbr\u003e"
