    "summary": "Welcome everyone, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eand thank you for visiting my Patreon site. I\u0027ll tell you about me, my art and what I am doing here on Patreon and what is in it for you. And hopefully, you will become a patron, or at the least check out my music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho am \u00a0I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sander Verstraten and I\u0027m a artist, daddy and husband (And I incidentally also still have a daytime job). My main vice is music: Guitar/Singing and whichever instrument I can program with a computer. But I found that I cannot stick to one kind of art. I\u0027m also very much interested in writing, drawing, 3D animation, video and any kind that pops up in my imagination. As much as the wide range of musical genres I was creating,\u00a0 from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/isleofatlanticdreams/poetry-in-motion\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e mesmerizing sonic landscapes\u003c/a\u003e to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/isleofatlanticdreams/horny-trinity\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e head-banging sing-along tunes\u003c/a\u003e. I want to share my creative horizon and make all kinds of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut to make sure it doesn\u0027t become a disjointed chaos, I want to build all art around a certain universe. And the core will be a story which I will publish in monthly installments.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI came to know Patreon through Amanda Palmer, and never thought it would be something for me. But I want to share my music,\u00a0build an audience and become better at my craft. And besides that; babies are expensive. So I decided that I would go and start a Patreon campaign to support my music making ventures. This way I can release art on a regular basis and stay independent. I make the kind of art I want, the way I want it. And with your investment, I can get the tools to become better and \u00a0better at it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding platform where, unlike platforms like Kickstarter where you pledge a one-time amount for something you get somewhere in the future, you support an artist by pledging a certain amount per month or creation. I set up Patreon as a monthly campaign, so you support me by a fixed amount per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo support me, \u00a0just type in the amount you want to pledge on the left, and \u00a0click the \u0027Become a Patron\u0027 button and follow the instructions on your screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost there is my art. I will release a chapter of the main story each month. And for my patreons there will be exclusives like story boards, lore, character sheets, sketches all the little things that make up a universe.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd occasionally I will ask for your input or suggestions; on what you want to see about the universe-creating-process and maybe even on the story itself. You are my patrons, you invest in me; It\u0027s not just me, we\u0027re doing this together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd remember: You are awesome! \u003cbr\u003eRegardless if you decide not to throw money at me or not: \u003cbr\u003eI am eternally thankful that you took the time to check out my site and my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s a song I did a while ago called \u0027Mental Nourishment\u0027. It\u0027s zombie-themed and it is an admittedly incredibly\u00a0corny video:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e \u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM_2HDbWUPE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
