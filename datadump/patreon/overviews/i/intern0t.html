We want to enable ourselves to do live streaming (in HD) for everyone and for patrons (in particular) as well. Currently, we have begun a pilot streaming project that you can follow for free on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting us, we will not only be able to afford better recording and processing equipment, possibly a faster Internet connection to stream in Full HD in the near future, green screen(s) for camera streams, \u00a0but also physical tools such as different software defined radios (SDR), that we would like to do videos about as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEthical hacking is not just about client/servers, it\u0027s about all the things that can be hacked, either to do unintended actions or to be improved. We believe that free material about ethical hacking lacks quality generally speaking, and we wish to improve upon that to train the next generation of professional and ethical penetration testers. (A penetration tester is an ethical hacker that typically \"hacks for a living\".)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur team is made up of experienced ethical hackers / penetration testers, who want to do more than just test and improve systems that we test. We want to educate and train those who desire to become a hacker.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the video above we demonstrated how to find unknown vulnerabilities in a SEO application.\u003cbr\u003e"
