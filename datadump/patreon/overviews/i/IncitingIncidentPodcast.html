The blog goes hand-in-hand with the podcast, but discusses issues on a more immediate level. She\u2019s used it recently as a way to shine light on the everyday experience of a transperson on a personal level as well as societal. Her book was recognized in newspapers such as \u003ca href=\"http://www.thedp.com/article/2017/02/college-senior-writes-trump-book\"\u003eThe Daily Pennsylvanian\u003c/a\u003e. She won a 2014 Keystone Award for Excellence in Journalism and won the 2015 Audience Choice Award for her film \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DosOKXMvpk\"\u003ePermanent Solution\u003c/a\u003e, focusing on the struggles of suicide survivors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn activist in the LGBT community, she\u0027s focused on being present to help with difficult questions to personalize and rationalize the issues that transpeople face. She was cast in two different productions of The Vagina Monologues, and was the first-ever transgender person in 17 years to appear in UPenn\u2019s V-Day production of the show. Marissa\u2019s main goal is to bring awareness and visibility to all LGBT people, especially those marginalized within the transgender community because of the recent bathroom bills attacking their rights to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarissa has been lovingly nicknamed \u201cThe Purple Amazon\u201d for her bright purple hair, \u201cSuperqueer\u201d affectionately for her openness about her identity and sexuality, and most notably, \u201cthe badass mistress of the podcast and written word universe\u201d by the fine people at \u003ca href=\"http://utahoutcasts.com/utah-outcasts-85-marissa-mccool/\"\u003eUtah Outcasts\u003c/a\u003e. She graduated the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 and now attends postgrad at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0",
