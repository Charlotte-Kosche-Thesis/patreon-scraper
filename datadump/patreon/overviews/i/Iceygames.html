Jonathan Wedge, or rather JW, is a character I\u0027ve created for the game I\u0027m currently working on and he even has a blog of his own in real life! I try my best to keep things lively around there by posting new JW artwork, collaborations done between me and other artist, and other nice tidbits which include updates about the comic I\u0027m working on, which is about JW himself and his life leading up into the game, Guardian of Light.\u003cbr\u003eSee more here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jonathan-wedge.tumblr.com/\"\u003eJW Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Game?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fbos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21950057_1410464729049547_4808671859514641301_o.png?oh=bb5824fb2f3c103af9c7265625bd6a2b\u0026amp;oe=5AB165EE\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuardian of Light is a JRPG I\u2019m working next to the JW comic.\u003cbr\u003eYou play as the lead man Kaito accompanied by his friends Satomae, Gorden, and J.W. as they get caught on a grand adventure into the depths of the earth in search of a mysterious man.
