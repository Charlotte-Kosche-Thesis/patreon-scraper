    "summary": "The reason for this Patreon page is simply to keep IVM going and encourage future albums to be released down the line. In this market and economy it is tough to keep producing quality art without going completely broke. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a ton of costs associated with running the IVM website and the label most of which has become a slight burden on my family.\u00a0This is why I am taking a unique path and offering quality product in return for your contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a little bit more about IVM and what I have planned this year:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndie Vision Music begin in the year 2000 as an independent online Christian music store. Slowly over time it has morphed into different forms like a record label and in 2005, a webzine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site has been consistent over the past 18 years with sharing hope and Faith without jamming it down people\u0027s throats. My goal has always been to be non confrontational and share hope from a loving perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 Indie Vision Music began digitally releasing albums again from variety of punk rock artists. Toward the end of last year, the first CD released by IVM in 10 years came out and it was by the band Available At The Counter (Australia).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2018, the 2nd CD was released which was called the \"Family \u0026amp; Friends Sampler 1\". It featured a variety of bands of all styles and sharing a common bond of Faith. The CD is printed on a Eco-Jacket and is full color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn March 30th we released Light The Way \"False Memory Syndrome\" which is the first pop-punk full length CD by IVM released in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBig plans are in store throughout 2018 and beyond. We are happy to be working with these bands who each will be putting out positive new albums in the next few months:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLight The Way, Must Build Jacuzzi, Mainframe, The Prettybads, No Lost Cause, Grandpa Loves Rhinos, Small Wars, Heart Like War, and Pleading Guilty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so pleased to offer you each quality recordings and positive outlet for music of substance. It is my hope that you\u0027ll join with IVM in helping to further the mission of reaching others with this hopeful message of Faith, Hope, and Love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Brandon Jones\u003cbr\u003eOwner/Founder\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.indievisionmusic.com\"\u003eIndie Vision Music\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
