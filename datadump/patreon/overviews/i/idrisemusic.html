People who understand the struggle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFull disclosure moment: To give you deeper insight as to why I started this Patreon account... I\u0027ve spent roughly $12k a year for the past 7 years straight, in order to get to the level I have gotten to today; and I have made back about 5k of that $80k+ so this has bee na marathon investment. Over half of that money was cash from my bonus money and all the extra money I had, so I had to pay bills on credit, with interest. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA major deal would have a 1/4 to 1/2 million to make it happen, but all of it has to be paid back (recoupable) and your percentage of earnings from revenue are usually under 5% \u00a0as an unproven talent, then you have 15-20% of that going to management and 10% going to an agent; and if you have no control over your career because the label is running it, you can be in debt to them forever, and be shelved, like so may artists are.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIndependently, I have gotten me quite far, and I am closer than ever now that I am in LA working with some of the greatest talent in the industry! That too is not free.... And I fully believe that the investment will pay off and I\u0027ll be just fine, which is why I left the military and moved to LA and hit the ground running! I just spent $12k on the production of 3 singles that I am releasing this year! I still haven\u0027t shot a video or done promo for them! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSounds crazy, but it\u0027s all gonna work out, I can feel ittttttt!
