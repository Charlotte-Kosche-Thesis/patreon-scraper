IN A LANDSCAPE celebrates both classical music and the Oregon outdoors in experiences that are accessible to all Oregonians, regardless of economic status, political affiliation, education or age.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHISTORY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the spirit of the Works Progress Administration\u2019s Federal Music and Theatre Projects, which presented thousands of free concerts and plays in theaters, public spaces and parks across the country during the Depression, IN A LANDSCAPE has produced two seasons of free/donation based concerts in public lands across Oregon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the 2016 inaugural season, IN A LANDSCAPE presented Hunter Noack and guests in nine classical music concerts at WPA sites, city, state, and regional parks within 75 miles of Portland, Oregon. The donation-based reservation system was made possible by funding from the Regional Arts and Culture Council and local philanthropists. Every concert of the ten-day series was sold-out before the first show began. Over 1000 people from at least 3 countries, 8 states, 13 Oregon counties and 34 Oregon cities made reservations, doubling the expected attendance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, the series expanded to 14 concerts presented in every region of Oregon and three in Southern Washington, to an audience of over 2000. The concert set-up became more efficient after Jordan Schnitzer bought a Steinway concert-grand piano for the project and a new means of transportation was invented specifically to take the piano to remote, off-road locations. A Creative Heights grant from Oregon Community Foundation, along with smaller grants won with local partner organizations, provided the means to offer 12 of the 14 concerts for free/donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe National Parks Service, Oregon State Parks, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, Confluence Project, Hood River Performing Arts Initiative, Eugene Symphony, Portland Chamber Orchestra, the Nez Perce, Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla Tribes, and many others have provided in-kind support, waving fees, and helping to market IN A LANDSCAPE events throughout their networks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIN A LANDSCAPE has been featured in printed and digital press throughout the state including Oregon Public Broadcasting\u2019s (OPB) television show ArtBeat (airs February 15, 2018), the Baker City Herald, Klamath Falls\u2019 Herald \u0026amp; News, OPB\u2019s State of Wonder, Portland Monthly, and Hood River News. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
