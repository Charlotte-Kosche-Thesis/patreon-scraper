I deeply research my topic, and am always open to engage in debate with readers, or hear from experts in the field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an independent writer is a financially precarious proposition. Journalism rates have been under relentless pressure, as many people with day jobs are prepared to write for free, and some of them are good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo remain independent, without undue influence from companies or lobby groups, and have the time to interact with readers, I need a new, consistent funding model. Many people have proved willing to donate when I needed it in the past, and I\u0027m forever grateful to have such a wonderful readership. Now, I turn to this same free market to ask for a small monthly payment if you think my work is worth supporting. I\u0027ll leave the amount up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll continue arguing for freedom, in politics, business and our daily lives. Freedom is a hard-won thing, and it is easily eroded. The least one can do is speak up when it is under threat.\u003cbr\u003e"
