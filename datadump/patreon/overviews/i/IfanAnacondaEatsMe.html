That\u0027s me in the photo. Dirty after days of camping and climbing with no shower. \u00a0Sweaty and totally exhausted, but internally elated upon reaching the highest point on the four day Inca Trail Trek to Machu Pichu last year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a 57 year old mother and grandmother. \u00a0I am a newbie hiker \u003cem\u003e(what kind of crazy person STARTS to hike at 54??)\u003c/em\u003e, hot yoga addict, gardener, from scratch cook and baker, organic and small farm supporter, adventurous eater \u003cem\u003e(think tasting termites in the Trinidad rainforest and street food in every country visited\u003c/em\u003e) and traveller..... \u00a0Boy do I love travel....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA this point, the changes of a lifetime are hitting me all at once like a tidal wave. \u003cem\u003e(Although I am definitely at the age - \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethat\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e change of life isn\u2019t the change that I am talking about here \u003c/em\u003e\ud83d\ude33\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e Divorce and dating, house purchases, renovations and sales. Three moves with all the packing and unpacking that is entailed. My very first solo trip behind me and another looming in just days. Changes in employment.  A mountain of activity in three short years, but there you have it - that\u2019s life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are many ways to navigate and make sense of the challenges that life throws at us. Mine seems to be to write about it. I\u2019ve been doing this really informally for years. Journals, junky bits and pieces of word processing that have disappeared on old hard drives, floppy discs and CDs. Many, many years of academic writing. Then of course all of the emails from my travels. And from my last trip - postings on Facebook. I can\u2019t imagine ever stopping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, this is where YOU come in\u2026.\u003c/strong\u003e I seem to have a tiny community of people who enjoy my writing. People who have said that they live vicariously through me and my \u201cvacations\u201d. People who have requested that I keep writing about my travels and posting them for consumption. This is a fortunate thing for me and when I see an opportunity on the horizon, there is always that irresistible pull to jump at it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eLuckily, I found Patreon, this awesome community space where people can display their creative work, get feedback from their readers and get paid for doing it!! \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eA small dedicated group of people who decide that my work is worth just five dollars a month builds the required space. \u003c/strong\u003ePrecious chunks of creative time where I don\u2019t have to do Tech work to put a roof over my head and food on the table. Needed funds that help to pay for the train fare from Varkala to Chennai. That pay for the \u201c\u003cstrong\u003ehovel\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d that will house me overnight \u003cem\u003e(to borrow from Carol\u2019s description of my usual accommodation style and NO that\u0027s not a typo - its not hotel)\u003c/em\u003e. That pay for the unrecognizable and unpronounceable item of food that I just picked up from a street vendor in Khota Bharu. Most importantly, help to pay for the really expensive part - the plane fares to Addis Ababa and beyond. I get that you wouldn\u2019t be caught dead doing the kind of travel that I do, but if you enjoy reading about it\u2026. think...   \u003cstrong\u003eIs it worth the cost of that one latte in your hand each month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI will be starting with manageable chunks. My usual travelogue type entries. On a slightly longer than two week trip to Peru last year, I managed to post 15 articles and a whack of photos. \u003cem\u003e(For those of you unfamiliar with the technical laboratory term\u2026 a whack is a whole lot of something \u003c/em\u003e\ud83d\ude09\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e Since these have been available to my Facebook friends, I will make some of them public and available to all. This will give you an idea of what to expect from me. I am anticipating that many new articles will continue to flow this trip. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis time it\u2019s a four month journey through Africa starting with an attempt to summit Kilimanjaro. Follow me as I explore. From Tanzania to a Diani beach break to recover from the strain of Kili. Then on to Nairobbery (Nairobi, Kenya) as I start a Safari, then a Gorilla Trek in Uganda, travels through Rwanda, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana. Then a bus ride through Namibia where I will spend two weeks as a medical volunteer at a tiny clinic close to the Angola border. I will end my journey with a week in Cape Town that includes a caged great white shark dive. My plans are somewhat loose and flexible. I have a few things pre-booked. But you never know what or who you will encounter and that determines what I will get up to while I am there. It\u2019s all one big adventure, so join me if you dare\u2026\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI also plan to continue with my periodic blurbs of writing. Opinion pieces or editorials if you will. Topics as widespread and eclectic as my tastes. Little side servings to round out the meal. I will be including some pieces on my chosen profession of Medical Laboratory Technology. It\u2019s a love/hate relationship that started when I was just seventeen in my first year of college. Who knew that all this time later - more than thirty-five years working on and off in the profession - I would still be at it. And after that four months of vacation, when back-to-work time hits, there are new professional adventures on the horizon and many more far off lands that are calling. I foresee loads of material/topics for writing\u2026..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOne final area that I may or may not include is a book that I\u2019ve started to write. The scale of this project is overwhelming and being the perfectionist that I am, I\u2019m not sure that any of it is ready for public consumption. But, never say never - while I continue to plug away at the task, snippets for feedback may just escape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHey, maybe in the end you\u2019ll say \u201cdon\u2019t quit your day job\u201d and that\u2019s OK - you can opt out at any time. But HA, I guess the joke\u2019s on me because it\u2019s too late - I already did \ud83d\ude01 \u003cem\u003e(and for those of us who have spent our lives working weekends, holidays, evening and night shifts and middle of the night callbacks in the healthcare industry\u2026. we all know how treasured a \u201cday\u201d job is) \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo there you have it. Start by checking my public posts. And of course, very soon you will find stories of my African journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBetam ahmesugenalew.\u003cbr\u003e\nDehna hun or hugni. \u003cbr\u003e\n(for now\u2026.)\u003cbr\u003e"
