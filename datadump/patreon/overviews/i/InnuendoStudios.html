You might know me best from YouTube videos such as \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmTUW-owa2w\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThis Is Phil Fish: A Case Study in Internet Fame\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxVDOc-oV8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThings of Beauty: Super Smash Bros. as Spectator Sport\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y8XgGhXkTQ\u0026amp;list=PLJA_jUddXvY62dhVThbeegLPpvQlR4CjF\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhy Are You So Angry?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a six part series about angry gamers and harassment. These were all posted on my channel, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5fdssPqmmGhkhsJi4VcckA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInnuendo Studios\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter wrapping a successful Kickstarter in 2014, I got to treat Innuendo Studios as a job, clearing some freelance work off my plate and releasing videos at a semi-regular clip. But Kickstarter money doesn\u0027t last forever, so Patreon is our shot at keeping the channel going indefinitely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, I\u0027m assuming you know the basics of how Patreon works. (Just in case: think of Patreon as a subscription to my work. You pledge to throw a few dollars at me each time I release a video. If enough people make that pledge, I can afford to keep making them on the regular.) What I will tell you is that making these videos is the best job I\u0027ve ever had. No matter what, I\u0027m going to keep releasing videos as long as I feel I have things to say and there are people interested in hearing them. Just how often that is will be up to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s talk goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight Now: Part-time Job\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt $800 per video, I can afford to keep the ads turned off on YouTube, no matter what. Between rent, bills, and student loans, I still can\u0027t promise any kind of regular schedule, but the videos will be making enough to justify making time for them whenever possible. This is the point where I can guarantee that Innuendo Studios isn\u0027t going anywhere. But it could be more if:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $1600 Per Month: Career\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis would cover rent, food, bills, basic cost of living, and maybe, now and again, a few hundred bucks in the savings account. I\u0027d clear most freelance work from my schedule - just the stuff I can fit around Innuendo Studios. Bare minimum, 10-15 minutes of content would come out every month. This would also pay for additional things like written pieces (\u003ca href=\"http://www.unwinnable.com/2013/09/06/finding-myself-in-resonance/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edid you know I do some writing?\u003c/a\u003e). For the time being, this would be my job, and I\u0027d get to keep working the best job in the universe!\u003c/del\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $2400 Per Month: Media Empire\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is shooting the moon and I\u0027m not entire sure what happens here, but at this point Innuendo Studios could be a real... thing. Which means it could ramp up and branch out. We could boost the production values, start a podcast, give lectures at conferences, and who knows what else! I\u0027d run some polls with the backers to see what things interest them, and we\u0027d go from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get In Return\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e$1 patrons will get the videos a day early. $5 patrons will get access to annotated versions of the videos (several of which already exist). And $10 patrons will get access to the Behind the Scenes blog where I talk shop about how the videos get made, what\u0027s in production, and as much data and observation about crowdfunding as I can manage - hopefully this will be useful to anyone thinking of running a crowdfunding campaign themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou would also get my deepest, sincerest thanks. Like, seriously, if you help keep this channel alive, you\u0027re on my list of rad people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s see if we can make the magic happen!\u003cbr\u003e"
