But her wish would never be granted. Due to a cursed necklace that she can never remove, Idriss\u2019 people have banished her to the outskirts of the forest with only her father to keep her company. One day she and her father are visited by a mysterious stranger, a boy who would unwittingly destroy the life Idriss\u2019 father had so desperately salvaged for his daughter. \u003cbr\u003eNow caught in the middle of a galactic war between monsters, gods, and magicians; Idriss must learn to harness her curse in order to survive. The question is, can she accept this part of her that destroyed any chance of a normal life? Or will she succumb to it, and let the entire galaxy fall with her?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e. . . . \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntrigued?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Meaghan Nelson and I\u0027m writing the Infinity Cycle. The Infinity Cycle is a science-fiction and fantasy novel series filled with magic, gods, aliens, and monsters at every turn. The books are centered around the main character Idriss as she travels through space and tries to survive a galactic war while being hunted by demonic monsters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I am planing on making this a series that lasts over five books, I am currently in the middle of book one and it is nowhere near ready to become a hardcopy novel. However, that is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site\u0027s main purpose is to give you early access to the book, as well as allow you to influence the very story itself! Whether or not you become a patron (which will allow you access to the full story as well as artwork, more influence, and background information) your opinions matter. In the comments you can give feedback on your thoughts, good \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e bad. If you see any plot holes or see any twists before they\u0027re ready let me know! That way once the story is published it will be the very best it can be and it will be thanks to you! Even if you don\u0027t want to become a patron and have access to all that I have to offer, take a moment to read the first couple of chapters and put in your opinion in the comments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of reading, the first twenty chapters are completely free!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
