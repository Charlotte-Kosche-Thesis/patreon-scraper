I write a surreal fantasy world called Arcadia, and an ancient history setting called Calista, and do concept art for both.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn my worldbuilding journey, I have made a ton of awesome friends, and had a ton of great experiences. I was also lucky enough to recently work my second year at my college art and lit mag as their Production Editor, and got a real taste for the professional world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe point of this patreon \u003c/strong\u003eis simple. From now on, this website is going to act as a central hub for all of my work. Art, writing, anything else, it will be posted here.\u00a0 Exclusive content like longform fiction and personal artwork will be posted under a paywall of one (1) dollar. That\u0027s it. Everything. Anything that relates to WorldAnvil will be uploaded for free there, and linked here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo, you ask. What are the pledges for? Just \u003cem\u003ewhat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is your money going towards?\u003cbr\u003eWell, to be frank, doing all this is a lot of work.... And while it is my greatest joy in this beautiful world, spending all this time on WorldAnvil and personal projects is just not something I can afford. I am moving in the next 5 months and need to be able to pay for a cross country road trip, and I\u00a0 just won\u0027t have the time to do this stuff if I get a full time job. Granted, that is definitely an option, but freelance is working out for me pretty well, so I want to stick with it\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, in short,\u003c/strong\u003e your pledges go to helping me support myself while I work. They help me manage my discord server (which you can join here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/5C4zSvv\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/5C4zSvv\u003c/a\u003e ) and bot hosting, and everything else.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAny\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and all pledges are deeply appreciated. And in return, for literally any amount, you get all premium content, a server role, and everything you need to stay up to date on my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGodspeed, and happy writing,\u003cbr\u003eAlice\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA little bit about the server!\u003c/h3\u003eIllux of Vidalia is a paragraph style roleplay server, with an emphasis on writing and worldbuilding separate from RP. We are a small, tight knit community of authors, creators, artists, and friends, who value their creative freedom above all else. The server is free for \u003cem\u003eanyone\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to join, but donors get a special rank to flaunt, and skip a portion of the leveling system. There will be more rewards soon as the server grows, and as Patreon does.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA little about WorldAnvil.\u003c/h3\u003eFound at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.worldanvil.com,\"\u003ehttps://www.worldanvil.com,\u003c/a\u003e WorldAnvil is a POWERFUL, intuitive tool for authors, worldbuilders, and roleplayers to organize their worlds and characters. Its free accounts are simple but robust, and offer plenty of tools for writers like myself to use. It has premium accounts, which are bought through their patreon (found here \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/worldanvil/posts\"\u003ehttps://www.worldanvil.com\u003c/a\u003e ), that have even more awesome features, like custom CSS themes for your worlds, and so\u00a0 much more. The community is \u003cem\u003eincredible\u003c/em\u003e. I have never seen a more responsive and excited community of writers in my life. Their discord server can be found on their patreon page, so on and so forth.\u003cbr\u003eMY WorldAnvil page can be found here:\u00a0https://www.worldanvil.com/author/ich0rous\u00a0"
