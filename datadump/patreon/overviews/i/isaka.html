    "summary": "Welcome! I create drawings, paintings, and murals that educate, inspire, commemorate, and document the African American and African Diaspora peoples. My art can be confrontational sometimes, even controversial, as it is based on the rare perspective of my life experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my early years in rural Texas, my work is buttressed by my personal activism and involvement in some of the most \nsignificant movements and groups of the \u002760s and \u002770s: the Student \nNonviolent Coordinating Committee, Black Arts West Repertory Theater, \nthe Black Panther Party, and Nation of Islam. Amiri Baraka (LeRoi \nJones), Kwame Toure (Stokely Carmichael), Bobby Seale, Emory Douglas, Ed\n Bullins, John Lewis, and Julian Bond were among my friends and \nassociates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my patron here on Patreon, you\u0027ll be supporting works in progress, including the production of a calendar of Black history featuring my art; the completion of drawings, paintings, and sculptures for exhibit; and other projects. In the past few years, my overhead costs have risen quite a bit; your help will make it possible for me to keep up with these increases and meet other needs, such as studio assistance and photography. Patrons will share in the fruits of my work, including reproductions in card and print formats and spreads from the calendar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art ranges from still life to landscapes to nudes\u2014people of many \nraces, cultures, and walks of life\u2014infused with a spirit that declares a\n sheer joy of creating. With representational, figurative formats, I use color, line and form\n to engage the viewer with lively and unpredictable adventures. Among my most notable achievements are murals \ncreated over a 53-year span, including those documented in the books \u003cem\u003eCommunity Murals: The People\u2019s Art\u003c/em\u003e (Alan Barnett, 1984) and \u003cem\u003eWalls of Heritage, Walls of Pride\u003c/em\u003e  (Prygoff \u0026amp; Dunitz, 2000). My last project, a public art commission called \u003cem\u003eHoney In The Bee Ball\u003c/em\u003e, took six years to complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current work includes a suite of new paintings and drawings centered on portraits of family members, friends, and historical figures and narratives. My most ambitious project now is a calendar featuring my original art and information of interest to the art lover who recognizes the value of history and contemporary life rendered by visual artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my active studio life, I also spent more than 40 \nyears teaching art and Black Studies, retiring in 2006. As a professor of art, I taught drawing, figure drawing, mixed-media drawing, figure painting and mural painting. I plan to share my process with my supporters, including research, preparatory sketches, drawings, and studies. Potential future projects include offering a drawing tutorial and allowing patrons to share their work with me for constructive feedback.\u003cbr\u003e"
