Once enrolled, we continue to support them the way we did in high school, not by holding their hands and leading the way, but by reminding them of the relationships they initiated and built and of the resources that they made available to themselves: skills of a successful college student that they\u2019ve already practiced! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCurrently, this program supports 500 PUSD graduates.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Investment in Action\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCare Packages:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Who doesn\u2019t like getting packages and cards in the mail?

Workshops are governed by alumni input, and our alumni play a vital role in modeling successful college student traits and skills when sharing information and experiences. Incoming freshmen are able to get answers to their questions from and voice their concerns to alumni, who came from the same high schools they attended. This summit is as much for the incoming freshmen as it is for our alumni, who enjoy the opportunity to give back to their community and who are in different stages of college persistence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e$5/month from 100 patrons = hosting Summer Summit\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIHC BFF:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e If you want to have a huge impact, simply support our alumni program with a sustained gift.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e$20/month from you = sky\u0027s the limit!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout College Access Plan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCAP was founded in 2006 by two educators, Mo Hyman and Kathleen Parent, who wanted to address a gap in college knowledge and matriculation among low-income and first-generation college-going students in Pasadena\u2019s public schools.
