My award-winning website \u003ca href=\"http://www.irishamericancivilwar.com\"\u003ewww.irishamericancivilwar.com\u003c/a\u003e was established in 2010 and has grown into one of the longest running and most extensive history blogs in Ireland. The\u00a0core principal of the site is to make large-amounts of original research freely available to as wide a community as possible, something in which I have invested heavily\u2014both in terms of finance and time. Today the site contains hundreds of articles and resources relating to Irish in 19th Century emigrants. I want to continue this work in the years to come, and to develop new and innovative ways of telling the remarkable tale of the Irish experience.\u00a0Your support as a patron is crucial to maintaining my work on the Irish during the era of the American Civil War, and together we can bring more and more of these remarkable stories to light.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe invaluable support of Patrons will assist in covering the running costs of both the website and research, without which I would not be able to create new content and resources. Every donation is important, and in return \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons will receive access to exclusive Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e. In addition, you will be enabling me to pursue major new projects, one of which will be the production of an eBook series examining the American Civil War on an Irish county-by-county basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmerican Civil War County eBook Series:\u003c/strong\u003e I have long wanted to produce a series of eBooks developed on an Irish county-by-county basis. These short books will aim to highlight not only the major players from each county, but seek to tell the stories of some of the ordinary emigrants who were caught up in the American Civil War. Each eBook will tie these individuals to the wider story of emigration from their county and examine the new communities they established in the United States. In this way, the series will further highlight the immense impact of the American Civil War on Irish people in this period. The intent is to make each completed eBook available for a small fee; Irish Legion Level Patrons will be granted free access to each on completion, and be acknowledged in the eBook itself. A minimum of one eBook will be produced a year."
