This is the best way to help support my ever growing quest to become the greatest content creator of all time! Or at least be able to buy food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Chris Hodgkinson. I\u0027ve been creating content in various forms since I was but a wee lad in school. Over the years I have grown my YouTube channel to the point where I am able to reliably cover video game related content, industry news, and provide entertainment for the masses through editorial or let\u0027s play content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sS1e9Zv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from creating videos I have also done a variety of freelance work for various websites such as GameWatcher, BagoGames and plenty others. I currently work full time at a virtual reality arcade for my general income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI received formal training at Lethbridge College to receive a diploma in Digital Communications. Alongside that I have experience working in both the news and entertainment industry as a radio host in British Columbia, Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo games however have always been my topic of choice. I rejoice in the content I can produce and greatly enjoy being able to be a part of the industry in any form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I spend most of my time covering PC games and industry related news. Everything from AAA titles to the dirty underbelly of Steam has a home on my channel. Most content comes in the form of live impressions along with a few pre-produced videos popping up when I feel extra-creative, or just can\u0027t formulate my thoughts on the fly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lYglCir.jpg\"\u003eMy goal through Patreon is to be able to use this revenue stream to fund my online activities. This revenue goes toward buying games I did not receive code for, new equipment to create better content, et cetera. Basically by supporting me here, you ensure I can cover more games and make better things for your eyes and ears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge reward tiers are kept to a minimum as honestly, there are many other things that need your money. Cheetos are a good example. You will get Discord server benefits though if that\u0027s your thing. I don\u0027t lock chat privileges behind Patreon, so anyone can still contact me at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also get a completely useless loot box of trading cards that have my face on them, so there\u0027s that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me I would be very grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Chris Hodgkinson\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
