    "summary": "Dear Listeners,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you all know, we\u0027re Nish Weiseth (Cosmopolitan, The BBC, Deseret News) and Amy Sullivan (TIME Magazine, Yahoo News, New York Times). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we make up the podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/impolite-company/id1297849796?mt=2\u0026amp;uo=4\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImpolite Company\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe chose the name\u00a0\u003cem\u003eImpolite Company\u003c/em\u003e because the rules of etiquette say that you\u0027re not supposed to talk about either politics or religion in polite company--presumably because those two topics can get people a little riled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut if this is where being polite has gotten us, friends, it\u0027s clearly not working. \u003cbr\u003eCLEARLY.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis show, the content we deliver, the commentary we thoroughly research is for YOU. We want you to better understand the intense beliefs, positions, and feelings that move and divide us all at this critical moment in our history. We try to provide you with as much context and perspective as we can--we sit down with journalists, religious leaders, and political figures to talk through difficult subjects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re diving into conversations that nobody else is having with the depth and nuance that no one else is providing.\u003c/strong\u003e These discussions are important, and the way we have chosen to deliver them to you is resonating with \u003cem\u003ethousands\u003c/em\u003e of people the world over.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal. We love what we do. \u003cstrong\u003eWE LOVE IT.\u003c/strong\u003e We will continue to do it no matter what. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut at the end of the day, podcasting costs us money. More than we anticipated. Creating \u003cem\u003eImpolite Company\u003c/em\u003e requires production costs, web hosting costs, our time, and other expenses. Aside from our lovely and hard-working producer, Constantine, it\u0027s just us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re it. We don\u0027t have a team of people, we don\u0027t have assistants. We asked, but our pets have proven to be no help whatsoever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s just us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo our costs aren\u0027t that enormous, since we\u0027re not paying a bunch of people to do the work for us, but we do have some overhead. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when it comes to making money for your work on the internet, there are two models: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. You can acquire advertising\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0-- you\u0027re beholden to advertisers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. You can offer membership\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0-- the people who listen have the opportunity to buy in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWe\u0027ve entertained the idea of going after advertising, especially after we were approached by a couple of ad networks. But at the end of the day, we would rather give the influence to help us shape the show to you -- the people who choose to listen to us every week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe people who willingly choose to listen to Nish scream into the void about Donald Trump. (We\u0027re not na\u00efve, that takes some commitment.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can donate as little as $1 a month. Or you can give us $100 a month. Whatever you\u0027re comfortable with and whatever you can do to support the show is a huge help and it goes a long way.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll always be up front with you about where the money is going--what our costs are and how we\u0027re using it--so that you can trust that every dollar is being used wisely. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd if all you can give is $1, we\u0027ll take it!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Your support will not only help us cover our costs, but will allow us to travel for interviews, attend events where we can have conversations on a live stage, and expand our content in really creative ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e(Another great thing you can do is subscribe to the show and get others to subscribe, too! Or take it a step further and give us a rating on iTunes.)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so thankful for you, our listeners. We hope you\u0027ll consider supporting the show financially so that we can expand the reach and work of \u003cstrong\u003eImpolite Company\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYours,\u003cbr\u003eNish \u0026amp; Amy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
