    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be creating maps using drone photography for RPG and table top games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese maps will be in two main formats. One will be square, useful for online VTT such as Roll 20. The other format will be 4x6, which is the common size of a tabletop map for miniature games such as Warhammer 40K. For those of you wanting to print out your maps \u003ca href=\"http://dmdavid.com/tag/how-to-print-map-graphics-as-battle-maps-using-free-software/\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e is a good website that shows you how to print out maps easily with free software. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love role-playing games, photography, video games, miniatures, drones, board games, cinematography, and tabletop games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have\u00a0for many years tried to make all of my various hobbys coexist, yet they have always seemed to be completely different sides of my life. I looked for a way to combine them into a single endeavor, to have them complement each other. I believe this Patreon will help me do that. I will be creating realistic maps for RPG and Tabletop Games using these hobbys and the skills I have learned over the years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering to support me, and helping the creativity of all who are on Patreon. My current goal is to do one map per week, and I will let my patrons know if there will be any change to that schedule.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I understand the appeal of a theater of the mind approach, I am a big fan of using maps in my games (I play a lot of D\u0026amp;D). To me a battle map adds a sense of realism, a sense of place, that helps ground both combat and social encounters. That being said I have always had a hard time finding a style of battle maps I liked. While there are some high quality artists out there, most battle maps are simplistic. This is especially true if you have something specific in mind and can only choose from one or two maps. These simpler maps\u00a0lack the details that can only come from the real world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe battle maps I create will be done using top down drone photography. These realistic images will allow Game Masters to have more detailed and immersive encounters for their players.\u00a0I know some Game Masters believe their players will inject those details into the world, but I find that it is much better if a map has details already that the players can latch on to. The beauty and life, the rust and grime, the true sense of age of a location (be it old or new). These are what I believe make worlds come alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to try to be broad with my maps, and try to provide items for multiple different genres. Hopefully I can help avoid the frustration of frantically google searching for the perfect shot only to find low res pictures covered with copyright information, something I have experienced quite often. All images will be shot, edited, and produced by yours truly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFine Print\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the content I produce and release is for your personal use, which you are free to share with your friends in any format, just please give me credit for the work.
