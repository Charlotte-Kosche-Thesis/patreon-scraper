Like most individuals who hone their crafts, I\u0027ve vastly improved the quality of the videos I produce and have reached a level of success I could only have dreamt of when I started the channel in high school. However, now that I\u0027ve reached another massive milestone, 700,000 subscribers (thank you SO MUCH btw), I\u0027ve been contemplating what\u0027s next: \n\u003cstrong\u003eexpansion\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eTL;DR\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nRunning the iCrackUriDevice YouTube channel is no easy task - I\u0027m constantly striving to bring you breaking updates in the realm of iOS and Jailbreaking first! Patreons\u0027, with your support I intend to improve the quality of my channel even further, expand into new areas and launch more giveaways (possibly sans FreeAppsFast - regular viewers will know what I\u0027m referring to). This is an exciting time and I hope you\u0027ll support me in my efforts to expand and bring the best tech content to YouTube!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003eThree Points To Expansion\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://besttechinfo.com/pat/Banner.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will happen to your contributions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eFirstly\u003c/strong\u003e, Giveaways! I\u0027ve always loved the concept of giveaways, raffles, drawings, whatever you choose to call them. I feel it\u0027s important to give back to the viewers who have helped me reach the level of YouTube channel success I have today. With your support, I want to both reduce and eventually eliminate sponsored giveaways (i.e. FreeAppsFast) and simply giveaway MORE of everything: gift cards, iPhones, iPads, iPods, Apple TVs and possibly even MACS!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003eSecondly\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027m at the point where I want to move beyond the scope of merely Apple product coverage and the occasional one-off products from other brands (Samsung, iRobot, etc). In order to properly accomplish this step, I\u0027m going to need to bring someone else on board the \u003cem\u003eiCrackUriDevice\u003c/em\u003e team (which currently consists of myself, my dog and my mother, without whom I never would have had the support needed to start my channel in the first place). Seriously, I want to bring on someone who will be able to aid in everything from content creation, to editing my videos and even assisting in graphics design/production - I already have a great candidate in mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003eThirdly\u003c/strong\u003e, provided we\u0027re able to expand beyond the second point, we\u0027ll need office space! Needless to say, that can be rather pricey. However, it should pay off in the long term, as it will allow for significantly improved production quality. Currently, I have a home office and all of the shots are captured in various spots around my house. Having dedicated office space will enable us to setup permanent \"sets\" or \"stages\" for varying types of videos; unboxings, news updates, tutorials, and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eFinally\u003c/strong\u003e, there are of course other goals and milestones that both accompany the above three points and compliment them. In other words, the channel will improve in more ways than listed above in light of your generous contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003eConcluding Thoughts\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s time to get real:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"81\" src=\"http://www.besttechinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/All-iOS-Devices-Patreon.jpg\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\nI\u0027ve put my blood, sweat and tears into YouTube (literally), and I couldn\u0027t be happier with the results. Regardless of whether you help contribute to the expansion of the iCrackUriDevice YouTube channel, thank you so much for aiding me in my quest to share my knowledge and love of technology with the planet. I won\u0027t stop until I\u0027ve reached all goals outlined in this Patreon campaign and I hope you\u0027ll join me in helping the channel grow by pledging. Also note that I\u0027ve put an enormous amount of time into coming up with what I think are some really \u003cstrong\u003eEPIC REWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to show you how grateful I am for your contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n[Concerning the higher up pledge rewards: you don\u0027t have to continually pay for them monthly (but you can if you want to help me reach my goals faster) and you can downgrade or upgrade at ant time! ]\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you again so much for your support throughout the years! You\u0027ve helped me in more ways than you can imagine!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
