    "summary": "\"(IAM)WARFACE is an Electro Rock Band formed in Brighton and London in 2016, consisting of Matt Warneford, Lou Matthews, Tom Howe, Mike Smith and Adam Stanley. The name is a metaphor for their own style of bombastic high-energy music.\u003cbr\u003eThey have taken the pop route but they keep it dangerous with a fusion of 80\u2019s style vocals, abstract guitars, moody layered synth riffs and pounding drum beats, and have been influenced\u00a0by many peers such as Depeche Mode, Gary Numan, Kasabian, Muse, Big Black Delta, Nero, Queens of the Stone Age, Tears For Fears, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Black Keys and MGMT.\u003cbr\u003eThey have just finished touring sold out support gigs with Gary Numan (including Leamington Assembly capacity 1500)  where they proved so popular to the Numanoids, calling them: \"The best Numan support act in fifteen years\". Not ordinarily a fan-base who are easily swayed - they\u0027re now actively supporting (IAM)WARFACE online, at gigs, buying their music and following them in droves! In addition Mr Numan also wants the band back as support for his next tour.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMAKING MUSIC IS OUR LIFEBLOOD\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e Using Patreon allows us to continue to create by way of fan funding. Pledges will be put straight back in to the creative process to create more music and videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLET\u2019S EMPOWER THE PEOPLE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe music industry is changing and we need to change with it. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have inherited a broken system that is no longer what it once was, yet has not found a definitive new way forward. A system where only the biggest of the big bands are able to make a living and the rest of us sacrifice our whole lives and risk financial ruin every step of the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where to from here? Well, we want to create an interactive fan experience unlike any band that has come before us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to help create a path, not just for (IAM)WARFACE, but for the countless bands across the world that are working incredibly hard, touring the world to perform for their fans and losing money every step of the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we want to do it by empowering YOU, the fans, so that you get to decide who succeeds and who doesn\u2019t. The old establishment is dying. Let\u2019s show that we can create our own new way forward and put the power back where it should be, with the fans who love and believe in the music that we, and so many great bands out there are creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start with though, we want to give you guys a bit more background on the reality of our situation, and then we\u2019ll explain exactly how you can get involved in our career in an unprecedented new way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet has resulted in an industry that actually gives more bands an opportunity to build a decent fanbase, as the music is now available for everyone to listen to anytime they want - for free. Lots of people in the industry refer to the \u201cgood old days\u201d when everyone bought albums and many bands made a lot of money, but in some ways, it is much more democratic this way. Instead of it being like the old days where the only bands that could become successful were the one\u0027s that had the support of a big label, these days it is YOU, the people out there that decide which bands succeed or fail. The bands that get signed at all are often the ones that have acquired fans at a grass roots level and forced the labels to take notice, not the other way around. That is what happened with (IAM)WARFACE and is happening with many other bands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFINANCIAL REALITIES IN THIS NEW INDUSTRY\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one downside is that though a band like us owes much of our popularity to the internet and the way the industry works in nowadays, it no longer supports bands financially in the way it used to. The harsh reality is that you now have bands that have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of fans all around the world, and yet still make less than minimum wage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll level with you...here in (IAM)WARFACE we don\u2019t even make that. In fact we have hardly ever been paid for playing in this band, as the little money we do make gets continually re-invested to finance all our music and gigs rather than paid out to members. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWE WANT TO DO THIS FULL TIME\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love playing in this band, and we\u0027ll be straight with you, we want to do this full time. It is extremely difficult to hold down any sort of normal job with the amount of work we are putting into this project at the moment and that leaves us with only one option;\u003cbr\u003eTo find a way that we can start making a profit and get paid for what we do in (IAM)WARFACE, so that we can continue to pursue this as a full-time endeavour and tour and make new music on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eA NEW WAY FORWARD IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wouldn\u2019t have been able to take that next step in our career without the massive support we have received from our awesome fans. But with the enormous touring opportunities on the horizon, for a while now we have been trying to work out what to do next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we are asking of (IAM)WARFACE fans is a small ongoing commitment; to become patrons through a new platform called Patreon, where you can contribute as little or as much as you want on a monthly basis\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, as well as the knowledge that you are directly supporting and financing the music and career of a band you like, we are also going to be creating a host of new content available exclusively to our Patreon members. Some of this content includes exclusive and/or early access to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew (IAM)WARFACE music, interactive tour video diaries, exclusive merch ranges, pre-sale ticket options, giveaways and competitions, tour podcasts, feature band interviews, live online chats with the band, live video streaming of (IAM)WARFACE rehearsals, access to exclusive cover song recordings \u0026amp; more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePLUS VIP levels that include benefits such as free tickets to shows, phone calls from members upon signing up or on your birthday, personal thank you in the liner notes of our next album, side of stage access at shows and even the ability to help choose our set list when we play in your town.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is the fans that have the power to decide which bands are successful. Every band that earns a living from their music does so financed by their fanbase, regardless of how many middlemen jump into the mix to dilute the money pool. What we are doing, cuts out all the middlemen and provides a direct way for fans to support (IAM)WARFACE in an ongoing fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to live in a world where new, exciting and innovative bands can punch through the general banality of today\u0027s mainstream music and actually make a living so that they can dedicate themselves 100% to creating the best music and tour the world as often as possible, then this is for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo band has ever done something quite like this before\u2026 so let\u2019s make history together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Matt Warneford,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e(IAM)WARFACE x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*****************\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe want to create an interactive fan experience unlike any other band before us and we need YOUR help to pull this off.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e So please, sign up and show your support for us and for this new way forward in the music industry -- and make sure you send through your comments and ideas to help us give you, and all our incredible fans across the world, the best possible value for your contribution.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003ePlease note\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e: While some rewards will be delivered every single month, others may only happen when on tour, or in between tours, every couple of months. We have tried to specify where possible, but feel free to contact us with any questions. We have listed an array of different rewards to show you guys the full scope of what we\u2019re planning, and we\u2019ll keep adjusting this over time based on the feedback we get from you all.
