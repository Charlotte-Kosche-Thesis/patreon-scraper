Also, sharing tips and advice for those coming to or living in Japan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I AND WHY DID I START MAKING VIDEOS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJust a normal 23 year old girl who grew up in New Zealand that had a BIG dream about living in Japan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduation, I finally moved to Tokyo in 2014 and started my first real job in a Japanese company doing Global Expansions. I\u0027ve also done exchanges before at Keio University in Tokyo but working was a totally different world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learnt and experienced a lot in the time I was working for the company, however at the end of 2015 I decided it wasn\u0027t what I wanted in life and made a big decision to quit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was also around the same time when I uploaded my first video on YouTube. I wanted to share a message with the world, help and give advice from my experiences to those who also want to come to Japan. Also, share more of the local Japan, the hidden gems, the normal everyday Japan and show the things that gets washed away on the crazy whack media these days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 2017, I have decided to dedicate more time to my channel.\u003cbr\u003eI get a lot of comments and messages asking me questions related to Japan and I try my best to answer most of them, however it takes a lot of time and the YouTube ad-revenue income is just not enough to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, with your support on patreon (just giving a few small change each month in return for rewards), I can put more time into making more videos (4-5 a month) and also answer your questions by doing monthly Live Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s and one on one hangouts :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who want to know more about Japan whether it\u0027s travelling, working or studying here - I will give you my genuine advice and share some of the things I have learnt from my experiences and just things I wish I had known earlier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all your support so far and if you do decide to support my patreon, I really do hope to give back to you through the rewards. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngela \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
