    "summary": "Since 1998, ISN Radio has been bringing you media, first as a radio show, then as a podcast and vodcast. We\u0027ve always made our material free to download and stream from our site, in multiple media formats for your convenience, while giving plenty of information about the music and artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, producing a broadcast requires a large amount of time and money. Since our focus is on delivering as much information as possible, a lot of the time goes into researching the music and its history, how it relates to other music, and the general landscape of contemporary music. In addition, we present an enormous amount of information through both the show and the website, all of which must be added to our database; a labour-intensive process. A great deal of time and money is spent writing scripts, acquiring sound effects, custom audio, new music, and various other elements to create a fun and entertaining show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd those just production costs. There are various sundry costs: server hosting, bandwidth usage, licensing, promotions, equipment, and software. Expenses that aren\u0027t as fun or creative, but are essential necessities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour funding makes ISN Radio happen! All of your support goes directly into the operation of the show and much of it goes back into the community at large, primarily through music purchases and contracting artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
