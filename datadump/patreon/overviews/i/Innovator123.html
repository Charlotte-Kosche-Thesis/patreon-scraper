Aside from working on anime, I am also currently working on a manga project with another writer. I also go by the name of innovator123 on Deviantart. I am fairly new to online art communities. Prior to this, Most of my art are limited to myself and some friends until my friends/fellow artists encouraged to share my art with others online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am a hardcore Gundam and Megaman fan. And I especially enjoy drawing up scene illustrations/fanarts for the latter. I also have my own original art but it\u0027s kind of a childhood dream of mine to draw every fight scene in the series. I am planning to make a Megaman Zero manga made by fans for the fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Other than that I also draw scene illustrations for other artists using their characters and other video game series. (Azure Striker Gunvolt, Xenogears etc.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Although I do enjoy working on various anime for my day job I feel that its time to spread my wings and reach greater heights. I am also beginning to realize all the potential that my art can do. Though I still think I have a lot more to learn.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0I felt a greater sense of satisfaction and growth with working on my own art and being able to share it with others as well as drawing for them. With this,I can also see the possibilty that I can help my family even further than what my current job can do alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be forever grateful to those who will support my work and be my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e"
