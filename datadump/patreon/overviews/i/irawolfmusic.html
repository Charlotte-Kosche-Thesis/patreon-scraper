I grew up in the mountains of Montana and have been chasing my wildest dreams across the country and the world over the past few years. \u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 21 I decided to take a giant leap outside of my comfort zone and move somewhere where I didn\u0027t know anyone. Thanks to a coin flip I wound up on the road toward Nashville with my entire life packed in a car. Moving to a place where I didn\u0027t have any friends, family, or history was one of the most difficult and rewarding experiences yet, and now I\u0027m lucky to be able to tour constantly and perform my music while calling it my \u0027job\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks to pledges from fans like you, I\u0027ve been able to continue writing, recording, filming, and traveling, while sharing the journey with you! I joined Patreon as a way to create a more interactive space where you can see how your contributions are helping me in my journey while receiving some perks for your support!\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron of this project means you get first access to new songs, videos, and events, as well as being part of the creative process (you\u0027ll help me name songs, brainstorm video plots, and plan tour routes.)\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to set up my page to run \u0027per video\u0027 instead of \u0027per month\u0027, so you\u0027re pledges will go straight toward seeing new material. You can choose any amount you\u0027d like to pledge for each video (I will be trying to upload one a month), and you can set a limit of how much you\u0027d like to spend, just in case I get a little upload crazy once in a while.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to start sharing new material with you!\u00a0Thank you for joining the Wolf Pack and being part of my adventure!\u003cbr\u003exx"

     "about": "Ira Wolf is an independent new-folk singer/songwriter from Montana, based in Nashville, TN. She uses her melodies and honest lyrics to connect on an intimate and vulnerable level with her audience, and is inspired by each new experience her adventurous life has given her thus far. After briefly studying at the University of Montana in Missoula, and Berklee College of Music in Boston, Ira left school in 2012 in pursuit of something bigger. She traveled the globe for a year, writing, recording, and learning about the world and herself. In the summer of 2013 she took her journey south to Nashville in hopes of a new adventure where she could learn more about writing and the music business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAfter settling into her new town, Ira Wolf spent much of her time collaborating with some of Nashville\u0027s top writers and musicians, and set out on her very first tour up the east coast and throughout part of the midwest in May, 2014.  \u003cbr\u003eAfter tour, Ira hit the studio with her producers (The Recording People) and worked tirelessly through the summer in order to release her debut album, \u0027Fickle Heart\u0027 on September 4th, 2014, just in time for her second tour. She hopes to stay on the road throughout 2015 to promote her debut record and continue gaining inspiration.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
