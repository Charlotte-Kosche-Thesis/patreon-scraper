    "summary": "Hello there and welcome to my patreon page. Thanks for\nshowing up!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m Ice Phisherman and I write actual play fiction. I write real stories with the help of real people in real time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen I say actual play fiction, I mean that you the reader gets to vote on what I do at pivotal points in the story. It\u0027s rarely from a defined list of things to do either. Normally what I do is ask something along the lines of \"What\u0027s next?\" in response to what is happening. This means that you the reader can have a personal impact on my novel sized actual plays. You can look back on what I wrote and know that the story went in that direction because it\u0027s what you and others wanted. The details you gave me sometimes made it in. In short, it\u0027s not just a story that you pull off the shelf at a book store or library. It\u0027s a personal story because you help to make it. You help me make the story better than I could ever do on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy style not only includes taking direction from others, but\nI also involve my experience as a game master from tabletop gaming and as a novelist. What this\nmeans is that most of the story\u0027s characters have sheets, stats and therefore limitations. This means that I\u0027m not only writing, you\u0027re not only posting what\u0027s next, but that together we\u0027re playing a game with me rolling dice in the background to see what happens. That said you don\u0027t need to know anything about these systems to make informed choices about what these characters can or cannot do. That\u0027s my job. All of what my characters can do is located in the story so you can just read and have a good time without having to worry about sheets or gaming systems. If people have specific questions about what is possible they can ask in the thread.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis also not only\nmeans that there are no Mary or Gary Sue characters that are magically good at\neverything. I don\u0027t decide who succeeds or fails. The story is fair to my characters because I\u0027m not picking winners and losers. As in life, characters can make sub-optimal choices and succeed or they can do everything correctly and still fail. In fact, I view loss as interesting. I roll dice. Good or bad things\ncan happen according to them. The consequences are real.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a professional author, and if you\u0027re interested in writing either because you want to do it yourself or because you want to see my creative process, then that is on display in the thread as well. I often have long posts explaining my thought process on this or that topic and why I do what I\u0027m doing in the moment without delving into spoilers. So you not only get to enjoy the work, but you get to take a peek behind the creative curtain as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you look to your left and to your right you\u2019ll notice a\nlack of goals and rewards. This is on purpose. After much thought and\ndeliberation I\u2019ve decided to forgo rewards and tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn respect to goals, the one goal that I don\u0027t want to get distracted from is writing. That is my focus and that is what I want to get done. This is to prevent burnout and to keep a steady pace of updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn respect to tiers, I\u0027ve decided to forgo them as well. Everyone can read. Everyone can participate. No one gets special treatment. The contents of your wallet (with a single, one time exception, see below) don\u0027t dictate your ability to contribute to the story and gain access to my thoughts or even me when I can spare the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat said I am an artist and I do spend a lot of time doing this. It\u0027s not something that I can do for free forever. Maybe if I do well enough I could get\nsome professional editing done or commission some artwork and I do plan on\nselling stories when I create my own intellectual properties. I\u2019ll see if the budget permits me to do those things down\nthe road.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI realize full well that\npeople will get my work for free if they truly want to so I\u2019m not going to\nbother trying to deal with that. That said\u00a0I don\u2019t run solely on sunlight and praise so if you\ncould donate I would greatly appreciate it. Any amount is happily received. If\nyou can\u2019t give anything, but still want to read then I understand. If you can\u2019t\nsupport me with money you could always tell a friend or two about my story. Maybe they\u0027ll like it. If they really like it they can support me so I can eventually write full time once again.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe one caveat in all of this is that if you want to vote on\nmy fiction you\u2019ll need to get a something awful forums account which costs ten\ndollars. I receive no money from this. I benefit by keeping people from voting more than once. The website also already has an already existing team of moderators to help keep the thread in good order so I can continue to create without interruption and you can enjoy the community there. You also benefit by getting access to a pretty awesome website.\nMy work is hardly the only good thing there.
