    "summary": "Isabelle Rizo was born amidst post-communist Romania. A political refugee by birth she was born in Germany and eventually grew up in the USA. From a young age Isabelle was interested in making and crafting things with her hands, and when computers came around she was hooked. Growing side by side with technology, a tumultuous identity finding childhood, and a desire to find her place in the world - she ended up creating her own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming an entrepreneur at the age of 16 - she began her freelance film production doing commercial shoots, photography, and creative direction. A one-person show since the beginning Isabelle mastered editing, filming, cinematography, and film aesthetics culminating in her first documentary featuring the Student Loan crisis in the US. As soon as becoming a US citizen Isabelle delved in alternative education, and began creating a curriculum for intercultural language learning in China. When coming back home the tech-space became normal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a scientist observing human behavior online and offline Isabelle noticed similarities between all humans. Our need for connection. Connection coming from integration with trauma. In online space where things were easily anonymous people would instantly connect - and she wanted to create that in offline space. From there Isabelle began integrating her online story with her offline reality by becoming a travel blogger, consultant, and strategist working remotely from various parts of Europe and North America. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkipping the traditional college route and becoming an advocate of life-long learning, political refugees, and sexual abuse survivors. Isabelle integrated her learning journey into her culminating mentoring and strategy programs. How we as a society must not fear technology but integrate with it as singularity storytellers. Creating a smaller more connected world. \u003cbr\u003eThrough her multimedia art she intends conversation to be sparked, connections to be made, and deeper things to be moved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
