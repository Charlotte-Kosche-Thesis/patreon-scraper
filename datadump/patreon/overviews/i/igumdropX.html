    "summary": "HELLO EVERYONE! Thank you for coming by my patreon page! ^_^ my name is Jaime and I am here to tell you who I am and what I do! Or try to do..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWELL MY FRIENDS, a few months ago I was watching a bunch of animation videos on Youtube and fell in love with the concept of being able to take any idea and share it through the art of animation...so I took this opportunity and spontaneously decided to pick up a tablet, draw for the first time in my life and create my very first animation video! (\u003cem\u003ewhich was the pokemon one if you guys haven\u0027t seen it yet..but it\u0027s embarrassing to me now so I\u0027m kinda shy about it\u003c/em\u003e) I didn\u0027t know what the hell I was doing (I still really don\u0027t), barely had any experience in drawing, spent endless hours trying to even download the programs necessary...but by the end of my first video I was so exhilarated to learn more about this new hobby and passion that I had found.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eANYWAY! I created this patreon because I actually full-time stream video games on Twitch (\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/igumdrop\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy channel here\u003c/a\u003e) but haven\u0027t been able to stream as often lately due to being absorbed into making videos while staring vigorously into my screen trying to make perfect circles. I\u0027ll also be going back to school soon and will have even less time to work on my Youtube channel as well as my gaming channel...but ever since I posted my first video, I have grown an incredibly fond passion for animating and want to share even more content with you guys. I\u0027ve honestly never felt so motivated in my life to make something happen, and so I really want to invest into new equipment and tools that will speed up the process (a new tablet, a proper desk because I sorta draw with the tablet on my lap at the moment, more programs such as adobe aftereffects/photoshop) which is why I created this patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I am a huge beginner and extremely noob at animating at the moment, but I really want to improve and create even better content for you guys! I love reading your comments and hearing feedback on my videos, and just knowing that people take time out of their day to watch something that I made makes me feel even more determined to work hard and develop better skills. Even the smallest donation will help me out, and your support really does mean the world to me. If you\u0027re unable to donate, I still am so grateful for those of you who subscribe and watch my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you guys!! Thank you again T_T \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
