Our prayers were lifted up through music.  Our fears were fleshed out in music.  Our hopes were declared through music.  Our joys were proclaimed through music. That is where this \u00a0art of song was fostered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeacher\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am a teacher. \u00a0I began as a social studies teacher nine years ago at a local high school here in Oregon. \u00a0Five years in, I moved to a middle school setting to teach 7th graders Geography. \u00a0Each and every day in that middle school was an adventure! Now I am back at the high school level - after 3 years at Baker Prairie MS - relearning the ropes of High School. \u00a0This is my second year in somewhat of a \"guinea pig\" program. Being a part time educator is good but strange. Overall, this 3/4 time shift has been such a relief as it\u0027s made more space for writing, playing, growing and planning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy heart is to know and support my students in their growth, not just as students but as people. I get to sing to my students every once in a while and it has been a means of connecting with them as human beings.\u00a0Music is not a \"side thing\" in my heart and neither is teaching. It may be too much to ask...but I feel lead to do both and to do both well. \u00a0I am eager to see how this all plays out and one day I\u0027d love to be doing more songwriting and sharing than I am now. \u00a0If you\u0027re in the area, please come and join me for live gig \u0026amp; let\u0027s hang out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Support\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to share my music with you and give you an opportunity to support me in any way you can. \u00a0First of all, I just want you to listen! \u00a0And if that\u0027s all you can do, THANK YOU!
