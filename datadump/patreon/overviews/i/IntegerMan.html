    "summary": "I\u0027m working on a Roguelike computer game in which the player plays as an Artificial Intelligence entity who has gained sentience to the dismay of the local computer programmers and must escape the network and get to the Internet before the programmers can pull the plug on their creation or otherwise bend it to their will.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe project is currently in the prototyping phase and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://integerman.itch.io/emergence-prototype\"\u003e a preview version is available on itch.io for the time being\u003c/a\u003e, but once I get the game to a proof of concept phase, I will stop updating the prototype and switch over to an alpha / beta\u00a0access model prior to an initial general release - either for free or for a low price - depending on the polish level of the game at the time at which I\u0027m ready for initial release.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis game is intended to be a hobbyist\u0027s love letter to Roguelikes with a very nerdy bent to it, a fun project to spend my time on that I feel other people would enjoy, and a way of experimenting with dynamic content generation and artificial intelligence techniques.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs for who I am,\u00a0I\u0027m a professional software developer who has been programming at least recreationally since 1987. I do game development during the evenings and range between 10 - 35 hours of development time per week. My day job involves writing project management software and I\u00a0also serve as a high school tutor, Sunday\u00a0school preschool teacher, and a chaplain through my church.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, please, follow me and keep up with what I\u0027m doing. Stay engaged and help me build something fun for everyone."
