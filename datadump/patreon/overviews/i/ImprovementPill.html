When I was very young, I told my mom that I wanted to become a teacher. She said, \"\n\u003cstrong\u003eNo, teachers don\u0027t make any money\u003c/strong\u003e.\" And that was that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started this channel 2 years ago because I never lost that passion for teaching. I wanted to share my knowledge and change the lives of people from all around the world. I started this channel as a hobby. But now, YouTube plays a huge part in my life and I spend a large chunk of my free time thinking about what I should create next.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\nThe problem is, YouTube alone is not very sustainable. I live in New York City so the ad-revenue I receive for my videos can\u0027t even cover the rent. This forces me to focus most of my energy on other projects that are more profitable. My dream is to create helpful content for you guys full time. That is what this Patreon is for. By supporting the channel here you are not only making my life way less stressful but you\u0027ll actually help me produce more content for YouTube\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/del\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e5/20/2018 - \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eIMPORTANT UPDATE!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0I always strive to be 100% honest with my fans and supporters. In the past couple of months, I\u0027ve been able to monetize the YouTube channel in a way that is much more sustainable. In fact, things have been going pretty well for me, and I can proudly say that I\u0027ve achieved financial freedom (for the most part).\u00a0The truth of the matter is, that I no longer need your help as much as I did last year. You no longer need to be my Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of you have sent me messages thanking me for all the value I\u0027ve brought into your life. You guys say you want to help out, and I understand. But as of right now your money is better spent investing in yourself.\u00a0Purchase books, courses, and programs that will help you develop into a better person. You can thank me by becoming successful yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to all of you who\u0027ve supported me over the last year,\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and I wish you the best of luck on your ventures!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. :If you\u0027re interested in making more money you can also join my mailing list:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=Kc-vsh3uPnxK-SgivsNt7ozqX0V8MTUyNjkzNjIyOUAxNTI2ODQ5ODI5\u0026amp;event=video_description\u0026amp;v=5gJ0KUPNqzw\u0026amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lXZ8Qw\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/2lXZ8Qw\u003c/a\u003e Here, I will send you information about the skills you need to develop in order to achieve financial freedom ( just like how I did ;) )\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/gygpw5\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jJJr9Q/Untitled_design_3.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 55, 52); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhat Will I Do With Your Money?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\n- \n\u003cstrong\u003ePay For Rent/Bills\u003c/strong\u003e: Living in New York City is impossible with the amount of money that YouTube gives me on a monthly basis.

One of which is the fact that some of the most successful people in the world like to visit the city that never sleeps. I\u0027ve always wanted to sit down with the great minds of our time and pick their brains. In order to do so, I\u0027d need the money to rent out a studio space (which is incredibly expensive in NYC) and hire a camera man.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eLivestreams:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Hosting livestreams is something that I\u0027ve always wanted to do.

I wouldn\u0027t be able to live comfortably as a teacher. Instead, I\u0027d probably be spending the majority of my time in some office cubicle wasting away.
