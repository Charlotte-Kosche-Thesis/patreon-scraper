He\u0027s won the \u003cem\u003eSF Weekly\u003c/em\u003e \"Best of the Bay\"\nsong contest, the Napa Valley Music Festival, and the \u003cem\u003eSongs Inspired by Literature\u003c/em\u003e contest, earning him a spot on a CD alongside\nTom Waits, David Bowie, Steve  Earle, and Roseanne Cash.  In 2014 He was named songwriter-in-residence\nfor the Tony Award-winning \u003cem\u003eSan Francisco\nMime Troupe\u003c/em\u003e, which has performed comic political theater since 1959 and is\nanything but silent.  He also writes and\nperforms for kids and has released five kids\u0027 CDs on his own \u003cem\u003eBrainy Tunes\u003c/em\u003e label.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn June of 2012, Ira opened \u003ca href=\"http://www.monkeyhousetheater.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Monkey House\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a\ncozy Berkeley, CA nest for thoughtful performers of all stripes. \u00a0It seats up to 65 and is one of only a very few \"listening rooms\" remaining in the Bay Area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen he was fourteen, his father scoffed at his plans for a\ncareer in music.  \u201cSon,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cmany are called, but few are chosen.\u201d \nNow, after three decades, after strolling with his guitar between the tables of\na Howard Johnson\u2019s, after singing at a circumcision, after being spit at by a\nspoiled-rotten four-year-old, he finds -- to his great surprise -- that he\u0027s\nmore excited than ever about music.  These days he\u2019s no longer that\nconcerned about being chosen.  He knows he\u0027s lucky to still feel called.\u003cbr\u003e",
