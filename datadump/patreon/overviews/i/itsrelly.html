    "summary": "Many of us pursue multiple career paths in our lives. Some we love, some we hate, some we\u0027re incredibly talented at, and some that our four year old could perform better than we can. However, I believe that our passions are where our focus should be, and for me that is writing. Unfortunately, some passions don\u0027t equate to careers, or at least, they are tough to be successful in. That is why I\u0027m here. This new platform for creatives is giving us the chance to be who we want to be and do what we want to do, and not suffer greatly for it. I appreciate any type of encouragement, engaging conversations, and constructive critiques - I\u0027ll be better for them. And of course I would be so grateful for any monetary pledges of support, and will strive to provide interesting, funny, valuable content in exchange for your contribution. People don\u0027t give their money away for free, and I am not asking you to do that. If you love the content, great, if you want to support my art because you love it, amazing. If not, that\u0027s okay too! The end goal of course is to be able to write full-time, but until then, baby steps. Thank you in advance."

I have been a writer since the tender age of eight, and while I\u0027ve bounced from job to job and hobby to hobby, writing has always been my passion. You can find some of my work on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rellywrites.ca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e. I currently work from home, which is great because I suffer from fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and anxiety. I love yoga and music, and in my \"spare time\" I volunteer for two cancer charities that are close to my heart. Thanks for stopping by my Patreon, I hope you like what you find here!",
