I love creating and sharing (without censorship) and in an effort to keep creating the volume and quality of work I have been over the past couple years I created a Patreon page, a place where you can learn, gain exclusive access to content and financially support the growth of my photography project, In Rooms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve reached a place in my career where I\u0027m taking matters into my own hands - building my own darkroom, processing my own film and funding all my travels/shoots/etc. The expenses of shooting film, building a darkroom and printing is not cheap and I want to keep creating as much art as possible with your help. I\u0027m thankful for all of your support through purchasing my book and prints and this site is a way to contribute as little as $1 a month to keep In Rooms alive. In exchange for your contribution you can step inside my darkroom and view prints as I make them, as well as learning about my darkroom techniques and view exclusive behind the scenes from my shoots. In addition receive letters, postcards and print discounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram and social media also does not allow nudity! I\u0027m getting tired of having my work removed and do not want to continue promoting censorship. I wanted a place where I can privately share my work \u00a0without the worry of being flagged. Patreon is a place where I can grow a community and share my work intimately while developing the financial support to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I can focus solely on creating art, my next books and growing as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you in advance for all your support! I\u0027m extremely grateful to have all of you as supporters and the ability to create\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
