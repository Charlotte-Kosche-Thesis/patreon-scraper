    "summary": "Hi, This is Tom from Inspiration Metalworks. Thanks for taking the time to check out my Patreon page. As an educator, I receive immense satisfaction from the work that I do in promoting creativity and the trades. I make videos on a variety of topics that are meant to help empower others to get out and make things. You should feel ok with the notion that you don\u2019t need to be an expert rocket surgeon in order to get the job done. You just need to be inspired enough to commit to the project and see it through to completion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the ways that I promote the Machinist YouTube community is by sponsoring the Bar-Z Industrial Summer Bash. Each year my sponsorship provides the live stream so people who cannot attend can still join in on the activities. The stream is 8 hours long and requires a good deal of equipment and preparation. If you don\u2019t believe me, try watching the stream from the year PRIOR to when I started helping out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe shop has also become a way for me to give to my local community as well. As we have grown we have added things like 3D Printers, CNC routers, and a laser cutter to our collection. In essence, we collected most of the tools you might find at a local maker space so that\u0027s exactly what we are doing - opening up our space in the off time to local folks interested in learning how to design and make things of their own creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuilding on the notion of the maker-space, we also host our local Titans of CNC Academy Small Group which gives folks a chance to learn CAD, CAM, and get hands on with CNC machines. In doing so we are enabling people to do things they never imaged they could do. Not too shabby for a town of under 10k people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon in one of the ways that people like you can help me continue this type of work. Donations go towards defraying some of the costs for the equipment, software, and other incidentals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you find something on the channel that inspires you. Click that Subscribe button on YouTube. Become a Patron. More importantly, go create something and share that inspiration with the world."

I\u0027m an educator, student, fabricator, creator, maker, and a few things that aren\u0027t fit for print. Most of all I like to set a good example for my kids to be creative, respectful, curious, and kind. My favorite question to ask people is what inspires them, and then I encourage them to chase that idea.",
