    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWoo!! Here we go!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys this is Terry Ruff I\u0027m creating this page to help you guys to help me to entertain you!!\u00a0I want to create original animation and illustration content that you all can just... enjoy! But, in order to do that we need the funding... I love bringing to the stories to life, so, with your help we can get this party started, and have fun creating toons!!! ...and thanks X\u0027s 10 for checking out my Patreon page! ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we do here is...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e     Some of you already know, I can have a million ideas, and what better way to express them than through illustrations and cartoon shorts.  It\u0027s not always clear how long it takes to complete a piece of work, and its not always consistent with each piece either. Frame by frame animating can take weeks for a full color cartoon, a few days for the animated shorts you see everyday. Full illustrations can be a lengthly process as well, taking days to complete. Supporting me through Patreon as well can make this my career can bring you content on an regular basis.  It\u0027s my dream to create cartoons and illustrations from my imagination that everyone could enjoy and be influenced by, and I really hope we can make it come true with this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do on here to help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e     Patreon makes it possible for my fans to support my art. Similar to other crowdfunding sites like a kickstarter or indiegogo, it uses a smaller number of contributors on a regular basis.  Once you make an account, you can choose to support me through a donation of as low as 1 dollar or as high as you like.  \u003cstrong\u003eThis donation is applied with each new cartoon and illustration release, but is not actually charged until the end of the month. Most importantly, you can put a maximum per month; so even if I create and post 40 times a month, you can set it for only 4 dollars or 30 dollars or however you wish!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Now, should you choose contribute an extra donation past 1 dollar you get extra bonuses!!! (how bout that) And if you\u0027ve had enough and don\u0027t wish to donate anymore, you can cancel at any time, no questions asked... :(\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the End...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith the help of all of you I know we can make this happen!! This will help make the content better and stronger. I\u0027ll be able to make this my 9 to 5er, and bring it directly to your fingertips on a regular. Thank you so so much for helping me, and supporting what I do here....you\u0027re the best ;)\u003cbr\u003e"
