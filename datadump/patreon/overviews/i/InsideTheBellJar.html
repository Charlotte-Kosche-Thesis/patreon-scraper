We specialise in poetry and prose on mental illness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Autumn Aurelia and Matt Sloan. Autumn is a writer from London, currently working on her first novel. She is dedicated to campaigning for better mental health awareness. She is currently housebound as a result of her disabilities. Matt is a mental health contributing editor for \u003cem\u003eThe Mighty\u003c/em\u003e, a digital platform for community stories on mental health, chronic illness, and disability. He is also currently working on his first novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also joined by Emma Guinness (associate editor) and Felicity McKee (arts commissioning editor). Emma is a writer and editor based in London. Felicity is an actor and activist who co-runs Chronically Fabulous - a body positive photo campaign for those living with chronic illness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a bell jar?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn her novel\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Bell Jar\u003c/em\u003e, Sylvia Plath uses the bell jar as a metaphor for her illness. She is stuck in her own mind, observing the world from behind this crystal glass - invisible to others, struggling to fight for air. The bell jar offers no sense of hope and instead fills her with dread and emptiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e Inside The Bell Jar \u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehope to achieve?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eInside The Bell Jar\u003c/em\u003e was created out of a desire to coalesce a community of readers who long to find their own stories in another writer\u2019s world and voice. Our poetry and prose intend to explore both hope and desperation, both pain and joy, light and darkness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur greatest goal is to offer something raw to our readers. That is to say: we are not afraid to publish your \u2018darkness\u2019. Living with a mental illness is a frightening, often very lonely journey. We hope to help you through that journey by publishing stories and poetry that people can relate to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been publishing quarterly issues online for a year, but are now hoping to transition into bi-annual eBook publication. Running a journal is costly. Over the past year, our two editors have paid writers semi-professional rates from their own pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year, we have published fiction and poetry on an array of mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anorexia and schizophrenia. We have worked closely with writers to publish pieces on\u00a0suicide, self-harm, toxic relationships and broken homes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are desperate to bring more raw voices to readers, but in order to do this, we need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will we involve our Patrons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eInside The Bell Jar\u003c/em\u003e is dedicated to providing you, the readers, with stories and poems you wish to read.
