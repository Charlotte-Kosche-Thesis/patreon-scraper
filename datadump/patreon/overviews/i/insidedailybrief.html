We\u0027ve tried websites, Chrome extensions, mobile apps and podcasts. Pretty much everything short of driving to your house and YELLING headlines at you through the front window. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur latest idea, and the one that really seems to be a hit with readers, has been email newsletters. We started with just one, the Inside Daily Brief, and now have 6, with a combined audience of over 100,000 readers. The feedback has been awesome. People REALLY like getting their news delivered in concise summaries, with tons of links and context and GIFs, right to their inbox.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe just want to keep expanding this project and seeing how far we can go, with the ultimate goal of having dozens, or even hundreds, of newsletters on every imaginable niche topic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEverything we do is about curating the best of the Web, and finding people only the information that they want, but to do it the right way... WE NEED YOUR HELP!"
