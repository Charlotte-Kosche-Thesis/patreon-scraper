I\u0027m also terrible at keeping up social media so I\u0027m hoping revamping this and trying out Patreon again for real will help me boost my creativity and get me back on track after my train-wreck of a post-graduation depression. I want to become a concept artist eventually, and really am trying to push myself forward. Any support will help me afford the programs I need, which, honestly, is just Photoshop. So yay! I\u0027m also trying to make tutorials so that the rest of the world can benefit from what I have to give. I really want art to be valued more and treated better, and the first way to do it is by passing on what you have learned, no matter how meager. And yes, I\u0027m your classic walking fashion disaster."
