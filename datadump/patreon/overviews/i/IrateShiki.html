I am a firm believer in recognizing art through giving of thoughts, feelings and opinions, along with the growth of not only the creator, but also for the audience.With this in mind, I have decided to create a Patreon, not only to support fellow artists, but to put up my own custom content for people to enjoy, and when given donations, make a couple dollars so I can improve the quality of said content. I want to strive for creating new, various and challenging pieces to extend beyond my favored mediums and better the quality of my work. With your help,we can improve our skills and provide a inspirational environment for the future of our respective art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e=====================\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Where does my money go?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eIf I receive donations, those generous gifts will be returned back to the donators, through the art and projects to come! My followers will see their donations go toward important details of my work, such as: much needed repairs for my Cintiq tablet, or buying ink and pencils I need to make the next exclusive, follower picked themed artwork. As a multimedia artist, my supplies range all over the spectrum and thusly, my costs to maintain them vary as well. The cost is vital in being able to shower my wonderful followers with gifts as a showing of my gratitude for their generous provisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why should I support you by becoming a patron?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecoming a patron, will help me become a stronger artist as I strive to start my own artist supported brand, and company. \u003cstrong\u003eT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehe choice,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is what makes Patreon unique;\u00a0we all have the say in who we want to support, and who we do not, its an opportunity to be heard and sincerely listened to as a part of the community I intend to create along side my artwork.
