    "summary": "Hey! My name is Tim, and I am a 21 year old fourth year Computer Science and Engineering student with a passion for music production (makes sense right?). I also run a YouTube channel and produce music under the alias \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eInspirAspir\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. I primarily focus on creating tutorial videos, producing music, and making covers of my songs. It has been a wonderful journey watching my creative process change throughout the past three years, and I finally decided to take the steps necessary to evolve this process even further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e [This is where you come in.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to make unique and creative content that I hope will both motivate and inspire my fans, and I am \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e hoping to improve the quality of my videos and songs; this Patreon page is meant to give me an extra edge to increase that quality. All of the money generously donated by my fans will go towards improving my videos or songs in one way or the other. This can be done by purchasing the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHardware: Improved headphones, speakers, MIDI controllers, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSoftware: VST\u0027s and plugins, movie editing gizmos and gadgets, Adobe Creative Cloud expenses, livestreaming setup costs, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDistribution/Promotion Fees: Currently I do not have a record label and therefore all music distribution and promotion fees come out of my wallet. While this fee is minor, I currently do not make enough money from releasing songs to make a profit. This hasn\u0027t stopped motivating me and I firmly believe there will come a day where that will change, but for now I need some help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall the main goal of this Patreon account is to help me raise the money to purchase equipment to improve the quality of my videos. I don\u0027t expect a crazy amount of money from this. Honestly. I\u0027d be happy with $10 a month; every dollar raised here is a dollar I wouldn\u0027t have had otherwise. Every dollar means one step closer to improving my work. Improving my work means entertaining more and more people. At the end of the day my main motivation is to entertain and inspire as many people as possible, and I can\u0027t do that without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you say? Come get lost in my little world!\u003cbr\u003e"
