I am a freelance illustrator who roams around the continental United States of America attending and selling my work and wears at conventions. \u003cbr\u003eA large chunk of my creative time is currently spent making works for my clients or pieces directly geared to sell at art shows and conventions. These art show pieces sometimes cross over into things I am interested in, but not always.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese endeavors leave a smaller chunk of time to explore concepts which are of more interest to me than they might be to the average viewer. This includes more esoteric/spiritual works, tarot study, experimental pieces, and short comics.\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of my work is uploaded online on various platforms and gallery sites. Patreon does not change this. By choosing to be a Patreon you just get more behind the scene information and origins of pieces.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you are\nsupporting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are supporting space and time for me to flesh out and finish larger pieces of\npersonal and experimental work.

This means: you\nare only charged \u003cem\u003ewhen\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI am actively creating non-commission personal works. This set up also allows me to treat Patreon as a space to upload rawer works touching on more personal themes and processing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis space also allows me to world build and script novels/comic projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAll finished works will still be uploaded to my gallery sites BUT Patreon will get to see a percentage of them first!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMore of my work can be found at the links below!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ishaway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIshaway.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.weasyl.com/~ishaway\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWeasyl\nGallery\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
