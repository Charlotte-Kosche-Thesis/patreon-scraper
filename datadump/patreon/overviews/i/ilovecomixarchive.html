Since the launch of the Archive began in early 2007, we have been scanning and archiving vintage comic strip from collectors and contributors. The founder, Steven Cottle Jr. stated, \"This is a collaborative effort to save and digitize old newspaper comics\". Filling in the gaps in runs of strips with a variety of contributors, the ilovecomix Archive already stands as a major online database displaying both familiar and obscure newspaper comic strips of the 20th century. By constantly adding comic strips by the end of 2016, the Archive had acquired more than 360,000 images including: Sunday strips, daily strips and various newspaper clippings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAbout the Founder\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tSteven Cottle Jr. founded the ilovecomix Archive in late 2007.  Being a huge comic strip enthusiast, he currently has a collection of 7 tons of newsprint in his home.  Currently In his spare time he is scanning and preserving these old newspaper comics for your enjoyment. \u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\u0027https://ilovecomixarchive.app.box.com/embed/s/7wyta7drnubk7wwjeciz6db4nioi6jnn?sortColumn=name\u0026amp;view=list\" width=\"1200\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen\u0027 rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e(Click to view the collection)\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Archives Mission\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eDigital Newspaper comics should always be FREE to access\u003c/em\u003e\". \u003c/strong\u003e Did you know that most comic strips created before 1990 are only available in a newspaper?   Almost every time you read a newspaper comic strip online before 1990 the person that digitized that comic content was not paid.  Unless an individual is selling actual newsprint of their collection, digitizing newspaper comics is not a paid profession.  Keep in mind that most of your money used in collection newspaper comics is probably gonna end up in some eBay auction sellers pocket.   So understand this, the ilovecomix Archives goal is very simple, every time we release a batch of scanned comics, you will be supporting the work of the individual scanners and by giving us a few bucks, you get access to content that may never be seen again.   We take the funds provided and apply them back into the project.  We are always needing to upgrading equipment,  purchasing more items to scan, pay for operation costs and cloud hosting fees.   We believe this hobby is much more than a few pages of newsprint for one single individual and it should be available to the whole world.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eLegality issues\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tAgain the content is only being preserved, so as usual you DO NOT have permission to use it wherever you want.

For that, we need your help and support.  Every dollar given will support the archive project. \u00a0All funds will be invested to support the longevity of this hobby. This will ensure there are future scans and more digital content. If you don\u0027t have a buck or two, please continue to share our ideas and the digital newspaper comic images with your friends and family! \u00a0 So I ask you this, would you like to become our patron?  Please consider becoming one and let\u0027s save even more history and preserve this disappearing pastime. 400,000 images is an awesome number, but saving even more is always better.  This is why we will always need your help!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ilovecomixarchive.box.com/v/ao390625\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
