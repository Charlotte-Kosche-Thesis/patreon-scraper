My\u00a0focus is on the people and ideas produced by war because I myself am a product of war and because the way the military is talked about publicly often does not align with my six years of experience in the armed forces. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eA martial hermeneutic grounds us in embodied reality and resists the alienating abstractions that currently dominate public discourse.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \"hermeneutic\" is a method for interpretation, from scripture and other literature to culture and language. \"Martial\" is an adjective that relates things to the military. A martial hermeneutic is a way of interpreting things from a military perspective. From theology to mass media, we rarely hear the nitty gritty story of military service from the most credible sources; soldiers and veterans themselves. Too often our ideas about the military are influenced by\u00a0folks without firsthand experience of the military. When they get the story of soldiers wrong, it can perpetuate biases and stereotypes that undermine the full\u00a0dignity of past and present\u00a0service members.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI need your help developing a number of projects that will contribute to constructing a martial hermeneutic and to elevating the conversation about soldiers. For example, two acquisitions editors from two different publishers have approached me to write \u003cstrong\u003ebooks\u003c/strong\u003e for them; one on a socio-theological history of combat stress and another a self-reflective adaptation of my journals and MTS thesis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also would like to create \u003cstrong\u003ecurricula, workbooks, and white pages\u003c/strong\u003e for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.centurionsguild.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCenturions Guild\u003c/a\u003e, a nonprofit I founded for sharing the story of Christian soldiers in Scripture, Worship, and Theology. Creating resources for ordained ministers and lay leaders is an important part of what I do and your support of my writing also equips Christian leaders to do better ministry with soldiers and veterans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, I am trying to improve my game publishing \u003cstrong\u003eblogs and short articles\u003c/strong\u003e. I write about religion and politics in general on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.iamloganmi.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy personal blog\u003c/a\u003e and about God and country specifically for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.centurionsguild.org/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCenturions Guild\u003c/a\u003e. Your support will help make writing sustainable over the long term as well as improve its quality and focus. Having an audience that is both supportive and critically engaged will incentivize me to be more careful and concise with my words. Your support will motivate me to make writing a discipline rather than a pastime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI value your input and support and look forward to your feedback on my writing as I develop my unique style and voice. There are always things I am thinking about writing and having this community support me as I perfect my craft is invaluable. As for the drafts I expect to put up here, I promise none will be less than 500 words, although some might be considerably longer (i.e. chapter length). Each draft will be unique, so you aren\u0027t getting stale material. I already have a lot of things on deck I am looking forward to crafting, and I\u0027m grateful you\u0027ve come here to help!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
