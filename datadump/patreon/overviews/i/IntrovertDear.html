Thanks for checking out my Patreon page. I\u2019m on Patreon because I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntrovert, Dear began as my personal blog in 2013. I wrote about being an introvert living with extroverted roommates and dating an extroverted boyfriend. I wrote it anonymously because, in true introvert style, I didn\u2019t want the spotlight on me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, Introvert, Dear has become less of a blog and more of an online publishing platform. It features many introvert voices, not just my own. The Introvert, Dear community brings together thousands of introverts from all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince starting Introvert, Dear, I\u2019ve been on a mission: to let introverts know it\u2019s okay to be who they are. You\u2019re not broken because you\u2019re quiet. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you because you\u2019d rather stay home on a Friday night than go party.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, it takes time and money to run a major website. There are costs like hosting fees, maintenance fees, email service fees, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for your help. When you give on Patreon, you\u2019re supporting \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eintrovert cause\u003c/em\u003e. You\u2019re helping Introvert, Dear grow and reach more introverts. You\u2019re helping spread the message that it\u2019s okay to be an introvert.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Introvert, Dear has helped your life in some way, would you consider donating? If every reader gave as little as $1 a month, we\u2019d be unstoppable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuietly yours,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJenn Granneman\u003cbr\u003e"

The typical photo is of a thin, young, white woman\u2014which doesn\u0027t accurately represent everyone in Introvert, Dear\u0027s worldwide audience. Additionally, stock sites don\u0027t always have photos that go with an article\u0027s theme.
