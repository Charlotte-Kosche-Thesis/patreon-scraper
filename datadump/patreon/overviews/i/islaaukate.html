It has since become a much enjoyed project even in its early stages by all who follow it. In order to continue producing content at a steady rate I have bi-weekly donation drives to pay for my daily goal so that I can produce the comic in place of commisisons for those days. Being able to publish the sketch /brainstorm version and later produce a colored cleaned up version is my goal for the series. With the help of my Patrons I\u0027ll be able to see this project continue through its plethora of storylines and eventual publication for sale at conventions and online. \u003cbr\u003e"
