My name is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInsane Ian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and I do comedy songs and music videos about pop culture stuff like TV shows, movies, comic books, and of course video games, and I\u0027ve been doing so consistently since 2008.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy songs have been featured on \u003cstrong\u003eWired\u0027s GeekDad\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Onion\u0027s AV Club\u003c/strong\u003e, and the legendary \u003cstrong\u003eDr Demento Show\u003c/strong\u003e, where for 2015 I had the #1 song for the year with my single and video for \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Benedict Cumberbatch\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rBn6p0ZcYd0?rel=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs some of you may or may not already know, I try to release at least one song a month on the comedy music website \u003cstrong\u003eTheFuMP.com\u003c/strong\u003e aka the \u003cstrong\u003eFunny Music Project\u003c/strong\u003e. What you also may or may not know despite that, I also tend to write and work on MANY projects at a time. Between several themed EPs, a planned comedy rock opera, and an eventual fourth album, Reviewsicals (my video game review series using comedy songs), plus a few cover albums and of course music videos...I\u0027ve got a lot planned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e comes in. While my releases in the past have usually just been singles with an eventual video, I\u0027d like to get more used to releasing a song and video at the same time (unlike the THREE YEARS it took to release the video for \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"DiG DuG\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e). Now granted, the first few videos I have planned are actually more like \"catch up\" videos, ie: videos for songs already released. I put out a double album in 2014 and had practically no music videos from it, so I\u0027d like to be able to go back and produce a few for the songs I feel were pretty stellar and could benefit from the visualization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7QUPqOYdhI?rel=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you\u0027d be able to get to see these videos before anyone else. I\u0027d like to do one video a month at first, building from the simplistic videos to the more higher-budget efforts. As more Patrons help out, the better the videos will become and you\u0027ll see the progress with access to my Patreon-feed. Patrons will also be able to see these videos exclusively via \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e first, with higher tiers getting behind the scenes videos, commentary on the songs, and more. Plus, once the backlog of videos is done, there will be \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enew songs and videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e packaged together, \u003cem\u003eexclusively\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support. With your help, I can keep bringing my brand of nerdy whimsy to the masses and help elevate my production quality to truly bring that comedy to your faceholes properly! Woo!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Insane Ian\u003cbr\u003e"
