I\u0027ve been a Furry since I was a child but only having joined the community itself in spring of 2016. I plan on making art a full time profession, creating drawings, fursuits, accessories and all the things in between as long as I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am a fine arts student graduating this fall (2017) with my bachelors. With my art I focus on the Furry community, drawing Furries as people would be in the normal world. I\u0027ve only recently come across creating fursuits(full body animal costumes), which I\u0027ve fallen in love with the process and working with my hands.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently I\u0027m using whatever spare funds I have to put forward towards my senior thesis show. This thesis show is an art gallery I put together with other colleagues whom are also graduating the same semester as I, this is our final portfolio to present in order to graduate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOnce the thesis show is finished, I plan on slowly upgrading my business: better sewing machine, larger and better quality drawing tablet, eventually a studio space for rent that isn\u0027t my spare bedroom in my house where I can set up a photography area to photograph products. I want to turn this into a full fledged business, paying bills, and supporting myself while also creating a name for myself among the art and Furry communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
