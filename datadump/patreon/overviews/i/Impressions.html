Soon after I found myself working on a yacht becoming part of the sailing community. I realized how passionately boat owners love and care for their floating homes, their nomadic way of life and the freedom it brings with it. I developed an admiration for these people, most of whom I found to be gentle, peace-loving, open-minded and generous; I admired their\u00a0pursuit of their\u00a0passion. I decided to give them back a little by creating portraits of their yachts, their pride, and joy. I have been creating yacht art ever since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.impressions.dk/images/demo/gallery/SintMaarten.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI left the beautiful windy isles of the Caribbean a month before the most powerful and most destructive hurricane in recorded\u00a0history destroyed the lives of so many I had left behind.
