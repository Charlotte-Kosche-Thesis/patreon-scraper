And along with James, Matt, Dennis, ArJay, \u0026amp; Nathan...we\u0027re\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ingamechat.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIn-Game Chat\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn-Game Chat is, first and foremost, a radio show about video games and gaming. When we say \"\u003cem\u003eradio\u003c/em\u003e\" the first thought most people have is a podcast. Well, we\u0027re one of those too, but we\u0027re also an actual FM radio show. We broadcast live every Saturday night from 4pm to 6pm central from the studios of News Talk 93.1 FM in Montgomery, Alabama. We\u0027ve got phones for live call-ins and the whole nine yards as far as a radio talk show goes. We started out doing this in February of 2007 and have been doing it, in some form or another (not always on the radio), for the past 8 years. In case you haven\u0027t watched the video, I\u0027m telling you all of this because our Patreon isn\u0027t a make or break situation for us. No matter what you give (or don\u0027t give), it doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027ll stop after a certain amount (or lack of). We\u0027ll likely continue to do this as long as we\u0027re allowed and can continue to make it to the show every Saturday. We aren\u0027t going anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I mentioned we\u0027re a podcast too. And look,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-game-chat/id121060914?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere we are on iTunes\u003c/a\u003e! It\u0027s the exact same show as the one on Saturday night, just minus the commercials. It\u0027s also available a few days later (usually Tuesdays). We also broadcast the show live on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/ingamechat\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour Twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e. We have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ingamechat\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e as well where we post the video of each show (again, usually on Tuesday) and also any game videos we may make for reviews, first looks, or just us playing a favorite game or genre.

We weren\u0027t sure how to go about it and felt money might eventually complicate things. It was a scary frontier and we were happy just doing it the way we\u0027ve been doing it now for the past 8 years. Then came Kickstarter and some listeners encouraged us to start one of those, but we didn\u0027t like how that was set up. You pay us, we raise a certain amount, and you get a product. Well...you\u0027re already getting a product without paying us, so that didn\u0027t seem like an idea that made sense. Then there was Patreon, and this one actually seemed to be a good fit for us. We\u0027ll still make content, you\u0027ll still get the content, and you can pay us for it or get it for free - your choice. We like that idea. You having the choice of what to do with your money sounds like a good idea to us. You already have the choice to listen or watch us so why not the same with the way you spend your money for us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will You Do With My Money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWe don\u0027t have any sort of large plan or long term goals with this idea. None of us get paid to do this. That\u0027s exactly right. For 8 years we\u0027ve done this for the total fun of doing it. I work at the radio station we broadcast from, yes, but this aspect of my job isn\u0027t...part of my job. In all honesty, it\u0027s a trade off. The station gets local content (even video game talk) for free instead of something piped in and pre-recorded earlier during the week and we get to have an actual radio show to talk about video games. We sometimes have to step back and think on that for a moment. We\u0027re on the radio! We\u0027re talking about video games for 2 hours on the radio!! That\u0027s...kind of a big deal to us. At the outset, this money is going to go into getting a new streaming PC for the show. It\u0027s been long over due and we\u0027d like to get started on that. Currently, we\u0027re using my PC and it\u0027s a giant beast of a box to have to lug to the station every week. Not to mention hauling it up and down the stairs to the studio. We\u0027d build something competent for the job and compact for the hassle. Then there\u0027s the games. There\u0027s 6 of us and while we all won\u0027t play the same game at the same time, it\u0027d be nice to be able to afford buying games for those on the show who want to play them so we can talk about them on the show or make some videos of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while your money would be going into the show, it\u0027ll also be going into making content for the show. Getting these games means more streaming and YouTube videos. We\u0027d also look into upgrading our camera equipment. We\u0027ve had ideas about using some professional cameras instead of or in addition to the $70 webcams we bought at Best Buy that we currently use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
