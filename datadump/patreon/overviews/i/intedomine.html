    "summary": "In Te Domine is a band with one mission - Offer the \"Parable of the Lost Son\" to live in your heart. Hence, the band composed 12 songs about the parable according to Luke 15: 11-32. The songs cry out that whatever is done, whatever happened, God is waiting for you to come back to Him. God is forgiveness. God is merciful. God is faithful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe invite you to join the band. Patreon is a membership platform that makes it easy for you to join the band and it\u0027s mission. By being a patron, you can support us, play with us, sing with us, travel with us, dine with us and have fun with us as we go to homes, churches and prisons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Te Domine are Latin words meaning \"In You Lord,\u201d the first three words of Psalm 31. This has become the band\u0027s name because everything we do is in the Lord, within the Lord, in devotion to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started as a small choir 5 of members in Jonesboro, Georgia, USA. Headed by husband and wife Elmer and Lolita Cortez, we are now a band with 25 members of different country of origins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLolita, who minted the name of the band, sings and plays the bass guitar. She also serves as Eucharistic Minister and Sacristan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElmer begun singing and playing guitar at age 13 way back in the Philippines. \u201cWe had no money for movies and teen-age stuff, so after school, my cousins and I would gather in our living room and sing and play guitar until our fingers hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sounded awful,\u201d he added. Little did he know that God was then preparing him for this mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin the band. Join the mission. Your financial support will help us reach more homes, churches and prisons and give away free CD\u0027s and T-shirts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet us gather and offer to the world the parable to live in our hearts.\u00a0We can be friends. We can pray for each other. We can help each other. We can serve the Lord together and at the same time, we can have fun! Become a patron today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
