    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was a kid, I\u0027ve been obsessed with story telling and have always had an interest in art and creativity. I thought for years I would be an author. One of my favorite authors, Donald Miller wrote numerous memoirs and even a book on storytelling. I read many of his books and thought I would write similar things and that would be how I expressed my creativity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, in 2010, I moved to Seattle, WA. Shortly after I was gifted an old film camera by a relative. I began shooting film regularly and eventually saved up to get a digital camera. I never considered myself an artist- I couldn\u0027t paint or play music, but somehow through the medium of photography, I was able to create art in a way I never expected.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last 4 years I\u0027ve been doing freelance photography work outside of my day jobs and in January of this year I quit my job to pursue my photography business full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhats happening? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of this, I started a personal project called \"Inhabit\". It is a biweekly photo series in collaboration with Orlando based news source, Bungalower.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of the project is to explore where people live and spend their days, whether at home, in an office, the streets of downtown, or anywhere in-between.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far we have completed and published 7 stories and plan to continue making them regularly. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis project has been an opportunity to get to know and celebrate members of our community here in Orlando. We sit down with people, ask them about their lives, the places they find home, and give them a platform to share about themselves with others. You can see two of my favorite stories\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bungalower.com/2017/04/17/inhabit-dick-steinborn/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bungalower.com/2017/05/30/inhabit-sonny-nguyen/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do you come in?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBungalower has about 40,000 visitors to their site each month, so its a huge opportunity for people to be seen and share their stories through Inhabit! Currently Bungalower has been kind enough to host and edit each story for free. Online hosting costs money and editing can take up a lot of time, so in the long run we will need to begin paying Bungalower for their work.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also spend numerous hours finding interviewees/subjects, photographing/editing, coming up with questions for interviews and then transcribing and curating the finished product! This takes me away from focusing on my business and finding new clients.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are looking for others (YOU!) who believe in this project to commit to supporting it through monthly financial contributions! Depending on the tier you choose to donate at, you will receive previews to stories before the general public, loads of bonus content, and even prints in the mail!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for your support!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
