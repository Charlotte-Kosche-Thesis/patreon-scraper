This is just one of \"my successes\" with \u003cem\u003eIsraellycool\u003c/em\u003e, one of the largest English-language pro-Israel websites operating out of Israel with almost 5 million page views in the last year alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince early 2003, I have been leading the way in online pro-Israel advocacy with\u00a0\u003cem\u003eIsraellycool.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eNot the average pro-Israel website, \u003cem\u003eIsraellycool\u003c/em\u003e prides itself on constantly outscooping the mainstream media and other sites. I endeavor to not just preach to the choir but win over new choir members, utilizing a blend of humor, informativeness and uniqueness. And I believe I have attained much success in this regard. For instance, the \u003cem\u003eIsraellycool \u003c/em\u003eWikipedia page was originally set up by a Muslim woman. You can read why she did it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.israellycool.com/2012/01/12/israellycool-wikipedia-article-we-hardly-knew-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Also, I invented a number of terms now widely adopted by other pro-Israel websites and personalities, such as \u003cem\u003eShirley Temper\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eHamashol\u003c/em\u003ee and\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBDS-Hole. \u003c/em\u003eOther techniques I helped pioneer, such as Separated at Birth posts, have also been adopted by other sites.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have also regularly been cited by the mainstream media, including the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0MSNBC,\u00a0Washington Post,\u00a0The Daily Mail,\u00a0The Telegraph,\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal,\u00a0BBC Arabic, and\u00a0The Blaze, in addition to Israeli sites like\u00a0The Jerusalem Post, Ha\u0027aretz,\u00a0Israel National News and\u00a0The Times of Israel. Past and present Israeli government officials read the site and have complimented it. For instance,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/israellycoolblog/posts/10151939777981144\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e is what\u00a0Danny Ayalon, former Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister and Israeli Ambassador to US, had to say about it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have also been able to cultivate good relationships with pro-Israel celebrities. Roseanne Barr has posted on \u003cem\u003eIsraellycool\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0twice before,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.israellycool.com/2015/03/25/special-guest-post-roseanne-barr-in-praise-of-israeli-democracy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.israellycool.com/2014/12/09/special-guest-post-roseanne-barr-to-whom-it-may-concern-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.
