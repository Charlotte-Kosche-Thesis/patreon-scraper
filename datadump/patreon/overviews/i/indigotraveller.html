If you want to chip a dollar or two then I am forever grateful but if you have something that you believe is more important to spend the money on then by all means, please spend it on that. Your support means the world to me and whether there is a dollar sign connected to it or not, I appreciate each and every one of you. I heard some fellow YouTubers use the analogy that Patreon is just like giving money to a busker on the side of the street and that made total sense to me so I thought I would go for it and create this Patreon. Any donations I receive go towards my travels and my videos. Thank you once again!\u003cbr\u003e"
