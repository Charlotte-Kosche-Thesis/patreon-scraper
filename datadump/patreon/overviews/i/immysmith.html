I\u0027m an interdisciplinary polymathic artist, merging curious combinations of art \u0026amp; biology. My PhD is in science, and I\u0027ve worked as a postdoc in human cell culture, and as a data analyst in industry. I work full time as an artist now.\u00a0I love to imagine the possible evolution of animal and plant camouflage through art. I use both traditional art ingredients, and re-purposed laboratory supplies in detailed drawings, paintings, giant handmade books, ink patterns \u0026amp; dye-scapes. \u003cbr\u003e",
