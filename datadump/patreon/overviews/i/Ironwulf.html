    "summary": "Through Ironwulf I share not only my skills as a smith, jewelry maker, creator of historical and fantasy armor and prop \nbuilding, but also the philosophy and history of the societies \nand peoples that nurtured the creation of these arts and skills in the first place.\u00a0 As well \nas sharing and encouraging the pursuit, exploration and \nteaching of them.\u00a0 We learn by doing, by building on the path blazed by others.\u00a0 I am inspired by the stories and legends of history and what they have to teach us.\u00a0 Through my art I try to teach respect and appreciation for our world and share in it the human experience. Wherever possible I use cast out and recycled materials to emphasis possibilities.\u00a0 To open our minds to thinking outside the box.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to teach and help others \nreach their potential, to share with others what I\u0027ve learned so that \nthey in turn can take it to the next level.  I am a student and will \nhappily die as such, I have done nothing but try to build on what others\n have taught me.  I owe a deep debt of gratitude to those who took the \ntime to share their skill and experience with me and it\u0027s to them I \ndedicate my efforts to teach and inspire others.  All I ask of my \nstudents is that they remember those who went before and honor them by \nsharing their knowledge and accomplishments with others.  To be tolerant \nand keep an open mind and to always remember to have fun and enjoy what \nyou are doing.\u00a0 I enjoy creating beautiful pieces that inspire and are fulfilling for those they go to.\u00a0 I hope that through Patreon others will appreciate this and help me in my quest! \u0027Secrets die with the secret keeper!\u0027\u003cbr\u003e-William-\u003cbr\u003e"
