    "summary": "Hello! My name is Idzie Desmarais, and I\u0027m a writer, blogger, adult (grown) unschooler, and self-directed learning advocate, who has focused on alternative education in my work for over eight years. My main project is my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://yes-i-can-write.blogspot.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027m Unschooled. Yes, I Can Write.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where I share personal posts on fostering a self-directed, unschooling lifestyle for parents, teenagers, and adults of all ages. I also maintain a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yesicanwrite.blog\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e as a companion to my blog, where I\u0027m active in sharing interesting links, articles, quotes, and more on radical education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do, and don\u0027t plan to stop anytime soon, but it\u0027s not easy working as much as I want to on my writing and advocacy, especially while stressing about finances, learning to cope better with my anxiety disorder, and trying to live more independently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to do what so many artists and freelancers are doing, and create a Patreon page! Patreon allows people like you--readers and supporters--to become \"patrons\" by pledging a recurring monthly donation\u00a0in the amount of your choice, whether that\u0027s $1 or $20 (or something in between). Your generosity can allow more energy and time to be spent on doing the work I love; it can help me seek out much needed healthcare that isn\u0027t covered under the public insurance I have; and it can help me to find greater independence and security in my everyday life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve committed myself to writing at least one post a month for \u003cem\u003eI\u0027m Unschooled. Yes, I Can Write. \u003c/em\u003e(something I\u0027ve managed every single month since launching my Patreon!), and along with that, by becoming a patron you gain access to a bunch of perks like early access to those regular posts, as well as access to patron exclusive posts; exclusive interviews (audio, video, and written) with my family, unschooled friends, and contacts with interesting things to share about self-directed learning; Q \u0026amp; A\u0027s with me; behind the scenes peeks at what\u0027s happening with my work; a patron only in-depth monthly newsletter; exclusive access to the text of any speech I write; quote graphics; and my endless gratitude! I believe strongly that ALL supporters, no matter how much or how little they choose to contribute, are important and greatly deserving of my gratitude, so all perks will be available to all patrons, whether their pledge is $1 or $20.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you choose to become a patron or not, I can\u0027t thank you enough for reading, following, and supporting my work with your kind comments, shares, and presence. I\u0027m so grateful for all of you!"
