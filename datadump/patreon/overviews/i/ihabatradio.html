I like good beer, read a lot of technology news on the Internet, and have a deep voice.  I also listen to a lot of technology podcasts, such as This Week In Tech, the Daily Tech News Show, etc.  I like to talk about these techy things, but none of my friends have as intense a passion for it as I do.  So, I decided to start recording myself talking aboot these things while drinking one beer and share it with the Internet.  With the help of Pulp \u0026amp; Deckle, Portland\u0027s only community handmade papermaking studio (which my wife and I run), I started collecting recording equipment and, with barely an idea what I was doing, started producing I\u0027ll Have A Beer And Talk on a more-or-less weekly basis!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The exclamation point is silent, its just there to make myself look more dynamic on paper.",
