    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Peter Hodgson and I\u0027ve been a music journalist for over 20 years, specialising in guitar. In 2008 I started the I Heart Guitar blog, and the support from my readers over the years has meant so much to me. It\u0027s seriously changed my life. And I thought it was time to bring things to the next level with a podcast, which launched on October 10, 2018. Now, writing the blog and recording and editing the podcast takes a lot of time, so I\u0027m starting a Patreon to help out so I can devote more time to writing and podcasting and less time taking every tiny little freelance opportunity that comes my way to scrape together a living. Every cent you contribute helps with things like podcast and web hosting fees, recording equipment, coffee to keep me going, etc, and allows me to focus on I Heart Guitar instead of other writing work that keeps me from generating that sweet sweet guitar content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI couldn\u0027t have done this for the last 10 years without you, and I hope you dig the podcast and that it adds something fun and positive to your day.\u003cbr\u003e"
