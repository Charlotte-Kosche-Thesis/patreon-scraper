My teacher would say, \u0027Your brain is filled with cow dung!\u0027 So I gave up school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the age of 20, I was married with a baby daughter, and life was almost unbearable. Some days there wasn\u0027t a bite to eat. Then I got the opportunity to train in documentary filmmaking. Now I\u0027ve made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/belmayas-films-14912845\"\u003etwo films\u003c/a\u003e, which have both been selected for the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival 2017!\u00a0My parents would have been so proud of what I\u0027ve achieved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep making films about women to fight injustice in Nepal, but I need a regular income to support my 5-year-old daughter through education.
