     "about": "I\u2019m a bass player, composer, educator, and writer from the San Francisco Bay Area with a strong interest in new avenues for music creation. Most of my life has been focused upon performance, with an emphasis upon jazz and Caribbean music. All along the way though, technology has been a constant presence in my life \u2013 from homemade computers in my childhood to early internet research in my college days, I\u2019ve always kept in touch with technology. My interests crossed paths many, many times, as I made demo tapes on my Tascam Portastudio, patched together rudimentary sequences, and played with MIDI keyboards. As music and technology merged more closely and became much more accessible, I started using programs like Propellerheads Reason, Digidesign Pro Tools, and Apple GarageBand on a regular basis. The more I funneled my musical life through technology, I kept my perspective channeled upon musicianship first and technical details later. I always felt that this kept me at a disadvantage until I embraced musical creation on my iPhone and benefited from the ease of the devices many music apps. Once I bought my iPad, I was officially hooked, spending a good chunk of my creative energy on the iOS platform. I\u2019ve become a true believer in the iOS platform as the future of music creation, and I know as the music revolution of the 21st Century approaches, I\u2019ll be meeting it with my iPad in my hands.",
