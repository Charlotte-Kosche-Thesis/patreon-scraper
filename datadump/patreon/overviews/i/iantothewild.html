We will be documenting this journey through photo and video sharing experiences and providing people with proof that our land truly matters. At every National Park we will be doing a trash pick up (some just by ourselves and others will be organized meets). This Patreon account is to help fund our traveling expenses, cleaning equipment, etc. Now we understand that starting a go fund me and Patreon are usually very looked down upon in the traveling industry. We are only asking that you donate if you feel comfortable! I am (Ian) a full-time photographer/content creator and father of a beautiful two year old son Rylan so I won\u2019t be traveling full-time in the van. Meagan is a Biomedical major at Northern Arizona University and as you know most college students don\u2019t have money to travel or for anything other than food and living expenses. Together we both share the same passion and drive when it comes to exploring and preserving the stunning landscapes around us. Yes this trip will be full of good times and memories but it\u2019ll also be extremely hard, expensive and a huge learning process for both of us. I will be setting up the account with different donating options and with each option comes a certain package per month, week, Etc. for example some of the packages may include T-shirts from Send It Goods (\u003ca href=\"http://www.senditgoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@senditgoods\u003c/a\u003e), Prints, Vintage cameras, other travel goods and more.\u003cbr\u003eThis entire trip could take a year or more total as we are still building out the van, planning and budgeting. I really hope that you would be willing to help us and live vicariously through our journeys, along the way we would love to meet up with as many followers as possible. This is also an opportunity for brands and companies to get unique content along our trip. If you own a business or Brand and would like your product to be used and content created during this trip feel free to reach out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA Quick Patreon Explanation:\u003c/h2\u003ePatreon is a crowd-funding platform. This is where YOU can support the CREATORS you believe in. Decide to pledge on a per video basis or set a monthly limit and join the family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to be a involved in this community. Please consider joining the team by pledging as little as a dollar or as much as your heart desires. I will continue to bring my absolute best to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_____________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars? NO - Pay in any currency! \u003c/strong\u003eAs this is US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron? Yes,\u003c/strong\u003e please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford. Even $1 per video I upload will make a huge difference and would be greatly appreciated. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it? Yes of course!\u003c/strong\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you need to donate less that\u0027s absolutely fine.
