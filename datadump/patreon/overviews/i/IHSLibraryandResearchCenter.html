    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is the Institute for Hermetic Studies?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 1998 the Institute for Hermetic Studies has been providing\u00a0instruction\u00a0on the theories and practices of traditional Western esotericism. These teachings have been disseminated through electronic newsletters, live instruction, publications, and both video and audio recordings.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Have We Accomplished?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of two successful crowdsource fundraising campaigns in 2015 and 2016, the Institute for Hermetic Studies raised\u00a0over $9,000 (or\u00a0138% of its goal of $6,500) to finance the publishing of\u00a0three of the five volumes in the\u003cem\u003e IHS Study Guides Series\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 These volumes include \u003cem\u003eLight on the Path - A Study Guide for Alchemy,\u00a0Qabala, and Astrology \u003c/em\u003e(Vol. 1) the complete four year curriculum\u00a0for use by groups and individuals; \u003cem\u003eChild of the Sun - Psychic and Physical Rejuvenation in Alchemy and\u00a0Qabala\u003c/em\u003e (Vol. 3); and \u003cem\u003eWords of my Teacher - A Study Guide to the IHS Audio Programs Series\u003c/em\u003e (Vol. 4).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Model of Success\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2016 the Institute for Hermetic Studies began publishing its highly successful \"IHS Monograph Series\".\u00a0 These monographs are between 10,000 and 20,000 words in length and focus on a specialized area of esoteric study or practice. By producing teachings in this manner, the Institute is able to create a cohesive body of teachings without having to write numerous volumes with redundant material.\u00a0 Each book stands alone and is a thorough overview of the topic presented along with extensive summaries and suggested reading lists for those interested in obtaining additional information.\u00a0 In addition, when taken numerically as a series, they interrelate to and support each other, providing a step-by-step course of instruction.\u00a0 Through the IHS Monograph Series, the Institute is able to address specialized topics as well as introduce the writings and ideas of other authorities to the student.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing to the Institute for Hermetic Studies you will be supporting not only the continuation of these projects, but also the establishment\u00a0of the\u00a0Institute for Hermetic Studies Library and Research Center, a center\u00a0that will serve generations to come. The establishment of local and regional facilities is essential to the continuity of various traditions, as well as in providing a place to meet people of similar\u00a0philosophies that strengthen, encourage, and sustain our individual and personal practices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards and Premiums for Supporting Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo encourage your support of our projects we will be offering a very unique set of incentives. While you may find yourself getting a logo emblazoned coffee mug or leather journal on occasion, we will be focusing on hard to find, if not nearly impossible without the time and connections, gifts that will add value to your beauty to your life and value to your practice.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Example:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYour name listed in publications as their sponsor.\u003cbr\u003eOne-to-one tutorials to help you with your Path.\u003cbr\u003eDiscounts at IHS events.\u003cbr\u003eSpagyric tinctures from Red Lion Labs.\u003cbr\u003eSpecialty astrological readings.\u003cbr\u003eHandmade floor and altar cloths, and\u00a0ritual objects.\u003cbr\u003eSpecialty and rare books, and even limited edition publications created\u00a0just for supporters like you will be included in our selection of rewards for our patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, a note to those of you new to fundraising.\u00a0 Our financial goals are established based on experience. We know how much time and costs\u00a0are involved in producing instructional material (particularly material that is being made at low or no cost to the end user), facility management, and fundraising. While sites like this one allow us to reach more people than our normal means of communication would, they come with real price tags attached.\u00a0 For this reason, keep in mind that typical fundraising costs are 1:4, or one dollar for every four raised.\u00a0 Where does this 25% go?\u00a0 In our case, platform fees, money transfer costs (such as PayPal), and Rewards.\u00a0 We hope to keep those costs closer to the 15-20% level, but there are fixed costs to using any medium of money transfer that we cannot change.\u00a0 These costs are factored into our overall goals.\u00a0 Thank you, and we look forward to your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
