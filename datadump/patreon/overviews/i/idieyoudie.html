    "summary": "Since 2011, I Die: You Die has been providing thoughtful commentary on industrial and related musics in the form of reviews, interviews, podcasts, and much more. In that time, ID:UD has become a trusted source for opinions and discussion of marginalized and often ignored dark music genres, with thousands of monthly readers and listeners worldwide. It\u0027s been a labour of love for Bruce Lord and Alex Kennedy, one that has in turn been fed by the sincere passion of our audience for this music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve always maintained a firm belief that sponsorship wasn\u0027t a road we wanted to go down with I Die: You Die. It is our belief our objectivity and credibility would be compromised by advertising. Consequently, hosting, equipment and other incidental costs have always been paid out of pocket.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal with starting a Patreon is twofold; firstly, we\u0027d like to defray some of the ongoing costs of running the site, and secondly, we\u0027d like to secure some funds we can put towards things like redesigning the site, upgrading our podcasting gear, and paying some contributors for their efforts. We\u0027re not asking folks to pick up the tab for those endeavours entirely: these are things we\u0027ve been working towards for a while and we\u0027re hoping a bit of extra cash would help us achieve them in a more timely fashion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Die: You Die will never enact a paywall or feature any ads on our site, and We Have a Technical will always be free for anyone what wants to hear it. What we\u0027re asking is that if you have enjoyed what we do, and have an interest in helping us take I Die: You Die to a new level, consider giving us a hand in whatever amount seems reasonable to you. Even a dollar a month is appreciated, and will net you some special rewards for Patreon backers only!"
