    "summary": "The reports read:  \u003cem\u003eFatal 90-133921.  Deceased is viewed in Trauma Room 1. Body is\nwarm to the touch. Manner of dress: Clothing cut away. No\nidentification found. The body is draped in a white sheet. The head is covered\nby short, curly, brown hair. The eyes are brown in color. There is a mustache. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy younger brother lay unclaimed in a Texas mortuary for almost a week before the Salvation Army notified police that we were his next of kin. We were lucky. Some families wait years without any word, only to discover their father, sister, cousin, son has been long gone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last two years, I\u0027ve been an unpaid, self-appointed volunteer searching for and finding next of kin (NOK) for 70 decedents whose bodies have been unclaimed. I start with their name, date of birth, date of death, and sometimes, a photograph. I scour the internet and public records for clues that lead me to their family. Some of them had poignant or powerful lives. Some lived through important historical events. Some of the things I\u0027ve learned inspired me. Some broke my heart. All of them helped me understand how intricately connected we all really are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Past Remains\u003c/strong\u003e is my current book project. Each of the twelve chapters tells the story of one person whose body was unclaimed, and whose kin I found. Think of what I do as helping to bring family members closure. Think of what I write as a cross between detective work, true crime, and heartwarming (or heartrending) resolutions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help. The cases are expensive to work because of the database subscriptions, and the stories are expensive to write because they require records requests. In Florida, a record may be $3, but in Oregon, for example, I\u0027ve paid $50. Many stories require records from multiple agencies. For some stories, I need to travel to record repositories that require me to review records on site. And then, there\u0027s the cost of my time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the straight scoop: For the price of a Diet Coke, a medium latte, a happy hour drink, a leisurely lunch, or a lavish dinner, you can share in my interesting, exciting, frustrating, and rewarding work. You\u0027ll get  access to read private Patron-only posts about the work I do, the clues I discover, the connections I make. You\u0027ll be virtually there when I resolve a case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust pick the level you\u0027d like at the right:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSnoop\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eShadow\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eBird Dog\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eGumshoe\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSleuth\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e Private Eye\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Sherlock\u003c/strong\u003e, or \u003cstrong\u003eNOK Ninja. \u003c/strong\u003eClick the button and you\u0027re halfway there.

Each level has additional awards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince Patreon is designed to build fan support for writers and artists, they don\u0027t offer an option for one-time payments. If you\u0027d like to contribute once, you can sign up for one month, then cancel after the first payment.
