From a young age I watched movies like The Lost Boys, Interview with a Vampire and read Anne Rice and Poppy Z Brite, played the roleplay RPG table top game Vampire:the Masquerade as well as creative roleplaying online. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso,In my early 20\u0027s, i started to write a story about a young messed up girl named Sofia who was slowly being driven insane by the vampire that she didn\u0027t know existed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a very dark story from a dark time in my life but I then started to think about the world Sofia was in and the mythology of the vampires of her world. Instruments of Darkness was born and after a few false starts the project is finally gearing up for a full graphic novel, written by me and drawn by artist Camilo Ponce Garay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Devourer of Souls and indeed the whole of IoD I wanted to go for a gothic style, a strong inking style that lent itself to being in black and white. I grew up with black and white comics like 2000AD and later on The Crow and these comics influenced me greatly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help in creating Instruments of Darkness will allow Camilo to spend more time on the project, post up more pages of art, character designs and character pinups. Simply the more money we can give him and the other freelancers working with me, the less outside work they will have to take to pay those bills. So lets help them get paid, and help me realise my vision for IoD!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/a77b92f2143d43c1d8d2f8e569420128/tumblr_nkfvr5LDko1uoh49so1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBonus comic series, Instruments of Darkness: The Black Hand with art by Pablo DeBonis will be unlocked at the $300 per page milestone!
