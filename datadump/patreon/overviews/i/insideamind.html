If this patreon was a success then I would be able to do this as a full-time job without worrying about YouTubes strict rules on monetisation and activity. I\u0027ll be able to up the quality of my videos and give you something that I truly believe you\u0027ll be entertained by. There may be one or two-week gaps in between uploads but that would purely be because I\u0027m working on multiple videos and spending as much time as I can researching and editing new content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all honesty, if you are a fan who watches every one of my videos or just an odd one here and there, that is pretty much the best thing I could ask for! But if you ever feel like contributing more then I will put it towards my content to make it better than it is now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese contributions would go towards getting better filming equipment, editing software, and even hiring actors and creating sets (right now, my buddy Eric is volunteering to voice Harold The Egg, and I would love to add more people to the cast and even give something towards his incredible voice acting). I\u0027ve set all donations pretty low but with as many rewards as possible to hopefully show that even the smallest donation deserves recognition."
