I make my living through an often chaotic combination of pornographic work, stage performance, professional domination, and freelance journalism, as well as sex education and private coaching. I\u0027ve presented internationally, from kink events and sex toy stores to Ivy League stadiums and intimate private parties, and have been featured on numerous podcasts such as \u003ca href=\"http://thewhorecast.com/podcast\"\u003eThe Whorecast\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://amoryjane.com/2016/10/sex-on-the-brain-with-amory-jane/\"\u003eSex on the Brain with Amory Jane\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.lifeontheswingset.com\"\u003eLife on the Swingset\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://manwhorepod.com\"\u003eManwhore Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://sexgetsreal.com\"\u003eSex Gets Real\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve co-chaired several sexuality-based conferences, most notably \u003ca href=\"http://www.sexdownsouth.com\"\u003eSex Down South\u003c/a\u003e in Atlanta, GA, and was a key player in the destruction of \u003ca href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2016/11/02/californias-proposition-60-just-condoms-porn/\"\u003eProp 60\u003c/a\u003e in California this past November. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, I\u0027ve been ethically non-monogamous for eight years. Providing information, comfort, and counsel around polyamory to individuals, couples, triads, and quads has consistently been my highest-priority passion, which is why I started my \u003cem\u003eI Am Poly \u0026amp; So Can You\u003c/em\u003e advice column via \u003ca href=\"http://harlot.media/authors/andreshakti\"\u003eHarlot Magazine\u003c/a\u003e in January 2016. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, while Harlot initially broke the digital mold in both unapologetically intersectional content and ethical business practices, its lifespan was short, and it folded after eight months. I pitched\u003cem\u003e I Am Poly \u0026amp; So Can You\u003c/em\u003e to over a dozen major publications in the aftermath and was routinely turned away. Meanwhile, the demand for an accessible, reliable, organically-evolving resource around navigating non-monogamous relationships only grew. In the span of January 2017 - February 2017 alone, I received a total of forty-nine separate inquiries in my social media inboxes from folks all over the world seeking my input on their unique poly situation(s). That\u0027s when I knew that if no one else would carry \u003cem\u003eI Am Poly \u0026amp; So Can You\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0027d find a way to make it viable on its own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI introduce to you: IAmPoly.net, the official (and permanent!) home of \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.iampoly.net\"\u003eI Am Poly \u0026amp; So Can You\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b9be07bf629a6755bb8627/t/58c0c59a29687f4f844aca79/1489475819729/?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to an August 2015 poll by \u003ca href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/08/12/polyamory-taboo-religious-americans/\"\u003eYouGov\u003c/a\u003e, only one in four U.S. adults believe that polyamory is \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d The majority (56%) believe that polyamorous relationships are \u201cmorally wrong,\u201d and 18% aren\u2019t sure. Such high levels of public disapproval help explain why many individuals in unconventional relationships say that dealing with social stigma is one of the biggest problems of alternative intimate relationships. This stigma is directly responsible for the disgraceful lack of representation and information around non-monogamy in our country, and it continues to pervasively harm us and our relationships with others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is education around non-monogamy so critical?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWithout education around self awareness, emotional IQ, and communication skills, the potential for abuse in relationships increases, even if it was not intended. It\u2019s the case with any relationship, but compounds in poly arrangements due to the complex emotional entanglements of multiple individuals.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor unlearning toxic cultural scripts and narratives, and as a way of learning to have non-possessive relationships and cultivate non-attachment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo expand vocabulary for both internal and external dialogue about feelings related to polyamory.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor learning to set boundaries and make relationship agreements\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo demonstrate that monogamy is not compulsory, and \u201cjealousy\u201d is not a dirty word.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause learning to recognize, articulate and differentiate between your assumptions, needs, and preferences is a useful practice regardless of the type of relationship(s) you are in.

Any \"alternative\" relationships are not taught in standard U.S. education systems, shown in media outlets, or casually normalized through mainstream culture. All of these structures teach monogamy, whether intentionally or not. Because these values are so entrenched in existing systems, increasing access to information about options is simply responsible and a way to fight oppressive structures.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, join me in creating and celebrating a vibrant community of relationship revolutionaries!

On average, I pen half a dozen articles a month on the intersections of queer and transgender identities, race, class, sexual pleasure, desire, and health, and the sex industry. I also regularly facilitate workshops and produce evening entertainment designed to combat ignorance around queer, fat, brown, transgender, female, immigrant, and sex worker bodies and experiences through inclusive, unapologetic education and exposure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will also cover the backend costs of hosting multiple websites, buying postage and office supplies, keeping a web developer and part-time assistant on call, preserving my home and vehicle so I can sustain both an office space and reliable transportation, maintaining a modest savings account so I can mitigate yearly small business and self-employed taxes, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, it will ensure that I can continue to afford to make monthly donations to necessary organizations such as \u003ca href=\"http://SurjBayArea.org\"\u003eStanding Up for Racial Justice (SURJ)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://TGIJP.org\"\u003eTGI Justice Project (TGIJP)\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e",
