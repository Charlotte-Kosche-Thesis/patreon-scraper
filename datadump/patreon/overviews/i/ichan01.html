    "summary": "Hello everybody! The name is ichan, Some of you might know me from deviantart \u003ca href=\"http://ichan-desu.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ichan-desu.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e A few years\n back me and a friend began working on a project called \u0027Elders Floating Temple\u0027. It was going to be a comic, however, due to time and money \nproblems, we couldn\u0027t continue. While it\u0027s been a few years, we both \nwant to still make this happen, but again money is still an issue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, with the \nintroduction of patreon, it might be able to help us finally get the \nproject off the ground!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow some of you may be asking, if you want to do a \ncomic, why are you focusing mostly on NSFW art with this patreon? Well, who \ndoesnt want NSFW contents? Lol. That being said our  comics (sadly) isn\u0027t \ngoing to be a pron comics, it will be a fantasy adventure story. We might still consider doing some bonus NSFW doujin\n style comics if we reach a certain goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also thinking of adding some random contents like fanarts and stuff (not related to EFT) as a bonus. That is if you want me to do it. All up to you! : )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for pledging and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig06.deviantart.net/74ff/f/2015/201/2/b/front_by_ichan_desu-d925jfi.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
