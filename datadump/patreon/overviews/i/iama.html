Well, we want to build tools to do the job better. Right now, with no income from this, we use the free, less functional versions of a variety of services. We want to raise some funds to deliver the next level of content - just-in-time AMA notifications, AMA countdown pages, and whatever other ideas you, our users, suggest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that any funds collected on Patreon will 100% go towards costs of moderating IAMA.
