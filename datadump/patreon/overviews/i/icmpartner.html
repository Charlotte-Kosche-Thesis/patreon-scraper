ICM is a private\nreligious seminary that is independently accredited through Accrediting Commission International (ACI).\nICM is headquartered in Orlando Florida. We are an online college with satellite campuses throughout\nthe United States providing in-depth ministry training to those pursuing their call and passion for\nministry within the church. ICM is no ordinary seminary as our graduates come from many Christian\ndenominations; believing that we are united by Jesus Christ as the only true Lord. We offer programs\nthat are designed to inspire personal growth, challenge individuals in a deeper walk with the Lord, and\nequip students with skills and tools to succeed in their unique God given purpose.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust as Christ was \u201cfull of grace and truth\u201d (John 1:14), at ICM our seminary strives to be a marriage\nbetween Spirit and Truth. Our students receive training that enables them to understand and convey\nsound biblical doctrine while also being able to personally hear from God and follow the direction of the Holy Spirit. We do not simply want our students to have a head-knowledge of Christ but rather that they develop a true and personal relationship with the Lord.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur goal and passion at ICM is to create educational programs that are biblically sound, spirit led,\nfinancially affordable and relevant to this generation\u2019s emerging ministers and leaders. We offer\neducational programs in Christian Counseling, Theology, Ministry, as well as Prophetic Ministry with\navailable degrees ranging from Associate degrees to Doctorates in any of our programs. In addition, we\noffer ordinations and ministry licenses, when applicable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhy We\u2019re on Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe are passionate about providing training to fellow believers that equips and encourages them into discovering, chasing and cultivating their unique God given purpose. In order to do that, we realize that we need to expand upon the programs we offer, hire more staff members, and\nincrease resources to both our student and alumni. Our vision is \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eto be able to make sure that\neach student is equipped to fulfill their God given call. Our goal is for very student to\ngraduate tuition debt free so we offer very affordable tuition and scholarships to offset the\nneed for student loans. Your support will help us to continue to send qualified ministers\nand counselors to preach the good news and bring healing to the broken hearted.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\nAt ICM we want our students to experience both the freedom and empowerment that modern day\ntechnology brings by allowing students to study anywhere and anytime and be able to connect\nwith other students, and even alumni, from different states and countries. Doing so will help\nbring different perspectives to educational topics, create essential networking contacts and help\nadd to each of our students overall experience while attending ICM. By creating a community of\nsupport each student will be encouraged to dream and cast their vision as they strive to walk out\ntheir personal call in ministry.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is our desire to keep our tuition cost at level that allows our students to be able to pay for their\ndegrees but graduate debt free. We look to work with our students to rise above financial\nstruggles and receive the training they need. At times to make this happen we have heavily\ndiscounted tuition costs but our heart and desire is to in the future be able to help offer\nscholarships that help cover the cost of training for those in need of financial help. However, to\neven begin to make this vision a reality we are in need of additional funding and support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn supporting ICM with your monetary donations it will go towards the goals we have designed\nto bring this vision into fruition. As a patron you will receive exclusive rewards such as behind\nthe scenes updates, exclusive pre-view/auditing of select new courses, online live events only\navailable for patrons as well as special thank you items as yet to be determined.
