Although the Jung/MBTI type\n\"INTJ\" is the subject of the forum, we\u0027ve always welcomed all types\nand talk about a lot more than the MBTI. We\u0027ve been around over a decade, have\nseveral million posts and hundreds of active members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nActive forums take time and money to run well. Ad revenue was performing poorly and I was\nuncomfortable with methods to improve my revenue such using adblock blockers, tracking cookies, selling out the community to marketers and imposing heavier\nregulations on our discussion topics to keep the sponsors happy. So I ditched the ads altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers\nan ethical platform that doesn\u0027t exploit my members with tricky tactics to get\ntheir money. They can see what I want to spend the money on and decide how much\nthey want to contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAre you charging a fee to be in the community?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNope, patrons get\nsome perks but the site will remain completely free to use with no penalties to\nthose who can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to contribute. If you aren\u0027t already a member,\nyou do need an invitation to get in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo you actually create anything?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of my time gets wrapped up in administrative work and providing support, but I do create\ncustom content and would love to do more if I had more time for it. Being an artist has been my \"day job\" for as long as I\u0027ve had the forum, and\nsome of my design and illustration skills go into customizing our site graphics\nand templates. I\u0027d also like to write more unique content for members to\ndiscuss and create a gamification system to make it more fun. I\u0027ve even thought\nabout dabbling in making some videos for the forum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat other things do you do as an administrator?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI configure and\noptimize the forum behind the scenes, manage the finances, manage moderators, settle member disputes, organize data, write\ndocumentation and policies, provide tech support, research changes in web\ntrends, html/css coding, seek out\ndevelopers and install modifications for the things I don\u0027t do myself, manage\nthe chatroom and facilitate community events.\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m not a software developer so I usually have to find other developers who can do it, and most of them charge money. Many also charge renewal fees these days. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I do get free modifications that members get used to having, but an official software upgrade breaks them and the free developer moves on so I then still have to pay someone to deal with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis amount is optional, as all modifications are, and not all members will care about every feature we add. But having a modification budget means we\u0027re less likely lose modifications we already use and allows me to say yes to new feature requests more often.\u003cbr\u003e",
