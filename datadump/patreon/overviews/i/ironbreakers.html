    "summary": "Thank you for taking the time to look at my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003eSo what is it all about?\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for fantasy and LGBT+ fiction and once I had exhausted all the reading lists I could find, I began to play with the idea of writing my own stories. I liked the idea of contributing to the limited pool of LGBT+ fantasy books, and so I set to work on Iron Breakers, my first trilogy. Unemployment had the one upside that I was able to dedicate all my time to writing the series and was able to finish it in only two years. It\u0027s given me some really great experience that I\u0027m now eager to put to use in a new series. I strive to release my novels as cheap as I can because I want as many \npeople as possible to have access to my books and LGBT+ writing in \ngeneral. Unfortunately, unemployment also means that Patreon is currently my main source of income. That means every dollar counts and every dollar is a dollar closer to a finished novel!\u003cbr\u003e I strive to create and upload content and offer cool rewards for you all to enjoy as much as possible! The list of rewards updates regularly as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on a new series. As I am both an artist and a writer, patrons will receive updates on the plotting process as well as concept art sketches and will likely get the chance to pitch in whenever I\u0027m faced with a problem or dilemma regarding the story that I might need help to solve! I\u0027m also still sorting out the last things regarding Iron Breakers as well and some rewards will still focus on that series!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
