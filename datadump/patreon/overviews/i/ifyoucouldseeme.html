These art and storytelling events shine light into the darkness, help us all to see the humanity in ourselves and in others, and can be the place where big change begins.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePeople don\u2019t take the time to see each other. We make judgments, we attach labels, we assume \u2013 we often do not see. I believe in seeing, hearing, learning, and being present with one another. The worst thing that a person can feel in this life is invisible. To be seen is to be truly alive.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is no end to the power that comes with finding our voice, sharing our truth, and embracing the pieces that we all, so often, try to hide from the world. In this process, we reclaim our narrative and remind others that they are not alone in their grief, struggle, and feelings of \u201cotherness\u201d. #IfYouCouldSeeMe was only an idea, an intention, until these brave people had the courage join me in bringing it to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFounder, Erin Mahone\u003cbr\u003eWatch my TEDx or visit the website for more: \u003ca href=\"http://www.ifyoucouldseeme.com/2017/05/21/ifyoucouldseeme-begins/\"\u003ehttp://www.ifyoucouldseeme.com/2017/05/21/ifyoucouldseeme-begins/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ePhotographs by the AMAZING Dean Whitbeck\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ewww.deanwhitbeck.com\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
