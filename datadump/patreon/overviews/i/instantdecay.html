    "summary": "I am a self taught photographer that is fascinated with analog film processes and experimental photography. I have been practicing my art for over 10 years and have been apart of a handful of international exhibitions. I have found my real love creating photographs with instant film and within a traditional darkroom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work focuses on self-discovery, fear, anxiety and mortality. I connect with with decayed architecture and how beauty can be found in places you least expect. Apart of these journeys to abandoned buildings, I\u0027ve continued an ongoing series of self portraits. I have shared bits and pieces here and there, but have not had the best experience sharing these photos online. Images I spend hours creating ending up on a questionable blog, with cryptic links to make them money. Nude art is still misconstrued so much these days. I want to insure an appropriate audience that can appreciate what I create, and not abuse my efforts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also receive a decent amount of questions about how my photos are created. Patreon has become a place for me to share more details about the cameras, film and technique behind creating my photos. I also include occasional behind-the-scenes posts which offer a different perspective to location shooting, my photography and thought processes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://transit6.cargocollective.com/1/18/604880/9982434/cro_1190_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my work is tangible. I shoot a lot of instant film and am always in the darkroom. I love MAKING photographs, not just taking them. With this passion, comes quite a few expenses; film, paper, chemistry, storage, hosting fees, submission fees, travel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt occurred to me that Patreon may be a good platform for me to:\u003cbr\u003e-Set goals for myself to stay focused on producing work within a set time-frame.\u003cbr\u003e-Display work in creative ways, which isn\u0027t usually shown through straight scanning of images.\u003cbr\u003e-Share personal artwork within a platform that doesn\u0027t censor nudity, or allow infinite reblogging/sharing with strangers.\u003cbr\u003e-Help offset costs associated with creating and sharing my art.\u003cbr\u003e-Allow me to create more images, with the ability to experiment more.\u003cbr\u003e-Share more information about my processing techniques and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e-Encourage me to continue creating! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any more questions or suggestions on how I can improve this page to gain and keep your support, please let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Brian Henry\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instantdecay.com\"\u003ewww.instantdecay.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
