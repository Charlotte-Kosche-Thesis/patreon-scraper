Welcome to \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e~ a fund-raising site/social network tool that connects creators with their fans.\u003cbr\u003eThere are FAQs for the site, but basically you can pledge a dollar amount to help the artists that you want to support. I\u0027m still going to make art and post it, but this website helps you help me have the means to do so.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET FROM ALL OF THIS?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hardest part of art is affording materials. Paint and fabric and wood all cost a lot of money! I hope that I can use Patreon to offset the cost of production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWHAT DO I GET FROM ALL OF THIS?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get the satisfaction of helping an artist make art. I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s not much flashier, but sometimes it just feels good to help someone towards their goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWAIT, ARE THERE PERKS?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow there are! Originally I had been using Patreon to offer a place for my followers to show their appreciation monetarily, but I\u0027d like to start focusing on providing more patron-specific content-- namely extra shoot photos, high quality photos, time-lapse videos of photo editing, patterns for props, behind the scenes pictures, and possibly tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hate the same-old-same-old so I\u0027m probably going to post a lot of random things that I think patrons would really like to see, but if you would like to see something specific don\u0027t hesitate to drop me a line! I would love some sort of feedback for what everyone likes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has really helped me out in the past-- even at under $20, every single month that money is deposited and it\u0027s just another encouraging push in the right direction. Thank you for reading this far and I hope you\u0027ll consider being a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
