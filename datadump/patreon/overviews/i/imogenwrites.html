It\u0027s a glimpse into my works in progress, and access to some of my work that will never otherwise see the light of day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I\u0027m working on the first full length novel for my character Jill Foster. As a patron you\u0027ll see excerpts from my planning notebooks (handwritten I\u0027m afraid) with commentary from me (typewritten, thank goodness) on what I was thinking while I was writing them. You\u0027ll also see parts of my research journal, again with commentary on what I\u0027m aiming to discover and how I go about doing that. Higher tier patrons will get to see snippets of works in progress, full length unpublished stories, and some\u00a0will get the opportunity to prompt me to write for them, once a month, anything that they choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you decide to pledge a dollar or ten, I hope that you enjoy the journey, and look forward to sharing it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImogen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ImogenWrites\"\u003e@imogenwrites\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imogenwrites.tumblr.com/\"\u003eimogenwrites.tumblr.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
