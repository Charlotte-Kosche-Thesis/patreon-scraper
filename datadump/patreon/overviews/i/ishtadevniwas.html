    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello beautiful people...\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been an interesting 12 years teaching in the North\nAmerican yoga community. I\u2019ve experienced amazing community gathering, selfless acts of giving and genuine transformation in students.  I\u2019ve also both witnessed and experienced people grinding gears between the teachings and the \"business\" of yoga.  I believe that to step into the next\ndimension and embody the teachings of yoga in North America, we need to \u003cstrong\u003eshift out of a business paradigm\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to be more aligned with the tradition in\nIndia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraditionally, yoga students aligned themselves with a teacher that held the teachings in a way that was felt to have value in the world, whether that teacher was in silence, available for private sessions or not, travelled, or stayed in one place. It was the embodiment of the teachings that was valued and supported within the community as a whole. \u00a0Thus, nobody who approached the teacher for classes was turned away based on income, \u003cstrong\u003efor the community held the teacher and the teacher served unconditionally.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means that yogis have tremendous\nhours to dedicate to personal \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003esadhana\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, to outreach at minimum fee, donation or no charge in\nthe community.  That the energy of the\nteacher is to support, enrich and hold space for the community; to study and to support the community through\nfree writing, teaching and private sessions that are easily accessible for\npeople in crisis and deep change.  Often\nthese people don\u2019t have the resources to access the support in their need for change. \nFor a person to truly embody this opportunity, they need\nto have this exchange of energy supported by the greater community.  People in deep states of change\n(i.e. addictions, depression, anxiety, birth, death, miscarriage, illness, eating disorders, PTSD, etc.) often have limited-to-no\nincome.  The stress of finances only\ncompounds their experiences of isolation and limited ability to harness their\nopportunities for healing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften when people are feeling lost, it is not only private sessions that help; it is a place to be fed, a place to sleep without fear. It is reading a blog from the comfort of your own couch and not feeling alone. It is the ability to receive a few words or a personalized letter infused with care that keeps us going when times are hard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis needs to change.  It takes a community, a large\ncommunity, to hold space for people, not just one. \nBy supporting this patronage, you are not just supporting Shivani or Ishtadev Niwas\nas a space to hold retreat.  \u003cstrong\u003eIt is 1000\narms holding up people who can no longer hold themselves.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWhatever is stress-free for you to offer is\nnot just a financial contribution, it is a contribution of love and encouragement to those who need it most.  It is a contribution in the belief of the\nteachings and of people\nfeeling heard, seen and held.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. \u00a0With any patronage over $20 per year, we will issue you a receipt by email.  All patronage money will be deposited into the Living Yoga Society account and managed by Shivani and our capable and conscientious Board of Directors to ensue our goals are met.
