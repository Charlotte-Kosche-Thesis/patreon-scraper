    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my Patreon\u003cem\u003e! For anyone unsure what that is, it\u0027s a website (and app) that works like any other social media, but their thing is that it\u0027s a platform specifically for content creators. The only way to follow creators here is to support them directly with a minimum donation. In my case it is $1.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I want to be very clear:\u003cstrong\u003e You do not have to donate any money to enjoy my music.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will upload free music to my Soundcloud.com @Benjamin D\u0027Angelo.\u003cbr\u003eYou can also watch videos of me and my work on YouTube.com/DontHitTheBen\u003cbr\u003eConnect with any of my other social medias too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my usual activity, I will also be uploading publicly here. If you like this app, good, because I\u0027ll be posting everything on my other social medias and more to here as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this being said, your support would be awesome, and I am asking for help. I want to create bigger and better projects for you, and I want to chase my dreams for myself. I promise you that your investment in me is an investment to your own inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I come from an extraordinarily musical community. All the offices in DC might be political, but all of the homes are music studios. My home is no different, with dozens of instruments and countless pieces of equipment, and a family that\u0027s obsessed with music. I play piano, guitar, ukulele, have a undergrad experience as a classical vocal performer, and also have a great understanding of the fundamentals of musical theory, techniques, and history. I have spent the last 5 years deciding that music is a passion that I want to turn into a career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe deeply in music\u0027s ability to transform people, personally and collectively. Music has always captured our hearts, it\u0027s connected to every part of our lives, and I believe that it emotionally it defines our lives; it gives meaning to the world. I strive to articulate my thoughts and feelings as deeply and honestly as I can, and although I find it easiest to express myself through music, I know that through language too I can help demystify music and share its beauty and power with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel a strong sense of purpose and belonging through music, and I am determined to inspire people all over the world.",
