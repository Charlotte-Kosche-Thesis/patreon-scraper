If that comes as a surprise to you, I\u0027d ask where you\u0027ve BEEN for the past decade and a half??! Seriously, online creating is a legitimate way to build communities these days... or did you just get off a time-vehicle? HOW fast was it going, man, your perspective seems really far flung from my reality right now... If I\u0027m right, PLEASE stick around :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI LOVE NEW MINDS, and if you are a time traveller (or just someone with a few wacky ideas) I would be honored to have a conversation with you!\u00a0So, we\u0027ve established I make \u0027videos\u0027 (whatever that means...) and I\u0027m sort of down to talk with you no matter where, when, how, what, or who you are! (Especially if the answers to those questions are Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha, before the invasion, some really inventive mice, Deep Thought, and the most sophisticated machine in the galaxy)... But those are some cosmically unrealistic standards, so DON\u0027T PANIC, you will do perfectly fine here! (Definitely better than the petunias)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess I should tell you, next, what you\u0027d be getting into by agreeing to enter into discussion with me. My most honest estimation would have to be: the aggregate of all of my experiences as made meaningful by my current perspective, which is of course always changing and developing with time as well as dissipating into redundancy.\u00a0Alright, I feel like I\u0027ve covered the basics. Feel free to follow me on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook,\u00a0and of course Patreon to stay up to date on my varying obsessions, thoughts, ideas, and projects! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you feel so generous (though please do not feel pressured), you could support what I do by becoming my Patron! I would be eternally grateful for the vote of confidence, because I hope to be spreading more of what I want to see in the world: quality thought-juice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOtherwise, I look forward to seeing you around the community!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and love\u003cbr\u003ex\u003cbr\u003e"
