    "summary": "Hello all! I am Idess, and I have been creating and uploading art publicly online for over 12 years. The internet has seen me grow both artistically and socially, and most have followed me from website to website over the years as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did not start a Patreon for a long time, despite it really becoming well known and used among my friends and fellow artists, because I never felt I produced enough work to justify asking people for money. I have had other part-time jobs that have supported my art \"habit\" that usually got in the way of me really focusing on art, and for many years the only art I produced was tiny commissions here and there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, things are different! This last year has shown a huge increase in my art output as well as my inspiration and drive for producing new art. I find that I am relying on my art more and more to help pay the bills and get through this wonderful thing called Life, and I have found myself enjoying it more and more as well. Lately I\u0027ve been having a lot of ideas and fantasies of trying new things in my artwork; new programs for digital work, new mediums in traditional; new styles, new goals, and new subjects. As many know, an artist who relies on commissions to get paid often find it difficult to work on their personal growth and still pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am starting this Patreon now because I feel that I have a lot to offer my fans, and I want to try all those new things. I want to make sure fans get to see artwork that they may miss if posted on places like Twitter, Weasyl, or Furry Network. Work in Progress photos that I usually take photos of but never share. Sketches and doodles that either stay private in my sketchbook that no one sees or go directly to convention binders which get sold at cons right away and never get seen by anyone but the person who bought it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot promise a certain amount of updates per week/month, but I can promise that my Patreon will become a close-knit group of people who are fans of my work and want to support me and I will always do my best to give you all even more than you asked for! I hope you will enjoy all the stuff I have to show and offer you, and I thank you ALL for becoming a true patron of my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow me these other places, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/IdessArt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://idess.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~idess\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWeasyl\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://beta.furrynetwork.com/idess/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurry Network\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd my online stores:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://idess.storenvy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStorenvy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/idess/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRedbubble\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
