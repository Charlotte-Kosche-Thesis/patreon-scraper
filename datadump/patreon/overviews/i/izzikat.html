I can either dedicate my time to commission portraits, logo designs and the like - or I can invest it in making comics and stickers. I\u0027d prefer to do the latter, naturally, but seeing as how rent, health insurance, car stuff, food and internet bills all cost money, I have to prioritize accordingly. You can help decide the future of my artistic endeavors! Even a few dollars a month can add up to make a world of difference. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m making:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://darkgold.tk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDark Gold\u003c/a\u003e is a dark, quirky Pokemon parody comic. It follows an actual Nuzlocke playthrough of Pokemon HeartGold, but adds some twists. The characters are often creepier, cuter or more vulgar than they are in the game. There\u0027s blood and guts, boobs and butts, annnd there\u0027s a lot of awkward humor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the comic, I make also make stickers! Stickers so far have featured characters from Pokemon, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Mad Max. More to come in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you have a taste for more exotic/erotic work, I have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/odderkitten\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eseparate Patreon\u00a0\u003c/a\u003ededicated to funding art in that vein. Stickers and comics from this Patreon will also be posted there, and will eventually be public. My Patreon campaigns are more about keeping things rolling than keeping things exclusive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me at OdderKitten(at)gmail.com"
