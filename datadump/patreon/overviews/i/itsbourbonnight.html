We\nreally hope that you do, because we\u2019re making Patreon our \u003cstrong\u003eBourbon Night\nHeadquarters\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 a Speakeasy, if you will \u2013 where instead of a password, a\ncontribution to the Whiskey-drinking cause will \u003cstrong\u003egrant you access!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn this page you will\nhave the most \u003cstrong\u003eUNCUT\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eUNFILTERED\u003c/strong\u003e access to us (although, in the winter, we\nmay be a little Chill Filtered.  Come on, who doesn\u2019t love a good Bourbon\njoke?!).  We\u2019re looking to use this community to \u003cstrong\u003ecrowdsource more ideas\u003c/strong\u003e,\nopinions and feedback from you, the Bourbon and Whiskey loving crowd, so we can\nmake our shows even better.  The audience has always been our motivation and\nthe inspiration for our channel, and this platform will give us better access\nto you, and give \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ebetter access to us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow will Patreon support\nhelp us?  Well, there\u2019s the obvious answers...your contributions will help\nus acquire more Bourbon, upgrade our equipment, and so on, but what we\u2019re most\nexcited about is our first goal; going \u003cstrong\u003eLIVE\u003c/strong\u003e once a week!  That will \u003cstrong\u003eDOUBLE\u003c/strong\u003e\nthe amount of content we release and allow us to answer more questions, discuss\nresults of our latest Flight Fights, try more samples we\u2019ve received \u2013 the sky\nis kind of the limit for what goes on with the LIVE show.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are also super pumped\nabout some of our higher rewards levels where you can become one of our\n\u003cstrong\u003edrinking buddies\u003c/strong\u003e.  It\u2019s one thing to talk to people in the comments, on Instagram,\nor through email, but hanging out on video chat, drinking some Whiskey and\ntalking about whatever is on your minds just takes things up a notch. \nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re all about with \u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s\nBourbon Night\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 taking our show, and the experience surrounding it, \u003cstrong\u003eto the\nnext level\u003c/strong\u003e.  This is where that dream starts to take flight.  Will\nyou be there with us?  We really would love to have you along for the\nride!  And maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 one day we can do \u003cem\u003eIt\u2019s Bourbon Night\u003c/em\u003e for a living!\u003cbr\u003e"
