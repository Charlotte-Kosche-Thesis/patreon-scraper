But in order to create a richer community and explore in more depth we have turned to Patreon. Choose your level of involvement; listen for free (we know surrogacy is expensive - it\u0027s the least we can do!), join our community to continue the conversation for a small fee or take the plunge and get more behind the scenes access to see what makes us tick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSticky thoughts and baby dust!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ellen and Jennifer"
