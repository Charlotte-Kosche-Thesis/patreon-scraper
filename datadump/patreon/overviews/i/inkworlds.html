I\u0027m currently attending Utrecht University in the Netherlands and I set up this Patreon to provide the tabletop gamers of the world with affordable maps for their campaigns, as well as to give them detailed tutorials on how to make their own fantasy maps.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs a kid I used to love drawing - and especially maps. As I got a bit older, however, that interest faded. A year or two ago I rediscovered the fun of it, as I got into Tabletop Roleplaying Games and being a Dungeon Master for our party of adventurers. At first I just made maps for my own campaigns, but soon I started getting requests from other Dungeon Masters to draw their worlds... Which is how I got into drawing commissioned maps. I always continued drawing my own maps, as well as maps that just ended up not being used. For a low fee you get access to a number of maps I made in the past that I deem good enough to share, as well as future maps I\u0027ll draw. All of my non-commissioned maps will be put up through this page for all of my Patrons to use. Every map is hand-drawn with pencils, before I ink them over with ink pens and scan them in to digitally add name tags and do final touch ups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat am I offering?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAffordable and editable\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003edungeon\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ecity\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eregion \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eworld maps\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for in your tabletop campaigns, which can be tailored to your own specific needs.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetailed, step-by-step tutorial posts\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eon how to make your own fantasy map - with the .PSD files to take a look at.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo tutorials \u003c/strong\u003ewhere you can watch my every move as I draw maps from start to end for this Patreon page!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ \u0026amp; A\u0027s \u003c/strong\u003ewhere you can ask me all about mapmaking, and for advice on your own maps.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u00a0As a Patron, you will also be able to vote on what the next project is going to be, as well as send in ideas and actively discuss the on-going projects with me in my private Discord group!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor your chosen amount you can support me monthly and gain access to all previously released maps and future maps, for your own campaigns.
