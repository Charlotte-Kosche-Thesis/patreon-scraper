I am traveling the US and documenting these vital stories of American women and their relationship with vulnerability. You as my Patrons will be directly funding the monthly costs to maintaining my cross country road trip. I will have a financial foundation that maintains my monthly basic costs and contributes to any foreseeable variables that living and working on the road can create.",
