    "summary": "\"Hello ladies and gentlemen; Central here! \"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose opening words are no doubt familiar to you as a regular viewer of my content on YouTube. As my channel continues to grow in the number of subscribers (that is you guys!), the number and types of games featured, the quality of production, and the quality of equipment; one thing remains the same. My continued effort to present accurate information in a way that is both entertaining and viewer friendly. That being said some things have changed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much fun as it is to make the content that I do, and to interact with you guys as I do; it does come at a very real cost in both time, and funds. That cost has for the most part been absorbed solely by me, as I have continued to work to create new and improved content for my viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I have created this account with Patreon! Now you as a viewer have the \u003cstrong\u003eoption to support\u003c/strong\u003e the content that you have come to enjoy so much. Note that this is just an \u003cstrong\u003eoption, \u003c/strong\u003eand not a requirement. I have never required; nor will I ever require payment for your viewership. That being said I will accept with\u00a0sincere\u00a0appreciation any help that you can give. Funds donated here on Patreon will directly influence the quality and type of content that I produce. How is that you may ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my content relies heavily on computing power, and is thus driven by an industry that is continually updating, upgrading, and developing faster more powerful hardware (computer components) and software (games, recording, etc.); funds will be needed to keep my production power up to snuff. So funds provided to me here on Patreon will literally affect my ability to purchase new games for content creation; as well as the machines necessary to run them. This also means that those contributing to the cause of my channel will have some serious sway when it comes to what kind of content gets uploaded. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of your participation in donating to the channel, I would like to take this opertunity to \u003cstrong\u003ethank all of you \u003c/strong\u003efor the support you already give to the channel, through your thoughtful comments, your viewership, and shared love of good content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks again! \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Central-"
