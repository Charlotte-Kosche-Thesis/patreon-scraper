I watched people feeding them with cheese, bread, vegetables, and other food that is not good for their health. Day by day, I saw despair in their eyes, dead kitten bodies, abandoned ones not able to adapt to the environment and finally dying from poison, almost nobody caring about them. Then, I said it\u2019s enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIKATI aims at preventing human-cat conflicts, facilitating human-cat interactions, enhance cat well-being, control overpopulation, handling health and food issues, managing sterilization, and broadly speaking handling the consequences of citizens\u2019 poverty on cats\u2019 daily life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelgrade, the capital city of Serbia, is an interesting microcosm: it concentrates five-star hotels, art-d\u00e9co and 19th century buildings, post-communist architecture and futuristic projects, mothers and fathers trying to educate their children despite tough economic conditions, young adults living with an average salary of less than $300 per month, as well as some of the worst behaviors which may take in a single place: animals and cats sold for sex, sacrificial rituals or pharmaceutical experiments (almost twice a month, someone asks me if I have cats to sell, like I am a car or carpet dealer \u2026), beaten, crushed by car, and poisoned But I will not quit and will pursue my efforts.\u00a0Every day I keep on feeding, healing, protecting, caressing and sharing moments with them, looking in their eyes and hearing them purring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cold of winter has already set in, temperatures are still low and this situation will last in the upcoming weeks. The upcoming period is the worst as people start again abandoning cats, from mature to young ones to pregnant females. Moreover, the general environment (that of the park) is not safe and poisoning constitutes the biggest threat. The 22 stray and abandoned cats I am taking care of, are in a daily danger. They are living in a park (Terazije) in the city center and have no other place to sleep and hide except in the cave of a ruined building. They were 32 in early September 2017: 8 kittens died of virus, broken spine, poisoned, and of cold; 2 females were \u201cstolen\u201d, 1 crashed, \u2026 and 1 abandoned and injured young male (Panther) is now part of my family (I have two other abandoned cats at home, Dvojka and Moustache).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are my two priorities for the year to come:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. To provide food (1 meal per day is a minimum, $170/month, $2040/year), logistics/medicine and veterinary assistance ($70/month, $840/year), and sterilization of 4 males and 6 females ($460);\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.Terazije park is planned to be transformed into a residential/commercial area by February 2019, meaning that cats that are living there must be displaced by end of December 2018. Therefore, my objective is to rent a house (or at least an empty office) with a garden outside in the city suburbs (which would serve as a bigger shelter for any abandoned or injured animal like those that exist in the US or in France) and build a veterinary office (in Belgrade, too few offer professional services and hygiene conditions are whether bad whether disputable). Estimated budget = $37000. Besides this concept, the aim is also to train cats and dogs, and to bring them to children in hospitals (those suffering from cancer, bone diseases, or other severe traumas). This medical approach is totally absent here in Serbia. At least, it may compensate a little the bad medical conditions of local public hospitals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin our community of cats and give a voice to be heard to Klinac/Littleboy, Tigar/Tiger, Buca, old Zika, and Bonbona/Candy ! Too many negative forces act against them. When you become our patron, they will have the strength to fight for a better and decent life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHvala / Thanks for your commitment to our cause !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIKATI Friends \u0026amp; Laurent Tournois\u003cbr\u003e"
