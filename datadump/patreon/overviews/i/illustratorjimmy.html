Maybe one day I\u2019ll get a grown up job. Until then, I\u2019ll draw on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like creating comics where kids are the protagonists but placed in supernatural situations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m Working On...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a ton of things I\u0027m working on, but the biggest one is a comic about Kids, monsters, and how they work together to live in harmony.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScare Care\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine, if you will, a world where monsters, zombies, trolls, mummies, and all other sort of \"scary\" creature have been legally designated as contributing members of society, and are allowed live among regular people as equals.\u003cbr\u003eThe problem, of course, is no one truly accepts them, so monsters find themselves unable to fit in, find jobs, and make friends.\u003cbr\u003eA group of kids decide monsters are being treated unfairly and form a small organization of their peers to help integrate monsters into regular society, which they call Scare Care!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m moving along well with it, and the story is coming together, however I\u0027m getting a nice stack of strips done first that are funny, sweet, and substantial in content as a way of gauging the\u00a0 reactions to the characters and premise. Once I\u0027m convinced people are reacting well to it, the next phase will be presenting the complete story - how it all started, why these kids are motivated to help, and much much more.\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to release the comic strip sometime this summer. However, you can see it much earlier by contributing at the $10 per month tier. I\u0027ll start posting the strips as early as April, and it will be one to two strips per month. You can send me private messages with input and suggestions, or even strip ideas! The comic is still developing and any help is appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://illustratorjimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/me-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Why Am I Asking For Your Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn excellent question!\u003cbr\u003eAs stated above I have a lot of projects I want to do, but in order to do them I have to earn money. Which means I have to accept commissioned work. And I love doing them, but the list of commissioned projects becomes so long that I find myself working solely on those, which means shelving my personal projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also found myself struggling to finish it. Recent things have made it where I had to pick up another job to make ends meet. Which made finishing this comic sooner rather than later difficult. Your help with in delivering a little money each month would be an amazing contribution to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is to use Patreon as a means of reducing the amount of time I spend on specific art commissions and have more time to create comics and stories, as well as pay for vendor space at conventions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat You Get For Helping and becoming a Patron...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExclusive content! Since you would basically be investing in me it\u0027s important that you know where your money is going and how it\u0027s being used.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be able to see what I\u0027m doing on a monthly basis and my progress. Pages will be made available for you to gaze at and look at, and process images will be made at your disposal. Different monthly pledges get you different incentives, but truly any amount is helpful. Take a look at different amounts you can do and if your interested in investing in the stories and art I want to create, pledge what you think you can do.\u003cbr\u003eYou will always be updated with what I\u0027m doing as well as get things in return for your monthly pledge amounts."
