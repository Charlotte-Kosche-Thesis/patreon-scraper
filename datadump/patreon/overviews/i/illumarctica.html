    "summary": "Hi,\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m from Sweden and I discovered ASMR in 2015 after some searching for sleep aid videos on Youtube. Among a lot of other interesting content, I found a handful of map related geography ASMR videos and was amazed by this discovery. Were there really other people out there who, just like me, felt super relaxed just by listening to someone pointing, drawing, describing and handling maps? I became absorbed by the ASMR community and since I couldn\u2019t find a lot of new map videos I decided to give it a try and give something back to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u2019ve discovered a lot of ASMR triggers, e.g. soft spoken talking about history, astronomy, geography, art, hobbies, pop culture, nerdy collections, as well as humming, gaming, traveling, languages, accents, books, writing, mythology, meditation, guided body scans, hand movements, hair playing, gum chewing, mint drops\u2026 and each time I find something new that captures me, I try to turn it into a new video idea. I believe there are so many ASMR triggers still to be found!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe feedback I\u2019ve got from you viewers have been completely unexpectedly awesome and fantastic! Today I\u2019m a part-time working freelancer in advertising industry, but have figured out that rather than sitting in a stressful office seeing no deeper meaning in what I do, I prefer to pick up my camera and try to realize video ideas to help you viewers relax and escape from some undeserved stressful thoughts. As long as I can remember there\u2019s always been an ongoing creative project going on in my mind that keeps most of my attention, and at the moment it\u2019s a lot about creating ASMR videos. It\u2019s amazing how it allows me to include most of my other passions in life: drawing, design, film editing, animation, music, art, geography, doing research, history, nature, awkwardly nerdy collections\u2026 In my experience ASMR can be found just anywhere, if you just slow down a bit, go out to see people, and start to enjoy life. And as a bonus for me the video making turned out to be the most efficient way to finally improve my english and feel more comfortable talking, something I\u2019ve always wanted to accomplish. So why not keep filming and keep posting and keep creating as long as there is an audience? I\u2019m so grateful that you have found my videos!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for your support, and please let me know what you\u2019d like to see on my channel in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you feel you want to help, but can\u2019t pledge, of course you can show your support by just watching my videos, and hitting the like, share, comment and subscribing buttons. Always appreciated, Thanks :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
