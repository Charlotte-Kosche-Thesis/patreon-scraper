I\u2019m an avid reader of science fiction, the majority of the sci-fi books that fill the shelves of my home library were purchased because of their cover art. I\u2019m also a collector of Sci-Fi and fantasy illustration books (I have nearly every illustrated book that was published\u2014worldwide), and over the years I have spent a lot of time studying and admiring them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy artistic \u201cheroes\u201d are\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sydmead.com/v/12/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSyd Mead\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.peterelson.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeter Elson\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. For decades, Mead has been the best car concept designer, as well as the best movie concept artist on the market (his work can be seen in the movie, \u003cem\u003eBlade Runner\u003c/em\u003e). His style, with his \"new era of design\" concept, is nearly unattainable for me and for the media that I use.\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, Elson has been my true and only \"muse\". A british artist made famous by his illustrations of the TTA (Terran Trade Authority) book series, his style is really colourful and whimsical in representing futuristic technologies and really speaks to my soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy talent comes from within, as I have had no formal artistic education. I\u2019m a self-taught artist.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I discovered\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.daz3d.com/bryce-7-pro\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBryce\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, I\u00a0suddenly realised that digital art was \u003cem\u003ethe media\u003c/em\u003e that was for me \u2026. It was at that moment that I became a total Bryce nerd!\u003cbr\u003eI also use Poser, of course, but also Wings 3D and any other strange 2D and 3D programs that would allow me to speed up my work. I love to use strange and little-known software, such as \u003ca href=\"http://www.braid.com/groboto-site/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGroBoto\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and many other unusual programs. I also use Adobe Photoshop, a lot!\u003cbr\u003eIn my works, my goal is not to achieve photorealism, but to produce eye-catching illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/vfa4hx.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a crowdfunding platform for creative users!

I have been a professional SF author, I edited a fantasy and horror movie magazine, and for ten years have been chief modelmaker in my own special effects company (obviously during the years I have done many other works in the field as freelancer).\u003cbr\u003eIn the last decades my professional expertise and my creativity has leaned towards computer graphics and 3D illustrations in particular\u2014with which I wanted to create professional artworks for books and magazines. I\u0027m happy to say that in recent years this objective has been fulfilled, with thousands works sold worldwide to private and corporate clients.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I\u0027m building my worlds in the hills of Bologna, north Italy, where I share a home with my cats Leeloo, Arthur and Merlin.",
