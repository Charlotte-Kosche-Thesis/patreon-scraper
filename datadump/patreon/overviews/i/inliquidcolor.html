I began drawing as soon as I could hold a crayon and spent my second birthday at a local zoo where I would later become the Education Manager. I also spent much of my young adult life as a hobbyist photographer, and in 2013, I fulfilled my lifelong dream of traveling to Botswana to photograph the some of the most amazing animals that we share our planet with. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2015, my life changed when I left this career that I fought incredibly hard for for over a decade to better care for a chronic health condition. Around this same time, I literally woke up one morning with something in my head telling me that I had to start exploring watercolor. I immediately fell completely in love with them and have spent the last two years dedicated to learning as much as possible through every mean available to me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThough the subjects differ, my career as a professional zoo educator provided me with the foundational skills that help me to teach others about the things I am most passionate about.
