First off, I want to thank you for considering the idea of donating, I appreciate that on another level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had an interest in creating videos since the 4th grade, which has led to making YouTube videos, Vines, and now my personal favorite PODCASTS! I love connecting with individuals and learning about their unique story and perspective on the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was originally hesitant to ask for donations, but decided \"what the hell\", this is what I\u0027m passionate about and can\u0027t allow my pride to stop me for asking for help. With that being said, any donations will go towards monthly podcasting expenses, marketing fees, and equipment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to criticize, but I really believe I am capable of making the world a better place through this podcasting platform. This podcast is so much greater than myself, and although I don\u0027t feel entitled to your donation it would be very much appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, much love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
