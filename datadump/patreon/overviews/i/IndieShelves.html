I love reading. I love writing. I hate the struggles that my fellow writers deal with. I want to help them be better, more successful writers. As a publisher, I focus on creating great ways to help writers get more exposure. We make genre anthologies and serialized fiction, to help readers find new writers. We focus on teaching the writers how to market on their own, and prepare them to self publish, in the future. Our goal is to be a stepping stone, not to get rich off of our writers. We pay our writers 75% of all net royalties, and even kick 5% to the editors, and 5% to the cover designers. We take a small 15% to cover overhead and pay for marketing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Indie Shelves Publishing is a great tool to help Indie Authors. It isn\u0027t a big enough platform to make a difference in the writing community. That is where Indieshelves.com will come in.\u00a0 We want to create a one-stop-shop for all of the people that help create great stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first goal of this Patreon is help raise the funds to create an awesome crowdfunding campaign.

How much you have contributed, here, by the time the crowdfunding has ended, will earn you the rewards for the comparable tier on the campaign.

It is all the confusion and headache involved in publishing, promoting, and marketing their books.  They lack the funds to pay for these things, and they aren\u0027t equipped to do it themselves. Indieshelves.com wants to provide a place where they can find all the answers, get exposure, market their work, sell their books, promote their books, and get connected with the editors, cover artists, agents, publishers, and the readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Help Writers Be More Successful!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Struggle\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  I have been writing my entire life. It is my passion. In 2010, I decided to write a book. It didn\u0027t take long to realize that writing was going to be the easy part. I started researching how to get published. IT WAS OVERWHELMING. Digital publishing has put a strain on traditional publishing. They publish less, take less risks, pay lower royalties, and for new authors, you still do all the promoting and marketing yourself. I wasn\u0027t going to put my heart into my stories, do most of the work, and give most of the earnings away. I decided I was going to self-publish...\u003cbr\u003eIT WAS EVEN MORE OVERWHELMING!\u003cbr\u003e  I couldn\u0027t afford an editor. I couldn\u0027t afford a cover artist. I couldn\u0027t afford to promote my book. I was a green horned newbie. I had no clue where to find answers. Honestly, the frustration caused me to put away my writing, at times. I joined forums and Facebook groups for writers. They were, by far, the most informative platform I found. The longer I was in these groups, the more I realized that I wasn\u0027t alone. Here were tens of thousands of aspiring writers, and they all had the same problems I did. They were desperately seeking answers.\u003cbr\u003e  The ones who pushed through, and published a book, quickly encountered new obstacles. They weren\u0027t selling any books. They had to feed the family before they paid for promotions. The lights were more important than a top notch cover. They watched the reviews go down as readers hammered them for typos and grammar...it hurts, but so does not paying the rent.\u003cbr\u003e  They were frustrated, confused, and in over their heads. Just like me.\u003cbr\u003e  It is now 2017 and things have gotten even more complicated. Where do you sell your books? Amazon, Kobo, Barnes and Noble, or iBooks? How much do you charge? Ebook or Paperback...or both? How the heck do you even format a manuscript for epub, or Mobi? There are a thousand more questions...\u003cbr\u003e  I was spending more time on Google, than I was writing. There was an answer here, and an answer there. This guy said one thing, and this girl said another. Again, more frustration. I found places to help promote books, but most cost money I didn\u0027t have. What you don\u0027t know is, odds are that a lot of your favorite books are written by people who still have to work a job to pay bills.\u003cbr\u003e  I got tired of watching my fellow writers struggle. I decided to put my writing on the back burner, and figure out a way to fix the problem...but how?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Problem\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  I needed to find a way to compile all the articles, blogs, videos, and tutorials that help answer the questions writers have. I had to find a way for editors, cover artists, and writers to find one another. There needed to be a place that helped promote independent authors, and do it cheap, or free. There had to be an easier way to find an agent, or for them to find you. I wanted a place that lets you know which publishers were taking submissions, and what they were looking for, but also protected the writers from the publishing \"Sharks\". I wanted a way for readers to connect with authors, and maybe even help a bit. That is what Indieshelves.com wants to set out to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFull Disclosure\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e     Indie Shelves believes in 100% transparency.
