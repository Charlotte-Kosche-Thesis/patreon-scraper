    "summary": "The function of this patreon is to support my sequential art (comics), illustrations, and design projects with the ultimate goal of being able to work on these projects full time. This Patreon is listed as NSFW due to the potential for adult themes in the majority of the stories (graphic violence, language, sexual themes, and adult subjects), as well as the inclusion of fetish art projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary interests and projects are in storytelling and design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent is mostly split into two categories:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCLOCKWORK TOWER\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe home for most of my fantasy and character design concepts. Clockwork tower involves a number of smaller stories and projects, many of which date back to my earliest careers online which were shelved or put on hiatus for various reasons, as well as new concepts and ideas.\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShadowlark Symphony\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA lot of feedback is usually given from people that had read the comic back when I originally did it and would like to see it picked back up again. Before actual comics start on a new Shadowlark Symphony a lot of characters need to have their designs updated (or I need to relearn how to draw them), and some writing will need to get done to fix the plot holes the younger me dropped all over the place.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTitan\u0027s Grimoire\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe story of a group of heroes attempting to save a fantasy world ravaged by wild magical energies as the result of it\u0027s native gods being turned undead. The protagonist of this story is a\u00a0 champion of good known in their lore as \"the Ogre\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDEMONESU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDemonesu was an old screen name I used when I would hang out on various expansion and fetish art forums and have recently begun resurrecting as a page name for my fetish art. While there are a few stories and plot-lines associated with the Nexus Universe (my primary fetish art setting) this is also just a general place for all that kinky and silly NSFW art that I produce. most of this stuff revolves around absurd boobage, expansion, and transformation content; but occasionally drifts off into other areas. In the future all fetish and kink art will be in a separate folder or tagged so you can avoid it more easily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with these stories I occasionally do freelance commission illustration work, and I always give first dibs on commission slots to patreons as just another way of thanking them for their support. My commission work tends to follow the same criteria as my own projects: and I often lean towards monstergirls, action, expansion and transformation fetishes, and character design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon content also includes all of my sketches and art dumps each month. Not really intended as exclusive content so much as works in progress and a look at all the workshop and practice nonsense I am too embarrassed\u00a0to show publicly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
