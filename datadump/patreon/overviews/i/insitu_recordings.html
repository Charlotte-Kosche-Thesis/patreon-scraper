If we earn $5000 per creation we will be able to pay these artists roughly $2000 at the time their record is released. This is in addition to the 50% of profits we will continue to pay artists for all non-patreon album sales. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemaining profits from each creation will be used to cover label expenses (web-hosting, equipment maintenance, digital distribution, etc.) and put toward eventually purchasing laptops with software and studio recording monitors. This will enable additional members of our team on Bali and Java to participate in the recording, mixing, and mastering process of our releases. We also aim to eventually create paid positions for Balinese Insitu members and regional representatives with a modest salary, in order to allow them to invest more time in their production and administrative roles. We also hope to eventually build a recording facility on Bali that is designed specifically for gamelan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we reach our goal of $5000 per creation, we will organize an Insitu Recordings music festival on Bali and live-stream it to patrons, who will also be invited to join in person. This has been a long-time dream of many of us here at Insitu Recordings, and will be a celebration of everyone in Bali and around the world who has worked so hard to make this project what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*A quick note for transparency: we are roughly accounting for shipping costs of physical products to Patreon subscribers, which is why the amounts in the first paragraph are not exactly half of our goal amount of $5000.*\u003cbr\u003e",
