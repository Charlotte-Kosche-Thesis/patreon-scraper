    "summary": "Hello! I have been meaning to do this for a long while on account of having so very much content to share and would love to reach out to new people with my words. There is very little that soothes me more than sitting down and writing, whether it be fiction, poetry or real life discourse. Words have always been important and - no matter what playground riddles may tell you - have a huge impact on our world and the way we see it. I strive everyday to understand the world around - and within - me by putting it into words. Now words are just sounds that you string into concepts and theories and feelings, but that\u0027s very profound isn\u0027t it? That symbols on a screen and strange sounds can come together and make you feel something. And that is my goal here, not to cater to or bribe you; but to make you feel something. I also understand that mental health plays a huge role in how we feel and that some content is not for others, and will be posting content warning at the beginning of every single entry. You will always have the option to turn away, but I hope you won\u0027t. I hope that you\u0027re healed enough to feel something wonderful again."
