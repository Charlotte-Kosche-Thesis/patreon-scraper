Through Creative Writing, Digital Illustrations, Video Production, or Podcasting, I like to create art for other people to enjoy.

Created in TWINE and SugarCube 2, it is my intention to make a work of fiction that can be played like a Choose Your Own Adventure story or a dice-based RPG\u2026 whichever you prefer.  I\u0027ve been working on it for almost two years now as I rewrite this. \u00a0It\u0027s not progressing fast, but it is progressing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support Improvision Entertainment on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy honest answer to that question is that I feel and others here make quality work and would like to get paid for it.  More specifically, I am often literally a \"starving artist\".  Due to a medical circumstances which I\u0027ll choose not to go into depth about here, I find it difficult to hold a steady job\u2026 and, when I do, it is never enough to live on.  That, compounded with the expenses of being poor, has forced me to try and take my life into my own hands, creating artwork for people such as yourself so that I can do more than simply survive from day to day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long have you been telling stories?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince I was eight\u2014I\u0027m thirty-six now\u2014I\u0027ve been making stories.  Back then, it was pencil and pen on paper with characters based directly on my friends.  You know, kids\u0027 stuff.  Over the years, I\u0027ve taken up storytelling most often in Werewolf: The Apocalypse (currently Underground Theater) and my own Creative Writing.  A part of my daily thoughts always leans towards my game, Adaptation 21XX, combining my two favorite things: video games and storytelling. \u00a0And, of course, there\u0027s Munsaga... an effort I hope to be community and story-driven in it\u0027s content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for being a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s plenty to be worked out concerning this question, but my current thoughts are this: Patrons will have a direct say in the next additions to things such as Adaptation 21XX\u2026 plot points, NPC\u0027s, transformations, characters, and sidequests are all in the running here. \u00a0As our community grows, you\u0027ll have more direct say in the Future of stuff like Munsaga and any video content we produce. \u00a0Additionally, if you prefer Digital Artwork or Creative Writing, you\u0027ll also give input into those projects by way of voting and direct feedback.  Whatever it is I do, you\u0027ll have say\u2026 that\u0027s the whole point of you being my Patron.  You\u0027ll be my boss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks once again for you time! \u00a0It really means a lot to me that you read this far, and so I want to make sure you understand that even $1 a month can really help out. \u00a0It\u0027s very expensive to be poor and if you think I and others here at Improvision make content you enjoy, then please consider supporting us. \u00a0A little bit of funds can go a long way to better content, and we\u0027ll give you a shoutout on the show if you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSee you in the Future,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2014\u003cstrong\u003eHuntermun\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
