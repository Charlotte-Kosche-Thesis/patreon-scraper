I am a \n\u003cstrong\u003egames journalist\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eprogrammer\u003c/strong\u003e from Sweden. If you\u0027re a swede then there might be a miniscule chance you actually might know of me.

I do\nthese in my spare time. In a perfect world some company would publish them and\nsell them somewhere, but I don\u0027t have the time to nor knowledge on how to get\nthat ball rolling - and to be honest; I\u0027m not sure the stuff I create is that\nmarketable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d much rather give them away for free so\neveryone can play them. I also need cool, smart people (thats you!) to give me\nfeedback and cool ideas.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat has this to do with me or Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI am enrolled at a vocational school in\nStockholm Sweden called\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://futuregames.se\"\u003eFuturegames\u003c/a\u003e and even though Sweden has\nthe worlds most generous situation for students (probably), I\u0027ve run out of\nmoney. CSN (Swedish financial aid for students) only grants you so many\nsemesters before the well dries up. For me that time is just around the corner.\nI would really like to continue to make games and finish school so I can look\nfor work in the industry - but without money, I won\u0027t be able to do that. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eGet a job!\u003c/h4\u003e\nYes, of course! That is the goal - to work in\nthe industry. But before that I need to finish school.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eGet a job WHILE you study!\u003c/h4\u003e\nI could, and I am - but the more time I spend\nat a job means fewer hours spent making games every day. I would like to be\nable to spend more time making games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy do you deserve special treatment? I don\u0027t get to do the stuff I like all the time.\u003c/h4\u003e\nI don\u0027t deserve it. That is just a plain fact.\nI don\u0027t. I really don\u0027t. But I am asking if you\u0027ll let me?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/h4\u003e\nWell for starters, you\u0027ll get the games I\ncreate - the ones that are mine to give away that is. Anything I create on my\nspare time (not in school, those are owned by the school) I will provide for\nfree to anyone who wants to try them out. I will also livestream some of the\nprocess of making the games, as well as some Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s and of course a lot of\nthe testing =)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGames and livestreams and other content will\nbe available for free to anyone - not just for Patreons. Patreons will get\nother benefits, such as playing games early, be a part of the decision making\nand similar stuff. I don\u0027t really know yet what we will do together, but I\u0027m\nopen to ideas!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nAside from the stuff I mention earlier about\nnot having money and wanting to spend as much time as possible making games,\nI\u0027d like to quote Drew Scanlon\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAfter years of working at a website with a\nsubscription model, I saw firsthand the great things that come from having a\ndialogue with a small group of passionate users. It\u0027s a model I believe in, not\njust from a business standpoint but as a fan myself. I\u0027ve cancelled my cable\nand instead subscribe directly to projects I\u0027m interested in and want to\nsupport. I truly believe this is the way the world is going, and I couldn\u0027t be\nmore excited to be a part of it.\n\u003c/em\u003e\nTake a look at\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/clothmap\"\u003ehis Patreon for Clothmap\u003c/a\u003e,\nIt is really cool!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat can I expect as a Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI expect the frequency and the size of game\nprojects will vary depending on the level of funding we reach. More funds means\nless time spent at work, but I am hoping to be able to do 4-6 games a year,\ntheir level of polish will depend on the amount of time I get to spend.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCan you actually do this?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI am decent programmer, really crappy\nmodeller, passable as a sound designer and I aspire to be a \n\u003cem\u003egreat\u003c/em\u003e game\ndesigner.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have made a bunch of small games already -\nso I know \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e of what I am doing!"
