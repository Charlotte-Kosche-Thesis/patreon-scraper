I want to share myself openly and honestly, and write well. This medium would allow me to do so if you become an active participant in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first blog got started towards the end of 2010.

It\u0027s like being drawn to conflict. Go figure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I spil....\u00a0er, spewed my forceful opinions on that blog, I seemed to become more reflective and peaceful. It took a couple of years, but once I had purged,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://philosusi.blogspot.com/\"\u003ePhiloSusi\u003c/a\u003e was born!
