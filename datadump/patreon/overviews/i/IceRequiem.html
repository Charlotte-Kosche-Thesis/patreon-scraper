So far, I am able to upload a new track about once a month, sometimes twice a month.

As a result, content creation has been slow, and music video creation has been even more so. Good quality equipment is very expensive, and I would love nothing more than to make a living by creating quality content for you guys. With your support, I would be able to spend a lot more time composing music and coming up with fun videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to help\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you like my content, either covers or originals, helping me continue to produce them is really easy, and would mean the world to me!
