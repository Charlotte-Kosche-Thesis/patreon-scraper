    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Iainne (pronounced \u0027Ian\u0027) and my dream is to be able to support myself on my art. I love making comics and making merchandise to sell on Etsy. If this could become my full time work, I would be the happiest person in the world.\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me achieve this! If you like my work and have disposable income, you can pledge a little bit of cash and help build my career. Your money will go towards hosting costs for my webcomic, The Wretched Ones, and help fund me ordering pins and prints for my Etsy store. Any leftover profits is used to help pay my rent and bills, which helps keep from becoming homeless. Yay not being homeless\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/875d2d539caff716cad0e1c33587d9c5/tumblr_oomqngzqfL1soq7c5o1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig02.deviantart.net/e3e6/f/2017/080/3/9/two_pin_by_robertripley-db32sbu.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thewretchedoneswebcomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Wretched Ones\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my current webcomic The Wretched Ones back in 2012 when I was a recent High School grad and all I had was a small box of copic markers and a song in my heart. Its grown from its humble beginnings on DeviantArt to having its own site and merch on RedBubble! It\u0027s my pride and joy and I hope others come to love it as much as I do.\u003cbr\u003eTWO is a comic that explores a world divided between magic vs technology and humans vs humanoid-creatures. It is currently very early in the story but will go on to grow into something like an epic.\u003cbr\u003eTWO is also a queer friendly comic. The main cast is completely made up of queer characters. There are gay people, trans people, bisexual people, pansexual people, asexual people, genderqueer people, and agender people. You haven\u0027t met them all yet, but they\u0027re coming. They\u0027re coming for you. You better be ready for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img12.deviantart.net/ed4c/i/2016/185/0/5/two_98a_panel_by_robertripley-da8smiw.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
