Anything, a speck of dust floating in the tandem of light passing in the window, or the glaring eye of a patron crossing my path seeds within my mind questions and those gradually grow into different realities. You, the reader of my stories and the watcher of my art, not only will see how my mind works...but perhaps will gain inspiration for yourself as well.\u003cbr\u003eAs my pledgers, you will be given, basically, my mind - in short doses of inspiration. Each pledge will go to help improve my art. A long-term goal for these pledges is my enrollment into Full Sail Academy to complete my education and most likely getting a job in either animation or CGI/special effects/storytelling, basically anything that involves art. Art is my passion and my mind breathes it. The short term goal is that a portion of it will go to getting resources that will allow me to continue maturing in the meantime. As you will see, I usually make my art via 3D software, particularly DAZ Studio 4, sort of an archive program that you can buy props and scenes for. \u003cbr\u003eI thank you in advance for being interested in me! I am always looking for constructive criticism and new ideas and am always open to both. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future!\u003cbr\u003e"
