    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHey, hey Patreon! My name is Isabela Escobar and I\u0027m a visual artist and storyteller!\u003cbr\u003e I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e making comics, telling stories using visual mediums such as animation, sculpting, illustrating, designing, making books and much, much more. I specialize in character design, visual development, and concept art.\u003cbr\u003e This is a picture I drew of myself, its not entirely accurate and albeit a little bit idealized but yeah, this is sort of what I look like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig08.deviantart.net/9aa3/f/2016/344/f/9/profile_picture_by_msraggamuffin-dar6p6b.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, ok, here is an actual selfie of what I look like in case you\u0027re the type of person who likes to see the face behind the creations, cause you know, It\u00b4s nice to put a face on a concept and whatnot i getcha im also a very visual person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-mia1-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15940783_1101790136634052_8724582517518884053_n.jpg?oh=79fe886be04304c6beffb41063cff9fd\u0026amp;oe=58DEA323\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo anyway, I found out about this Patreon thing a while ago but i really never got the cojones to step up and commit to actually doing it. Its an incredible idea, I mean, its almost like an artist Non-Profit ONG! But, I was always a but nervous to take the plunge into this whole entrepreneurship world. It seemed a little scary, and asking for money is \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e a very awkward thing. But now that I am close to graduating from school, and that rent is a real thing i have to take care of, I feel like I\u0027m more ready than ever to take this exciting new step into being a full-time freelance illustrator and storyteller. The problem is that I\u00a0want to spend more time creating art, but if I do then I deprived myself of time that could be used towards creating a stable income. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m still a little scared and this is all new to me. Ok, fine, my metaphorical undies are heavy with poop... But the bottom line is, I want to do this...\u003cbr\u003eI want to do this for the people who have always shown interest and support for my art. I want to take the chance, dive into the deep end and commit to something bigger, something thats going to help me develop into a fully realized artist. I want to grow! And every cent that you guys decide to give me is going to be put right back into creating more art and content. I already have amazing ideas of what kinds of things I want to make for you guys! Just Imagine the Enamel pins! The Patches! The posters, the prints, the t- shirts, and omg the stickers. So. Many. Stickers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first milestone in my campaign will be put into ordering merchandise for you guys and have a decent stock of goodies. All profits of sales of the first batch will be put into creating my first self-published story book titled AMAZONA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really counting on you guys to take a moment to at least look at this project and see what its about. Your time means the world to me and the fact that you even came here to check it out is amazing as is! Here\u00b4s a a future of bright creating. Chin-chin!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
