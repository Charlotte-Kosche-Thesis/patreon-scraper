(I sometimes go by the name IronStylus on the internets)\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI hail formerly from Riot Games. I make concept art for a living. I come from a very straight-forward pipeline in terms of developing concept art for various world-building purposes. I work in several stages when it comes to developing anything from a character, a vehicle, prop, or environment. On Patreon I\u0027m going to show how I generally approach my concepts, with some fun other stuff in there as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e How I tend to work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rough sketches/thumbnails. Very loose, often smaller explorations of a subject. This is where I show how I generate ideas. I\u0027ll be showing various versions of whatever thing I\u0027m working on, for the purpose of eventually cutting them down into a design I\u0027d like to build from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Tight drawing/line art concept. This is where I\u0027ll take whatever I\u0027ve decided to persue on the thumbnail exploration and flesh it out into a tighter and more cohesive drawing. This is where I\u0027ll finalize the design in preparation to make a painted concept.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Final concept. A fully colored and rendered piece of art that serves the purpose of handing to a 3D artist to make a model, a costume designer to make an outfit out of, a fabricator to make a prop, or any other way that concept art can be brought to life for various media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll be making:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, beyond that I\u0027ll be creating various piece of art. The art I\u0027ll be posting will range from traditional sketches, digital sketches, fully rendered concepts/illustrations and Zbrush models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be showing off exploration and ideation, process and technique, along with some tidbits as to how you can approach the industry, hopefully giving some good pointers that will make learning clearer and focused.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is educational for me too! I\u0027ll probably stumble all over the place since I\u0027m trying new styles and approaches all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
