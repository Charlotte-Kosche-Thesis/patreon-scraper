I have an education in Graphic Design, I was a Front End Web Developer for 5 years (that included a lot of CSS work!), and I\u0027ve recently done JavaScript with Hardware. For the last year, I\u0027ve been focusing on my health and getting better, and I\u0027m happy to do a lot more. I enjoy spending time with my animals, my friends, and exercising! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude01\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, when I\u0027m not taking of my lambs or lifting weights at the gym, \u003cstrong\u003eI like to explore creative ideas, using digital formats, code, and hardware.\u003c/strong\u003e Using my experiences, I want to help people have resources, inspiration, and materials to use and learn from, so that they can be able to make their own creations, on the web and in the real world! \ud83d\ude4c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\ud83e\udd14\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to make a Patreon, in order to cover the costs of certain bills, as well as living, but also to have the time to create articles as well as explore ideas, as well as acquire extra materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things I want to do with Patreon is to make working on creative things a big focus for me. I have a lot of ideas (a lot of of them are very stupid!), but I\u0027d like to bolster myself and focus on making things I have ambition in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat do you intend to make?\ud83d\ude1b\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question! A lot of the time, I\u0027m exploring small ideas and techniques using languages like JavaScript, and I write about them on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hackster.io/IainIsCreative\"\u003eHackster.io\u003c/a\u003e. I want to explore making physical things and apply JavaScript to electronics, as well as IoT components and services. People seem to really enjoy the things I do, so I guess I\u0027m doing something right!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I\u0027ll be entering the world of robot combat for the first time, and I want to get people inspired to help people build their own and learn about the awesome world of robots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eOkay cool! So what\u0027s in it for me? \ud83e\udd13\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to pledge to me, I want to give things back to you folks for supporting me.

In addition, you\u0027ll be able to see things behind the scenes, and certain announcements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you\u0027ll be able to get resources and materials for your own use, before it\u0027s open source or sold to the public! You\u0027ll get materials before the public sees it, and you\u0027ll be able to see posts and content the public will not be able to see! You get a glimpse into my world and be able to see content that\u0027s patron exclusive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSounds awesome!
