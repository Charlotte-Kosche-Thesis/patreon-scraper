My long term vision is that eventually all sciences, intellectual fields and disciplines will reach the point of singularity with Art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore that happens officially I am here sharing with you my trajectory towards the abstract and profound + a global community/assembly of minds that act and collaborate towards greater understanding of art and future. I created \u003ca href=\"http://www.ideasrex.com\"\u003ewww.ideasrex.com\u003c/a\u003e to share my own multidisciplinary creations/ideas and \u003ca href=\"http://www.musebuz.com\"\u003ewww.musebuz.com\u003c/a\u003e to help inspire both you and me with the ideas/creations of others (both past and present). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ideasrex.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mesphere.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u003cstrong\u003e official \u201cabo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eut me\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e is the following: A concert pianist since early childhood (piano found me and lead me to the road of conventional concert halls which I gladly replaced with recordings as I discovered about the Colosseum and the bloody/ruthless history of performance), a painter and visual artist throughout formative years (because I wanted to transform my musical thoughts into visual), eternally deeply interested in philosophy and psychology (because both fields are instrumental in our ability to reach broader understanding of things around us), learnt coding and webdesign (because internet and computers were the best things that happened to humankind in recent history and I needed to explore more), was involved with sustainable projects and eco-oriented initiatives (because I believe that Earth has the right to live and we should become more sustainable and responsible being a living part of it), built web-based businesses (because economy and financial world were very important to learn about), aspiring astronomer (this is something that awaits me in the future). You can read my seriously serious official \u201cabout me\u201d at \u003ca href=\"http://www.irinaklyuev.com\"\u003ewww.irinaklyuev.com\u003c/a\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://irinaklyuev.com/images/gallery/ir20.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon found me? \u003c/strong\u003eIt has been almost a year since people started talking about Patreon, and asking me why am I not on it? To be frank, I had misgivings because attempting to monetize can compromise a work of creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn many instances throughout history and with certain exceptions, art has rarely been monetarily appreciated at the time of its creation. Van Gogh for instance sold only one painting during his lifetime (after his death the world became mature enough to appreciate his genius). J.S. Bach wasn\u2019t even regarded a composer during his lifetime (but organist was his profession and means to living); he was only discovered and appreciated 200 years after his death. So too with Cezanne, El Greco, Manet, Gauguin,\u2026 the list goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reality is that truly visionary art pieces (music, visual, writings,..) are rarely appreciated/understood by their contemporaries because they are so far into the future and that it is only logical that they be discovered and appreciated by future generations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I do believe that today is different in comparison to previous times in that we have communities which internet enables and, in addition, we have independent means of communication and sharing with those whose lives we touch, and that is what this Patreon page is all about, and that is why I have decided to join Patreon. It helps to enable me to spend the time and effort to share my own creations (ranging from visual, through music, writings, to futurism and technology) and mutually inspire the creation of a supportive community not only to myself but also to each other. \u003cbr\u003e"
