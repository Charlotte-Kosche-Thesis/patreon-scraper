    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/iwontuseanumber\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI make videos about nerdy stuff on the internet.\u003c/a\u003e I really, REALLY like anime and video games (and cartoons and television and books and comics and . . .) and I want to expose people to things that they might enjoy too. I mostly make positive reviews of anime and video games. It\u0027s sort of like I\u0027m recommending stuff that you might be interested in. I also occasionally review other things, make analysis videos, and make negative reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow for the actual \u003cem\u003ework\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0part of this whole affair.\u00a0The amount of time it takes for an individual video can vary wildly. First of all there\u0027s actually experiencing the content: I can watch a 24 episode anime like Noragami in a day whereas a game like The Witcher 3 could take well over 100 hours to experience. Scripting and editing are also highly variable timesinks. I\u0027ve had reviews that are two and a half minutes long and reviews that are nearly twenty minutes long: I\u0027ll say what I feel I need to say about any given thing regardless of how long that may take and I insist on doing my own editing so I can show specifically what I want to show. Assuming there are no massive delays such as writer\u0027s block or editing errors, the scripting and editing process for a 12 hour game or 12-24 episode anime\u00a0\u003cem\u003eusually\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0takes 8-12 hours, though I\u0027m sure outliers have existed before and will exist again. Longer (or even simply more complex games) can take upwards of 20 hours to complete a video on and the amount of time longer shows can take to make videos on varies on how spoiler heavy that show is. When I have the opportunity to focus on video making full time, I will upload an average of 2-4 videos per month, barring outside issues such as personal family matters or copyright problems with my YouTube account. All of these numbers are just to give you an idea of what you should expect, the whole point of going through Patreon is to get to a place where I can dedicate the vast majority of my time to making videos without any time based restrictions on what things I choose to make videos about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for Patron rewards, there will be three tiers, for now. This may all change as time goes on, all of this is very experimental for me. Higher tiers give access to everything in the lower tier as well. The $1 Tier will let you view my Patrons only blog (hosted here on Patreon) where I will make a post each Sunday explaining what I did with that week in regards to content creation and what upcoming plans for content creation are. You will also get access to the Patrons Only Discord Server where you can chat with myself and other patrons. This discord server will be the first place I go to find people to co-op games with me if people I personally know in real life are, for whatever reason, busy. The $5 Tier will allow you to influence the channel by voting in occasional polls where I ask patrons what thing I should make a review of next. Initially these will be rather infrequent, probably one every few months, as I need to focus on attracting new viewers and patrons, but if I get to the point where Patreon is my primary source of income these polls will become far more frequent and give my patrons even more control over the content of my videos. The $10 Tier gives an additional vote in these polls and allows mod status on the Discord server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve loved this stuff since I was a child and being able to have a career focused on spreading my love for these various nerdy things would be an absolute dream come true.\u003cbr\u003e"
