Currently that\u0027s primarily\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/sephie\"\u003eSephie\u003c/a\u003e, my loose adaptation on the Persephone mythology, but also includes shorter projects, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://izziillustrates.bigcartel.com/product/nino-comic\"\u003eNino\u003c/a\u003e, my all ages adventure comic from 2015, and my most recent comic,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://izziillustrates.bigcartel.com/product/the-ink-witch-comic\"\u003eThe Ink Witch\u003c/a\u003e, a queer romance comic about magical tattoos and relationship stumbling blocks. I want to make stories and art that represents people who don\u0027t often see themselves in fantasy stories - LGBTQ+ characters, complex, nuanced women, POC - and many variations thereupon. I\u0027m still learning and pushing myself forward, and patreon gives me an opportunity to connect with my audience, get your feedback - and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why should you help me out? All my Sephie pages are currently on Tapastic to be viewed by anyone at any time, and that\u0027s unlikely to change the future. But currently, the comic is going at a much slower pace than I would like (updating fortnightly instead of weekly) and by getting a small amount of extra income, I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more of my hours to making art. You\u0027ll be ensuring that I continue to make a story you love, and hopefully gain access to it even faster - and also help make physical copies a reality, when I\u0027ve amassed enough chapters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn practical terms, you\u0027ll be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ehelping me pay for art materials such as sketchbooks, pens, pencil leads etc\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eallowing me to upgrade to photoshop CC instead of using my outdated CS5\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epaying towards printing costs for physical copies of my comics and other cool things to sell, such as badges, enamel pins and stickers! :O\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emy travel and hotel costs for events like Thought Bubble, which I really want to keep attending.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epaying me for the hard work I put into Sephie and other comics!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Sephie?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the hidden mountain kingdom of Ilia, the descendants of gods live in decadent comfort, largely ignorant of the outside world. Their ancestors, the creators of this world and many others, have receded into myth and legend, and the Godspring bear little of their responsibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe heir of the Deciduade line, Persephone, daughter of Demeter, doesn\u0027t want any of this. She feels bored, stifled, pampered: she craves adventure, intrigue, escape.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSephie\u0027s story starts with her doing the unheard of: she runs away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see other things I do, please head over to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://izzi-illustrates.tumblr.com\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/izziward/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://izziward.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e!
