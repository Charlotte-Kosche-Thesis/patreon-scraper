    "summary": "Hey Idiot! (That\u0027s you! And me! And everyone sometimes!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, if you\u0027re here, thank you for supporting me and my podcast, Ignorance is #Blessed. Even if you\u0027re only considering becoming a patron, the fact that you listen really warms my heart. It\u0027s truly a pleasure attempting to overcome ignorance by asking ignorant questions to all of my podcast guests and I hope you enjoy listening to them as much as I enjoy creating them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve stumbled on this page by accident, here\u0027s a little rundown of what I\u0027m creating: My name is Jessica Michelle Singleton (@JMScomedy if you see me on social media, which--by the way--has led people to simply start calling me JMS a lot lately.) I\u0027m a professional, internationally touring stand up comedian and I host a podcast called \"Ignorance is #Blessed\" where I interview guests from all walks of life and ask ignorant questions as a way to learn and get past misconceptions (and also for the entertainment of those who enjoy cringing when I ask things like \"Why can\u0027t I say the N word?\" and \"Are you sure you\u0027re not just making up your (fill in the blank with various mental illnesses)?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to keep most conversations light enough for laughs but we do get deep sometimes so it\u0027s technically a Society \u0026amp; Culture podcast rather than a comedy one. Luckily for those who enjoy comedy, I make a joke out of literally everything in life. AND if you want more of my comedy, I tour all over and will hopefully be somewhere near you in the future!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon to help fund the production costs the podcast which is more with my schedule getting busier because I\u0027ve had to hire someone to start editing the sound (if you\u0027ve noticed an improvement, spoiler alert: it\u0027s not because I got better at sound engineering). I pay by episode and am trying to put more out regularly so it addes up. Between that, funding my one woman show for Edinburgh and my medical bills for trying to keep my Rheumatoid Arthritis at bay (UGH), there\u0027s a LOT more money going out than coming in. Plus I would love to be able to fund other content/cool projects in the future for your entertainment so I thought, why not?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am genuinely thankful to anyone who comes here and pledges even a dollar as I still have not developed the self-worth skills necessary to believe anyone would actually love me enough to invest in me. So congratulations on helping me break that barrier and thank you for participating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
