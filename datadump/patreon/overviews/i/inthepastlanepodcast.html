O\u0027Donnell, the historian who started the In The Past Lane podcast (http://inthepastlane.com/) in January 2016.\u00a0Each episode takes on a fascinating topic in American history. I interview historians and documentary film makers, speak with museum curators, and create narrative features. I also talk about history in the news (Confederate monuments and all that). My aim is to be both engaging and entertaining, but also informative and thought-provoking.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut creating podcast episodes is SUPER time-consuming and since I have a real job (college professor) and other projects (writing books, public speaking, etc), I\u0027d greatly appreciate some financial support that would allow me to outsource tasks like editing. Support would also help pay for the monthly costs of the podcast hosting service and website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAny amount, even a dollar per month, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Each we\u003ca href=\"http://inthepastlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/EdODonnellPromo_Jan2016_10x8Lg.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eek host and Historian-at-Large, Edward T. O\u0027Donnell, correspondents, and guests bring you news, stories, interviews, and special features on all things history. Our aim is to be both engaging and entertaining, but also informative and thought-provoking. We are inspired by the notion that history is not just about the past. History is about us, here and now.  It explains the world we live in and why things are the way they are.  And history gives us insights into how to achieve a better future. So our focus is on the past, but always with an eye to the present and future.  We hope you\u2019ll come along with us as we journey In The Past Lane.",
