If you\u2019re an OG fan of our original web-series BACKYARD FX, you may have learned how to create special effects projects like zombie makeup, halo armor, or lightsabers from our tutorials, or maybe you enjoyed some of our wacky \u201ctest films\u201d like Harry Potter Rap Battle or Wolverine the Musical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell INDY MOGUL IS BACK and we\u0027re doing our best to bring it back to life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Your Help: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nLong story short: Erik \u0026amp; Justin created Indy Mogul, but never really owned it. Since it\u2019s inception in 2007 it was actually owned and funded by a few different companies. First by a startup called Next New Networks and later by a giant video platform site that you\u2019ve probably heard of. It rhymes with \u201cBouTube\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 \u201cBouTube\u201d sadly decided to stop funding Indy Mogul and Erik \u0026amp; Justin were all like \u201cNOOO!\u201d :(\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then in 2016 \u201cBouTube\u201d (you guys all know we\u2019re talking about Youtube right?) anyway, YOUTUBE generously offered turn over ownership of Indy Mogul to Erik \u0026amp; Justin and they were all like \u201cYAY!\u201d :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen E\u0026amp;J remembered how much time and money it takes to make awesome videos every week and were all like, \u201cOh snap, how the hell are we going to pay for this?\u201d  :|\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAaaaaaand that brings us to now...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eBy popular demand, we\u0027ve brought back our Backyard FX series, hosted by the awesome William Jakespeare. Our current goal, is to raise enough money to pay William to keep the show going for us on a monthly basis. As you know, YouTube money just ain\u0027t what it used to be - and since we\u0027re not getting billions of views, we need your help to keep it going!\u003cbr\u003e"
