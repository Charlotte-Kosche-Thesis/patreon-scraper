    "summary": "Hi! Thank you so much for checking out our Patreon page and supporting us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this podcast anyway, and why should I care?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here you probably know what \"\u003cstrong\u003eI Never Saw That\u003c/strong\u003e\" is about, but just in case you don\u0027t know, our premise is that we watch or listen to the \u003cstrong\u003epop culture\u003c/strong\u003e that I (Jen) missed from \u003cstrong\u003e1994-1996\u003c/strong\u003e. Why did I miss the pop culture from those years, you ask? Well, I had some \u003cem\u003eissues\u003c/em\u003e, and was sent away from home at age 16 (listen to our intro episode for more context!) for two years. I lived at a \"therapeutic boarding school\" in The Middle of Nowhere, Montana, where I was removed from the outside world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe experience of being in Montana is a part of my life that I am, and will always be, processing and dealing with. I have been looking for a way to share my strange Montana story for a long time, and when this idea came to me it felt like a great way to do that, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e to check out the stuff I missed while I was away. \u003cstrong\u003eMissing two years of pop culture from the ages of 16-18 was significant. \u003c/strong\u003eI missed some things that were part of what shaped my generation. And as we say in our intro episode, this podcast is a fun way of acknowledging my time in Montana without it being too dark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMicah, my husband, is my co-host and our sound engineer. We are both creative people, and doing a creative project together is an incredibly special experience for us. Also, we were DJs together in college, where we met, so doing a podcast feels like some sort of full circle. Isn\u0027t that sweet? \u003cstrong\u003eYes. It is.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we asking for money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor one thing, our podcast will get better and more enjoyable to listen to if we can buy new equipment and sound editing software!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut also,\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0it turns out that making a podcast, and more importantly, making a \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0podcast takes a\u00a0\u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of time and work, and in order for us to continue putting in this kind of time and work, we need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Right now Jen is spending all of her time working on this, which means she is bringing in no income, which is not sustainable for us. If you believe in what we\u0027re doing and want to help us continue, please consider pledging $2 or more per month. Think about it this way. We release an episode each week, which means if you pledge $2 a month, you are paying approximately $.50 per episode. $10 a month would be $2.50 per episode, and so on. In other words, not a lot! But \u003cstrong\u003eeven a small contribution will help us so much.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s awkward to ask people for money. I hate it actually. But unfortunately this is the reality for a lot of creators. This kind of work is seen as a hobby (and for some, it is!), is undervalued, and since it\u0027s available for free people don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth\u00a0paying for. \u003cstrong\u003eWe hope you disagree.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e much. Really, we can\u0027t thank you enough. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you thank you thank you\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSee you in the \u002790s,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJen and Micah\u003c/strong\u003e"
