For those who don\u0027t know what fingerstyle is, it\u0027s basically a one man band. The style can include bass, percussion, lead, rhythm and vocals in an arrangement played on one guitar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can request your own favorite song and get it both arranged (guitar tablature / sheet) and recorded in mp3 to bring with you and listen to wherever you go\u003c/strong\u003e. The process usually requires a lot of time arranging, rearranging, practicing, recording and editing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour pledge as a patron will help increase the quality of my arrangements and improve your listening experience.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are more interested in hearing a guitar cover of a pop song (singer/band), It can also be arranged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
