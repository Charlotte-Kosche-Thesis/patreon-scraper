    "summary": "This is my Patreon. Thank you for visiting!\u003cbr\u003eHow this works is that, since I post at least one image a day on DeviantArt, I usually stock pile and preschedule my drawings for at least a week in advance. That means that I build up a stash of art that has not yet been seen by the public. So, I decided that I might as well post them on Patreon, since I got an account in order to support my friend. My current plan is to post any drawing on this Patreon, the moment that\u00a0I make it. This could be days, weeks, or even months before that particular art is scheduled to post on DeviantArt. That means that, by becoming a Patron, you can get early access to all of my content. Due to the varying quality of my content, I decided to go with a monthly flat rate payment instead of charging per creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only art that I will not post here is the Ultra Fight Akiris comic. For that, you must go to PrettyBareFootBoy\u0027s Patreon, which I highly recommend over mine. He is in need of income much more than I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for Ultra Fight Gaoh and Fan Art of TJ \"\"\"\"\"Henry\"\"\"\"\" Yoshi, even though I post Gaoh early on FurAffinity and I post Henry art early on Henry Booru, I see no harm in also putting them here, seeing as there is a monthly payment, and I want to make it worth the dollar a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested, then please feel free to join. However, I do not want to force anyone into it. I will probably be putting my art here regardless of whether or not anyone sees it, as posting my work somewhere motivates me to draw more.\u003cbr\u003e"
