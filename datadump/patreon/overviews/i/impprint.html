I am the designer for Imp Print, an indie game company I run in my spare time. I grew up playing boardgames and role-playing games and have always loved creating new and exciting games and adventures. A few years ago I took the leap and started publishing my own games. I want to continue to design games, but I need your help. In order to take time away from my day job to focus on game design I need to ensure I will be still making the money I need to keep a roof over my head. In exchange for the support I will be releasing free print and play versions of all of my designs. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat have you made?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a few games currently available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.thegamecrafter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Game Crafter\u003c/a\u003e. Holiday Beatdown, Bottle Barrel Brick, Gridiron Dice and others. Most of my games are fast, casual games designed to be playable almost anywhere by novice or experienced gamers. In the past, my games were only available for purchase. Going forward, you will be able to play these games and provide feedback for free, effectively joining me in the creative process of making a game people will love.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMaking\n games is a fun and fulfilling pastime but I can\u0027t really spend the \ntime I want to spend on it without some financial assistance. Plus, \nI want to take my games to conventions and that takes a lot of extra dough. So if you like my games, it would be really cool of you to help! Patreon allows me to gather support for my designs, and only charges my patrons when I complete a release. You can select a monthly cap of how much you are willing to spend, so if I somehow manage to release more than a single game in a month you are only charged the maximum you are willing to spend. Fortunately, regardless of whether or not you support me, I will continue to make games and you will be able to download and play them for free.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe\n best part is that you\u0027re not charged if I don\u0027t produce! So you\u0027re never left wondering where your contribution went and \nwhen you\u0027re going to get something in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat counts as a \"version release\"?A\n version release, for the purposes of earning your contribution, is a \nnew release of one of my games. While they\u0027re still in playtesting, \nthat means each time I release a new beta version with significant \nupdates, that\u0027s a version release. When a game is completed, that\u0027s a \nversion release. When a new version of an expansion is released, that\u0027s a\n version release. At my current pace, I don\u0027t typically have new \nreleases any more frequent than once a month, and more typically several\n months apart. Once I get support that will change!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA significant release means that it has to have real \u003cem\u003emeat\u003c/em\u003e to\n it. We can\u0027t just update three cards and call that a new version. To \nqualify, a release must have significant updates in the form of art, \nrules changes, mechanics updates, and/or meaningful wording updates and \nmust be different enough to qualify as a separate version from the last!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat do I get out of this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou get the satisfaction of helping to create great games! Joining in the playtesting and the dialog about each game release. Your opinion will be heard and help shape the final version of each game. You also can get awesome stuff, depending on what tier you pledge to! Check those out below -- \nand thank you for your support!"
