And thank you for checking out my Patreon! My goal with this whole thing is to make content I\u0027m super motivated and inspired to do all while pushing my limits as an artist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been mainly a commission artist for 10 years and I\u0027d love to branch out and do some more personal stuff like fanart, rule 34, comics, and merchandise. I want to create these things in the same way I would want artists that I love to create new content and also try new techniques out and experiment a bit. I also want you, the viewers to let me know what you want to see as well, we can have this communication and support that Patreon allows the creators and audience to have and I can\u0027t wait to see the results of these projects I\u0027m planning on making!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere will be no paywall to see the artwork.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll of the artwork will eventually be posted publicly. The perks of being a patron are getting to see such things much earlier than when it will be posted and give input on what is created!

We will be teaming up to bring you a short story comic in hopes of showing you guys what we can do together as a team! And then after you get a taste of what we can do together- we will bring forward 4 ideas. I will do a sample picture for each idea, and then we will have you all vote on what comic you\u0027d like to see the most first. And then second, third and forth! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat do you get from supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eEveryone who at least supports with $1.00 a month gets access to full res files and PSDs, voting power, and early access to everything as my thank you for the support.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigher tiers means higher prizes, like chances at a free sketch per month or an icon, getting access to my tutorial blog, getting to request content to be up for voting, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe more support I get, the more things will be available like monthly request streams, recordings of me working on pieces so you can see my process, and more time dedicated to bring my personal stories and characters to life as well as fanart pieces of characters we all love!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
