    "summary": "After my first trip across Canada I became very interested trying to capture part of what makes traveling by bicycle (or else!) so interesting, inspiring and unique. In April 2014 I took off to cycle around the world I also decided to try and document the journey as best as I can. Since then I have released 14 episodes of a series titled\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\"SEE THE WORLD\"\u003c/strong\u003e which will follow my journey from Alaska to Argentina and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThese entire series are all available for free \u003c/strong\u003e(and always will be)\u003cstrong\u003e on\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll along it has been a dream to just keep riding and making the videos on the way. A friend suggested to connect a donation link to my website and since then things have slowly headed that way - allowing me to continue my trip past Mexico in 2015 and even even purchase a packraft for paddling The Darien Gap. This page here allows for a monthly, recurring donation to keep the rubberside down and it has been what kept me going through 2017 and it is looking like it will in the years to come. If not able, please do not feel obligated at all to help, it is also my dream to share the experiences from the road with others and just seeing the videos is enough!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehow the money will be used:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0A good chunk would go toward trip expenses (food, parts, etc.) and also being able to stop somewhere, rent a laptop or PC and work on a new episode. Extras go toward new camera equipment and replacing old ones (current rate is about 1 mirrorless or point and shoot every 6-8months). In december 2017 I was able to get a drone for filming and episodes 24, 25 and 26 will feature drone footage!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to filming equipment, the sky is really the limit so if this page becomes more successful, all this will go toward that and in the future maybe working on some sort of a feature length film of say, riding from The Land of Ice to the Land of Fire (Alaska to Patagonia).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards: \u003c/strong\u003eI will always try to have something new for all patrons each month, most likely an early link to a new episode but I can try other things as well (ideas welcome! wallpapers? cards?) All patrons will be mentioned in the videos (first and last name - if you become a patron and would not like that do not enter a last name or email me at iohan.gue@gmail.com). See the panel on the right for all current rewards. Anything with postcards being mentioned can be delayed until I can find a place to send from... but it will eventually get there, i promise.\u003cbr\u003e*note: for the HQ downloads episodes are still being uploaded\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enew episodes release schedule\u003c/strong\u003e: As this is monthly page here is some info on how often I make content. I do not want to do the Patreon cycle \"per creation\" as this would somehow put a price tag on the videos I am making and I want to stay away from that. In general there will be a SEE THE WORLD full episode at least every 2 months (as of 2018) and something small in between.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything up to episode 24 (peru) is available on youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for being a part of this, or for thinking of being a part of this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTailwinds,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eiohan gueorguiev\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.s. also a short video on what is Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/L3VF1oeL66o\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/L3VF1oeL66o\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_iIWdqNuRQ\"\u003ea short video of the story so far (North America)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003emore info, story \u0026amp; route, gear, etc. at \u003ca href=\"http://www.bikewanderer.com/\"\u003ewww.bikewanderer.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
