     "about": "I started like most people my age. Sitting too close to the TV most evenings playing Super Nintendo. My family never had a lot of money for games so the few I had I cherished. I always had a computer infront of me growing up. My parents new the value in me being able to find my way around a computer and it had a major impact on who I am today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began streaming in 2011. I was enthralled by it but that year was a rough time in my life. I was struggling for work, dropped out of school, and I was just trying to survive my student debt. I began streaming as a way to escape but it never really took off.\u003cbr\u003eI found myself floundering and let streaming go for a while. After focusing on myself and my future I found a tech job in a network operations center and began living comfortably. I was able to finally approach my favorite hobbies again one of which was streaming.\u003cbr\u003eI started back out slowly. I found a few streamers who I got along with and enjoyed spending time with and looking back I realize those people who eventually set me on the path I am on now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that gamers are good people and my community is proof of that. in July 2015 we raised over $1300 for charity (extra-life.org and wounded warriors) during my first ever 24 hour stream. Each and everytime I start my stream I do it with the intention of showing others that gamers are whole-heartedly the most generous and loving people on this planet.\u003cbr\u003e",
