    "summary": "Back on May 1st 2013 Laura Kate Dale, Isaac Federspiel and Jose San Mateo launched a gaming website as part of a six month long exercise for a writing class. Having come together as part of a twelve person course on games writing hosted by ex-IGN EIC Hilary Goldstein, our final challenge as a class was to go away by ourselves and set up our own website where we could put our new skills to the test and write about video games in whatever way best suited us. For more than half a year we fought among ourselves about core focus, editorial tone, scoring systems and what would and would not fit into our chosen niche of coverage. We lost a great many writers along the way, but what we eventually created was IndieHaven.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we launched the site over a year ago it was just the three of us, meeting online and working from far flung corners of the world. We had very little in the way of Indie scene contacts and very little physical presence to establish ourselves with, but we dived right into our local Indie game communities and started talking to developers, playing games and getting our name out to everyone who would listen. In the year since then we have appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live, made numerous convention and event appearances and run a podcast for 50 consecutive weeks with guests ranging from Mike Bithell and Jonathan Blow to a nine year old developer named Ian. We have run developer and critic roundtables, we\u0027ve affected change in games through important early articles and we have gone from a couple of people posting as and when they could to a multinational team of volunteers keeping up a strong daily content schedule.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you reading this will hopefully already know about our site either as a reader, or as a developer we have worked with on content. I would like to believe that the quality and breadth of our content speaks for itself, but there is a catch - the bit where we want money from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndie Haven as a site runs ads on the side of our page, but due to the highly prevalent use of ad blocker software and the fact that we cater to a niche audience our ad revenue is almost non existent. You\u0027d probably struggle to buy a chocolate bar for what we make off our ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndie haven will always remain a free site to every reader, no level or lack of support will see us implement any kind of pay wall to our content. We love what we do and we love doing it, we\u0027d just like to be able to avoid some of the costs that currently have to come from our pockets being a deterrent or wall stopping us from being able to do what we want with the site. The editorial staff have handled the site hosting costs, Laura has handled the podcast hosting fees and any equipment costs, travel and accommodation to cover events and resources we need to create content come directly out of the pocket of the writer doing the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to be able to cover our hosting costs, to cover any out of pocket expenses relating to improving the site and it\u0027s coverage and create a fund which can be used to pay for equipment, travel, accommodation and similar expenses for our writers to take some of the financial burden from them. Who knows, if we hit a high enough goal we\u0027d love to pay one of our editors to work full time on the site, but that\u0027s possibly a bit ambitious for today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there we go. We will keep Indie Haven free, but we would like to be able to avoid our staff having to go out of pocket to keep creating the content you love. Every month your donation will go to ensuring we can keep up our daily content schedule and regular content, with reward for each stretch goal we hit. Thank you, and hope you continue to enjoy our content for years to come."
