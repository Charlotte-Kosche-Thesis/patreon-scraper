I\u0027m an adjunct professor, part time bridgetender, occasional uber driver, and publisher of Inkst Magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInkst is the feeling of angst that motivates one to step forward and express an opinion, to make themself a part of what they think is an important conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat inkst can be totally self-serving, or it can suit a higher purpose. As a teacher of critical thinking and civic literacy, I think it must be the latter, but I also realize that people often respond most positively to acts of self-discovery.\u00a0In other words, it\u0027s important to be aware of and involved in our greater community, but it\u0027s easier to do this when we see other\u0027s struggling to do it themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s the focus behind Inkst Magazine. Feeling and sharing inkst, using different types of writing to teach critical thinking and foster civic literacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThe to-do list\u003c/h1\u003eThis is the to-do list for the next two months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA complete redesign of the website and efficient use of all social media platforms.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI just made a switch to a wordpress theme that reflects the initial vision of the magazine, and I\u0027m totally stoked. This is cleaner and more responsive, but the SEO leaves a little to be desired. It also takes advantage of social media platforms in a few ways the old site set-up did not. This will be discussed more in the patrons-only posts section. The important part is over the next two months the website and everything connected to it will expanded and improved.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn Inkst store\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m going to open a store. This will be discussed more in the patrons-only posts sections. There will be numerous sticker, t-shirt, and merchandise designs. This will be to entice potential patrons, for sales and additional fund-raising opportunities, and to get the Inkst brand out there. Merchandise will be high-quality with interesting graphics.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClarification of the rewards tiers and goals\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnce the shop is up and running, the rewards will actually mean something, those who join now will be able to take advantage of the rewards before making two monthly donations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe goals will be more specific and clear. This will be discussed in the post section where all patrons can read and discuss. The purpose is mainly transparency and commitment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIntegration of all monetization opportunities.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTranslated: All ads and affiliate contracts in place. There will not be many, because the goal is not to create a website that is bombarded with advertising, but what advertising the magazine will ever have will be in place and poised to exploit any high traffic spikes and steadier growth. I will blog about this in case you\u0027r interested in what this means--open to all patrons.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThank you!\u003c/h1\u003eI\u0027m thrilled that you like reading Inkst, and I want you to imagine how much bigger and better it can be with your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards tiers will be improved upon and fleshed out with time, resources, and feedback. I want to provide a lot of benefit and goodies to the people that help Inkst grow. So look for changes and additions to the reward levels as the weeks progress. There will be posts here weekly, and patrons will have access to more posts and content as well as whatever rewards are included in corresponding tiers. So check back here regularly, whether you\u0027re able to donate or not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, your interest, and your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eP.S.\u003c/h3\u003eThis Patreon page is a work in progess.
