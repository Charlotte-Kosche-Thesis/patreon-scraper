Insane Throttle dives deep into the news and issues that face our Lifestyle everyday. We here at Insane Throttle led by James \"Hollywood\" Macecari take on the tough issues that no other biker site will. We pride ourselves with being totally independent without any loyalty to any motorcycle club or person. This independence allows Insane Throttle to give hard hitting editorials on subjects that face all of us as a biker community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith over 25 years experience in the Motorcycle Club scene in and around Chicago, both as a patch holder and now independent, I give a no-nonsense look at all the issues that face all bikers and especially motorcycle clubs. I no longer have preferences to which side of the fence to be on when it comes to clubs, this enables me to be honest without any misconceptions or determinations towards one group or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout no \"Horse in the Race,\" as I like to say, I\u0027m able to write openly and honestly, regardless of what the masses think. One thing you will find about me and my articles, I do not follow the mob mentality. I like to ask the hard questions and decide for myself. This is something every man should do, find out the facts, then make the choice you see fit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJames \"Hollywood\" Macecari is also the host of \"Motorcycle Madhouse\" Insane Throttles newest podcast. This podcast can be found on Itunes, I heart Radio as well as other platforms such as our Youtube Channel and Facebook.
