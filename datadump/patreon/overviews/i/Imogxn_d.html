    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Imogen, I\u0027m a linguistics student from Northern England and my passion for language has transferred itself into a blog. After suffering from depression and eating disorders in silence for a great many years I decided upon my recovery to do my bit for the community. The idea that other people may suffer quietly the way that I did broke my heart, I never wanted that to happen to anyone else. Thus, Imogxn_d was born.\u003cbr\u003eI like to term myself as an \u0027everything else\u0027 blogger. But I focus largely on self love, body positivity and the importance of mental health and care. The most heart warming feeling I have ever experienced is when young people contact me to tell me I have helped them have a better view on themselves; I could stop now, happy that I had helped those few handfuls of people.\u003cbr\u003eBut I don\u0027t want to stop, I want to continue to share this positivity with as many people as I possibly can. I am still in education, which means I am not obliged to go into full time work and therefore I can devote more time to my blog - however this period of education will not last forever. And I would love to make my blog my full time career, a naive dream I can admit.\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in my lovelies. Those who have followed and supported me are the most incredible people that I know, they continue to help me pursue my dreams. But as it stands now, the only way I can increase the impact I have on the younger communities who need a positive influence is through advertising. Hence my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eI can promise you that even just a $1 donation will go directly into paying for the reach of my blog to increase and flourish and touch the lives of those who need it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd for all those who do donate, here is a *great big virtual hug* because you are the most incredible type of person for believing in me and all the others who have a dream to make the world a happier place.\u00a0"
