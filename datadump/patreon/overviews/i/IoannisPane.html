Thank you also for all the support you have shown to me until now, it is\nso important for my music.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON AND HOW IT\nWORKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Patreon is a funding platform very similar to Kickstarter but with one major difference, instead of raising a lot of money for one project it collects small recurring tis for every upload of content. That way it allows people to support the creators they love by pledging money for their creations. If you like my music, and if you\u0027d like me to make more, you can\nbecome a patron and give me a small amount of money for every piece of music or\npiano cover that I upload on YouTube. You can choose how much money you want to\npledge and you can cancel it anytime you want, or reduce the amount. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have the option to set a monthly max on your pledge.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As you might already know I am a professional musician and I am also an\nindependent artist. That means that I am doing everything alone concerning\nthe creation processes, and when I say everything I mean literally\neverything...\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have been making music for many years, since I was a young teenager,\nand I have chosen to become a professional musician and make a living out of\nthis. For me there is not a path in which I can combine what I do with another\njob, because I am working very hard to create my music and everything that is\nrelevant to it, and reducing the quality of my work is not an option. My music is going to be free for you on YouTube and Spotify, as it is now, nothing is going to change. By supporting me here on Patreon you simply help me to continue creating music for you, so will not have to force myself to stop due to lack of money.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of things need to be done before the release of a piece of music. The\ncomposition, the performance, the recording, the arrangement, the mixing and\nmastering, the creation of the artwork, the making of the relevant video... Many\nof these procedures are usually done by special professionals, who also need\nmoney for their services. All these are to be made by me, and I don\u0027t mention\nthe work that needs to be done for other things, like preparing a live\nstreaming show... Making a piano cover also needs a lot of work, considering the\ntime that it needs to make the piano arrangement, to perform and record it, to\ndo the video shooting and all the video editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By giving me money you don\u0027t only pay\nfor my work but also for my equipment and the software I use (and all the\nupgrades) which are tools of major importance, without them I wouldn\u0027t be able\nto have this level of quality in my productions. You also help me to handle\nvarious expenses concerning my music releases.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u0026gt; For announcement videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026gt; For videos containing samples of live streaming shows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026gt; For any remakes of older pieces or videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eYOU WILL ONLY BE CHARGED\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u0026gt; For new original pieces and piano covers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eieces and piano covers. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please be patient if you don\u0027t see any new releases for some period, I\nhave already explained how difficult it is to finish a piece of music.
