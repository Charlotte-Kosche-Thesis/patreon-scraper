Well, not me personally.\u003cbr\u003eRather, I should say that my creations will be fulfilling your every need, no matter how perverse, dark or obscure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, \"What exactly do your creations entail?\" I hear you whimper pathetically and/or inquire confidently from behind your +1 magical electronic box of pornographic viewing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current game is called Baleful Bassinet. Though it was released for Halloween, if you enjoy the humiliation and degradation of being infantilized, it\u0027s good for any day of the year. As you dwell through a haunted manor, your mind and life are at risk. Can you trudge through the macabre madness of a forced second babyhood? There\u0027s only one way to find out. If you\u0027re brave, go ahead and step into The Baleful Bassinet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the big project that I plan to release to you fine ladies, gents and everything in-between is titled Sacred Solace: A Whore\u0027s Game. In it, you shall play as one of two characters who have taken the bold step of moving from a small, Upstate New York town to New York City to try to make all of their wildest dreams come true... Unfortunately, dreams rarely come cheap or easily. Lucky for them, they\u0027re noticed pretty quickly and given the opportunity to make something of themselves. Unluckily for them, and most luckily for you, it\u0027s a debaucherous, degrading and demanding road paved with cum, sweat and tears. Fetishes are varied and I\u0027m quite willing to add to the list, should consumer demand command it. Care to know more? Well, you get the chance to play a game as a whore, building stats and choosing johns to sleep with... Care to know EVEN more? You\u0027ll have to wait for the game and play it then, won\u0027t you? And for that to happen, I\u0027ll have to find a new artist. Sadly, my old one kind of fell through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep right up and leave your inhibitions and morals behind.\u003cbr\u003eYou won\u0027t need them to play A Whore\u0027s Game... But you will need to wait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: All characters depicted are eighteen or older.\u003cbr\u003e"

Should this happen, your character will lose their room and be moved to the staircase. However, I shall preserve all of the information for all old characters and rooms. If you donate again while there is an open slot, I will immediately be able to restore your character\u0027s position in the game.
