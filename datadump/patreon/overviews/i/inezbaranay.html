I\u2019ve been living a life of many relocations and new directions. Terrifying instability gives way to magical serendipity; a productive period in one place breaks apart and a new environment must be found.\u003cbr\u003e\n The one constant is that it is a writer\u2019s life; the writing is my vocation, the centre and meaning of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am setting up this Patreon page at a time where more massive relocations loom in my near future. At this point, I need financial support to make a new journey and to set up a new life somewhere, somewhere I can survive in peace and safety and continue to write, somewhere I\u2019m more available for other opportunities, find a way to be useful. I need to move away and need to move on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cI want to support you on Patreon because\u2026.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is what some friends/readers/supporters say\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI want to support you on Patreon because the world is a better place because of your fierce intelligent insights. You must continue and you must have independence. For all of us.\u201d Julie Brumlik\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI want to support you on Patreon because 3/4 of the people I know would never have the courage to lead a peripatetic life like yours. Remember to pat yourself on your back regularly.\u201d Philip Gorman\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI want to support you on Patreon because\u00a0you are a subversive thinker, one who defies the stereotypical and sentimental, be it in life or in the genre-shifting fluidity of your writing.\u201d Loveday Woods\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to \u003cem\u003eadd your own\u003c/em\u003e completion of \"I want to support you on Patreon because...\".

And small amounts add up. It might be just the cost of that coffee or cocktail we\u2019d have this month if we could meet. Or a dinner, if you could. Or a week\u2019s rent, if you\u2019re able to spare it.
