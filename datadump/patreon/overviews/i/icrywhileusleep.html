(Note: I cannot draw anyone or anything else.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I was compelled, one may even say fated, to draw little episodes and vignettes of my fascinating life and inner thoughts. \u00a0I may seem strange but if you keep reading you\u0027ll discover that on the inside, I\u0027m just like you: I have a job as a programmer, I do math in my spare time, I like cats, goth and rave dancing, weird sea creatures, and I am in a constant existential crisis. \u00a0Yes, I am the epitome of relatability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy main comic page is here:\u003ca href=\"http://icrywhileusleep.webcomic.ws/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nhttp://icrywhileusleep.webcomic.ws/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I also post these comics, along with other sketches and, you know, stuff, here:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://icrywhileusleep.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://icrywhileusleep.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nComics are posted Mondays \u00a0Occasionally there may be other things.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also sometimes make non-comic visual art of one kind or another. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is not impossible that I would expand to other mediums in the future: writing, dance, mixed media, performance art, concept art, etc. \u00a0But for starters, comics.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, the catch!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am satisfied when I make things, but I\u0027m not a capital-A artist. \u00a0I work as a software engineer, but that doesn\u0027t have capital letters either. \u00a0What this means, though, is that I make enough money to live and I\u0027m pretty satisfied doing so. \u00a0I don\u0027t aspire to make a living through art. \u00a0I don\u0027t even want to make money from it, due to my idiosyncratic personal philosophy about art. \u00a0 Therefore, all proceeds from this patreon are going to go to charities.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are four charities I\u0027ve already signed up to donate to\u00a0out of my programming paycheck:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAgainst Malaria Foundation\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGive Directly\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDoctors Without Borders\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSchistosomiasis Control Initiative\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInitially, I will match all patreon profits, e.g. if I get $20 through patreon, I will take it and donate $40, divided evenly among the four. \u00a0This obviously has to have a cap at some point since I only have so much of my own money to match with. \u00a0I understand that this will unfortunately will create diminishing returns past that cap, but I\u0027m not worried that I\u0027ll reach it just yet. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNote: rewards above $1 are basically one-time commissions, restricted to a certain category, or un-restricted for $10+. \u00a0All patrons of any level get a card or postcard from me once a year (guaranteed at least once as long as you are a patron for at least one month). \u00a0This can be for a particular date, and/or a particular occasion, or just whenever the spirit moves me. \u00a0I\u0027ll be asking if you\u0027d like something in particular (i.e. your birthday, and then a birthday date, or something about snakes at any time) when you sign up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e(Long Version, extra details)\u003cbr\u003e\nI deal with the horror of existence through the lens of art. \u00a0Unfortunately, I\u0027m not particularly driven, so I don\u0027t actually devote enough time to creation to end up with anything of use beyond my own amusement. \u00a0This mostly suits me, as I consider art to be more of a personal practice than the mode of producing a commodity. \u00a0Insofar as it\u0027s at all like self-expression, then it\u0027s really for me and not for you. \u00a0So although I desire to become more skilled and productive, I rarely find the energy, drive, or motivation - I can not fully justify the devotion of the necessary effort to the activity. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut it\u0027s a useful therapeutic exercise, and I wish I did more of it. \u00a0Ideally, I would put my time and energy and skills into something that I wouldn\u0027t have as many doubts and uncertainties as to the value of - some kind of \"contributes to society by advancing medicine, technology, or standard of living\" kind of thing. \u00a0But I don\u0027t seem to have gotten there either.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, amid much internal struggle about what I should be doing with my life, I have reached a compromise (probably temporary, but better than how I was previously). \u00a0I will continue to earn my living as a software developer, hopefully keeping to software that seems to serve some kind of useful purpose other than its own perpetuation. \u00a0But for art, essentially to motivate myself, I will set up this page, and all proceeds will go to charity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI consulted givewell.org, and with a mixture of their recommendations and whatever seemed sensible to me (I\u0027m not confident enough of my own instincts or established methods to do some 100% calculated method, but instead have done a rather wishy-washy compromise that is guaranteed to not be optimal, but as this entire enterprise illustrates, I try to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good), selected a number of charities that I am already donating to, listed above in the \"Short Version\" section. \u00a0 Patrons are welcome to comment and discuss about implementation details, such as:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- how to deal with reaching my matching cap, should such an event occur\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- how to best divide donations among selected charities\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- which charities donations go to (My selections are for starters, but I\u0027m definitely willing to give to others.)\n\u003cbr\u003e"
