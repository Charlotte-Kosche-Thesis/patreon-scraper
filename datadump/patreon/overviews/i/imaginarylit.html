    "summary": "I started writing in 1999, when I was in 7th grade. At the time, it was fanfiction, and continued to be up until 2010, when I decided to dip my toes into the pool of original fiction. Once I did, there was no turning back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first self-published novel was\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Only One\u003c/em\u003e in August 2015. I wanted to write a romance that was centered around two independent, successful, self-sufficient people who weren\u0027t looking for relationships, who didn\u0027t need someone to \"fix\" them, but who met and fell in love. I took a lot of romance tropes and put my own spin on them, while still creating a love story that remains very close to my heart. I hope one day to revisit Richard and Piper in some capacity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy second novel was actually the first book I wrote, called \u003cem\u003eNo Safe Place\u003c/em\u003e, which I started in 2011 as an original project just to share with my friends. It centered around the kidnapping of a young woman named Hannah, and the subsequent race to find her before she was killed. I wrote several follow-up stories, continuing to follow Hannah\u0027s life and the lives of those around her. It was my pet project for years, my baby, and in 2016, I finally decided to polish up the main kidnapping story for publication. I submitted it to Kindle Scout, and much to my surprise, it was selected, and published in October 2016. The follow-up novel \u003cem\u003eFinding Home Again\u003c/em\u003e, which gets into the immediate aftermath of Hannah\u0027s kidnapping and her journey of getting her life back, was published in July 2017. With both of these books, I again wanted to twist some tropes around; I wanted to feature a young woman who was strong, and smart, and capable, but also human, with human limitations. Hannah cries, she gets scared, she gets hurt; she struggles with the aftermath of her traumatic kidnapping, and not all of it is pretty, but she\u0027s able to find her own strength and work through her own issues, both on her own, and with help from others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next project is a supernatural series called \u003cem\u003eCrimson Hollow\u003c/em\u003e, and will be my most ambitious undertaking yet, as I\u0027m planning for the series to consist of four novels and a novella (though there\u0027s every possibility that it could end up being bigger; there\u0027s a lot to play with in this universe, and I\u0027m not ruling anything out). Like \u003cem\u003eThe Only One\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNo Safe Place\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eFinding Home Again\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0027m planning to put my own twist on some long-standing tropes, and hoping to offer a fresh take on a genre that many people love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, I would love to be able to write for a living, and to be able to support myself with my books, but writing and self-publishing is as much work as any job outside the home, and it doesn\u0027t pay nearly as well, which is where you come in. The purpose of setting up this Patreon is to help with writing and marketing expenses (I would like, once I get to the point of needing them, to have professionally designed covers for \u003cem\u003eCrimson Hollow\u003c/em\u003e), but to also help with everyday expenses, when funds are low and there are still a few days left before I get paid for my \"real\" job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNobody is under any obligation to pledge anything. I definitely know what it feels like to not have much \"extra\" money for things like this. Even just sharing this page helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelf-publishing is, by and large, a solo endeavor, and a slow, uphill climb towards success, but no man is truly an island, and I would be honored and grateful if you chose to support me on this journey towards my success."
