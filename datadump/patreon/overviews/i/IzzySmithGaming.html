    "summary": "Hey everyone! Thanks for coming by and looking at Izzy Smith Gaming! I\u0027m Izzy Smith, the host, creator, narrator, writer, producer, director... well, you get the idea. It\u0027s a big job for one guy to wear so many hats! But, it\u0027s what I love to do, and it always keeps me busy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIzzy Smith Gaming is a YouTube channel that I established in December of 2016, and I began uploading content to it in January of 2017. It consists of gaming \"Let\u0027s Play\" videos and \"playthroughs\", as well as ongoing gaming tips, hints, and ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy did I begin making gaming videos? It all starts back In 1986, when I was sixteen. I took interest in a local college radio station. I enjoyed the music they played, which was far from the mainstream rock I heard on most of the \"big league\" stations in my area, but it wasn\u0027t just that. I became interested in the personalities I heard on the air, playing the music. They sounded like me. They spoke about things that I was interested in. They connected to me. I decided that I would investigate what it took to become an on-the-air personality. Having a few friends that attended the college helped, and after speaking with them, they put me directly in contact with the head of the station. After meeting with him and discussing my interest in broadcasting, he asked me if I\u0027d like to try out, by sitting in with one of my favorite on-the-air personalities. You can imagine my surprise! I jumped at the chance, and the next day, I was broadcasting alongside a great person from a station I\u0027d only heard on my radio dial. I was hired afterwards and began my work in radio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince those days, I\u0027ve worked at several radio stations, including an internet station. I\u0027ve broadcast countless hours on the air, as well as having worked behind the scenes, recording and mixing a lot of bumpers, top-of-the-hour ID\u0027s, commercials, and news broadcasts. I was even a News Director once!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut to sum up why I started making gaming videos, I feel that\u0027s what I bring to them - my passion for broadcasting. Being behind a microphone has always been my dream. I love video games, and I enjoy the process of taking the audio I\u0027ve recorded and mixing it with the video I\u0027ve captured. So why not take a shot at a dream, and see if I can make a go of it for a living?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos I record are driven by the story of the games themselves - I only add a narration to them. I attempt to drive the story by fleshing out the ideas and motivations of my character while I play the game. Some games, such as the Fallout franchise, allow you to make decisions that guide your character towards a path of good or evil. \u00a0If I\u0027m playing a hero, why not play upon that idea, and make him someone that a viewer wants to see win in the end? If the main character is a villain, then why is he that way? What makes him evil? The viewer should understand my motivation for playing him that way, and react to him accordingly.\u00a0When I record a game series, I want the viewer to feel as though they\u0027re watching a movie or their favorite television show, where they come to know each character by name, and develop feelings for those characters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do. That\u0027s why I do it. I\u0027m also driven by a desire to share it with others. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve created this Patreon page, and I ask for your assistance - so I can go on doing what I love, and sharing it with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and I hope to speak to you in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Izzy"

Currently I\u0027m talking with a few YouTube friends on making some collaborative videos where we get together and play some multi-player games, which would be new for me.",
