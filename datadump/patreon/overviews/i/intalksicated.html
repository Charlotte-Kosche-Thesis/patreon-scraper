It\u0027s the drunk podcast tackling real life topics with some heart. We also have monthly bad movie episodes where we rant about your favourite bad movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of movies!\u003cstrong\u003e InTalksicated Reviews\u003c/strong\u003e is a separate feed specifically for tv and movie booze-induced reviews and recaps. Corey covers the latest in tv and movies, as well as revisiting your old favourites on 90\u0027s/80\u0027s Proof (co-hosted by Bryant Thompson) with special guests and stand up comedians!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell the day that we launch this page the podcast will be 1 year old! What\u0027s a better birthday gift than launching a Patreon page?! We made it one whole year without asking for money! Corey and I (Sarah!) put a lot of work into this fun little podcast and we will keep doing it no matter what because we love it! BUT some financial support (even a little!) means we can aspire to improve\u00a0the quality\u00a0of the show to make it better for our awesome listeners!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patreon will help us in soooo many ways! But here\u0027s a few:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will help cover our hosting fees! We host two different channels under InTalksicated so that means double the fees! This would be a huge help for us!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can help us reach our goal to get new equipment so we can sound even better than we do now! We know drunk podcasts can get loud, so some new dynamic mics would help cut down on the noise!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can put more money into marketing the show so other people can find out about us!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can start saving for some amazing new cover art! And trust me, for what we have in mind, this will be worth it!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can help cover our booze fees! It\u0027s a drinking podcast so that means buying alcohol for almost every episode we record (not all, but most!). So you\u0027d essentially be contributing to our alcoholism. HOW COOL IS THAT!!!!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBeing part of the Patreon community means you\u0027ll be part of a super cool club where we can connect directly with you! Got feedback or questions for the show? This is a great place for that! Taking the time to talk to the people who listen would help us figure out what we are doing right, and what we could do better!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd most importantly, you showing your support will give us the confidence boost we need to keep pumping out awesome content for you! Flattery will get you everywhere with us ;) Even if you can\u0027t donate a dollar amount just yet, we would love to know we still have your support!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you sooooo much for listening and supporting InTalksicated!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t wait for what\u0027s to come with both shows and we are excited to connect with you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Sarah (Forever Alone) \u0026amp; Corey (Human Um Button)\u003cbr\u003e"
