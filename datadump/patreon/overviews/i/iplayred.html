    "summary": "If you are reading this you probably know something about me. My name is Kat and I have been board gaming for over 20 years now. Initially, I was introduced to games like Catan (there wasn\u0027t much else available at the time), however as time has gone on I have developed a love for heavier Euro games, although I will gladly take a seat at any game table. After many years of demoing, play-testing and working at events I decided to set up my own blog to talk about the games I play, and the events I go to.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://iplayred.co.uk\"\u003eI Play Red\u003c/a\u003e was born a couple of years ago, however, in the past six months ago I have revamped the site and have been producing regular content on a weekly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral people have started mentioning that they would like to see me branch out from writing and adding podcasts and videos to my repertoire. This is something I am looking at over the course of the new year and anything that I receive will initially be invested in getting the right set up to provide you with additional good quality audio and visual content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at my page, reading this and hopefully put a bit of money towards making I Play Red bigger and better than ever!\u003cbr\u003e"
