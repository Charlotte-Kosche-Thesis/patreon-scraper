    "summary": "Dear subscribers and followers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIPF is trying to put certain issues in the spotlight that are forgotten by most media outlets, we don\u0027t care about sexy news, but we do care about the deeper feelings, the weird opinions (or what might be perceived as weird but actually isn\u0027t) and our own integrity. It is a magazine for you and by you, because we create a space for those that love to create. As a matter of fact, our Creative Designer, Jonas Mensah, summarised it very well in our recent Manifesto:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\"I\nthink we can already come to the conclusion that IPF is a non-profit\n\u2013 heck we even lose money \u2013 magazine that puts independence above\neverything. We\u0027re purely surviving on gifts, either out of pity or\nout of support, the one more favorable than the other, but\nnevertheless equally important at this point. Because right now we\u0027re\nin the building stage where we modestly try to build up a strong\nmessage, slow but steady and with a good conscience.\u2028\u003cbr\u003e\nThis\nis one of the strengths of IPF, our conscience and consciousness. We\ntry to bring stories that are truthful, probably biased, sometimes\nwitty or aggressive, but fairly to the best of our abilities. We try\nto kick people out of their hibernation, with soft, subtle and\ndebatable illegal electronic shocks. If those will be effective is\nyet to say, but whatever the result might be, useful or useless, we\nwill keep going because relativity can be implemented on everything.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might know, most little amateur magazines don\u0027t make it past their second edition, a difficulty we already overcame, and we can be proud of that.\u00a0However, the time has come to organise ourselves, in order to survive this crucial moment and make it to our second birthday! Believe it or not, but you can really help us with that: if we can find 20 people that pledge to give 2 USD to IPF every month, we\u0027ll have enough funds to publish 4 editions in the coming year! And with a little more we can actually pay for the website Thomas Collet is creating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the sceptics among you: we know we didn\u0027t break the Donna\nBrazile story, and we\nknow there\u0027s no commercial audience for this bulls**t of ours. We\nknow it\u0027s annoying for you guys to hear yet another independent media\noutlet begging for your hard-earned dollar-dollar bills and\nshiny-shiny euro coins. We know Cenk from TYT already sucked your **** for the last cents on your bank account. We know you know that\nwe\u0027ll use your money to get drunk, and than ask for more... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n...But that\u0027s just how independent media\nworks, either you pay up, or we go bankrupt and you\u0027ll be stuck\nin a world dominated by Euronews and Fox \u0026amp; friends. It\u0027s your\nchoice... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe wish to thank our subscribers for\ntheir confidence,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe IPF Board\u003cbr\u003e"
