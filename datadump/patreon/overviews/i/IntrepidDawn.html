You can pay just a \n\u003cstrong\u003efew dollars per month\u003c/strong\u003e to help support your favorite providers. As content creators this support is essential in offsetting the cost of creating high quality content. Patreon allows me to spend more of my time \u003cstrong\u003ecreating videos that you enjoy \u003c/strong\u003eby offsetting the cost of production and freeing up my own time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYouTube is special because\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eI make my videos for my audience, not to appeal to the masses\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s an intimate setting where my community takes precedence over everything else. However to be rewarded on the platform mass market appeal (huge views and subscribers) is the measuring stick for financial success. Patreon allows small channels like mine that \u003cstrong\u003ecreate the content you want\u003c/strong\u003e to be viable.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/v3i1YOc\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/v3i1YOc.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nAs a content creator I can assure you that YouTube ad revenue is extremely volatile and only \n\u003cstrong\u003epennies a day \u003c/strong\u003eunless you are a huge channel with tons of views and subscribers. The support that I\u0027ve received from my community continues to allow me to make high quality content by offsetting some of my costs associated with higher end production. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI create all of my own graphics in After Effects\u003c/strong\u003e and I think that it makes a significant difference in the viewer experience. For me high fidelity cinematic video helps enhance the experience. I am always trying new things to make the videos even better from a production point of view.\u003cstrong\u003e I also license all of the music I use in my videos\u003c/strong\u003e. I believe using only high quality music is an important part of video experience. I pay these artists for the rights to use their music and it adds up but is a necessary expense as their work has value.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach video can take up to 20 hours of production time before it ever gets released. Research, recording footage, audio, editing, asset gathering, tags, thumbnails, render time, and uploading all factor into the time needed to have a video reach you.\u00a0You\u0027ve seen the difference between the channels that simply record gameplay footage with terrible audio and no editing then immediately upload it and my channel where I strive to bring you \n\u003cstrong\u003esignificantly more value with cinematic gameplay and interactive livestreams\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m community minded first and foremost. No matter how large the channel becomes that will not change. That\u0027s part of my contract to you as a viewer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the flip side there\u0027s likely never going to be a huge audience for the content I create and I accept that. The sci-fi genre has always been one that gravitates toward the educated and forward thinkers among us that are imagining a future that they want to experience.\n\u003cstrong\u003e I\u0027m happy to provide you content that fits that niche\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI always enjoy connecting with my viewers on a more personal level, and my livestreams reflect this as I\u0027m constantly \n\u003cstrong\u003eengaging with the community\u003c/strong\u003e.
