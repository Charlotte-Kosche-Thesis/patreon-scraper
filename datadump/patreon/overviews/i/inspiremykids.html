As the headlines we read each day become more disturbing and our children are exposed to more and more negative influences, we believe that our mission has never been more important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, for the first time in our history, we are asking for financial support, to dramatically improve our website, our content and our impact on the world\u0027s children and on your children. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp to now, our website has been entirely self-funded. But as our traffic grows and people want more from us, our costs have been rising substantially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp to this point, we have not accepted advertising or membership fees. \u00a0We\u0027ve felt these would compromise the experience we provide and potentially limit access to those who may need our content most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, while we will continue to aggressively invest our own money in order to get to the next level of impact, we need to invite our community to consider their financial support which will enable us to really put our foot on the gas. \u00a0With your help, we can develop more regular and diverse inspirational content and programs to support children whether for:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003esparking motivation\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebuilding character and enhancing social/emotional learning\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehelping make the world a better place\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eimproving problem behaviors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edeveloping key values that the world\u0027s children need, such as empathy, honesty and perseverance\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproviding more parent and educator support materials\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreating more actions that children can take to improve themselves and the world around them\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who do not know us, we are Mike and Kevin - co-founders, college roommates, husbands, best men at each others weddings and dads. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u00a0created InspireMyKids because it\u2019s something we wanted for our kids.
