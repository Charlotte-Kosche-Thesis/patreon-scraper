    "summary": "Inkubus Publishing focuses on publishing male-male erotica and romance. We currently publish two anthologies per year, and we also have various novellas that are in the works. When we started, we were paying $10 per story published, but we recently increased that to $15. Part of being on Patreon is to raise that amount again. We would like to eventually pay per word, but we\u0027ll start with increasing our reimbursement to $20.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInkubus Publishing also offers opportunities for authors who might not otherwise fit into the mold created by one of the large publishing houses. We currently offer royalties of 7% (traditional publishing) to 10% (electronic publishing). Patreon will help us to increase those percentages. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInkubus Publishing will also use proceeds to pay for book covers, which are not cheap if you want quality work, and help with distributing copies of books to our authors and our consumers. With your help, we plan to turn Inkubus Publishing into a friend of the independent author in the male-male erotica and romance genre.\u00a0"
