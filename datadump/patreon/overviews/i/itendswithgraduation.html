    "summary": "It Ends With Graduation is an ambitious free Visual Novel and tribute to the Ren\u0027Py Engine. It includes voice acting, a unique calendar-event system, and of course, Eileen! It is made with the permission and blessing of RenpyTom, the creator of Ren\u0027Py.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClarkson Mound High School is built on an old Adena Native American mound in the small town of Isnay, Ohio. A few years ago, a large Silicon Valley company decided to build a logistics center there, and has invested heavily in the area. Among other places in town, they\u0027ve bought out the high school, and it, along with the mound, will be demolished at the end of the current school year, to make room for a large parking garage for employees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only problem? The Mound is the only thing keeping the Earth from being destroyed. And no one knows, except for one local senior, named Darren (Ren) Bay. He carries Iroquois blood in him, and is contacted by the Great Snake Spirit, Onyarekowa, to warn him of the impending danger. Ren has one year to spend either trying to save humanity or making peace with his doom. He\u0027ll soon discover that both Heaven and Hell have their fingers in the pie, through angel representative Eileen and demonic representative Lucy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt Ends With Graduation will be a calendar-event-driven Visual Novel following Earth\u0027s last school-year, where you can choose which events to attend and which to skip. But be warned, the choices you make will influence what events are available later as well as the eventual ending. What would \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e do if you were the only human who knew the world was going to be destroyed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that proceeds will not be going to me, but will be for paying my dev team! Voice Actors, Artists, our Composer, and Writers! Only if there\u0027s anything left over after compensating them all will I get a cent. Thank you for your attention and I hope I\u0027ve managed to pique your interest."
