    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWhat I do\u003c/h2\u003eI have been a hobby game designer for many years. from board, card and RPG games to modifications for Doom, Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, I have always enjoyed creating things and expanding universes that I enjoy. I am best known for my efforts with \u003ca href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52248/?\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Legacy of the Dragonborn\u003c/a\u003e mod, found on Nexus and the continuation project \u003ca href=\"https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/2380514-project-odyssey-odyssey-of-the-dragonborn-contributors-needed/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOdyssey of the Dragonborn\u003c/a\u003e, which is under development. Additionally I also have a player home entitled \"Bolar\u0027s Retreat\" that has been in the works for some time (pictures available on my \u003ca href=\"https://arcadiamgames.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMod Blog\u003c/a\u003e), and grand plans for a re-envisioning of the Legacy \"Explorer\u0027s Society\" guild in a stand alone faction centered variant of Legacy entitled \"Relic Hunter\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have self published a role playing game set entitled \"The CrossRoads of Eternity\" and have several prototype board and card games in various stages of development. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003eI love creating things. If I don\u0027t have an avenue to do so, I tend to go a little nuts. In the past, classical artists and musician always had benefactors or \"Patrons\" (hence the term patreon) who would help financially support the artist who\u0027s work they admired, in order to allow them to continue working on said art which the patron and people at large would then get to enjoy. Often the patrons would also get special perks such as private performances, custom work, etc. Like all of us, I have bills to pay and a family to help support, and having any show of support here or through other donations on Nexus, enables me to attribute more time to working on these creative projects I enjoy so much rather than spending all of my time on handy man work, which pays well and I enjoy but is not my passion. All contributions received here are considered continued donations, any level of which I greatly appreciate, not only for the financial burden it help alleviate but more importantly for the show of support is symbolizes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0027s the Goal?\u003c/h2\u003eMy creative efforts tend to focus and shift over time from project to project. Currently my focus is with Modding and I\u0027ll continue to nurture and cultivate \u003cem\u003eLegacy of the Dragonborn\u003c/em\u003e as the foundational cornerstone of my modding fleet so to speak, my flag ship if you will, while working with many other developers to bring the sequel, \u003cem\u003eOdyssey of the Dragonborn\u003c/em\u003e to life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther projects I will be focusing on over time will be the second edition of my RPG series \u003cem\u003eThe CrossRoads of Eternity\u003c/em\u003e as well as the \u003cem\u003eZ-Day\u003c/em\u003e card game, GunMage RPG and Novelization. I also have a steam punk themed dungeon crawl game in the works called \u003cem\u003eThe Nexus\u003c/em\u003e and a board game based on campground management, title TBD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributing via Patreon will not only help me out, but I also intend on paying forward your generosity to those folks who are helping with development of my current projects. I have already in the past sent some thank you donations of my own to several of my voice actors for my Mod projects who have done extensive work, as well as my cohort designers MyBad and RonnieMagnum who continue to dish out awesome content to contribute for Odyssey, and receiving support will help me continue to do this.\u003cbr\u003e"
