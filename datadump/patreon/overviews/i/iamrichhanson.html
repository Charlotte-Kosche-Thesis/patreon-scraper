    "summary": "Welcome to My Journey!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Richard Hanson. I am a husband to my amazing wife Jodi! Father of two beautiful children Emma and James. I\u0027ve spent a great portion of my life traveling the four corners of the world inspiring people to be everything they were intended to be. \u00a0Let me start off by saying the #1 reason for starting to film, blog \u0026amp; podcast, wasn\u0027t because I was looking for something more to do. I just realize the internet\u0027s ability to connect a message, with a global audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started out as a simple request to record a few podcasts, quickly turned in to those episodes going around the world, in just a few short days. This made me realize, just how many people are searching for answers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with that we quickly created a website to host the vlog, podcast, upload messages and write some blogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to check it out \u003ca href=\"http://www.iamrichardhanson.com\"\u003ewww.iamrichhanson.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with anything, it cost us to continue filming, blogging, recording, editing and putting out valuable content, but we have no intention to stop now, because we believe people matter, and we\u0027re prepared to go the distance with whatever that might entail. What were inviting people to do, is to join us on this amazing journey, of making these valuable messages available to the average person like myself. So whether its $1, $5, or $10 a month, we truly love \u0026amp; appreciate each and everyone of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I will do my best to deliver on. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith every episode,I intend to bring in everyday people living extraordinary lives, to talk about everything from business, personal development, leadership, marriage, family, faith, and a whole lot more!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith information now at the click of a button, I hope to better serve you and the global community with valuable content, so together we can pioneer the future courageously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for joining me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch Love, \u003cbr\u003eRH\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
