    "summary": "Dear Sirs and Lady Sirs,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet\u2019s best kept secret is back on Patreon, baby!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been doing comedy, in one form or another, since 2006. That is when I took the stage for my first open mic. Did I bomb, you ask? I sure did. Like a tiny Hiroshima at Cajun restaurant\u2019s open mic night, but way less funny. That didn\u2019t stop me though. I continued to do stand-up and got pretty good at it. Performing all over the west coast, working with some of today\u2019s best acts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, along with my \u201cbetter half\u201d Jenks, I launched the No Talent Required podcast. With no equipment or skills in the way of audio or editing, I managed to get the show on the air and featured by providers such as iTunes and Stitcher Radio. That podcast is still going strong today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, I discovered something called live streaming and have been performing live, unscripted comedy for a growing audience ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have enjoyed a variety of different forms of performing, yet there\u2019s still more to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron you will be assisting me with not just the day-to-day costs of hosting fees and data storage, but you\u2019ll also be helping me get drunk in the day time by supplying me with the funds to afford top shelf liquor and street drugs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeres The Deal...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Shows: in addition to No Talent Required, which will remain free of charge, I\u2019ll also be releasing a new podcast called, The Gary Lee Show. This show will focus on movies, television, sports and whatever else I decide to let escape my big fat mouth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew Equipment: What small percentage of your money isn\u2019t going to scratchers and cheeseburgers will be used buy some new equipment. Mics, soundboards, a new set for live streaming...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Road: I plan on putting together comedy live comedy shows and podcasts that will feature myself along with some of my funny friends. We\u2019d love to take the show on the road... you know, a nice change of pace from broadcasting out of my spider infested garage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what do you get out of this scam... er, I mean, deal? More of what you like... me! More podcasts, more live shows and more comedy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very beginning I\u2019ve relied on the support of you fine folks. The people that care. I love performing and creating for you, and from the bottom of my heart I thank you for all the support you\u2019ve given me thus far and all of the support you\u2019ll give me in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGary Lee\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
