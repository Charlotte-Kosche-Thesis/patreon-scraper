When you consciously make an effort to spend your money with the locals, it leads to a win-win. You have an awesome authentic experience and the money you\u0027ve spent stays with the people who provided it. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecan be a force for good when you travel.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We believe you can vote for the world you want to live in with your actions and your wallet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking us out, we hope you are inspired to become a patron and join the movement!"
