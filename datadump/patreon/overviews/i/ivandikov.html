    "summary": "Dear Patrons, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Ivan Dikov, and I am asking you to\nsupport me to become an independent full-time journalist with my two projects \u2013\nwhich are \n\u003cem\u003ecauses\u003c/em\u003e, really! \u2013 \u003ca href=\"https://paxglocalica.com/\"\u003ePaxGlocalica.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/\"\u003eArchaeologyinBulgaria.com\u003c/a\u003e. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support would be invaluable as it would\nallow me to work independently and with integrity to put forth my ideas, views,\nanalyses, and coverage in order to contribute globally and locally towards\ngreater understanding, knowledge, freedom, and peace.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I\u2019ve been taking\nnon-journalistic jobs for more than a couple of years now (largely out of\ndisgust with media conditions in my native country and beyond), I am what I am,\na free, unaffiliated journalist.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am based in Sofia (despite the smog), originally fromrural North Bulgaria. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve studied political science / international\nrelations and history at\nby far the best college in Grafton County, NH, and in the Eastern Balkans (that is a thing). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI served for five years as the\neditor-in-chief of Bulgaria\u2019s largest English-language media (that, too, is a\nthing). (In fact,my tenure\nthere was so successful that I\nended up on WikiLeaks.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have collaborated with media from the US, the\nUK, Germany, and Australia. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am the founder and chief editor of\nArchaeologyinBulgaria.com (because Bulgaria\u2019s archaeology and history boast a gazillion stories\nworthy of being botched by Hollywood), the now dormant BulgarianPolitics.com (because Bulgarian politics is a political\nthriller in its own right) which I might relaunch, and now of PaxGlocalica.com\n(because the world has been\nglocalized for a while now, and it\u2019s glocalizing still). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI enjoy \u201cgeneral hanging out\u201d (which is a\nquote by a college professor I really liked but who didn\u2019t really like me back\nas much for some reason). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI split my free time (if any) between coming up with\nsolutions for Bulgaria and coming up with solutions for the World. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of my solutions might never be\nrealized because that\nis how both Bulgaria and the World operate\n\u2013 but they sure, or hopefully, make for a good read. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr perhaps at least the most worthy of them\nmight be realized thanks to your support. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am asking you to support me to become a\nfull-time journalist for two projects \u2013 PaxGlocalica.com (officially launched in\nJanuary 2018 although it does feature earlier stories) and\nArchaeologyinBulgaria.com (launched as a hobby at the end of 2014 and the\nbeginning of 2015, and grown substantially since then). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn a nutshell, Pax Glocalica is a vision\nfor a world at peace with itself seeking to combine considerations of the\nglobal and local level, rather than prioritizing one over the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is likely the best approach\nto understanding the world of our time in which the trends of universalization\nand particularization are growing stronger simultaneously, intertwined in an\never more complex spiral, rather than one eclipsing and dominating the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThus,\nPax Glocalica is seeking insights into an ever more glocalizing world,\nbut with unending hope of peace and freedom! (Learn more \u003ca href=\"https://paxglocalica.com/about-pax-glocalica/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, including why the name Pax Glocalica!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nArchaeologyinBulgaria.com was set up in order\nto reveal to the world Bulgaria\u2019s truly amazing but very little known archaeological,\nhistorical, and cultural heritage. \n(Learn more \u003ca href=\"http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/about-us/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, including why Bulgaria is still a treasure to be discovered!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving \u003ca href=\"http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/01/25/archaeologyinbulgaria-com-registers-1-million-visits/\"\u003eregistered its 1 millionth visit\u003c/a\u003e at the\nend of January 2018, it is yet to achieve a lot more in that regard. It now\nalso seeks to explore further the human \u2013 Earth connection, namely, how the\nevolution of human history is interacting with nature and the grave environmental\nchallenges of our time. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy pledge to\nyou, prospective and current Patrons, is to never censor myself to your liking.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause if I\ndo, this whole thing would be completely pointless. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I am looking\nfor a voltairesque support from you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou know, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u201cI don\u2019t agree\nwith what you have to say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eNow there is a\ndispute if it was Voltaire who actually said that but whoever said it, they were a moral\ngenius. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo journalist\ncan subscribe to a political ideology if they are indeed a journalist. That\u2019s\nwhy you might find my writings liberal on some issues, conservative on others,\nmoderate on still others. I do like classical liberalism but I still wouldn\u2019t\nlet any ideology define my work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI strive for\nvisionary common sense. And integrity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is why I hope you will support me in my causes Pax Glocalica and\nArchaeologyinBulgaria!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support and contributions will allow me to start working \nfull time on both of these causes (as opposed to whenever I can - \nnights, breaks, weekends, etc.), make them more professional and \nin-depth, and maybe eventually have other journalists join me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI firmly believe that the causes enshrined in these projects are worthy, and, hopefully, so will you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou support and contributions are unbelievably appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIvan \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
