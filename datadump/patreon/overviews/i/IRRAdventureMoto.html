    "summary": "One of the functions of IRR is introducing men and women to the sport of adventure touring while at the same time, getting folks on adventure! We do this by offering simple systems and solutions for getting you out there to experience it! It is what we believe we have been called by our Creator to do. Our hope and focus is not only on making adventure simple but helping folks realize just how simple a walk with God can be! However, the most important part of doing an IRR adventure is providing an opportunity where folks can get encouragement, training, experience, and riding time, without breaking the bank!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIRR is stepping it up to be better at what the Lord has been developing over the last 10 years and that requires updating our existing equipment.\u00a0 This not just video documentation of the backcountry in our area, it is also a ministry that is directed towards, men and women who feel stuck in life, folks who just can\u0027t seem to get out of their ruts, others who are looking to simplify their walk with God and want some encouragement, or perhaps they are folks who are already serving in some way but need a little time to regroup, have some fellowship, or stop and smell the back country! We know that not every one can afford to just jump into Adventure Touring but everyone at some point does need an adventure! And that\u0027s what we are about! Adventure, discovery, sharing our stories, and developing a community of folks who will ultimately journey in life together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help by making by becoming a Patreon today! All proceeds will go to getting folks on adventure and helping them to do a week or more of back country camping, in a small group setting, and at an affordable cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope and pray that you will consider being a partner with IRR in this new adventure! Your support is really appreciated and will go a long ways in helping us continue this journey. We are also glad that you are considering coming along for the ride! We have already began to see the Lord use this as an opportunity to love people around us and happy to have you become a part of it!"

We love the characteristics of dual-purpose machines that allow us to enjoy long range touring and the remote, off road, backcountry places at the same time. While IRR is a riding organization, we are also a place for getting off road training, assistance with finding the right gear,  sharing our experience with people who are interested in the sport, and developing adventures. We share stories, develop friendships, and most importantly discover the depth of Gods love, grace, plan and purpose for our lives. Adventure can be challenging but we are all on some kind of adventure and it becomes even more rewarding when we understand how God uses adventure and story in our lives to help us realize our full potential. We \u00a0are about having a simple walk with Him, and at the same time having a positive impact the culture around us.\u003cbr\u003eWe are passionate about riding and passionate about God. We know that not every one can afford to just jump into Adventure Touring but everyone at some point does need an adventure! And that\u0027s what we are about! Adventure, discovery, sharing our stories, and developing a community of folks who will ultimately journey in life together!",
