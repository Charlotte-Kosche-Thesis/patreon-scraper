Itchy-O has collaborated with the Denver Center for Performing Arts to create a staggering Halloween spectacular that startled OffCenter theatre goers, and has also performed at the world renowned horror-fantasy festival, Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas three years in a row as well as center-piecing Dark Mofo in Tasmania, Australia in 2016.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003eWITH YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS, ITCHY-O WILL BE ABLE TO FUEL OUR CREATIONS AND DRIVE PAST LIMITS AND BEND BARRIERS EVEN FURTHER\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile itchy-O is not limited by creative restrictions and exists on an intergalactic plane beyond space, time, and gravity, earthly fiduciary fetters can be at odds with our out-of-this-world imaginations.
