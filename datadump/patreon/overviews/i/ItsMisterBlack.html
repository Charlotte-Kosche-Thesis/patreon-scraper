    "summary": "Hello and thank you all for checking out my patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me tell you for a moment what my goal here is all about. I spend a lot of time working on commission work but I don\u0027t get time to develop my work and skill as I see fit. I figured if I actively choose what gets featured and what I want to experiment with, I can do it at no cost of my time and benefit all of you! So as we all move forward we all get to see the work grow and the style evolve as I get to practice more and more the styles and techniques I\u0027ve wanted to learn for ages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s one little extra thing I\u0027m doing here. The funds contributed will not just help me with offsetting the time I spend on commissions, I\u0027ll use a portion of the funds toward getting my ass to the gym. Know what that means? YEP! Progress pictures(in the PG-13 area) and notes on my goals for fitness. As I learn more about routines and diets geared toward my own goals, I\u0027ll share those notes as well. I\u0027ll touch more on that as I move along.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that said and done, while trying to keep things short and sweet, check out my tiers for the rewards you get being a patron. I\u0027ll be updating every other day. I\u0027ll also be posting links for livestream works and uploading videos of any content that may have been missed for those who sign up. Lets get to it!"
