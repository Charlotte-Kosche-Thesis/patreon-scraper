My name is Alexander Trapp! Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is where you\u0027ll get access to my content before it shows up anywhere else. But before we get to any of that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW I GOT INTO ANIMATION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I started making animated web shows, I wrote screenplays for several years. I tried to break into Hollywood by either writing stories that I thought an executive or movie agent might want to see, or perhaps something I thought would look good. Neither approach worked for me. So in 2013 I decided that I would make movies on my own. The only problem was; I was poor, had no movie camera, or knew of anyone who would want to act in a movie of my own creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s when I turned to animation for an answer to my visual media problem. But then I ran into a new issue. I couldn\u0027t draw. And it would take me years to perhaps learn how to create animation in some kind of program. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that point that I remembered a website called Goanimate.com that was created for animation enthusiasts and hobbyists who wanted to tell their own stories. Creating animation was as simple as creating a character from a template and then using drop and drag animation techniques to make the characters perform actions. Pre-made backgrounds were plentiful and other images could be imported to help set the scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, GoAnimate was perfect for a person such as myself. And from there, I went on to create my current web shows that you now see on my YouTube page:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOK5CKC7bV4\u0026amp;list=PLbuvag-0mbzVyvcvt4Aat5A_JOYLeDoTY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmina\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utpwrYUarzA\u0026amp;list=PLbuvag-0mbzVGDWZTQdwAlv2akXvCzavf\"\u003eSpace Opera\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYvtco676U\u0026amp;list=PLbuvag-0mbzUuiB2d6COSZBUiGukAui_G\"\u003eand Ninja Steve\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW CAN YOU HELP?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve launched this Patreon page to help support my animation projects full time.

Signing up for as little as $1 per video, you\u0027ll get access to my latest animated episodes 2 weeks before they show up on YouTube and other platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat may not sound like much, but if hundreds or even thousands of people were to share and sign up for this page, those dollars could add up very quickly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far, thank you reading about my personal journey and my efforts to turn a passion of mine into a full time career. Even if you can\u0027t become a patron of mine today, please do share the page around with as many people as you know. Subscribing to my YouTube page also helps to build up my audience and and allows you to share my videos from that platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and enjoy my content wherever you happen to see it!\u003cbr\u003e"
