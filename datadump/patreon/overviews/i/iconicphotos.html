    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eIconic Photos is a weekly series of blog posts that aims to educate readers about history, culture, and global politics using the medium of photos and photography. Our website is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://iconicphotos.org\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIconic Photos began in 2009 as an offshoot of a college assignment. Since then, I have written over 1,000 blog posts, and covered\u00a0a wide variety of topics -- historical, political, artistic, criminal, moral, psychological, sartorial, financial, and scientific aspects of issues and ideas from over 70 countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may notice in last few years, I have been posting not so frequently on Iconic Photos. But I want IP to\u00a0go on for a long time and be sustainable. Linking a monetary value to a new post (not a \u0027monthly salary\u0027 -- which is another way of doing Patreon) should give me some incentive to write more, and at least cover part of my research budgets (photography books, library subscriptions, etc.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had tremendous fun researching and writing Iconic Photos. I would not have been doing this for several years if I did not. I also feel what I wrote was worth sharing, and was worth writing. I had in my mind a vague idea about a history book -- educating people history using photographs -- similar to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://iconicphotos.org/2014/04/01/empire-of-images-an-iconic-photos-book/\"\u003ethis book\u003c/a\u003e I mocked up for an April Fool a few years ago.\u00a0Throughout most of its short history, photographs were supposed to be tangible mementos, not ones and zeros pixelled on a screen. A book will be a nice way to honor that, as well as a pleasant coffee table piece to touch and stumble upon. In order to make that happen, I need funding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think ads are the way to go. I took Iconic Photos off free wordpress site a few months ago because the ads were bothering me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all your support all these years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
