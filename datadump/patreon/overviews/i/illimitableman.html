I\u0027ve given a lot to the online men\u0027s community, and I wish to continue doing so. However, I deduce that if I\u0027m going to continue to dedicate so much time to developing theory and writing quality content, I should get paid for my efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI considered beginning monetisation of my site with banner advertisements, but decided I would take a gamble on crowdfunding first. As such, I\u0027m asking readers who enjoy my work to pledge a dollar amount of their choosing to support the continued production of my writings.\u00a0If crowdfunding is profitable enough, I won\u0027t have to resort to traditional advertising methods. Only time will tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, by supporting me, you incentivise me to not only continue publishing new content, but to do so with increased frequency (I estimate I\u0027ll average one article/podcast per week, or 5 per month at the most.) In the instance I post more content than this, you can set a monthly limit in your Patreon account settings to stop yourself going over budget. \u003cstrong\u003eIf I go over 5 articles/podcasts in a month and you have no maximum pledge amount set, a higher amount will be taken from your account (as I\u0027ve produced more) - consider this when pledging.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t want any of my patrons becoming disgruntled because more money than they could reasonably allocate left their account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nThank you very much for reading, and should you opt to do so, supporting my work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you have any questions or concerns, send me a message and I will endeavour to get back to you as soon as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eNOTE: Rewards are issued after a pledge is processed, not upon making a pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease do not request your reward after you have pledged, only once your pledge has been successfully processed at start of the month. This saves me a lot of time and hassle, and minimises misunderstandings. Thank you!\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

There are gems upon gems of wisdom contained within that archive, which at the time of writing has over 30,000+ tweets over the past 3 years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome tweets outline basic principles succinctly, others through multiple tweets explain extremely complex and abstract aspects of Machiavellianism.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSaying \"you get to look at my twitter archive\" really doesn\u0027t fully communicate just what you\u0027re getting access to, hence my somewhat lengthy elaboration here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a\u00a0valuable archive for anybody to have, of which you will receive the latest version of upon becoming a patron.
