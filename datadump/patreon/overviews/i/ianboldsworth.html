    "summary": "Hello there. How are you? Me, I am fine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnyway, it was only a matter of time before this became a\nthing, and your main job is going to be proving me wrong in my assertion that\nit\u2019s a bad move. Although if you don\u0027t prove me wrong I will REALLY sulk. I have argued over Patreon for about two years now, and I have\nfinally run out of excuses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what Patreon is (if you do then you can\nskip this paragraph, although you may be risking missing a brilliant joke),\nthen it is a platform where creators (me) can fund their work directly with\ntheir audience (you). You pledge to make a monthly payment (some people do it\nper item, but that would bankrupt you with this page) to fund the creator\u2019s independent\nwork. It is up to you how much you wish to pledge. Some of this work will still\nbe available to the genuine public, but patrons will get it earlier, and some\nof it will only be available to patrons. Sorry there was no joke in the\nparagraph.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou may know that I have been creating online content in a\nvariety of forms and guises since 2007, and that I\u2019ve slowly shifted all my creative\noutput to this method. You can find out all about this at ianboldsworth.co.uk, but it wasn\u2019t until 2015 that I had the courage/front to\nattempt to monetise it, with the rewards based donations system of \u003cem\u003eThe ParaPod\u003c/em\u003e\nPodcast.  I then got cocky and tried it\nagain with \u003cem\u003eThe Mental Podcast\u003c/em\u003e, but for my next project I am struggling to see\nhow that can be a thing.  To be perfectly\nhonest I am struggling with my next project full stop, as I appear to be having\na, some would say long overdue, crisis of confidence.  Actually, crisis might be a bit strong, but\nit isn\u2019t charging into my work portfolio as quickly or confidently as previous\nstuff.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe project is called \u003cem\u003e4000 Words\u003c/em\u003e and is an ongoing podcast\nseries of short stories and I\u2019ve presently written 4.5 of them which is\npathetic (my target for now was 20). \nNow, this Patreon is not going to be exclusively for that, but it is my\nmain starting point.  It occurred to me\nthat in all my previous work I have rarely been transparent about the actual\ncreative process until after the event, and even then only on a very basic\nlevel. There is something about the Patreon format however, which \u2013 I think \u2013\nmight facilitate that.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am basically allowing you in on the creating bit, you\u2019ll\nget everything before everyone else, including the RSS for the demo recordings\nof the stories as they arrive (I suspect some of these will end up being the\nfinal released episodes).  My plan, such\nas it is, is to write on Patreon pretty much every day, be it blog posts, bits\nof the stories (you\u2019ll definitely be getting the stuff I end up binning too), just\na stream of the process.  This is how I\u2019ll\nfund \u003cem\u003e4000 Words\u003c/em\u003e. There\u2019ll be audio blog posts, even if that\u2019s me just grabbing\nthe guitar and singing a song before bedtime (I have made up my own chords and\nmanipulate them for every song, you\u2019ll spot that quick), and posts about other\nprojects including \u003cem\u003eThe ParaPod Movie\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Mental Podcast 2\u003c/em\u003e (another one\nlanguishing in development hell, but there is a reason for that).  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLook, I am basically letting you in on the stuff that I only\nusually show to friends. I\u2019ve only got about four friends, so maybe my Patreon\nis you paying to be my friend.  Maybe I\nshould be paying you.  I am being\nfacetious of course, but genuinely, I am really tired of Twitter, and it\u2019s\nvague, weird, living your life in public feel, and I think this is potentially\na way for me to overshare in the same way I sometimes do on Twitter, but without the\ncloak of mystery. On the work front, I like the symbiotic thing between\naudience and creator that has been present in all my work, it\u2019s the main reason\nI\u2019ve avoided sponsorship on stuff \u2013 I don\u2019t want to feel that I\u2019m selling you\nout. So, I am finally prostituting my art, but directly to the audience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe posts will start the second just one person pledges and\nwill continue until you have all shook your heads and walked away. I need to go\nand think of some tiers now. And they keep telling me to do a video. \u00a0That\u2019s\ngoing to throw my ego into crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for reading, thanks for the support (with or without\npledging \u2013 but people that pledge are MORE SPECIAL TO ME)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIB xxx \u003cbr\u003eianboldsworth.co.uk\u003cbr\u003e"

This is simply implausible, but if you made a one month go of it and then went to a lower tier (NOT THE LOWEST ONE), I\u0027d be fine with that and would genuinely give you a half hour of my undivided attention (I have never managed to only talk to someone for half an hour, it\u0027ll drag on). In all seriousness, I\u0027d happily do a consultancy Skype or phonecall for that. \u00a0I don\u0027t claim to have all the answers, but I know some bits, and if you needed industry advice or a chat about stuff that\u0027s relevant to the work I\u0027d done before then deffo let\u0027s do that.\u00a0",
