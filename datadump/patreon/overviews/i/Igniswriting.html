    "summary": "It was a cold rainy Saturday morning, winter was just around the corner. I just woke up, plucked a little on my guitar and dressed myself. I liked the rain, it worked soothing on me, no traffic noise, no screaming kids, just the sound of the rain. I decided to put on my coat, and go for a walk. I didn\u0027t know where I was going, wasn\u0027t important either. I was walking,thinking about all sort of stuff, when suddenly a girl walked up to me. She looked as relaxed as me, just walking through the rain on a quiet morning. We made eye contact, she sat down on a bench. I asked if I could join her, she nodded. When I sat down we began a conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMay I ask your name?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course you may, It\u0027s Kenneth.

I put on paper everything that pops up in my head, from horror to adventure to romance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSounds cool, do you ever post your work online?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just started a page on facebook where I publish my work, and I am starting a patreon page where people can support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do people get when they support your work on there?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy default you will get access to patreon exclusively, this will include Q\u0026amp;As, anecdotes of my personal life and more.
