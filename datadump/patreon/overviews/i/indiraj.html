My name is Indira Jainanan and I\u0027m a self taught artist \u003cdel\u003eslowly dying\u003c/del\u003e born and raised in \u003cdel\u003ethe abyss\u003c/del\u003e Bronx, NY. In addition to a lot of random pieces of art, I\u0027m currently working on two awesome webcomics:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sacrimony.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/g8Ajd7/leaderboard.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sacrimony.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSacrimony\u003c/a\u003e is the tale of a strange looking teenage girl named Khajad who\n has no memory of her past or why she has magical powers. Her mother, \nYunika, tries to keep her origin a secret by finding clever ways to \ndeflect and ignore her questions while insisting that Khajad keep a low \nprofile as they try to build a life for themselves amongst high society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story is very special to me because it\u0027s pretty much my life\u0027s work come to fruition. It\u0027s something that I had been planning since I was a kid in middle school (over twenty years ago!!) and I finally figured out how I was going to go about telling it. It\u0027s not \"just\" a fantasy story, but a story that revolves heavily around familial connections, moral grey areas and what makes people tick in general. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s an ongoing story that will span at least 20 chapters with a solid chunk of about 100 pages per chapter. Updating once a week means it\u0027s going to take a lonnnng time to get through and I hope to be able to get to a point where I can make time to do more than one comic page per week. Currently, I\u0027m not able to do that, as I have to find other means of supporting myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://buddyandfriendcomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/eZ7fJ7/leaderboard.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://buddyandfriendcomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Misadventures of Buddy and Friend\u003c/a\u003e is the tale of three inept \u0027heroes\u0027 on a quest to save the world from a demon invasion, however, their carelessness may end up resulting in more damage than any demon invasion ever would. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddy and Friend was conceived on a whim back in 2013 and has been going strong ever since. It\u0027s a lighthearted story with dark humor and officially the longest running project I\u0027ve ever done. I estimate it will probably take until about 2023 to finish at the rate I\u0027m going - also updating once a week like Sacrimony. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support My Work On Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese comics are free to read and my art will always be around for those who are interested, however, support via Patreon allows me to spend more time working on more content to provide to you *points at you*. I\u0027ll be able to update my webcomics more often, do non-comic art more \noften and also pursue other art projects (both comic and not-comic related) \nthat I currently can\u0027t do on account of just not being able to find the \ntime to do so because of work/life reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, by becoming a patron you get access to fun behind the scenes commentary for my comics, character designs, concept art, a super top secret discord server, high resolution artwork, my ranting and raving, art tips, writing tips, free art prints, personalized sketch cards and discounts on commissions and merch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this relevant to your interests? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to keep my reward tiers reasonably priced and accessible to those who love my work but are on a budget (I understand! I\u0027m on a budget too!!). I will also keep my number of Patreon posts per month/week to a reasonable number so that your inbox won\u0027t get overflooded with updates every day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for checking out my Patreon. If you decide, to pledge then extra thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t commit to support on a monthly basis, you can still show some love via \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/indiraj\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eko-fi\u003c/a\u003e or buy something from my \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/MetalSorceryArt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eonline store\u003c/a\u003e!
