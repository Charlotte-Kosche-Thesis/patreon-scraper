We choose to help others connect to their own unique truths, which is pure spirit. We coach people through energy work and intuitive tarot/oracle readings and counseling sessions, to accept and work with the duality of the human experience, what we call \"radical self-acceptance\", We are also here to help them find their passions, solutions to challenges, while providing tools to make their lives Joyful and fulfilling. As our name suggests, we search for the wonder in the everyday, finding gratitude in the most unexpected places. We practice what we preach and share our own experiences in the hopes that they will resonate with our subscribers. The feedback we have already had, tells us that we are on the right track and that we must continue to reach out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonations\u003c/strong\u003e that we receive will enable us to devote more of our creative and psychic energies to our own work, rather than spending precious hours working for companies that do not appreciate us enough to provide decent pay, or who sometimes make us chase them down to get paid. It is a frustrating waste of our time, when we know we could really be helping someone through the fulfilling work of our own brand, The iWonderSisters."
