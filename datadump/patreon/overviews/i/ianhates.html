    "summary": "My name is Ian and I\u0027m the creator, host, editor, marketer, and everything else you can possibly imagine for Ian Hates Shows. What are Ian Hates Shows? Well...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Ian Hates Music:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIan Hates Music is a show I created to talk about the music I love. I talk about music news, new songs, album reviews, and so much more for genres of music like Rock, Metal, Metalcore, Post-Hardcore, and a ton more that I can\u0027t keep listing! Haha. Add in comedy, debates, bits, and segments, and you\u0027ve got Ian Hates Music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIan Hates Conversations:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIan Hates Conversations is a show where I speak to people in the music industry. These are often long form, in-depth interviews, and really more conversations than interviews. They\u0027re the best interviews you\u0027ll hear with the artists we love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Ian Hates Movies:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIan Hates Movies is a show where my co-host Kelly and I talk movies. Surprise! Haha. Not necessarily just reviews really though. It\u0027s like a couple of your friends at a bar going through the entire movie! It can be a good movie, it can be a terrible movie, it doesn\u0027t matter, and movies we cover are picked on a whim. Expect some debates, yelling, misunderstandings, fun, and comedy! Plus, sometimes special guests...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, those are the three shows I\u0027ve been doing for a long time now. Each started as weekly shows. Ian Hates Movies has been moved back to monthly and Conversations goes by who can be on the show, but there\u0027s always something new for you on a weekly basis! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put a lot of my own money into these shows because I care about them. Anyone can have a podcast, but I want you to hear the quality. So a lot goes into physical equipment, software, and recurring payments for websites, programs, and promotion. Not to mention the amount of time it takes to do all of that...though I just mentioned it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I don\u0027t plan on stopping there. I\u0027ve talked about a new show Ian Hates Love for a long time now. Want to hear crazy relationship stories and a whole lot more? Then help Ian Hates Shows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m doing this. I want to continue to put out the best quality shows for all the Haters out there! That\u0027s right, I\u0027m taking that word to mean something positive! Thank you to everyone out there who listens, interacts, and/or helps me continue this with donations. You have no idea how much I appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong days and pleasant nights,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIan\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
