    "summary": "Our goals are simple. People should be able to enjoy their connected and remote controllable sex toys however they want without worrying about security, privacy or safety. In an ideal world, you could trust manufacturers to have the security, privacy, and safety of their customers as their top priority. However, as with many Internet of Things vendors, they either don\u0027t know, don\u0027t understand or just don\u0027t care about these issues. We want to change that. By examining these devices, associated apps and infrastructure we hope to work with those manufacturers who want to understand how to secure their devices to do so, and those who do not, we want the public to know the risks of using those devices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site is active at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://internetofdon.gs\"\u003eThe Internet of Dongs\u003c/a\u003e and is quickly becoming the central point for researchers and vendors interested in the security of these devices. \u00a0Right now it is hosted on a shared VPS and out of RenderMan\u0027s server closet in his basement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are not asking for much. \u00a0We have a major sponsor in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://pornhub.com/\"\u003ePornhub [NSFW]\u003c/a\u003e who kindly donated funds to acquire devices to test which was the biggest expense. \u00a0What we do need is funding for the smaller bits of operational expenses like proper mail hosting, web hosting, and test equipment. \u00a0Additionally we could use help in the expenses for getting our message out through things like stickers at conferences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot sure what we can offer as a reward at the moment for supporters beyond knowing someone is looking out for their privacy and security, but any suggestions are welcome.\u003cbr\u003e"
