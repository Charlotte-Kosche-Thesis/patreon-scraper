I\u0027ve released hundreds of music videos on YouTube since 2011, and I make a living as an independent artist thanks to my incredible Patreon supporters!!

I am so thankful to have a platform like this now that enables me to regularly make new music. Please consider supporting a dollar (or more!) per music video that I upload to YouTube (I post new videos every couple weeks). Quality is my number one priority and with your support I can hire the right people to help me release music that I am proud of. If you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can set a monthly maximum. I never want you to go beyond your means, and I appreciate every one of you regardless!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, making music/music videos is not something I can do all on my own. It requires hiring certain people to help along the way and every dollar will go towards paying for locations, videographers, etc. No joke, without my patrons none of this would be possible! You are the reason I can keep making music. THANK YOU!!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQUESTIONS\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHOW MANY VIDEOS WILL YOU UPLOAD PER MONTH? \u003c/strong\u003eI plan on releasing one to two videos a month. However, that number may be more or less. But do not worry because you can set a monthly maximum when you sign up so that you only contribute what you can afford!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDO I HAVE TO PAY WITH US CURRENCY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 No. All currencies are accepted and converted to US Dollars! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCAN I STOP DONATING IN THE FUTURE IF I CANT AFFORD IT? \u003c/strong\u003eYes!
