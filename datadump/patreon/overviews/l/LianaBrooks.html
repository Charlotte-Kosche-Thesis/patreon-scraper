It was an echo of Tolkien\u0027s memories, but it\u0027s an equally appropriate question for you and I as we sit here across the screen from one another. How did we get here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer. Not because I had a daring dream at age nine to write The Great American novel, but because I was one of those quiet kids with an unruly mind scribbling snippets of stories on the back of my homework. I went to school for a degree in marine biology, but my life took a turn that led me to needing to be home full time to care for my daughter who had learning disabilities. Writing was first an escape, and then it became a way to pay for food and rent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting became a secret door I could open to let other people escape from the stresses, fears, and sorrows of their lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re probably already familiar with my writing. Perhaps you started with \u003cem\u003eSeventy\u003c/em\u003e, the first short story I ever sold. Maybe you jumped into the continuum with \u003cem\u003eThe Day Before\u003c/em\u003e, the first novel I sold and my first piece of time travel fiction. Or maybe you read my latest piece and decided I was a good fit for you. Whatever brought you here - \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming this far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lianabrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Patreon-Headers_Bright-City-Patreon.jpg?resize=1024%2C313\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy did I start a Patreon page? Simple.\u003cstrong\u003e You want books and I write books.\u003c/strong\u003e You have spare change and I like money to buy food. If I write something and you give me a dollar we both have what we want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd really, a dollar does amazing things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 100 people logged in every time a new chapter of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lianabrooks.com/bodies-in-motion/\"\u003eBODIES IN MOTION\u003c/a\u003e was posted on my blog. There are over 3000 people who follow me on Twitter. The newsletter goes out to about 2000 people. On Tumblr 630 people read snippets, short stories, fanfics, and chapters. That\u0027s not a small number of people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne dollar from even a fraction of those people is enough to cover the cost of writing another book. It covers the time spent writing and editing, the cost of getting a professional editor for the book, and the cost of the cover art. It is enough to make the next Heroes and Villains book possible. It makes it possible for me to pay my bills and buy my medications without getting a second job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal #1: Earn $300 a month to cover the medical gap.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen, we all know the healthcare system in the USA is a mess. Reform is necessary, but while we\u0027re working for reform I need to stay alive. I was born with a genetic defect called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The bad code in my genes makes the collagen tissue - the connective tissue - hyper-extendable and lax. This means I wind up dislocating my joints. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome days EDS makes it hard to walk. Some days it makes it hard to move. Constant dislocations of my hips and knees mean I\u0027m in braces and physical therapy. All those dislocations tear the muscles and leave me in pain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy insurance doesn\u0027t cover pain medication. They cover the physical therapy, some of the braces, but not the pain medication I need for my condition. It isn\u0027t an opiod or an addictive form of anything, but my health insurance doesn\u0027t cover pain meds unless I have surgery, and I\u0027m not having surgery.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublishing can be an unreliable form of income. Some months are good. Some months are bad. Over the past two years the gap has averaged out to $300 per month. Using Patreon to provide a reliable income every month means I can stress less and write more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal #2: Write More Books.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt won\u0027t surprise you to learn that authors who aren\u0027t in pain and aren\u0027t stressed are more productive authors. Less stress for me = more books for you. It\u0027s a win-win situation for everyone, really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing goal for 2018 is to write LAWS OF ATTRACTION (the sequel to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lianabrooks.com/bodies-in-motion/\"\u003eBODIES IN MOTION\u003c/a\u003e), HIGH ALTITUDE (the sequel to a book I\u0027m currently shopping with larger presses), POLAR TERROR, Heroes and Villains 4, and WRITE LIKE A VILLAIN (a non-fiction book about - you guessed it - writing!). That\u0027s roughly 300,000 words to write this year, or 1000-words-per-non-holiday-day. That\u0027s not a goal I can reach without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month two new chapters will post on Patreon starting with THE POLAR TERROR (the first few chapters will be open for everyone). Teaser chapters from LAWS OF ATTRACTION and WRITE LIKE A VILLAIN will be posted here. And, sometime later this year, HEROES AND VILLAINS 4 will be posted to Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all goes well with the Patreon experiment Heroes and Villains 5 and 6 will follow in 2019 and 2020.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.lianabrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Patreon-Headers_Bright-City-Rewards.jpg?resize=1024%2C233\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 - Eternal Gratitude (and chapters of your favorite Villains)... full access to the book I\u0027m currently posting, all long-form editions of blog posts, and other fun stuff like photographs, sketches, and sneak peeks.

Do that and I\u0027ll sit down with you to design an original character that will have a cameo in the current book I\u0027m posting.

Toss $1 in my Patreon cap and you can come read at your leisure when the whole book is up. Toss in $2, forget about this website, and wait for the ebook to arrive. Toss in more and maybe I\u0027ll do a happy jig or something, you never know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever works for you, thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.lianabrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Patreon-Headers_Bright-City-Thank-You.jpg?resize=1024%2C520\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming this far.
