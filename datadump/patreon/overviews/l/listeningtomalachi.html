    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon! Listening\n to Malachi is a fiction based podcast that explores the supposed impossible in conspiracy theories and \nthe paranormal. Narrated by the mysterious Malachi, the show contains \nstories, audio recordings, and eye witness testimony that will rob even \nthe bravest of a good night\u2019s sleep. Currently new episodes will release once a month and will be a combination of stand alone \u0027monsters of the week\u0027 and ongoing narratives that will continue a specific story line. Although the episodes are fictional, a lot of work goes into the writing and custom made special effects to give the impression that these tales could very well occur in the real world. You can currently find the show on itunes, stitcher, or podbean:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://listening2malachi.podbean.com/\"\u003ehttps://listening2malachi.podbean.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/listening-to-malachi/id1374754297\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/listening-to-malachi/id1374754297\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://stitcher.com/s?fid=183116\u0026amp;refid=stpr\"\u003ehttp://stitcher.com/s?fid=183116\u0026amp;refid=stpr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to why I am creating this Patreon. My goal for Listening to Malachi is to eventually produce biweekly episodes working at a full time schedule. Currently the show is a low-tech one man operation, and with the help of Patreon I am hoping to expand to hire actors when needed, composers to continue making original music for the show, adding sound effect libraries, a dedicated website, and be able to focus on creating new content on a full time basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In addition to Listening to Malachi, I aim to resurrect my horror centered talk show \"Ghost in the Podcast\"(which currently has 158 episodes recorded before it was put on hiatus in early 2017) and continue creating video content of my paranormal investigations/ghost hunts. I have live streamed both of these shows previously on my twitch channel (www.twitch.tv/baron_von_gosu) and would love to bring these back into the fold with Listening to Malachi to create an ongoing network of new content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly I want you all to know that I love writing, and I love storytelling. Listening to Malachi is a passion project two years in the making that has now gone live. I\u0027m immensely proud of the work created and owe a tremendous debt to those who have supported the project to this stage. To all of you who take a moment to check out this Patreon and especially to those of you who donate even a dollar to help me make this dream come true, thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to entertain you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
