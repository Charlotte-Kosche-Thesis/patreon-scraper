    "summary": "\u00a0A little more about me, my story, and my WHY: It\u0027s a little long, but I do believe you will enjoy it \ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003eIn a word, my why is Serenity, my beautiful little girl, but there is so much more to it than that.  Yes, that is where Threads of Serenity came from, my beautiful little girl, my inspiration, my why.\u003cbr\u003eI have a background in Accounting.  When I left my position as Plant Controller back in July of last year, I had been in manufacturing accounting for almost 15 years.  Fifteen fabulous and more recently, stressful years. Lol.  If any of you are in the field, you know what I mean. lol\u003cbr\u003eI completed my Master of Accountancy @ Auburn in December 2015.  I LOVED being an accountant in the manufacturing sector.   I had HUGE plans.   I was planning to sit for the CMA (certified manufacturing accountant) and CPA (certified public accountant) exams.  I was even considering taking a few more classes so I could be certified as CFA (certified forensic accountant).  But after I finished grad school and had the chance to sit back and breath after 3 years of full-time work and part-time school, I began realizing all the things I missed during those 3 years; time with my family, my friends, myself.  And the more I thought about it, the more I realized those HUGE dreams I had for my career would come with a price; a price I really was not willing to pay.   \u003cbr\u003eI realized that more than anything I wanted to be home with my family, I wanted to go on field trips with my baby girl, I wanted to be home with her in the summer while she is on break, I wanted to be home with her when she was sick without having to worry about conference calls and deadlines.  I just was not sure at that time how I was going to be able to accomplish this new dream.\u003cbr\u003eA little over 1 year ago, I tried my first pair of LuLaRoe leggings; I purchased a pair of Holiday leggings for myself and my daughter.  This was after over 2 years of hearing how AMAZING these clothes were and how I HAD to try them.  I had zero interest in wearing leggings and refused to even look; until I bought that 1st pair.  I figured, hey they are cute, I can wear them around the house, and maybe everyone will quit bugging me to try these darn things if I finally get a pair.  Little did I realize at the time, that this small purchase would forever change my life in unimaginable ways!\u003cbr\u003eI fell in love with those leggings and so did sis.  I wanted to wear them every single day.  So, I bought 2 more pairs and a couple tops a week later.  By January I owned over 30 pairs, 3 Carlys, various tops, and a Maxi.  It is ALL I wanted to wear.  I felt amazing, confident, and so comfortable.  As my husband watched my LuLa addiction, and my confidence in myself grow along with it, he apparently began researching the opportunity offered by LuLaRoe.  One night in mid-January, while I was sitting at home stressing about whatever was going on at work that week, he looked at me and said I think you should give this a shot, invest in LuLaRoe and become an independent retailer.   \u003cbr\u003eI almost fell off my couch!  Hahaha.  There was no way I had time for that and holy cow the investment required to start; what if I failed?  What if it wasn\u2019t for me?  So many thoughts and questions were running thru my head.  Until he looked at me and said, honey\u2026 this is your chance; your opportunity to work for yourself, to build your business, to be home with sis.  I know you and you CAN do this\u2026  He reminded me that I love people, I am a social butterfly, and that I LOVE helping others in any way I can.\u003cbr\u003eSo, I joined the queue.  And I set a goal that, at the time, I was not sure was even remotely achievable \u2013 to be able to leave my full time Controller position by the end of 2017.   I received my call on March 15 and I launched March 26th and was a completely stressed out ball of nerves! Lol.  I hid that to the best of my ability.  I was exhausted, sleep deprived, and could barely move but I smiled, joked, and hung out with some of my closet friends and had a BLAST during that launch.  And I realized\u2026 I really can do this! \u003cbr\u003eFast forward to June; I made the extremely scary decision (with my husband\u2019s blessing of course) to quit my full-time position as plant Controller.  Again, I was a ball of nerves; I made A LOT of money at my job, my salary paid the car payments, the mortgage, and more; if this doesn\u2019t work out\u2026OMG\u2026 what will we do?   BUT I had to try.  My blood pressure was beginning to spike crazy bad from all the stress at work, I felt like I was never home with sis, my evenings and weekends had become consumed with spreadsheets and analysis for work.  I could not take it anymore and neither could my health.  So I took the plunge; I jumped and have never looked back.  And I got \u201cme\u201d back!\u003cbr\u003eI got to spend the summer with my why; my baby girl and my hubby.  I have been able to help out with her school functions since school started back up, I have been able to go on field trips with her, I have been able to take family vacations with no questions asked \u0026amp; no schedules/deadlines to work around, I have been able to take sis and go home to Ohio on a whim and spend 3 weeks with my family before school started back up, I have been able to spend quality time with my friends and family, and I have been able to enjoy life again; enjoy being me again!   \u003cbr\u003eIs it easy? Absolutely not!  Do I still get stressed, overwhelmed, frustrated? Of course, nothing worth doing is completely stress free or easy.  But you know what?  It IS worth it!  I do not regret my decision and I would not change any of it, not for anything!  On the rough days, all I have to do is look at the beautiful, ornery smile on Serenity\u2019s face and it reminds me why I chose to do this, why I will always choose to do this, and it brings me the peace of mind I need to sit back, smile, breath, and keep pushing.\u003cbr\u003eNow that you know a little more about me, I would love to learn a bit more about each of you, your kids, your hobbies, whatever you would like to share \u2764\u003cbr\u003e"
