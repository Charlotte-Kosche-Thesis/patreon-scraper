    "summary": "Hi everyone! I decided to start this Patreon account specifically for you guys to access behind-the-scenes work and additional content that don\u0027t always \"make the cut\" for my blog/social media posts, as well as future projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a Body Positive activist and Mental Health advocate, most known for my eating disorder awareness campaign that went viral last year --\u00a0#BoycottTheBefore. I contributed an article about #BoycottTheBefore to\u00a0Comsopolitan, which went on to be featured by People, Huffington Post, Refinery29, and Shape Magazine to name a few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also known for an article I contributed to Cosmopolitan in October -- \"\u003cem\u003eWhen Fat-Shaming Bullies Terrorized This Body Positive Instagrammer, She Used A Genius Strategy to Cope\u003c/em\u003e\". My story went on to being covered by other news outlets,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/attn/videos/1580878025280984/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eATTN:\u003c/a\u003e being the most prominent. The ATTN: video has accumulated 14 million views to date.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe in my work and the impact I continue to have on and off social media. I feel like approaching serious topics such as body positivity, self love and mental health with a willingness to learn more, authenticity, vulnerability, and big heart have been my biggest strengths. I genuinely enjoy sharing my story, advocating for positive change, and interacting with people from all walks of life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI value sharing much of my work for free, so most of what you see from me already will not change. I reach over 45,000 followers on social media collectively, so I believe a great deal of work regarding body positivity and mental health should be available for everyone (which is why you can become a patron of mine for only $1 per month, and still access everything).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, the work I do requires time, patience, research, educating myself, interacting with, supporting and validating those in recovery/those joining the communities I am a part of, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI thoroughly enjoy the work I do, and would love to continue putting out content I am both proud of and that you enjoy engaging with. This small piece of financial support will be put towards the hours I spend every day creating content and engaging with all of you, as well as go towards ideas I have for future events and projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs my personal platforms on social media grow, I want to continue engaging with every person who reaches out to me. At the moment, I am only one person with a job completely separate from this online work I do! Ideally, in the future, I would love to make this work my full-time job, and this is a first step towards that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, you can access all of my content for $1 per month, or support me at $1 or more per month -- the choice/amount is completely up to you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for your continued support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Lexie\u003cbr\u003e"
