    "summary": "Lithium To Lashes\u0027 blog was created as a place for open dialogue about mental health, particularly\u00a0my own, but with an emphasis on mental health in the Black community. Too many of us suffer in silence because of the stigma surrounding\u00a0mental illness and working toward overall mental wellbeing is so great within our community. In my transparency about my own journey with mental illness, I hope to inspire others to open up or at least let them know they aren\u0027t alone as well as make the topic less taboo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn conjunction with working to reduce the stigma around mental illness, Lithium To Lashes works to show that those of us living with them are multi-dimensional and full human beings. We have hobbies, jobs, are creators, adventurers, and much more. I use my passion for makeup and beauty to show that I am more than my diagnosis. I write product reviews and give makeup tips to those that are new to the beauty world and don\u0027t know where to start. I love to help others accomplish the techniques that will amplify their beauty and take pride in bringing a smile to other\u0027s faces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my Patreon page, I\u0027m going to be sharing even more of my writing on various topics, photos from trips and outings that you won\u0027t see on my social media accounts, and offering access to one on one video makeup tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see exactly what it is I do over at Lithium To Lashes you can visit it here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lithiumtolashes.com/\"\u003ehttp://lithiumtolashes.com/\u003c/a\u003e"

I want to put a more personal touch on mental health advocacy than the often sterile approach we see from large organizations; showing that we are more than our diagnoses and full, multidimensional human beings. Because of the pervasive\u00a0misinformation within our community, I also want to show other Black people that having a mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of and to remind them that they aren\u0027t alone. In my own quirky\u00a0and\u00a0quite\u00a0often scattered way, I want to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness as well as inspire others to do what makes them happy. It took me years to find makeup and writing as an outlet and I want to encourage others who may not know where to start that it isn\u0027t as intimidating as it seems.",
