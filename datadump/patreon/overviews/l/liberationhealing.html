It\u0027s mostly headed up by white folks, rooted in white european history and does not honor in real ways all of the cultures and traditions that have been influential and at its roots.\u00a0The School of Liberation Healing and Medicine is a space where we can share knowledge about suppressed black, brown, queer, two-spirit, trans and gender non-conforming healing histories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe root ourselves in a decolonial framework and center marginalized perspectives on health and healing. We focus on indigenous ways of knowing and being, attempt to unlearn harmful western \u0027scientific\u0027 supremacy and spend time honoring our ancestral medicine and the medicine of our stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, we had the first\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXofT0CfKow\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHerbal Freedom School program\u003c/a\u003e take place and it was an amazing experience to have so many like-spirited folks sharing the space together, connecting with decolonial and ancestral healing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a miniscule budget and less than a handful of co-visionary work exchangers we were able to make class videos and do skype interviews with teachers and community healers and develop some awesome lessons but this was not without some serious challenges and lack of sleep. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot more could have happened with a better platform, better equipment, paid staff and more resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your recurring support so much more will be possible.
