We also have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/lairoflore\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e channel where we host all of our past twitch streams, as well as our podcast and hopefully some original content eventually.

At the moment we have five scheduled stream days. none of these have set end points but they\u0027ll all last at least 2 hours.

Of course to make it a job that doesn\u0027t just help out with bills on occasion it needs to actually make money. So that is the hope with this patreon, give the people who support us a simple way to help us keep doing what we\u0027re doing, and get a bit more out of it too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWell then what do I get out of supporting you?\u003c/h4\u003eFirst of all, you get our undying love and gratitude! Then for a more specific breakdown you\u0027ll have to check the side bars. You will get access to a wide variety of things, from the derpy puppy feed all the way up to us mailing you food with a small mountain of stuff inbetween.\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
