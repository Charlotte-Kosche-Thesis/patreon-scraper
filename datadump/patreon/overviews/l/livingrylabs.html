    "summary": "So many people are struggling with their health and wellbeing. The challenges this brings impacts all areas of people\u0027s life, their families, the communities they live in and our society at large. At Livingry Labs we are building tools to help those that need it the most and the first in-house product is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eVene\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. We are working towards a world where design and science go hand-in-hand, creating communities of passionate people that are helping each other. Using our design and engineering prowess to intentionally create the world we all want to live in and leave a legacy for future generations to be proud of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur team has been working in startups for close to a decade. In education, on community projects and in the design and development of software products. We are aiming to be fully funded and generating revenue by the end of 2018. But, until then we have setup this patreon page where people that believe in us and why we are doing what we are doing can offer their support.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll it takes is a monthly contribution that will cost you less than a night-out. Less than a dollar a day. Less than you spend on coffee per month. Just signup for an account and support us with the amount you can. The money that comes from your support helps us to cover some of our basic operating costs, like software subscriptions, IT resources and office supplies, pay for industry events and fees that come with running a startup (legal, accounting, expert advice).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor you\u0027re support, apart from the awesome feels you get know you are helping great things come into being, you\u0027ll get some goodies and exclusive content once a month. Plus you get to be part of shaping the future of wellbeing and have fun being part of something greater than yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks from the Livingry Labs team!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMat and Graham :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
