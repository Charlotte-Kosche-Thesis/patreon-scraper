My ultimate goal is to create a comic book, but since my time is currently limited - due to a job I enjoy - I realised that the most feasible way to get this story done is to write it as a novel and illustrate it along the way. Then, who knows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll complete one or, at maximum, two chapter covers each month.

But where they thought the worst trouble they\u2019d \nencounter would be misattributed quotes and mixed-up dates, instead \nthey\u2019ll have to deal with realities they\u2019d long debunked as \nsuperstition, powers they would\u2019ve sworn were metaphorical, and people \nwho should\u2019ve long been dead. What does a scholar do when the most \nridiculous story turns out to be true? And what\u0027s there left for a \npriest when the rival religion turns out to be the one that got it \nright?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStick around to find out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://the-state.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chars_s_patreon.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent status:\u003c/strong\u003e I have completed and posted the \u003ca href=\"http://the-state.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efirst part\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e of the story\u003ca href=\"http://the-state.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNo Good Road\u003c/em\u003e (26,000 words) which is now being illustrated while I write the next part, \u003cem\u003eTramontane\u003c/em\u003e (8,000 words and counting, with the first two chapters ready to post).
