With the support of you, I\u0027ll be able to cover larger events, interview more prominent artists and review better products with the additions of more contests and giveaways! I like to think that my blog is unique in the sense that I am the only content generator and therefore, I only post about things myself and my readers find interesting! I hope with the creation of this account, I\u0027ll be able to push the envelope for 2016 with even more intriguing content!\u003cbr\u003e"
