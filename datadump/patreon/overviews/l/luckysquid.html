Like many artists, I think I\u0027ve been drawing since the day I could properly hold a pencil, but my work has vastly improved over the glitter-glue dolphins of my childhood. I started drawing digitally when I was in middle school after my dad gave me my first tablet, and I\u0027ve never looked back. I still love traditional mediums (I\u0027m really into painting D\u0026amp;D miniatures right now!) but it\u0027s the computer that beckons me and it\u0027s been my dream to make something of a living off of my work. Doodle and draw all day for a paycheck? Hell yeah! Especially after sacrificing limb, first born, and the last three years of my life to pay for my college fund.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a graduate of Fullsail University (BS degree as a Game Artist, specializing in character creation), and right now, I\u0027m just trying to stay afloat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWithout commissions, and possibly pledges from you guys (fingers crossed!) I\u0027ll have to go out and get a different job, which will ultimately eat up my time and drain my soul so that I won\u0027t have the energy for my art that I do now. I just want to do what I love, and share that love with you all, so that\u0027s why I\u0027ve put together this Patreon. I want my art to make my viewers as happy as getting to make it made me! All the pledges here will be going to funding the happy little life I\u0027ve made for myself and my family, from groceries and dog food all the way to new programs or tech that\u0027ll allow me to make more interesting things for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/4e6f/f/2017/014/1/7/patreoncats_by_mintskeleton-davc578.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Sometimes I fancy myself a writer, but such a notion is rare, for usually I\u0027m too wrapped up in feels to worry about tense and tone. I graduated from Full Sail with a BS degree in Game Art, and a specialization in character creation, and I\u0027m currently desperately trying to fend off the eldritch horror that has manifested out of my student loans, so please visit my creator patreon or my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://luckysquid.tumblr.com\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e to join me in my epic battle against the ultimate evil~!\u003cbr\u003e",
