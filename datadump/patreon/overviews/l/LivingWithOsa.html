I have spent years trying products and trying to figuring out what works and what doesn\u0027t work for type 4c hair textures. I will continue to have my YouTube channel running along side this new campaign, however I will create exclusive content for my Patron supporters!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou now have a place where, you can come and have confidence that the content is real and is backed with video data entries to support my claims. All research conducted will be collected and documented, over an extended period of time (1- 6 months before conclusions are reached). If research is important to you, then look no further. I am ready to put my hair to the test, and document my journey properly. If this is something you would like to support, I encourage you to donate.

Keeping in mind what moisturizes type 4 hair will ultimately moisturize other textured hair types as well. My goal is that this time next year, is to earn enough so that I no longer have to rely so heavily on ad revenue from YouTube or do unrelated sponsored videos to make ends meet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI learned about Patreon from other content creators that I enjoy watching. I too, made the decision to support those content creators, because I believe in what they do and black content creators are not getting the backing they deserve. I then asked myself, why am I not using Patreon? This would be a great way to raise money for future Research Projects and rally the many supporters who want to say thank you for my contribution to the natural hair community. To fund this campaign simply donate $1 a month, your hair will thank you later.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I can do with the help of the Patron community:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake more content related videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp more naturals have a better understanding of what works and doesn\u0027t work on 4c Natural Hair.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave a video database that 4c Naturals can call their own.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave honest product reviews because it is funded by you.

The main fundraiser of raising $3000- $5000 is to create a natural hair product for kinky, coily hair textures. I am not someone who fully understands how to make products, so using a Lab to research and manufacture a product for me, is the direction I want to go in. Other ways that donations will be used AFTER a product is created. Your donation will allow me to upgrade equipment for filming, buy lighting, \u00a0update my computer for faster editing, invest video editing software and the list can go on. My heart is in the right place and I just want to make content that will speak for itself. When I look back at my legacy within the Natural Hair Community I want to know that, I conducted myself with integrity and helped to make progress in how we care for 4c Natural Hair.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0WHO IS OSA OSULA? \u00a0 \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://nebula.wsimg.com/3daf6208d10b75b965074e584868189c?AccessKeyId=DC439C1CAE6F3E512BD8\u0026amp;disposition=0\u0026amp;alloworigin=1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI am a Physical Education Teacher by day and YouTube content creator by night. I work with 3rd- 8th grade students, and I absolutely love what I do. I am a former professional basketball player, who wanted to take on  a new hobby after sustaining a shoulder injury, that ended my career. I took on college coaching (Women\u0027s Basketball) and did that for 9 years until I retired in 2015.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started my Youtube channel almost 3 years ago and I am so proud of how far I have come. Honestly, I started the channel because 4c natural hair was not represented enough on youtube. I wanted to show others what 4c hair actually looked like and how it behaves when you add certain products to it. I began researching different topics and started testing different theories to see what would happen (the results might shock you). So, if your interest in what I learned over the past 13 years of being being natural you can join me today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI stand by what I am doing, and I know what I share on YouTube has merit and is valuable to so many people. Those of you who support me, I thank you in advance and I welcome you to the new chapter of my life. I am passionate about our hair and the way we care for our hair type, this is truly important to me and it is an honor sharing with you. Lets continue to learning Grow with one another.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOsa\u003cbr\u003e"
