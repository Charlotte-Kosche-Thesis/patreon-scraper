    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there! \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for visiting. My name\u0027s Lee Hulme. I\u0027m a writer, trans activist, and occasional actor/webseries producer/twitch streamer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to join my happy little band of patrons, you\u0027ll be getting 2 things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst: Stories. Always stories.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories about whatever drops into my head. Fantasy, horror, supernatural, comedy, there\u0027s a mix of everything in there. If you\u0027d like to check some out, please visit the story section on my \u003ca href=\"http://leehulme.com/category/writing/stories\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e to find everything from superheroes to cats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love tell more stories, and I\u0027d love to expand into audio storytelling. I have talented friends chomping at the bit to act out in front of a microphone, but I won\u0027t do this without being able to pay them something. So that\u0027s a long-term goal, and I\u0027d love your help towards achieving it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in the short term, there\u0027s a book which needs editing and more short stories to write, and every penny helps me pay more attention to those than I currently pay to working and bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also help to keep me caffeinated, which is very important indeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond: Trans vlogs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis began as blogs, meant to help out people around me after I came out as transgender. They kept going, then got transmuted into vlogs by request. I want to keep making these. I want to dig deeper into things and answer questions and keep trying to help and educate and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do that, again, I need to be able to spend less time worrying about day-to-day stuff and more time thinking on and working on these. I want to ask other people to contribute their time and stories. I want to be able to spread these around. I want to be able to buy the books that will help me explain things. Again, every penny frees up my brain a little bit towards doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see everything already\u00a0 up online by \u003ca href=\"http://leehulme.com/becoming-me-a-transgender-journey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclicking here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you don\u0027t get nothing back, if you decide to support. I\u0027ve set up levels of perks for you to choose from, and I hope they appeal, but I\u0027m also open to suggestions if there\u0027s something you\u0027d really like that isn\u0027t there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow this works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set this up so you can contribute your chosen amount once a month, to help me keep making more and better things.\u003cbr\u003eOnce a month your chosen amount, and no more, will be taken by Patreon and passed on to me.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re not bound to stay with me once you sign up, you can cancel your patronage right away any time you choose, so there\u0027s no risk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise a minimum of two pieces of content a month to you, which could be stories, vlogs, something entirely random, or stuff specially for you folk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSound good?\u003c/strong\u003e Excellent, click the Become a Patron btton above, pick a tier, and sign up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestions? \u003c/strong\u003eNo problem, drop me a line on \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/capn_geekilee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/geekilee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e, or on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"__cf_email__\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/span\u003e/*  */\u003c/a\u003e and we can have a chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e"
