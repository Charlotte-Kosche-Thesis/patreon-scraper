    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWelcome to the \u003cstrong\u003eListen Here Reviews Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e! If\nyou are familiar with the website, you are probably wondering why I (Lauren\nGribble) have decided to start a Patreon (and if you are curious to find out\nmore about Listen Here Reviews, go\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.listenherereviews.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.) If you are a new reader, here\u2019s a\nquick background. I graduated college in 2013, with the goal of starting a\nmusic journalism career, and as my final project as a music business student, I\ndecided to start Listen Here Reviews. At the time, the focus was solely on\nbeing a portfolio to show interested companies my writing when job hunting. The\nonly requirement for the blog (as a class project) was to show that I was doing\nsomething each week, and as such, I spent most of my free time going\nto shows around \u003cstrong\u003eAustin, Texas\u003c/strong\u003e where I live, and writing live show reviews on\nAustin bands.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince then, the site has grown to have an\ninternational audience from cities as far away as \u003cstrong\u003eLondon\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eParis\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eTel Aviv\u003c/strong\u003e,\nin addition to a strong presence throughout the \u003cstrong\u003eUnited States\u003c/strong\u003e. Due to this, I\nhave gotten a chance to not only write about upcoming acts, but also some well-known\nartists that people recognize. With all that said, here\u2019s a little secret.\nSince starting the website four years ago, I have made no money from the site\nat all. I have never run a single ad or generated other revenue. With an\naudience that has reached into the thousands every month, I decided to reach\nout to my audience to ask for your support on Patreon. Below, you will find not\nonly what you\u2019ll be getting if you donate, but how your donation will be\nable to make Listen Here Reviews even better then it is now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want Listen Here Reviews to be around for a\nlong time, and for it to be that way, it must be able to sustain itself. With\nyour donation, I can focus on things such as \u003cstrong\u003ere-designing the website\u003c/strong\u003e, focus on\nbringing more content that \u003cstrong\u003ekeeps you engaged\u003c/strong\u003e, and ultimately, I would get to\nfocus on my favorite part of doing this, which is \u003cstrong\u003ebringing you great music\u003c/strong\u003e that\nI know you\u2019ll love. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere\u2019s how donations on\nPatreon work. You can donate on a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly\u003c/strong\u003e basis for as little as a dollar, and\nif you choose to have a set amount donated, you can cap your donation at that\namount. If you want to stop your donations, you can do so \u003cstrong\u003eat any time\u003c/strong\u003e. All the\ncontent on Listen Here Reviews will continue to be available for you to read,\nwatch, and listen to at absolutely \u003cstrong\u003eno cost to you. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read\nListen Here Reviews. If you know of anyone who would enjoy the site, please\nspread the word."
