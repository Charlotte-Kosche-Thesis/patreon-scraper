    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Who\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello there! It\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Lara Eckener, a poet and writer who lives in Boston, Massachusetts and maintains an ever growing collection of too many books to cut up for collage art. I\u2019ve had several pieces of writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://laraeckener.com/publications/\"\u003epublished over the last few years\u003c/a\u003e, but right now I\u2019m working on kicking the old output into high gear and molding it with renewed purpose. I have a lot of big projects and grand plans in the works, as writers often do, but there are also some smaller, more personal things I\u2019d like to put into the world in the meantime. It\u2019s that desire that has brought me here to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe What\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start off this experiment I\u2019m going to begin work on a chapbook of poetry and short fiction based around a speculative fantasy theme. Over time I would like to add other types of writing projects, such as collaborative projects with friends and serial novel length works, as well as physical art in the form of collage or paintings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the work I create tends to inhabit fantasy and science fiction spaces. My main areas of preoccupation are queer friendships and relationships, what it takes for a person to truly feel at home in their body, and the mysticism that\u2019s bred when the magical and the mechanical meet. My first planned chapbook will look at these things in a cosmic sense, but all of my projects are likely to tackle them in some way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Why\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the recent past I\u2019ve had people ask me how they can pay me for my personal poetry and collage projects. Patreon feels like a good way to allow people to support my work while also allowing myself the added time and resources needed to create more beautiful and professional looking pieces of art to give them in return. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first phase of this project any funds up to $150 a month will go toward materials and time put into creating physical rewards, as well as expenses for an upcoming move that will put me one step closer to having an art space of my own. Any money raised above and beyond that will be used to pay artists for commissioned work to go into future projects and editing services for novel length works before they are shopped around the traditional way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all, I want to create beautiful things in an attempt to give back some of the beauty the world has given to me. I\u2019m excited to get these projects underway one small step at a time and I\u2019m doubly excited for you to join me. I promise to only share creations that I love in the hopes that maybe you will love them too."
