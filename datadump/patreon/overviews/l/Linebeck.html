    "summary": "Hey there, Linebeck here. I\u0027ve been making Let\u0027s Play videos since 2013. Since then, I\u0027ve met and made a lot of cool friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really only do LP because well, I like doing it. I find it really fun and enjoyable telling people about games that they may or may not have played, showing them secrets and details about them. Also partly to show off my \"skill\" at games. Some of them anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently however, I\u0027ve been dealing with some financial trouble, and while I never intend to make Let\u0027s Play a main source of income for me, I thought that I could perhaps make a bit off of it to help support me, as I was recently diagnosed with ADD, and have to pay for appointments and medication for it.\u00a0On top of being a full time student at a univeristy, getting a job, even\n a part time one, has proven to be very difficult. The main purpose of \nthis is to help me get back on my feet, regarding my current situation. I\u0027m also doing this to help me overcome a lot of the issues I face with ADD, namely the lack of focus and issues with procrastination. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do eventually want to be able to stream more, but with my current revenue, living conditions, and internet, my options for that are rather limited. Still, I\u0027ll try to work with what I have available to me. Once my financial situation improves, I can put money towards a better mic and even perhaps a capture card.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf however you are unable to support me, then feel free to spread the word around. Every little bit helps after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd above all else, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
