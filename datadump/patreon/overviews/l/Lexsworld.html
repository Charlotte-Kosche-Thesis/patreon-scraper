I enjoy making content that helps you all be more professional growers and smarter, safer Cannabis consumers. It\u0027s a fun hobby and a busy part-time gig: I get a bird\u0027s eye view on the Cannabis industry while answering countless inquiries and running Cannabis-related projects...not to mention the researching, scripting, filming, editing \u0026amp; uploading of the actual videos! Sadly, big platforms don\u0027t reward creators who aren\u0027t \"brand-safe\" and small platforms can\u0027t - To combat that, in 2018 I launched THIS 420 Club - a place where \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e can get \u003cstrong\u003e1-on-1\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ehelp\u003c/strong\u003e from \u003cstrong\u003eME\u003c/strong\u003e, so if something is important, I can be there to advise each person individually while also building this up into a full-time career.
