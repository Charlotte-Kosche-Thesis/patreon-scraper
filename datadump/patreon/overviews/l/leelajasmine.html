There are thousands of creators here on Patreon. It\u0027s a wonderful platform for artists to receive the support they need to bring their work into the world. Thank you Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eMy name is Leela and I always wanted to be an artist when I grew-up. This summer, after a multitude of synchronistic events it looks like I have grown-up! At 37, I am actualizing a childhood dream. I graduated with a B.A. in Fine Art (painting) back in 2008 and have participated in gallery exhibitions and informal showings as well. I have never stopped creating, the difference is now I am actually asking for the support needed to be an artist. Aaa-mazing. This is where you come in. I would love to create a base of patrons that will help fuel my work. I\u0027m ready to burn bright, but I need some support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eArtful Objective\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI view my work as a connection, if you will, to nature\u0027s living garden. You may be wondering what all that means and I did too, at first. SO, here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got so far (forever a work in progress!):\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGardens provide an abundance of wild beauty, food, shelter...life. In essence they support us. Gardens uplift our mood, enhance our sense of well-being, feeding us in all ways. So, if nature was to have a garden what would it look like...The whole Earth! I look to bring nature\u0027s garden, all its helpers and our (we, humans) inherent connection to this garden forward. The \"living\" aspect of my artistic objective is a reminder that Nature\u0027s Garden is Alive. There is nothing here that is outside of this garden. It speaks to us continuously, it shows us its support ceaselessly, we just have to be aware of the connection we intrinsically have, our innate place in the garden, as the garden. My love of Nature\u0027s living Garden, Earth; animals; Unseen helpers; all things mystical and magical, play muse for my artwork. I aim to bring our connection forward.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Work-Play to be Done\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first goal in stepping into this work is to complete a series of paintings, called\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eCourageous Being\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(7-9 paintings, all 24\"x 36\" acrylic paint, mixed media on wood). Patrons\u0027 support will go toward covering select computer programs subscription costs, supply costs (canvases, paints, brushes, etc) and help cover some living expenses, to give me the time needed to complete this series by the beginning of 2018. The more support given, the more time I can devote to bringing this project to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMore Thanks and Many More to Come\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am eternally thankful for having the courage to ask for help and for those that feel drawn to and have the means to give to this adventure. Thank you with my whole heart!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLots of Love,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLeela\n\u003c/span\u003e"
