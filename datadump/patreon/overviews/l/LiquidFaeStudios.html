    "summary": "Liquid Fae Studios is above all else about fantasy, in every essence of the word. From watercolor illustration to fairy tale stories, my goal is to bring that sense of wonder to anyone who might be looking for it. I remember my very first moment of passion, my first moment of inspiration that gave me the desire to create, and this grand idea of a dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to recreate that feeling for anyone I can. I want to inspire that passion and desire for something great. Whether you dream of being a mermaid, a hero, or something more tangible, I want to inspire that feeling of awe and wonder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin those goals I have a personal desire to create, build, write and make an actual living doing the things I am most passionate about. I\u0027ve been working as a freelance illustrator for about ten years on and off, and those rough times that require a guarantee always seem to lurk around the corner. Freelance can often be unstable, and I have many times had to put my work on the shelf to take care of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy major projects include fantasy, nature, and landscape art, as well as a large set of fantasy novels, Including \"The Lord of Shadows\" series and several new, unrelated stories as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to my Patrons I will be able to focus on writing and working on my art without having to worry about external sources of income, and hopefully one day, be free of that forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we move forward and begin to hit goals I would love to be able to offer even more exclusive content, such as time lapse videos, special live stream events, and early access to new products, books, and giveaways! Also, it is extremely important to me that this be a group effort. Tell me your thoughts, what projects I should be working on, do you want to see a new coloring book? a calendar? a card deck? Lets create a project to get excited about together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow Tier Rewards work:\u003cbr\u003eMonth based Tier Rewards are sent out the second week of each month, after your pledge for that month has processed. Likewise for rewards that go out every three months, your items will be shipped after each third month pledge has processed, and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
