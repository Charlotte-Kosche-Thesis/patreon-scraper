Wilson, and I love to write about vampires...and shifters...and witches...and, well, you get the picture. There\u0027s kissing, and biting, and hot and heavy sexy times, and Happily Ever Afters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, let me just say how grateful I am that I get to do this as MY JOB. And I get to do it because of YOU. So, from the deepest depths of my heart: \u003cem\u003ethank you\u003c/em\u003e.

I used to lie in bed and dream up scenes: a guy with green eyes and curly hair who drives a jeep comes to town and saves a girl (who looked a lot like me) from her boring, small town life. However, her current overbearing boyfriend decides he\u0027s not letting her go. Lots of drama and angst ensues, but then, our hero kisses her...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr, our heroine (who also looked a lot like me) starts college in a town far away from home. She meets some people and gets invited to a party. After much indecision, because she\u0027s an introvert, she decides to go. But when she gets there, she finds this isn\u0027t your ordinary frat house. The heroine runs for her life, and is saved by a hot stranger with green eyes and dark hair. He tells her he hunts the things at the frat house. Lots of tension and harrowing situations ensues, and then he kisses her...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really should have written those down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all that time, it never once occurred to me to try to become a writer. I played around with poetry. I was the weird kid who loved writing essay papers. (Mostly I loved the research, and thought about working in a library for a while, or maybe as a historian.) I took every English, Literature, or Writing class I could in high school and college, and yet I thought getting a Business degree would be a better option. Because I\u0027m a Taurus, and the practical side of me almost always wins over the creative side of me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/13d0e9_5017ff0dfa634ef497e3927ef42b6817~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_600,h_430,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/13d0e9_5017ff0dfa634ef497e3927ef42b6817~mv2.webp\" style=\"width: 368px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what changed my mind? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA dare.

And this time, I wrote them down. One year and two moves later, (to a rental and then our own tiny home in Seattle), I published my very first book. And to my shock and surprise, readers \u003cem\u003eI didn\u0027t know\u003c/em\u003e actually read it. AND, they started giving it really good reviews.
