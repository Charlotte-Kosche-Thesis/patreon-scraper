    "summary": "Unoffensive Animal is an activist collective. We strive for a world where activism isn\u0027t needed, but we recognise activism is the only way to reach that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlthough mostly focused on animal rights, Unoffensive Animal also reports news and actions about direct action on defence of the earth and we also highly regard activists taking steps towards human liberation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur work is diverse. We have been giving \u003cstrong\u003eworkshops\u003c/strong\u003e around Europe, we have been \u003cstrong\u003etravelling\u003c/strong\u003e from activist occupation to animal rights actions over and over in the last months, not only to \u003cstrong\u003ebring you news\u003c/strong\u003e from the front line but also to \u003cstrong\u003esupport the activists locally\u003c/strong\u003e. We do \u003cstrong\u003epublic speakings\u003c/strong\u003e and organise \u003cstrong\u003ecreative actions\u003c/strong\u003e. We admin and send \u003cstrong\u003eprisoner support\u003c/strong\u003e letters around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter a wave of internet oppression, we have had to move away from a simple Facebook Page and we will be setting up a website to be able to reach you all without censorship. That means some extra monthly costs over our already expensive travel costs, tools, vehicle rentals and prisoner support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have no idea what sort of rewards we can offer. Unoffensive Animal was set up to empower activists and we are \u003cstrong\u003eALWAYS\u003c/strong\u003e open to your emails and messages asking questions. We do not charge for workshops. We want information to be free and to give activists power and strength to carry on fighting. For that reason, we haven\u0027t offered a \"reward\" in exchange for whatever cash you can give. Just email us with whatever we can help, we don\u0027t care if you\u0027re giving money or not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e We have decided that 20% of your donations will be separated from the rest every month and kept in a \"Solidarity Pot\".\u003c/strong\u003e This will be used for prisoner support, activist fines and overall legal money for those who risk their freedom to create a better future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBecause we are inherently anticapitalists but we recognise that living within capitalism has costs, we have a love-hate relationship with money. As a collective, we have decided that \u003cstrong\u003eevery 6 months we will clear out our account to zero and donate whatever money we have left (if we do) to a sanctuary of your choice.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are open to other suggestions. We are aware that money is problematic, but we have reached the point where we cannot carry on with our work without some support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eGive if you can, share if you want. Change the world however you\u0027re able to.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e For true animal liberation, for a change in the system, in defence of the Earth.\u003cbr\u003eUntil every cage is empty, every mouth is fed, every prison is a library and everybody is free!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
