Welcome to my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a voice actress and one of the writers for\u003cem\u003e Black Lagoon Abridged, High School of the Ditz, Room Mate Mini\u0027s \u003c/em\u003eand many other series on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may also know me as the voice of Sombra in the Team Talon Dubs by Seigi VA, Kae from Abridge Him, Not Me and other works in the Abridged Community. If you wanna see a full list of things I am in, please check out my YouTube, Twitch, or Twitter for details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I doing a Patreon, you may ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, the work I do for abridged series is non-profit. I do monetize comic dubs (only with creator\u0027s permission) but unfortunately, I do not make much in the sense of ad revenue that is able to support me financially. While I do love creating these amazing works, it takes time, and unfortunately, money to make these projects work (Adobe Creative Cloud fee\u0027s and the like). This page is meant to help out artists and myself keep doing what we love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo be clear, the abridged series being created on this channel are NON-PROFIT.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I will NEVER monetize any abridged series. The videos being posted up in terms of abridged are solely\u00a0the intellectual properties of the rightful owners. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003eComic dubs, however, are FOR-PROFIT works\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. They take a bit less time to do but still help keep food on the table, so to speak.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon Page is to help me make the content you know and love. If you wanna keep supporting me and what I do, pledge. You\u0027ll gain early access to my videos before they go up on YouTube (or any other video platform if demonetized/taken down), be able to see scripts of never before seen series, see From the Vault drafts of long dead/uncompleted works and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for the support and join the FIRE NATION!\u003cbr\u003e"
