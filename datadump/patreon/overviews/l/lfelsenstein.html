    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOrigins\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI come from an activist family \u2013 both of\nmy siblings and a cousin were at the 1963 civil rights March on\nWashington \u2013 we only recently found out the others were there. I\nwas able to participate in the Free Speech Movement because I failed\nto get a security clearance for my NASA work-study job. Lessons I\nlearned from that experience helped me elude the military draft\nduring Vietnam. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\nan engineering student at Berkeley in 1963 I thought that people\nsmarter than me would tell me what to design and I would design it.\nNext year during the Free Speech Movement I discovered the flaw in\nthis concept -  my intellectual betters were ignorant of what it took\nto bring a new device into existence. I decided to not leave it to\nothers and do my own exploration - a good decision that has paid off\nfor me and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 1964 Free Speech Movement at Berkeley was\na revolution \u2013 the counterculture grew out of it and thousands of\npeople \u2013 mostly students, changed their life courses in the\nprocess. I was no exception \u2013 and began to explore the question of\nwhat technologies I could create to allow people live free, creative\nlives in sustainable communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMedia\u003c/h4\u003eI began to write and worked\nfor the Berkeley Barb underground paper while in school. I tried\nthings and learned from the results, and I began thinking about\ndecentralized media. Eventually I realized that a network of\ncomputers would be the right thing \u2013 then found that others had\nobtained a serious computer for use by the counterculture. I joined\nthem (Resource One Inc.) and brought my ideas with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether\nwe created the first computer public-access social media system,\ncalled Community Memory. We showed that people could use it and were\nattracted by it. I began to think about how to let the equipment\nsurvive in public use \u2013 and began to work out the architecture of a\n personal computer. I designed a modem that could also spool data\nfrom a cassette player. The computer was installed in a \u201cwarehouse\ncommunity\u201d - Project One \u2013 in San Francisco and I lived there for\na year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe PC underground\u003c/h4\u003eDuring that time I consorted with the small band of\nhackers and visionaries who were discussing what personal computers\ncould and should do when they came into being. In 1974 I\nself-published an engineering specification for a personal computer\nthat would start life as a terminal (we had only Teletypes and\nexpensive CRT terminals then) and grow with plug-in modules to become\na computer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen in 1975 a near-bankrupt company in\nAlbuquerque offered the \u201cAltair 8800\u201d for sale - a personal\ncomputer kit at a good price. Along with thousands of other hackers,\nhams, bored doctors and just plain engineering geeks I got busy\nworking out what to do with it. I was at the first meeting of the\nHomebrew Computer Club with 30 others (including Woz) to look at and\ndiscuss the first Altair to hit Silicon Valley. By the fourth meeting\nI was organizing and running the meetings, and continued to do so for\n11 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePayoff\u003c/h4\u003eThen my exploring started to pay off \u2013 I was able\nto apply my personal computer spec and design a video display adapter\nfor the Altair \u2013 the \u201cVDM-1\u201d that set the standard for how\nvideo was presented on the personal computer. That architecture is\nstill in general use today \u2013 unless you\u0027re reading this on paper\nyou\u0027re seeing it presented that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI redesigned the modem I\nhad made for Community Memory as a product that lowered modem prices\nby a factor of three \u2013 it could be successfully sold as a kit. I\ndesigned a whole computer around the display architecture which was\noffered for sale in 1976 when Apple was still designing their Apple\n2. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI became a bit of a celebrity in the small personal\ncomputer world. In 1981 Creative Computing magazine\u0027s announcement of\nthe Osborne-1 portable computer opened with the words \u201cLee\nFelsenstein has done it again!\u201d Adam Osborne, a well-known\nself-promoter, had asked me to design what became the first\ncommercially successful portable computer in exchange for 25% of the\ncompany, and the article was a reaction against Adam\u0027s minimizing my\ncontribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eIn the Sunshine\u003c/h4\u003eOsborne Computer went bankrupt two years later,\nand I continued to explore. I helped Stewart Brand start the Hackers\nConference in 1984 as the publication party for Steven Levy\u0027s book\n\u201cHackers \u2013 Heroes of the Computer Revolution\u201d (where I was\nfeatured in the cast of characters), and later advised Brand in the\nformation of the WELL (an online community that set high standards\nfor others). I had a major role in \u201cFire in the Valley\u201d - the\nfirst journalistic account of the personal computer\u0027s history,\npublished in 1984.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hung around the San Francisco-Moscow\nTeleport in 1986 and 1987 as it developed people-to-people email ties\nwith Soviet citizens. In 1989 I was sent to Moscow to check out a\nbusiness school in formation \u2013 I used the opportunity to explore in\nthe Soviet hacker underground. I tried to form a company to prospect\nfor business in Russia but backed off in 1991 - the\nplace was overrun by thieves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Lab\u003c/h4\u003eDuring this time I survived\neconomically by doing electronic design work on contract. As this\nbecame a slowly-failing business I jumped at the opportunity to be\namong the first employees at Interval Research Corporation \u2013 Paul\nAllen\u0027s research lab, where I spent 8 years designing prototypes for\nan amazing batch of researchers. They closed up shop in 2000 and I\nwas back to doing contract work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe \"Pedal-Powered Internet\"\u003c/h4\u003eIn 2002 and 2003, while\nemployed by a company that did contract product development, I\naccepted a challenge on the side and designed a village\ntelecommunications system based on Wi-fi, voice over IP, and embedded\nsystems (and powered by batteries recharged by a bicycle generator) for a group of refugee villages in Laos. I burned off my\nvacation time to fly over there and attempt the installation, which\nfailed in the software area (it may have been sabotaged). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe New York Times Magazine included the idea in their 2002 \"Best Ideas of the Year\" issue, dubbing it \"The Pedal-Powered Internet\". The story\nof the expedition made the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle. Back at my job,\nwhere we were designing a military communication system, someone\nlooked up and told my managers \u201cwe can\u0027t do anything to him \u2013 he\ndoesn\u0027t have a clearance\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOff to Tunis\u003c/h4\u003eThat company closed up shop in\n2005, and I went to Tunis for the World Congress on the Information\nSociety \u2013 by that time I was blogging as a critic of the \u201cOne\nLaptop Per Child\u201d (OLPC) program that was introduced there.\nThey were a highly connected Media Lab spinoff \u2013 during the\nintroduction Kofi Annan, mistakenly assuming that the hardware model\nwas real, broke off the balsa-wood crank when he tried to demonstrate\nrecharging the battery on stage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was OLPC\u0027s primary\nopposition voice and my criticisms were published on the independent\n\u201cOLPC News\u201d website. While I never got a response from OLPC I was\nvindicated by the fact that no country took them up on replacing\ntheir educational system with the product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso that year I\nwas invited to give a talk in a series on spirituality and technology\non the roots of personal computing. The talk, titled \u201cThe Arming of\nDesire\u201d was delivered in the \u201cWaag\u201d in Amsterdam \u2013 in the\nroom that was the anatomical dissection theater pictured by Rembrandt\nin his famous 1632 painting that we know as \u201cThe Dutch Masters\u201d\n(from the cigar box on which it appeared).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLooking for a Job\u003c/h4\u003eOccasionally some\nwell-meaning people would advise me to knock off this crazy stuff and\nget a stable, good-paying job. My last attempt in 2013 was working\nfor some small-scale Russian oligarchs designing petrochemical safety\nmonitoring equipment \u2013 they disciplined me twice for not being a\ngood enough Dilbert before the project ran into optical technology\nproblems and I was out again. No, thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI got hired in 2001 and again in 2013, but increasingly employers would talk with me and then - silence. In one case I responded to an agency and spoke with an engineer in the target company who said he would recommend me for the next step. Hearing nothing again, I called the agent, who told me in a brusque tone of voice that the job had been filled. I looked and the job posting was still on the site - and remained there for weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have projects - some in process - but now have to spend my time chasing contract work and carrying it out. If that\u0027s what the rest of my working life would be like then I need to develop an alternative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\nwould be great if someone offered me a job to be an adventurer, but\nsince no one is advertising for this, I want \u003cstrong\u003eall\nof you\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003ehire\nme\u003c/strong\u003e for that\nposition \u2013 an old revolutionary urged forward by visions of a new\nworld to come \u2013 \u201cnostalgic for the future\u201d. I\u0027ve got the experience and the skills - plus a list of projects awaiting completion - see \"\u003cstrong\u003eComing Attractions\u003c/strong\u003e\" in the posts (the contents will change as projects get completed or are modified). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou, my\ncollective patron, will not only provide financial support but will\nalso serve as my audience and colleagues. Your involvement will help me\nimprove my understanding of the idea(s) under development so I (or\nyou) can take sections of the ideas and turn them into practical\nimplementations \u2013 I have too many to keep to myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour\nsupport will be invaluable in helping me develop and realize the\ntypes of adventures described in the posts. Let\u0027s go!"
