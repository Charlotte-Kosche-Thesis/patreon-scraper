I\u2019m Kristine Kruta, and I love music. Specifically, creating music - I\u2019m a cellist, arranger, producer, semi-knowledgeable audio engineer, and composer. I\u2019m also a pretty great chef, but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here today! You\u2019re here because of Little Kruta.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s \u201cLittle Kruta\u201d?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tLittle Kruta is a pop chamber orchestra I started around 2015 that consists of mainly strings (a LOT of strings), vocals, horns, percussion, piano, and other fun stuff thrown in for good measure. Honestly it changes shape pretty frequently - but that\u2019s the beauty of it! The name is from my childhood nickname - my mom would nickname me \u2018Little Kruta\u2019 and my father \u2018Big Kruta.\u2019 He passed away a few years ago, so this is my way of honoring his memory with something he loved - music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eIn the last 3 years I\u2019ve put out a 5-track EP, 8-track album, re-orchestrated over 50 covers, arranged several original songs for other artists, produced a bunch of live shows and studio sessions... *runs out of breath*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3CsKyByniQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat purpose does Little Kruta serve?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eListen, I *love* arranging. I also love bringing people together and creating a space for people to make new friends, collaborate with those new friends, feel good and make some music just for the joy of making music. So with that in mind over the years, I finally tied it all together! \u003cem\u003ePLUS:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eA)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I needed an outlet for all of my arranging (it\u0027s my #1 favorite thing to do... if I\u0027m not watching Law\u0026amp;Order... Also, what good is having 300 files saved quietly on my computer when I could have some of New York\u2019s most talented musicians bring them to life?)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eB)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0There are so many incredible artists struggling to be seen in this city. I have the ability to bring together an excellent ensemble, write charts, direct and all, so why not share the love? The vocalists and soloists that join my orchestra are always incredibly hard-working, dedicated artists (most of which have almost never had the chance to perform or record with an orchestra) and they deserve to be seen. I want to help!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eC)\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMusic is healing. Strings are special. I\u2019m offering a safe place for artists to come emote together; a hideaway from competition and a haven for music-lovers to just vibe together unhindered, unjudged.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/frSf3Y56RJ0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy use Patreon? Can\u2019t you just do this on your own?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eI am a freelance cellist and constantly run around this city playing studio sessions, live concerts, TV shows, theater performances, orchestra jobs, literally anything. I write and arrange music for other people, and I\u2019ve had desk jobs and studio jobs and restaurant jobs... But playing music full-time is what moves me and honestly, how I feel I can most positively contribute to this world in which we all live. All that being said, I work really hard every day. \u003cbr\u003e\n\tThis Patreon funding will help me continue to press forward with this orchestra as it will give me a little more breathing room financially to spend more time on arranging, contracting, producing, and editing. The musicians that play these arrangements are all professionals living in the city, and I want to pay each one so that they can confidently spend time working on this music. I also want to pay an audio engineer+recording studio so that we can continuously have high-quality recordings that you, the Patron!, can download and enjoy at any time, and cover costs for rehearsal space should we need it for a live performance.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLjwfCwBZnE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u2019s hard to ask for help. \u003c/strong\u003eEspecially when you\u2019re a stubborn, I-Can-Do-It-On-My-Own-But-Thanks person like me.
