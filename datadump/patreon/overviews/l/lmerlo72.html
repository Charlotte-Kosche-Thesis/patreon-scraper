    "summary": "Hey guys!\nMy name is Luis Merlo, and I\u0027m the designer behind the Creatures of the Labyrinth website.\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u0027t know me, I\u2019m an\nartist and illustrator from Ecuador, with other hidden passions such as writing and design. Some of you might know my work from \"The Pokedex Project (Pokemon Reimagined)\" or the \"Elder Sign Project\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/ed4d/f/2016/062/5/2/patreon_showcase_1_by_lmerlo72-d9trxeb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy work usually features dark themes, ranging from really classic, gothic stuff to cyber or\nindustrial designs, with the occasional fantasy or fantasy piece\u2026 Usually influenced by the works of HP Lovecraft.\u003cbr\u003eSince\nI\u2019m also a full-time geek and video game lover, my content feed is usually\nadorned with the occasional redesign or reimagining videogame universes or tributes to my favorite characters from the 90\u0027s. Right now, I\u0027m working on the Pokedex Project: Anniversary, which involves reimagining ALL 151 Pokemon, all of them done individually with ink and watercolor pencils.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/646b/f/2016/206/7/c/pokedex_samp_by_lmerlo72-dabd5tq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sta.sh/02bgeu3vmpbx\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig11.deviantart.net/0bda/f/2016/062/d/4/patreon_showcase_2_by_lmerlo72-d9trxug.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e you support me on Patreon? Well, for one, you would be getting some really cool rewards, which are ever growing and changing according to what the community wants. You would also help to get the Pokedex Project to more generations (with current funding I can only do Gen 1). Finally, you would become a patron of the arts, and a member of The Labyrinth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy largest reward as of now is available for as little as $5 per month, this is \u003ca href=\"http://www.creaturesofthelabyrinth.com/book-of-monsters\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Book of Monsters\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s an epic undertaking to record, in a fantasy-encyclopedia style book, the details of all first gen pokemon. Every creature is redesigned using their original characteristics as base, and renamed to suit a fantasy world. This project will remain Patron-Exclusive, and you will gain access to a new species every month (Subject to increase with funding).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig05.deviantart.net/d6b8/f/2016/234/9/6/book_of_monsters_cover_by_lmerlo72-daexjw2.png\" style=\"width: 161px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/12b2/f/2016/234/4/5/mock_1_by_lmerlo72-daexjvm.png\" style=\"width: 159px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig12.deviantart.net/dbc8/f/2016/234/9/0/mock_2_by_lmerlo72-daexjvb.png\" style=\"width: 163px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re on the fence, please visit my web gallery, where you will experience where we are now, and where we\u0027re heading:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.creaturesofthelabyrinth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCreatures of the Labyrinth\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnyway,\nplease consider supporting me, check out the reward tiers, and help me bring more creepy creatures to life!\u003cbr\u003e"
