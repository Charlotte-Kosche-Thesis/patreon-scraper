So why back us? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we\u0027re hoping to achieve is to add another voice into the gurmz jurnalisrm mix, a fresh one tailored to everday people and run by a team who absolutely won\u0027t be influenced by publishers or advertising.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLoadScreen is headed by Tom Heath and Charlie Braithwaite, two (mostly)\u00a0professional journalists, who are so professional they have PREVIOUSLY BEEN PAID TO WRITE BY NEWSPAPERS. Any money you can help us out with will keep us clothed and fed whilst we attempt to fill 0.000001% of the Internet up with unbias, engaging and entertaining gaming content. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been at this for a year, and what we have demonstrated isn\u0027t even half of what we have planned. But the thing is, it\u0027s an uphill battle getting noticed, and quality content can only get us so far before we need to sink some cheddar into the machine. Is that a common phrase? Anyway, once the machine has been sufficiently cheddard we\u0027ll be able to journalism even harder. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both work freelance on the side to support this, and it\u0027s not yet something we can do fulltime, but that could all change with your help. What you will gain from this is an even better site to rely on, one that wants to break the shackles of a market dominated by the same old organisations. We would also love to be able to pay some likeminded writers to join our team, because we absolutely hate having no budget to pay the awesome people who contribute to our site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us we will be eternally grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLoadScreen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
