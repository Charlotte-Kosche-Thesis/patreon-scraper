After many years of writing and private blogging, I recently decided to create a space to share some of my thoughts about plants, ecology, and science education with friends, scientists, educators, and other interested folks.\u00a0 I\u0027m glad you\u0027re curious about my work, and I\u0027m excited to share it with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I start out here on Patreon, I am planning to share:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eScience education blog posts, suitable for a broad audience (always free).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eScience blog posts related to plants, ecology, and sustainability (patron-only).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOriginal artwork ranging from scientific technical illustrations to abstract, full-color botanical designs (patron-only).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time allows -- and based on the interests of patrons -- I plan to expand the content.\u00a0 The existing Goals list some early expansions, and reaching each Goal will unlock an additional one with a new content option!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy is a science education site privately listed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome of my teaching has included topics related to human reproductive anatomy and physiology, differences in sex development, medical gender transition, human sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, and birth control methods.\u00a0 Several friends and colleagues have told me that they would be especially interested in educational content on these topics, so this is likely to be the third topic area I develop here on Patreon.\u00a0 While I believe that anyone with a college degree should have a basic understanding of all of these topics, many people consider some or all of these topics unsuitable for minors.\u00a0 Putting such materials behind a paywall is my way of limiting that conflict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for supporting me on this journey!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFaculty working on contingent appointments often face job insecurity and are paid less per credit hour than our full-time and tenure-track counterparts.\u00a0 We also now make up the majority of faculty in the United States.\u00a0 In becoming a patron, you are not only supporting my own financial stability, but allowing me to bring a higher quality education to my students.\u003cbr\u003e"
