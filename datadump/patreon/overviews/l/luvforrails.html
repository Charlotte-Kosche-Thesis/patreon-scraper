    "summary": "Thank YOU for being here! I\u0027m an installation artist, city researcher and writer in Berlin, Germany, where I\u0027m creating temporary art, sculptures out of different materials, which you can see in this 2-min-video. Sometimes I work on commission and my art has been exhibited in shows in Berlin and abroad. My installations are usually large scale and require a huge amount of work and time. Sometimes I rely on a grant to co-finance my work, though the competition is high, and just the application processes are a job in themselves. Through my projects, I traveled all over Berlin and got to know various places off the beaten tracks: this made me a local of many districts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this channel, I\u0027m happy to share with you short stories from my ongoing projects, railway stories, anecdotes and much more from my knowledge about Berlin, a fascinating city that never wears out.

It\u0027s an exciting process, with many insider stories about Berlin and about the railway of the city. YOUR subscription contributes to the big vision behind the project: an art space at the scale of the city, with re-designed abandoned buildings and new opportunities for artists of all sorts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour subscription on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you thinking about becoming a patron of the arts?\u00a0As one of my patrons you get access to local stories and photography starting with 1 $. The currency of the website is in dollars, but you can contribute in any other currency.\u00a0You can change this anytime you choose to do so, either by changing the monthly subscription, or by taking a break from it.\u00a0I\u0027m also grateful to you if you share this page with your circles, sometimes it\u0027s not immediately clear who is a railway fan. I keep uploading new content regularly and I\u0027m happy to share my work and my Berlin stories with you. This is a lot about stories along the railways, with or without trains, about art in public space, but also about a Berlin off the beaten tracks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also get to know me better by having a look at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/sitespecificideas\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e account.
