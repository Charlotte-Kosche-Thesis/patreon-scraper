I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to have had patrons my whole life, from my mom to friends who have allowed me to get the tools I need to make music and develop as an artist. This has not been lost on me and I am forever grateful. I just wanted to open up this page so that if there\u0027s anyone who would like to give that encouragement and tangible support of contributing financially to the making of my music, you can. You\u0027ll be charged each time I create a song, and right now I\u0027m not planning on releasing more than a song a month, but you can set a monthly limit of how much you\u0027re willing to be charged each month just in case I release more songs than one. I\u0027ll let you know if I think I\u0027ll be releasing more than one song a month and keep you posted when you become a patron. Thank you so much for giving and I\u0027m excited to see what we will do together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLee G"
