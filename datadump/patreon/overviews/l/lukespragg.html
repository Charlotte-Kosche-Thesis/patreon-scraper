You may know me as \u003cstrong\u003eWulf\u003c/strong\u003e around the Oxide community and gaming world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhere it all began...\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSince January of 2014,\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve been supporting and maintaining the Oxide project \u003cem\u003enearly 24/7\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ve learned a lot along the way, and now probably dedicate way too much time toward the project. There are other projects I am involved in since long before Oxide, but the Oxide project is my primary focus right now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs much as I love supporting and making things for others to enjoy for free, it won\u0027t pay the bills!\u00a0On average, I probably receive around \n\u003cem\u003e$50 per year, usually $10-20 randomly\u003c/em\u003e and that\u0027s about it. In order to continue the same level of time and dedication toward the development and support of the project, something has to change, else I\u0027ll need to take time away from the project to support myself and family.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat I hope for...\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, I hope to be able to push forward with Oxide project and finish up a lot of what I haven\u0027t had much time for lately. The goal is to bring enough in so that I don\u0027t have to split my time between a full-time job and the Oxide project. Developing Oxide and supporting those that use it is something I love, and I want to make it the best it can be, but that all depends on you!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
