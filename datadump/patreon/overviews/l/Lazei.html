If any of you guys like my work and are looking to support me making more content, then feel free to contribute.

Patrons can \u003cstrong\u003eenter into the raffle by leaving a comment in the raffle box \u003c/strong\u003eI put out every month with their suggestion (which can be found among my text posts). After the month is over, I will pick and choose \u003cstrong\u003eat random\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the winners from that raffle box.
