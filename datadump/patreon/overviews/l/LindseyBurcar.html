    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Lindsey Burcar, also known by the name of my\ncharacter, \"Rhos\". As an artist, I have always aspired to bring to\nlife and unleash the beasts and monsters of my imagination to adorn your walls,\nterrorize your work desks, fly across your computer screens, and claim the\npages of books.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the last few years I\u0027ve been doing just that, while\nfeeling out my niche in the world of freelance fantasy illustration. While\nthere is no lack of work for me, it would be such a wonderful thing to be able to financially justify\nworking on passion projects that not only I want to work on most, but the\npeople who have been supporting and appreciating my work want to see most. I\nwould love to be able to give back to my fan base, as well as take my art to\nthe next level and grow as an artist at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith\nthis Patreon I hope to be able to spend more of my time working on sculpture,\nto eventually be available for sale in casts and molds of various creatures for\npainting or artistic reference. Its a long road to get to that point, and I\nwould like to explore more of what I\u0027m capable of as well as offer exclusive and\nvery limited sculpture commission slots to my Patreon supporters. I would also\nlove to take up digital 3D sculpture again as well, via Zbrush, etc.!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlong\nwith sculptures and comics, I\u0027ve always wanted to try my hand at more\ncostuming, and monster making. I\u0027d love to document my process for you all to\nsee, so you can learn with me along the way and collect helpful tips and\ntricks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\nguys are interested in the stories I\u0027ve had in my head for years, I\u0027d love to\nshare comic shorts of my personal characters with you all, and hold special\nraffles for supporters of a certain level to have their likeness or character\nfeatured somewhere in the comic!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnimation\nis something I have always had a keen interest in. I\u0027ve tried my hand at it on\nmultiple occasions, and would love to share more. If enough interest is\nexpressed, I will share my learning process as well as take votes from\nsupporters for subject matter.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLastly,\nI\u0027d love to create and share more personal drawings and paintings for everyone\nto enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreating creatures in my passion. I want to do more, create\nmore, help my fellow artists, give back to my fan base, and take my art to the\nnext level for all of you to enjoy. \nThank you so much for taking a look at my Patreon here, and be sure to\nlook out for all kinds of Progress pictures, tutorials, givaways, and stories,\nexclusive to you awesome people here. There\u0027s so much I have planned, and I\ncan\u0027t wait to have you be a part of that. \nUntil then, see you soon.\u003cbr\u003e"
