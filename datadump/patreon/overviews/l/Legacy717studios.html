And to which I am highly dedicated to seeing them reach the masses one day in a variety of media formats.

Which brings me here to Patreon, where I\u0027m reaching out to my fans and those who want to become investors to back my series projects goals, and if I\u0027m lucky, finally achieve my dreams of pursuing my creative endeavors full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOkay, You Have Peeked My Interest,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 So How Does This Whole Patreon Thing Work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, simply put, Patreon is kinda like crowdsourcing funding project sites similar to Kickstarter, except you will be investing in my creations over the long term, and not just per project at one time. That doesn\u0027t mean of course that I\u0027m expecting \u003cem\u003emillions\u003c/em\u003e of amounts of funding to start pouring in, far from it, but the general idea to me is Patreon is a site where people\u0027s numerous little amounts of investments can grow into stable flow of income which will allow creators such as myself the opportunities to turn their creative passions into a full-time careers. Hence why I am initially just starting out asking for pledges of only a \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1 dollar\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e a month, as I feel that is the most realistic tier for most people to pledge to. Although you are always welcome to pledge more if you like, I won\u0027t complain, promise...lol All kidding aside, any pledge amount I\u0027m fortunate enough to receive has my everlasting gratitude to you, and that is not just lip service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you do wish to sign on as one of my Patrons, you subscribe to a monthly pledge/investment to my page account through the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u201cBecome a Patron\u201d\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003elink button located above.
