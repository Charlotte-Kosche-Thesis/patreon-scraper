    "summary": "A while back, I received a review for my book \u003cem\u003eDead Heat\u003c/em\u003e\nthat summed up with the following: \u201cMs. Nowak, if you have a day job other than\nwriting, please do us all a huge favor and quit. All of us, and particularly\nAmerica\u2019s youth, desperately need you to spend *all* of your time creating\nthese thought-provoking, eye-opening \u0026amp; encouraging little masterpieces.\nThank you!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I longed to do just as this reader suggested, it simply\nwasn\u2019t possible. My writing business doesn\u2019t pull in enough income. Then I\ndiscovered Patreon and realized I might be able to accomplish this lifelong\ndream through the generosity of people like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lisanowak.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/who-am-i.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a kid, books were my refuge. They gave me all the\nthings I didn\u2019t have in \u201creal\u201d life. True friends. A family who loved and\nsupported one another. Hope for the future. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014no one beat me\nor starved me\u2014but there was very little emotional warmth in my life. Books\nshowed me there was another way to live. Now I\u2019m in a position where I can pay\nit forward to kids who are in similar situations, and by supporting me, you can\nhelp support the kids I write for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe teens who read my books are often at-risk and reluctant\nreaders. My stories not only contain a lot of action, but they feature kids\nmuch like my readers, so they hold a lot of appeal. I\u2019m confident they fill an\nemotional need (not just with these teens, but with adults) because of the\nemails I\u2019ve received from:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\nA\nschool counselor who used my Full Throttle series to help a student work\nthrough his anger issues. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\nA\nteacher who ordered twenty copies of \u003cem\u003eDead Heat\u003c/em\u003e to use in her class\ncurriculum. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\nA\nmother who said I\u2019d given her insight into her relationship with her troubled\nadult son. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\nA\nwoman who told me \u003cem\u003eRunning Wide Open \u003c/em\u003ehit close to home because she\u2019d had\na difficult childhood and now works with kids who have behavioral issues. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\nA\nman who related deeply to \u003cem\u003eDead Heat\u003c/em\u003e and the Full Throttle series because\nof the manipulation and emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being emotionally satisfying, my books turn\nkids (and adults) into readers.

Even if\nmy stories do nothing more than give a neglected kid a few hours of escape, I\nfeel I\u2019m contributing something positive to the world. Will you help me do\nthat?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lisanowak.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/why-do-i-need.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time, I was able to write during the winter and run\nmy small landscaping company the rest of the year. But when I launched my\npublishing business in 2011, it became necessary to write year-round, squeezing\nit in when it was too rainy to mow lawns, or on my unpredictable days off. I\u2019m\nnot simply a writer who has a day job. I\u2019m running two demanding businesses,\nwhich means I can\u2019t just walk out the door at the end of the day and leave work\nbehind. I barely manage to meet my self-imposed publishing deadlines, and I\nhave little time for the marketing necessary to get my books into the hands of\nthe kids who need them. Every choice I make regarding what to do with my time\nmeans letting something equally important go undone. Despite this, I\u2019ve managed\nto release a total of nine full-length novels over the past five years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy personal time is practically non-existent. I never get a\nfull weekend. For me, a day I\u2019m not landscaping is an opportunity to write. My\ngreatest bliss is taking my laptop to the river in the summer and staying till\nsunset, working on a book as I watch dogs frolic, kids swim, and boats drift\nby. I like being busy, and I\u2019m actually quite happy to spend the majority of my\nfree time writing, but pushing myself this hard is having a detrimental effect\non my creativity and leads to mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lisanowak.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/river-12.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey say a successful writing career is a marathon, not a\nsprint. I\u2019ve been sprinting for five straight years. I need a change. The\ntrouble is, I\u2019m not a commercial success. I\u0027m simply not able to dedicate the\ntime needed to use proven marketing techniques.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo be successful in my writing career, I need to stop\nlandscaping. But the only way I can do that is if people like you, people who\nbelieve in my books, help out. I\u2019m not greedy. To me, money is simply a tool. I\ndon\u2019t need a ton of it any more than I need a half-dozen shovels or\nfifty-bajillion weed-whackers. I\u2019m only asking for enough to pay my bills so I\ncan devote myself fully to my passion. A mere two thousand dollars a month\nwould allow me to write full time. Another thousand on top of that would let me\nmarket to the teachers and librarians who act as intermediaries in getting\nbooks into the hands of kids. A final thousand dollars a month would make it\npossible for me to hire someone to do that marketing for me so I could invest\nall my creative energy in writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you and 1,999 awesome individuals like yourself were each\nto donate one slim dollar every month, I\u2019d meet my first goal. If you were to\ndonate three dollars, I\u2019d need just 665.6 other patrons. And if you donated \u003cem\u003efive\u003c/em\u003e dollars, I\u2019d only\nneed 399 other patrons (plus you\u2019d save that poor, unfortunate .6 person from\nbecoming a decimal point.) In addition to helping me and the kids who read my\nbooks, you\u2019ll also get the cool rewards described in the right side bar (each of which is named after an amazing cat I have known).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lisanowak.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/100_6753-e1482697883407.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA boy reads Running Wide Open during a race.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you willing to help me help kids by becoming a patron?
