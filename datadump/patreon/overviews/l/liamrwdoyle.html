I realize a lot of creators here, writers particularly, ask for patronage on a monthly basis. Well, I seriously considered that; but, since my output can be sporadic depending on how in depth my novel work, and life, are, I thought it would actually be more fair to you to pay for what actually gets produced!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said, it should generally be 1 story a month anyway, maybe 2. But if you\u0027re afraid I might suddenly burst out with a ton of stories in a month, if you\u0027re on a budget, I heavily encourage you to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913729-How-do-I-set-a-monthly-limit-to-my-pledge-\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ego ahead and set that maximum payout per month option\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s cool! I totally get it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in this way you will be contributing to actual work and product, regardless of how involved and in depth I am at the moment with my other endeavors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 229, 241);\"\u003eYou get content, product, and I get support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most important of all: Thank you!!
