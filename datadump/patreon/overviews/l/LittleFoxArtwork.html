    "summary": "Firstly, thank you for stopping by and supporting my artwork!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rei, and this is my official Patreon. I am hoping to share my art with the world, as well as hopefully make some money in the form of commissioned artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have an eclectic variation of interests, from literature to history, to comics/manga, film and anime (I\u0027ve mostly done semi-realism, so I\u0027ll be trying to expand into more commercial styles soon, hopefully), from which I\u0027ve drawn/painted many favourite or interesting characters/figures throughout time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project has been an idea of mine for a while, but I wanted to at least gather a bit of a sample portfolio before making my account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping that you enjoy my work as this gallery grows, and that you are able to support my growth by becoming a patron ($1 x post, which I will limit exclusively to artwork posts, not including posting finished commissions as samples [with permission]). For commissions, I can be reached at littlefoxartwork@gmail.com, for discussion of piece and my paypal. I am physically disabled, so I thought art could be a good way to make some extra money to make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatron Tiers:\u003cbr\u003ePatron: $1 x post. (I won\u0027t charge unless there\u0027s art.) No reward, except supporting an artist.\u003cbr\u003eFoxy Fox Tier: $2 x\u00a0 post. Free Shipping on Commissioned Pieces!\u003cbr\u003eLittle VIP: $5 x post. 20% discount and free shipping on commissioned pieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003eCommission Prices:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLineart/Basic Inking: $10\u003cbr\u003eChibi Doll/Bookmark: $15 (mixed media: copic, colored pencil, ink, etc.,includes laminated bookmarks)\u003cbr\u003ePencil Drawing: $15 (portrait/bust or full body, realistic style) + ornate background +5\u003cbr\u003ePastel/Coloured Pencil drawing: $20 (portrait/bust or full body, realistic style), with complex background +$5\u003cbr\u003eCopic Marker/ink: $25 (Simply due to the cost of the markers and ink), with complex background +$5\u003cbr\u003eAcrylic/Watercolour Portrait [realistic]: $35 (again, due to the cost of the canvas and supplies, as well as time invested), with complex background +$5 (basic colour background is included in the original price)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Shipping cost will vary depending on your location, and obviously due to canvas being heavier than drawing/bristol paper, it will be more expensive to ship, but I can\u0027t imagine shipping going over $5-10 for those. For paper pieces, probably $3?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope these prices are fair. If not, I am open to see examples by artists of similar talent and what their pricing is, as I am just starting out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do all kinds of commission, I would even be open to doing NSFW commissions (just nothing illegal, please.) Whether I accept \"lewd\" (this doesn\u0027t mean nude, but overtly pornographic) commissions proposals will be at my discretion [and will NOT be posted here], otherwise, I\u0027m open to doing any type of work (again, as long as it\u0027s not something reasonably offensive or illegal.)\u003cbr\u003e"
