    "summary": "Hello! My name is Brittney, though online and in the\nartistic community I am more commonly known as LeopardWolf or Lhunpaurwen (\nLhunie ). I am a New Orleans native\nwho was displaced by Hurricane Katrina. I ended up shuffling around New\n  York and Minnesota,\nand have since returned to New Orleans.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI love creating art and making things. I think everyone\nshould have the opportunity to enjoy art in all its forms. Art is good for the\nsoul, and if I can help make someone\u2019s day a little brighter with my creative\nfire, then I am happy to share it with others. My hope is that I can invoke\nemotion and inspire others with my creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.leopardwolf.com/patreon/corvids1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love things that sparkle, shine, and glow. I tend to see\njewelry as a wearable form of artwork. I find my inspiration in the natural\nworld around me, from animals to leaves and branches and rocks and gemstones. I\nlove to incorporate these things into my work, using gemstones, crystals, bone,\nfeathers, leather, and wood just to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am an animal lover, a tree hugger, and all around open\nminded person. A lot of these things are reflected in my artistic endeavors. I\nenjoy spending time with my animal companions, reading, writing, and\nphotography. I also enjoy outdoors and wilderness activities when I am able to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have studied in biology/zoological sciences and behavioral\npsychology, and enjoy training animals. Over the years I have done a lot of\nvolunteer work with domestic animal and wildlife rehabilitation. I donate\nportions of my sales to these causes and help spread awareness through\neducation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have Ehlers-Danlos, and have dealt with chronic pain,\nfatigue and a host of other medical issues and complications as a result. Wanting to gain some semblance of independence\nand financial freedom, I create various forms of artwork, train animals, and\nprovide educational information as a small source of income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming a patron, your support gives me the opportunity\nto be an artist and to create freely. I value your donation in more ways than\nwords can adequately describe. Your support inspires me to believe in myself\nand my dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nJust a small pledge on your part can change my life\nand help my dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.leopardwolf.com/patreon/with_dogs1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so many amazing ideas floating around in my mind,\nwaiting to be given form. Sadly many have never come to be simply because I\nlack the funds to invest in the supplies or materials I would need to\nexperiment or to justify spending my time or materials creating these things\nwhen I should be working on productive projects that are more likely to help me\npay my bills. While I don\u2019t create art just for the money, the financial\nreality is that I must make ends meet if I wish to continue making art as a\ncareer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in.
