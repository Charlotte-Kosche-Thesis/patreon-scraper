    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI\nam, first and foremost, a burlesque entertainer, making my stage debut in 2004.\nThree years later, the opportunity arose to combine my business acumen with my\nlove of entertaining, and I was able to add a burlesque producing hat to my\nonstage feather boa and tassels. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince\ncommitting myself to working just as hard behind the scenes as in front of the\naudience, I\u0027ve produced over 600 burlesque shows/events; these include my\nweekly show \n\u003cstrong\u003eMonday Night Tease\u003c/strong\u003e, (2003-2017), \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Hollywood Burlesque Festival,\u003c/strong\u003e and\na gallery showing of burlesque photos, \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Monday Night Tease\nRetrospective\n\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve also produced LA\u0027s chapter of \u003cstrong\u003eDr Sketchy\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e and executive/co-produce 3 other shows. Production has been in my blood, as I weekly produced 18 live hours of radio and 2 recorded for 10 years. I proudly run \u003cstrong\u003eLili\u0027s School For Wayward Girls (and men)\u003c/strong\u003e and teach the art of burlesque and tour as a teacher as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three sites dedicated to burlesque. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Burlesque Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e, a weekly show with interviews and conversations about the burlesque industry. \u003cstrong\u003eBurlesqueCasting.com\u003c/strong\u003e which facilitates producers and performers to connect and assist in booking. \u003cstrong\u003eBurlesque411.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a resource to find burlesque performers and productions in your area.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPrivate\nevents are often funded by corporations, or individual financial backers;\nlarger entities with deeper pockets that are able to easily absorb any losses\nthey may incur and spend money needed to ensure losses don\u2019t incur. When I\nproduce a show, however, the burden is all mine: if I don\u0027t raise enough funds\nthrough ticket sales and sponsorships, I pay any losses directly from my own pocket\n\u2026 and honestly, ticket sales rarely cover all the costs of original content. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\nhard costs from a weekly show are over $500 per event, while the Hollywood\nBurlesque Festival saw me risk $20,000 from own pocket \u2026 TWICE. The financial\nuncertainty of where and how I can raise enough money to put on these events is\nextremely stressful; even if they break even or turn a profit, it rarely pays\nme minimum wage for the hours of time I have put in. While producing and\nperforming the art form I love dearly is a dream come true, it\u2019s also placed me\nin a position of nearly bankrupting myself several times. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFollowing\nin the footsteps of many great artists whom I\u2019ve worked with and admire, I am\nturning to fans and supporters to help continue creating spaces for women and\nmen to entertain and practice their art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(I\nknow that sounded like your cue, but hang tight; just a little more ground to\ncover, but I do appreciate your eagerness.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn my almost ten-years of producing, I have booked over 600 different artists.\nHiring a performer is so much more to me than just writing in their name and\ngiving them a time to show up; if I book someone it means I trust them as a\nperformer. The magic they bring to the stage never ceases to take my breath away\n\u2026 and every night, every show, I\u2019m always transported by the Magic. I don\u2019t\nwant to just hire people; I want to facilitate the art of each one of these\nwomen and men, allowing them to grow as performers, and get better at the thing\nthey love to do. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany\ntimes I\u2019ve had to sacrifice, hang up my feather boa and put on my business hat;\nI do this because risking money from your own pocket to produce live\nentertainment isn\u0027t always profitable. I\u2019ve managed to eke out a living and I\u0027m\ngrateful for my experiences \u2026 but sadly, experiences don\u2019t pay the rent. Worrying\nabout meeting not only the show\u2019s expenses but my personal obligations as well\nis taking its toll. My personal art is also suffering.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve\ndecided it\u0027s time I ask for help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(WAIT!\nNot yet; we\u2019re almost there, I swear)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI teach burlesque, produce burlesque, perform burlesque \u2026 hell, I eat, sleep\nand drink burlesque. Whether I\u2019m booking my own shows, hiring performers for\nindependent performances, making costumes and pasties, or just developing my\nown stage persona, I am working endlessly to improve my craft and keep the art\nform I love alive and well. Taking on an outside job\nwould never leave enough time to keep working on the weekly show and pursuing\nart \u2026 so I turn to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Ah-ha!\nHere\u2019s where you come in; look at you, striding confidently through that door,\nall square-jawed and determined to help!) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nask now for your help to fund productions and cover all the extra costs that\nkeep the show - and my career \u2013 from getting that final curtain call. I ask for\nyour help not only for me, but also for the hundreds of performers pursuing\ntheir own dreams on my stage; I do this not only for me, but for them \u2026 so they\ncan continue to transport me, transport all of us, with their Magic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m not trying to go all Ziegfeld here; my goal is to raise enough money each\nmonth to pay my personal needs and allow my entertainment and art to fund\nitself. Knowing my rent is paid provides two necessary functions: it will allow\nme the freedom to reinvest profits and survive those weeks that fall short of\ncovering their own costs, and give me the financial breathing room needed to\nfocus on advancing my personal art as well. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for reading this, and for your support. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n... and as always, support live entertainment.\u00a0#BuyATicket\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
