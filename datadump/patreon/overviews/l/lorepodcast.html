    "summary": "I believe people hunger for story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all enjoy a well-told, well-written tale. It allows us to escape for a moment and live in someone else\u2019s world, a world where problems have solutions (most of the time) and things make sense (again, mostly). Story is in our DNA. We evolved from knuckle-dragging cavemen into advanced cultures, in part, because we discovered the benefits of gathering around the fire at night and telling stories. Shared knowledge, shared experiences, communal narrative; this is what makes us who we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI created Lore because I wanted to tell stories. In the process of researching my supernatural thriller novels, I often discover pieces of history and lore that give common scary stories a new level of detail, and a fresh humanity. Vampire tales, for example, aren\u2019t stories of supernatural beings; they are stories about our longing for immortality, the hint of our death that waits around every corner, and a way to rationalize the mysteries of the afterlife.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nVampire stories aren\u2019t about vampires, you see.

Each episode examines a new dark tale from history, and presents it in a style that\u0027s been compared to a campfire experience. No interviews or round-table discussions here;\u00a0Lore is a spoken word narrative podcast that\u0027s designed to entertain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReviews of Lore have blown me away.
