    "summary": "Hello Everyone, \u003cbr\u003eI am LMG, a creator, YouTuber, Twitcher and a lover of all video games.  I create daily long-form content for YouTube and perform on Twitch 6 days a week. With 30+ years of gaming experience under my belt and a true love for the industry, I seek to continue to bring that to my viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter spending a decade working for the government, my life changed when I developed esophageal cancer.  After surgery, intensive chemo and several near-deaths, I managed to pull through. I do not mention this for sympathy but to tell the backstory. After that experience I took a long look at my life and realized I had never really created anything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began to focus on what I loved and knew. I created video content on YouTube part-time and when I moved up north with my lovely fianc\u00e9e (now wife) I made it a full-time venture, producing daily long-form content for YouTube and streaming daily on Twitch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy daily videos on YouTube consists of Let\u0027s Plays and unbiased game reviews. I cover a lot of the indie game scene. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last year and a half I\u0027ve self-funded the business as well as I could while maintaining the bare-minimum living expenses, putting all profits directly back in to the business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve nicely grown the YouTube channel and have just started a second one for more non-mainstream stuff, and my Twitch channel is close to being partnered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seek to avoid having to run ads, sponsored content and taking money from developers for biased reviews.  The industry is currently plagued with sponsored content. Somebody is always trying to sell you something and unfortunately, many YouTubers take money on the side to promote games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seek to create a place where you the viewer can find the qualified and trusted info you need, have a laugh and not have an ad tossed at you every couple of minutes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for the bare-minimum funding to cover the living expenses and a budget to procure the games the channel needs and for giveaways. Any extra funding plus new goals will be used for pc equipment upgrades, channel upgrades, and will be put back into better and bigger backer rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking very forward to working for YOU! \u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003eLMG\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
