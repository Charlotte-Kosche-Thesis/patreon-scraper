Within 24-48 hours they have finished the jam and sent photo evidence of the empty jars with messages of love. I would love to make a huge batch and this money will go towards supplies. I will send jars to 10 people who donate. I haven\u0027t done the math on this so I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll lose money but I\u0027d like to start with this goal and see where it goes.\u00a0",
