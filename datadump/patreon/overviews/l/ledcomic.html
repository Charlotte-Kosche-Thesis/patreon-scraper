It\u0027s a story about a team of heroes who pilot six colorful giant robots, and use their awesome power to protect the Earth from alien threats! The year is 2099, and soon after the discovery of a mysterious new planet in the Solar System, codenamed \"Dark Earth\", our planet is besieged by a giant cyborg dinosaur! As it overpowers Earth\u0027s weaponry, the only ones who can fight back are the Light Earth Defenders! But this new war might not be as simple as it appears...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"WHY the heck did you make this?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years back, I had two distinct realizations. One: nothing gets me as excited as the concept of giant mecha! Everything about them is awesome, and I started to dig into movies and anime and games that were all about them. Two: There are so many problems with the mecha genre, as it is. Too many stories of hyper-masculine aggression, too many examples of exploitative and oversexualized outfits and camera angles, and too much encouraging of consumerism over creativity! I want to make a series that expresses my love/hate relationship with the genre, and can get more people to understand why I think it\u0027s such a magical thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"HOW the heck am I supposed to help?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimple! By pledging to donate a certain amount to this campaign, you can help support me while I keep creating awesome comics that both you and I want to see! (along with other more experimental projects, like animations!) But don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not just panhandling here. I\u0027m offering plenty of rewards and goodies, depending on the Patron Tier you select below. Check \u0027em out and see what you\u0027d like! Even if you can\u0027t support me with your wallet, your word-of-mouth is at least as important! Tell your family, friends, and anyone you know about this series and campaign, and you\u0027ll have my deepest thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"WHEN the heck do I pay?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust once at the start of every month! Think of it more like a subscription than a donation, so please don\u0027t pledge more money than you can reasonably afford. I wouldn\u0027t want you accidentally bankrupting yourself because you obviously think my series is worth tons of your money! Just a little donation each month makes a huge difference, and can get you plenty of cool stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Sounds great!
