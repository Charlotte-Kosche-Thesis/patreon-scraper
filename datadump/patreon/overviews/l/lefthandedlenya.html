My dad came to check on me, and he found me with my hands pressed against the windowpane, eyes watching the storm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDo you see that?\u201d I asked. \u201cI did that.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.78697779.9994/flat,1000x1000,075,f.u2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m no longer as certain that I can command storms from the heavens, but I have retained my appreciation of darkness and chaos. I am fascinated by nature and have a fierce love for all things that go bump in the night. The dual influences of biology and horror manifest themselves in all of my work \u2013 I studied biology in college, and I enjoy combining scientific concepts with occult imagery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.205240881.3977/flat,800x800,070,f.u2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be a full-time professional artist, and every contribution you make, however small, gets me closer to LIVING THE DREAM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two projects in particular that I would like to have more time and resources to work on, my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/lefthandedlenya/collections/510158-coffin-series-memento-mori?asc=u\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCoffin Coloring Book\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/lefthandedlenya/collections/580341-arthropod-tarot?asc=u\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArthropod Tarot\u003c/a\u003e. These works will have top priority when utilizing your pledges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT ME:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrained in several classic illustration and painting techniques at the Southwest Michigan Visual Arts Academy at an early age, I have continued to refine my style through practice and travel. Most notably, I spent seven months in Ecuador with a primary focus on biology and ecology, while also studying figure drawing at the Universidad de San Francisco De Quito. While in Quito, I was drawn to the metal subculture, which continues to be a strong presence in my art and life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother major influence artistically is the old school tattoo aesthetic \u2013 I love the permanence and history that comes with tattoos, the time and pain that goes into the process. I have several tattoos of my own, and each piece teaches me more about patience, confidence, and commitment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs it possible to be vivacious and morbid simultaneously? The most truthful thing ever said about me was \u201cLenya gets a lot out of life \u2013 and the most out of death.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of my work is part of a series I\u2019ve titled Lux Edo, which translated from Latin means either \u201ceat the light\u201d or \u201cI, who am the light, consume,\u201d depending on the translator\u2019s fussiness. A graduate of Kalamazoo College, the school motto is Lux Esto, \u201cbe the light,\u201d and my contrarian nature couldn\u2019t help but subvert the motto to my own sinister purposes. I believe in the voracious consumption of truth and knowledge \u2013 to me, \u201ceat the light\u201d means to devour what illuminates your mind, passionately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more of my work on \u003ca href=\"http://www.lefthandedlenya.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
