Macy being from Oregon and Quintin being from Australia really bridges the gap between their 2 lives.\u003cbr\u003eQuintin\u2019s Father and Mum sailed around the world in the 26 ft sailboat, the LOOK FAR.  He sees it as inspiration but has always wanted to seek out that lonely surf spot with a perfect right hander.  There has always been a sailboat and a surfboard in Quintin\u2019s life.\u003cbr\u003eMacy met Quintin in 2006 and has always seen eye to eye with adventure.  Quintin\u2019s cousin\u2019s taught Macy how to sail, not even knowing they would ever one day meet. She spent 3 years traveling Central America, the Carribean, and Alaska by boat working privately for different families.  She is prepared for a sailing adventure and cant wait to surf the same lonely right hander together with her husband, Quintin.\u003cbr\u003e",
