I\u0027ve traveled an amazing, sometimes arduous road, and instead of taking me to places of ultimate despair and self-harm, I turned out to be a writer, while somehow avoiding: sleeping with and exchanging love-letters with my grandmother (Djuna Barnes), walking into the water (Virginia Woolf) or becoming an alcoholic (half the library).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e horrific things happened to me, and as a result, they triggered Serious Mental Illness (which I am probably not nearly serious enough about). I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I, for those of you who know/care what that means), Dissociative Identity Disorder (hint: For most of my life, my brain was a baseball team) and ADHD (which is actually the one of these I trip over most frequently in my daily life).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried a LOT of day jobs, and the short story is that I have realized that I need to just create, seeing as it\u0027s what I\u0027m best at. I will be using your generous support (thank you! thank you!) to help me fill in the gaps whilst I do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should add that this is all very scary for me, but the island of sanity in my brain convinces me that it beats falling back into being depressed all the time and looking longingly at sharp things and pill bottles and other psychodramatic rot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content will range from blogging about everything and anything, including but not limited to my mental illness recovery adventure, what happened to me to get me there, what I\u0027m doing now, and yes! Some fiction!"
