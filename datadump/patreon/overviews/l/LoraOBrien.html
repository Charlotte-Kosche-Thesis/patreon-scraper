Everybody thinks they have a book in them. The vast majority of us won\u0027t ever actually sit down and do the work... I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t need to map out the endless years of honing the skill and talent of the craft of writing; you, my dear Patrons, know better than to think that just because a person can put words in a sentence that they are a writer - someone who can draw a stick figure isn\u0027t automatically an artist, right?\u00a0Then there\u0027s all the research, and the actual time-intensive slog of writing and wordcount, editing it down to readable, reasonable content, and even the marketing of each and every book us writers have to do these days. It\u0027s intense, truly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like my books though, and want to support me so I can write more of them (ok, so it\u0027s hard, did I mention how HARD it is to write a book - but it\u0027s also a good thing for me to do, I know this), you can support me as an author by choosing this reward.\u00a0There\u0027s been like *counts* 10 other reward options by now, with some pretty awesome swag, so I guess I don\u0027t need to go through everything else you\u0027ll get. If you\u0027ve read through to this point, you\u0027re pretty into the whole idea of connecting to Ireland, so you know what your options are here.\u00a0$500 per month is a lot of money for one person to give each month. But if you\u0027ve got it spare, there\u0027s definitely worse things you could be doing with it. Do you REALLY need an underground aquarium beneath a living room floor made of glass? Do you? What if that shit breaks?!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSupporting me writing my next book, or books, gets you all of the other Patreon Prizes each month, plus you get raved about in the acknowledgments section of each new book, and of course you get a personalised, pre-release, signed copy of all forthcoming print books I write while you\u0027re a Patron. And you don\u0027t have to worry about falling through your living room floor and drowning in that aquarium. You\u0027re welcome.
