I started blogging in the early 2000\u0027s and failed about three times. HA! No fail, no gain. Right?\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568875aac21b8690d5b73b05/t/59ce989ec534a54561850a9f/1506711718193/Leah-Vernon-Plus-Size-Hijabi-Style-Blogger-Body-Positive-Model-Detroit-Paris-1.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, I joined Instagram then started the body-positive blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.beautyandthemuse.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeauty and the Muse\u003c/a\u003e. Why? There were no girls, women who who looked like me who were deemed \u0027beautiful\u0027 or worthy. I had a fucked up android phone and some wacky outfits, but mostly, I had no clue what I was doing. What I did know was that girls from all over the world were sending me messages of feeling worthless, ugly, and unimportant because of the number on the scale but when they saw my photos and read my words, that they were given the inspiration to also live their lives unapologetically. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal, by creating content, is to show the world that every BODY is a good body. That you don\u0027t have to fit into a nice box, that you can BE whoever the fuck you want to be in this life without restriction. That you can live your best life at any size, color, culture, religion, or sexual orientation. We need more of these kinds of affirmations.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortuntely, I\u0027ve wanted to quit many times over the years because of the stress of the unknown, mostly financial. I\u0027m never sure how I will pay my rent, satisfy the many bill collectors that call my phone, or how my next project will be funded. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568875aac21b8690d5b73b05/t/5984cb30d482e94a17edb582/1501875001602/?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor some reason, people believe that I make a lot of money from blogging. The truth is, I make ZERO dollars from my blog. In an attempt to keep my blog \u0027organic\u0027 and not sell readers Flat Tummy Tea, bundles of weave, waist trainers, and teeth whitening kits, I turn down projects, and in turn, turn away income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm I dumb? Maybe. Or maybe I care more about the art, the expression, my readers and want to make my blog community a safe place where you aren\u0027t bombarded by capitalist brands only wanting to make a big buck. Maybe, I trust that my community will lift me as I have lifted them over the years.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m finally on Patreon, truthfully, because I\u0027ve maxed out both credit cards and cannot create and maintain myself any longer. Most of you know when I got divorced, my financial and mental status took a fall. It\u0027s been a year now, and although I\u0027m doing better, I need help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568875aac21b8690d5b73b05/t/5997106fc534a546367bcba1/1503072375963/Leah-Vernon-Plus-Size-Model-Detroit-Blogger-Muslim-Girl-Body-Positive-Activist-Feminist.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I write, it takes time, hours. When I create visual art, it takes time and money. Same with social media and blogging and marketing. My entire day is filled with time consuming projects that I create for the world to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make all the internet trolls that constantly fat-shame me more angry by supporting me on my journey. I\u0027d loooove for you to say \u0027I do\u0027 and be my patron so that I can continue to make waves of inclusion through visual arts and content creation.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will receive exclusive shit:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$1 will get you a \u0027New Blog Post\u0027 email alert\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$5 will get you a \u0027Photo\u0027 before it\u0027s released to the public\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$10 will get you a \u0027Photo\u0027 and inspirational quote to match\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$20 will get you access to a top-secret monthly \u0027Group Chat\u0027 to check-in on my current projects\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$50 will get you a monthly 10 min video chat (1 on 1 with Leah V)\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$100 will get you a monthly 25 min video chat (1 on 1 with Leah V)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$200 will get you a monthly 25 min video chat + Instagram tag on a current project"
