There is an overall sense of belonging and mutual therapy at play, resulting in a sense of family for many of the participants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0The logistics of of executing 15-20 hours of live monthly content requires a degree of planning and maintenance that to date The Vampire Lovecraft has incurred to the best of his ability, but a small degree of funding would work wonders towards helping to keep \u003cstrong\u003eLovecraft Radio\u003c/strong\u003e on the air...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. It would allow the stream to become a permanent fixture on \u003cstrong\u003eLivestream.com\u003c/strong\u003e, which requires monthly fees.. as it stands, the stream is removed every 30 days and has to be recreated, thus losing followers of the stream itself and any archival capabilities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. The vocal equipment used to achieve the incredibly high quality of the stream represents a substantial investment and requires periodical maintenance and upgrading/expansion. There are plans to incorporate live-looping and multi-effects capabilities to further customize the music for instance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. It would allow \u003cstrong\u003eThe Vampire Lovecraft\u003c/strong\u003e to dedicate for time towards creating original and requested tracks, of which there is a substantial backlog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. It would also allow for an expansion of \u003cstrong\u003eLovecraft Radio\u003c/strong\u003e onto \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u003c/strong\u003e and the creation of a dedicated website featuring an embedded stream,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
