You may know us from our various projects on the internet (like Grim Reaper School and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dennisillustration.co.uk/main/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHeirs to the Throne\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) or from our local, Memphis con appearances. We create a wide variety of things from original art to fandom related content. We draw comics, write stories, and we have an expanding list of interests including game design, machinima, merch, handmade stuff, the list goes on. We created Lunar Blaze a few years ago as a way to join forces and collaborate on our ideas, but we\u0027ve been creating since we were children. We hope we can continue to create until we\u0027re old, decrepit, and have to make art with our dentures.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605 What is Patreon?\u00a0\u2605\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is kind of like Kickstarter, where you can pledge a certain amount to the creator and help support them and their work. Each tier comes with rewards the creators provide for their patrons, it\u0027s almost like a subscription to exclusive things they may not share in a public space. You can choose how much you want to pledge, and if you can\u0027t subscribe anymore that\u0027s totally fine! You can stop whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u2605 What are our goals? Why Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur main goal has always been to turn our passion into our full time job, and we feel that Patreon is a step towards achieving that. We know that being self employed isn\u0027t always rainbow and sunshine, but it\u0027s something we\u0027ve wanted since we were very young. A 9-5 retail job pays our bills (and those super fun student loans!), but we\u0027re ready to start the transition towards making our creative endeavors into our livelihood, no matter how difficult it may be. We chose to start with Patreon because we wanted to offer extra content to the people who support us and, of course, be paid for our work. We hope to add more to each of our tiers the closer we get to our goal and offer more for our Patrons to enjoy as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605\u00a0What\u0027s in it for me?\u00a0\u2605\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of what we can offer is listed in our tiers+rewards on the sidebar. However! We have a lot of ideas for things we would like to add once we\u0027re able to put more time and money into our creative work. Things like Patron only streams, requests and exclusive projects are some of the ideas we\u0027ve been tossing around. The closer we are to our goal, even if it\u0027s making this our part time gig, the more we can create, make, and share!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your interest in our work and for your support! We look forward to sharing our creations with you and we hope you enjoy what we have to offer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, the Lunar Blaze Crew~\u00a0\u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more about us and our artwork through our social media sites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605\u003c/strong\u003e Twitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ajahli_arts\"\u003eAjahli\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Devillo\"\u003eDevillo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605\u003c/strong\u003e Tumblr:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://spacewusky.tumblr.com/\"\u003eAjahli\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dennisillustrationblog.tumblr.com/\"\u003eDevillo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eFuraffinity: Ajahli |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/devillo\"\u003eDevillo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/spacewusky/\"\u003eAjahli\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dennisillustration/\"\u003eDevillo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
