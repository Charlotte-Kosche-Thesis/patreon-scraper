As well as building relationships with developers to understand better where they are coming from passing that information on to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5JZkFab.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all see what the mass media of online games and the games industry has become and being able to take a stand and say - no - I will critique and put out opinions on what needs to be said has become ever more important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you doing rewards and Tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are tiers for those who want to support and I offer some extra benefits - Luetin with benefits - there for those guys. I have decided that beyond some vlogs which allow me to share my thoughts about my channel and ongoing changes I don\u0027t want to exclude content away from the main platforms.\u003cbr\u003eI have found over time that the majority of Patreon supporters as with Twitch care more about supporting the content they enjoy and ensuring it has stable longevity than they do about some extra benefits that ultimately take time away from the producer when they could be making content you wanted to see in the first place!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way in which we consume entertainment and media is changing. 5 years ago I would regularly watch television and watch a few shows when I returned from work. Now I barely turn the thing on, because we do everything online we watch Youtube, Twitch, Netflix. We have streaming sites to enjoy the content we always did but all in one place. Producers of content on both Youtube and live streaming work at what they do because they are passionate about it, and \u003cstrong\u003ethere\u0027s nothing I am more passionate about than gaming. I live it every day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PPCtNiH.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat content do I bring you as a channel? and why do I need your support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\n channel is focused around longer videos and not posting all of that \nhype content that turns off a lot of people, over time this \nhas been resonating with my audience. I regularly have people telling me \nthey want to hear my opinion on a new game because I am the \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027only \nproducer they trust now\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e. That\u0027s what I bring with the channel is \nintegrity and a promise that I will always tell you exactly what I think\n of a game as I have been doing for the past 3 years. I also work at producing longer content often editorials for you to enjoy, as this was exactly the content, I myself was looking for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my channel reaches beyond 150,000 subscribers you might assume \u0027hey things are going well Luetin you must be making plenty of revenue from Youtube\u0027 right? well its not as simple as many people assume in fact \u003cstrong\u003eThis is a huge misconception\u003c/strong\u003e. For some reason the majority of people who watch Youtube seem to have little understanding of just how revenue works. So let me break it down simply. \u003cbr\u003eYou earn revenue on Youtube per \u003cstrong\u003ethousand views\u003c/strong\u003e, this is called CPM and generally its as low as say \u003cstrong\u003e$2 per 1000 views\u003c/strong\u003e. So that means if you make a video with 10,000 views you might get $20. I say might because if your viewers have ad block, or also dependent on the length of time they watch as well as other factors it may be less or a little more. Also youtube does not run ads on every video even if they are monetised, it depends on how many ads a viewer has already seen youtube might choose not to run an ad.\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that we have seen recently Youtube implementing systems that demonetise videos during the early release which damages peoples earnings further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat my subscribers value the most\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that my audience care most about the discussions I create, the effort I put into my video editing and the integrity I bring with my strength of opinion on gaming issues. You can help support me and my channel, enabling me to continue releasing content every week\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you decide to fund me or not, thank you for reading and watching the channel. \u003cbr\u003eYour continued support is what drives me to create content every day.\u003cbr\u003e"
