He\u0027ll keep doing it out-of-pocket regardless, but hey, if you want to toss a few bucks his way...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoozy, as he is affectionately known among those that know him but don\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d him, is a civil litigator who took the long road to being a lawyer, previously holding esteemed positions as a bartender, a car salesman, and a riverboat deckhand. He maintains his nominal anonymity on here, and a look through his post history should make it pretty clear why he does this. There are those who have met Boozy in person, and describe his appearance as a cross between Danny Devito and a hobbit.

Otherwise, I may or may not use your money to buy the fuel for this endeavor, i.e. liquor, and continue to have the requisite background for it, i.e. being a lawyer.\u003cbr\u003e"
