    "summary": "Long-time friends John Patrick Owatari-Dorgan and The Adam Glass of With Two Brains have submitted themselves to Sisyphean task of watching every single film in the ever expanding Criterion Collection and maybe learning a thing or two about film in the process. Lost in Criterion is just two non-cinephiles diving into the world of important films, and learning that sometimes a movie is important because\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://withtwobrains.com/lost-in-criterion/2013/1/18/lost-in-criterion-ep3-the-lady-vanishes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHitchcock made it before he came to America\u003c/a\u003e, or because it was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://withtwobrains.com/lost-in-criterion/2015/6/5/closely-watched-trains\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eone of the first films out of Czechoslovakia\u003c/a\u003e after the Soviets relaxed, or because it\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://withtwobrains.com/lost-in-criterion/2013/10/5/lost-in-criterion-ep40-armegeddon\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArmageddon\u003c/a\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eYour support will keep us at it for the long haul -- over 200 films down so far, only like 800 to go! until they add more which is once a month -- as well as allow us to pay for more sophisticated hosting that will keep the entire archives more easily accessible. We really don\u0027t even need that much money! If everyone who regularly listens donated just $1 a year we\u0027d have far more than we\u0027d need!\u003cbr\u003eAny money received beyond those base costs will go toward making Lost in Criterion better and facilitating other With Two Brains projects.
