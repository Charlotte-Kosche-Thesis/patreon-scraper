    "summary": "I\u0027m the guy always lost in worlds and places almost impossible to describe. I\u0027m your reporter, journalist, tour guide into the vast speculative fiction landscape that spans over 40,000 years of human history blending our own history and legends with modern science and almost provable concepts of magic and multiverses. The stories I weave for you are all tied together with accurate historical \u0026amp; scientific research and a unified timeline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m best known for my debut \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThread Slivers, book one of the Golden Threads Trilogy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, which became the #1 best selling fantasy for over a month\u00a0in 2013 and has remained on the top 100 bestselling classic fantasy bestselling lists ever since. In 2016 I started releasing an extraordinary steampunk blend of science-fiction and fantasy serial titled\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEndless Horizons Sagas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0In short, I\u0027m a proven bestselling author who delivers\u00a0adventure epics that blur the lines between science-fiction and fantasy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories are not fluff; they are detailed\u00a0requiring years of writing and research to complete.\u00a0The \u003cem\u003eGolden Threads Trilogy\u003c/em\u003e had over 130,000 words per book weighing in over 500,000 words with chapters large enough to qualify as novelettes. With three editors, cover artists, proofreading, and formatting it takes a long time to push 130,000 word novels through the publication pipeline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI regularly get emails asking when my next book will be completed. As an author I\u0027d be nothing without people like you who want to read incredible science-fiction and fantasy books. My only goal as an author is to publish high quality stories as fast as possible. I wanted to publish new books faster than one every three to five years, but not compromise quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve found a solution! Growing up\u00a0I loved reading pulp fiction novels. These were between 20,000 and 50,000 words. Just long enough to give a great story to enjoy. I\u0027d save my allowance and check the five and dime every day for the next \u003cem\u003eAsimov\u0027s Science Fiction\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAmazing Stories\u003c/em\u003e, or\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAnalog Science Fiction and Fact\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0When I got a new one I\u0027d read it for days. I loved being transported away, and thanks to these wonderful monthly magazines I didn\u0027t have long to wait for something fresh and new to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created a new kind of pulp. While adventure arcs are not new, ones that tie together across predictable boundaries are. I\u0027m combining my large epic story telling skills with the pulp short novel style. This style transformed my epic tales into independent serial novels, novels that when put together cause a larger story to emerge. Each novel is detailed, action packed, and a complete story. But, put four of the novels together and they transform into a larger adventure book. Finally combine those adventure books together and like one of those incredible pictures made of other pictures an entire new epic comes into focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an added bonus, all of my series, books, and novels also fold together onto a single historical timeline. My timeline passes cleanly, and logically, through our world today, and yet, there will always be a soft touch of fantasy with science-fact tweaked by a bit of science-fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to believe the magic is real, and something we may yet learn to use.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have four blended science-fiction and fantasy series in varying stages of publication:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eEndless Horizons Sagas\u003c/em\u003e - the tales of Janali Jedalor, a female researcher on the order of\u00a0Da Vinci,\u00a0Galileo, and Newton battling\u00a0for her crew\u0027s lives, and her own, with the church after an amazing discovery\u00a0on an unique world. Five seasons, sixteen episodes each planned out with the first two seasons rough drafts completed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ci style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eDagger Tales\u003c/i\u003e - the on-going stories of Ticca of Rhini Wood and Lebuin of the Argos Guild of Mages after they finished saving the world in my \u003ci style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eGolden Threads Trilogy\u003c/i\u003e. These will also have guest\u00a0appearances\u00a0by other major characters from the world of Niya-Yur. One season of twenty episodes is plotted out. More to come.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDuianna\u00a0Chronicles\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- the adventure stories of a young space marine as he moves up through the ranks of the Duianna Imperial Marines. This is a grand space opera series with everything you\u0027d expect along with some of my characteristic twists. Three seasons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eForgotten Dynasty\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- an historical fantasy series revolving around a lost dragon and the boy that found, healed, and befriended it. Together they create a vast empire alters the future of two universes. Six seasons planned.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eTo help the ends of the month meet and cover the production process I\u0027m turning to\u00a0\u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s an amazing reliable funding platform. Exactly what I need to allow me to stop worrying about where to get the funds needed to pay for stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron\u00a0you get to peek behind the curtain at the magician as he works. You also get to see the works before anyone else! As my greatest fans, you also have a chance to kibitz (offer input) on the outcomes and may even get cameo appearances in the stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI wish my favorite authors would give me a chance to chat with them about their stories. I have many ideas and questions I\u0027d have liked to discuss, maybe even give them some inspiration. Hence, I\u0027m giving you that incredible power. Abuse it as you will.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI want to take you on grand adventures to amazing places with people you\u0027ll fall in love with. By pledging your support to my Patreon campaign, you\u0027ll help me devote myself entirely to putting out books you\u0027ll want to read over and over again. There will be laughter, strange concepts, kibitzing, and fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Thank you for reading this completely through!
