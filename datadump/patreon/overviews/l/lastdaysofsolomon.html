    "summary": "This page is for players who want to support the Last Days of Solomon, a text-based roleplaying game by Jay Dragon and Abe Mendes. We\u0027re running this program out of love for all of you, and even a few dollars a month makes it so much easier for us to justify the use of our time. You\u0027re welcome to play, regardless of whether you\u0027re supporting us, but your support means the world. Thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur story takes place in the city of Solomon, surrounded by a moat of black mirrors and a sky of mist, with no stars or sun. It is a huge city, a sprawling city, a city made of layers of broken buildings and ruins, with tall onion domes and gothic spires cutting against the heavens. Narrow, cobbled pathways run between crowded and cramped buildings, and beneath the city secrets lurk within the catacombs. The citizens of Solomon are tired, broken, and prone to outbreaks of violence. To be a common person in Solomon is a bitter and cold life, disrupted by periods of intense revelry and celebration. They stare up at the tall towers, dreaming of the queen and her fabulous wealth. \u003cbr\u003eBut you\u2019re no ordinary citizen of Solomon. You\u2019re a member of the noble class. Your blood is blue and pure, and the power you exercise over the city is matched only by your peers. And of course, you\u2019re not just any noble. You\u2019re the head of a noble house, a family which can trace its lineage and wealth back to before the Pacts. You aren\u2019t above the law. You are the law. You\u2019re not beholden to the market - your wealth defines the market. And your will is the will of hundreds of servants, and carries with it the legacy of ancient magics and ancestral forces. There is only one person in the whole of Solomon with more power than you, and that is Queen Theodora III herself. And the three demons sworn to serve her. \u003cbr\u003eThis is a game about manipulation, betrayal, and scheming. As the rulers of various noble houses within the city of Solomon, you will vie for power, knowledge, and the assertion of your agendas. You can throw massive banquets, assassinate your rivals, duel rival nobles, appease powerful demons, engage in clandestine schemes, and potentially even claim the crown of Solomon for your own. This is a fantasy of power, corruption, and the tragedy of collapse. This is a game with a fair bit of numbers involved, but the focus is on your story and your narrative, and should be engaged with as a role-playing game. \u003c/em\u003e"
