Preparing for the next chapters of my career and for our community. I\u2019m absolutely grateful that we have over \u003cstrong\u003e250,000 Lucidians in our family now. \u003c/strong\u003eAll of them have supported me in my darkest times, shared my artistic vision, and embraced me for my\u00a0shit. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m in awe.\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, this is a new journey. I\u2019m jumping in this Patreon thing head first and I\u2019m eager to meet the people who want to be part of it\u2026 \u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon??\u003c/strong\u003e If this is your first time here, let me break it down for you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of mine and you want to support me in the creation of new songs, webcasts, videos, writings, podcasts, and more random art-related creations, then you are in the right place\u2026 \u003c/strong\u003eThere are no limits here. I\u2019m open to creating a variety of things, and I want to know what you are interested in. I like surprises, throw em at me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackstory:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Lucidious.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSimply put, I\u0027m an \u003cstrong\u003eartist\u003c/strong\u003e and an \u003cstrong\u003einfluencer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out these\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrWu1qIF4QVSTp-Z9yayhX-DEdK4qh-h\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideos\u003c/a\u003e if you haven\u0027t seen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve completed two albums and multiple music videos thus far. My second album, titled \u2018\u003cem\u003eTorn Between Pages, Vol. 1: Make It Out Alive\u003c/em\u003e,\u2019 was just released on September 13, 2016. You can \u003ca href=\"https://itun.es/us/vo9Veb\"\u003egrab it from iTunes here\u003c/a\u003e - These songs touch on depression, relationship struggles, family dynamics, suicide, and general fears that everyone experiences in their own lives. If you didn\u0027t catch my first album, \u0027\u003cem\u003eReflections\u003c/em\u003e,\u0027 then you can also \u003ca href=\"https://itun.es/us/VS-0_\"\u003egrab it from iTunes here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah,\u003cstrong\u003e I\u0027ve been struggling\u003c/strong\u003e... I am \u003cstrong\u003ean independent artist with no label or backing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We\u0027ve created all of this shit by ourselves with this team... and I\u0027ve been trying to find a way to continue sharing my art with you guys and make a living. I\u0027ve gotten to know myself more over the years, as a creator, songwriter, recording artist, and I know that I\u0027ve been held back. I need to reach you without the mass media mainstream. \u003cstrong\u003eI also know my fan base.\u003c/strong\u003e You are SO SUPPORTIVE, you have felt the pain I\u0027ve felt and I know the dark times you have been through. I see it. You know me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMost of my artistic shit is FREE\u003c/strong\u003e..YouTube, streaming on Spotify, live videos, my site... and I don\u0027t charge for any content that isn\u0027t music related either, so it\u0027s tough to continue on. My music does sell on iTunes (which is awesome), but it costs nothing on most platforms. Subscription sites like Patreon allows me to connect with you and continue making art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut...to actually do this \u003cstrong\u003eI need support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve avoided asking for YEARS and I\u0027m not sure why. This allows us to bypass the whole commercial system! Which yes, is pretty controlled by money and powerful labels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of me if you support me or not I am genuinely appreciative of you if you support other similar artists.\u003cstrong\u003e By supporting the people that REALLY GIVE A SHIT about what they do and the impact they have on this world is the ONLY way to make a difference in the system\u003c/strong\u003e... a system filled with political bullshit, racism, and hate. It\u0027s a sloowwww shift to backing outspoken people that are making a social impact, but \u003cstrong\u003eTHIS IS HAPPENING!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI tried IndieGoGo, but it didn\u0027t really work... \u003cb\u003ewomp\u003c/b\u003e. It was more of a one-time deal anyway, this is ongoing and you constantly get to stay in touch and get prizes from our team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO MANY WORDS I KNOW. BOTTOM LINE. \u003c/strong\u003eI just want to be able to go into the studio and focus on writing, make music with my friends, call my videographer and spend hours on creating a video, and publish right when I\u0027m done.\u003cstrong\u003e Instantly. \u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t want to keep falling behind because of money... that\u0027s BS and I want to give you more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of \u003cstrong\u003emoney\u003c/strong\u003e, let\u0027s openly talk about it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be honest, \u003cstrong\u003esome shit costs a lot of money. \u003c/strong\u003eProjects can range from $2,000 to $15,000... yikes. And yeah, some things like LIVE videos cost nothing, but\u003cstrong\u003e the more budget we have, the more crazy shit we can do. \u003c/strong\u003eAlso, I can pay \u003cstrong\u003eour staff more\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(which they deserve) and dive more into \u003cstrong\u003eartist collaborations\u003c/strong\u003e (a lot of you have asked for those).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind that this is a \u003cstrong\u003eBIG EXPERIMENT.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve always listened to you guys, and I listen to you. I care about your story.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTell me what you want more of and what you\u0027re liking about the platform vs. what you don\u0027t like. \u003c/strong\u003eI am creating this music for my own sanity and for my own reasons to stay alive, but I\u0027m pushing it to the next level for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe love and support I see on Facebook/Instagram and other places is \u003cstrong\u003eINSANE!!! (I hope it stays that way). \u003c/strong\u003eBut honestly, whether you are backing me for a dollar or ten dollars....seriously.... \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU.\u003c/strong\u003e Don\u0027t worry, you \u003cstrong\u003eget rewards too.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0p.s., I\u0027m going to be \u003cstrong\u003evideo chatting with patrons one on one every month\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to check out \u003cstrong\u003ethe video above\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to see what I\u0027m about if you haven\u0027t seen it yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow..... \u003cstrong\u003eLET\u0027S DO THIS SHIT!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0007216187_10.jpg\" style=\"width: 262px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMUCH LOVE to you guys.\u003cbr\u003e-Lucidious\u003c/div\u003e"

I\u0027ll get to answer your questions directly, talk about life, the work that goes on behind the scenes, etc. You will be members of the smaller group with whom I discuss personal issues, business strategies, how to find success, what\u0027s really going on in my head, and more... I\u0027m going to kick it as real as it gets with you guys here. Good news, I\u0027ll do the monthly webcast even if I haven\u0027t made any art or new creation... SO you may get to see me in my funky psychopath depressed state of mind that happens here in there, so we can chat about that. FUN! hey, it happens to the best of us.\u00a0",
