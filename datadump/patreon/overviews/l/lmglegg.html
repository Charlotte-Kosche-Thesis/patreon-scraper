    "summary": "Time\nis all at once our most precious resource and most unforgiving master\n\u2013 and time to create is sorely needed if I ever hope to make even a\ndent in Project Stonefeather. I\u0027m L M Glegg, and to answer the\ninevitable question, Project Stonefeather is my upcoming series of\nmedieval fantasy novels, complete with original artwork, lore,\nhistoric timelines, and everything else that goes into the craft of\nworld-building. I am a perfectionist by nature, and that certainly\ndoes not make me any faster, but I\u0027m pleased with what I\u0027ve produced\nthus far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a massive amount of groundwork laid already,\nwith a lot more ahead of me in the pipeline, and time is currently my\nenemy. It is a hard, cold fact of this modern world that the dollar\nsign is the bottom line, and the terms \u201cstarving author / artist\u201d\ndid not just appear out of thin air. With enough people signing up for my Reward Tiers, I\u0027ll be able to\nfocus my energies on producing projects that, I believe, will entertain\nand inspire long after I\u0027ve left this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to\neveryone who has taken the time out of their own busy day to consider\nthese words. In my initial post I\u0027ve put up a few samples for you to read. As well, some of my artwork is displayed in the Rewards column. If you like what you see, jump aboard\nfor the ride \u2013 I promise it\u0027ll be anything but dull."
