    "summary": "Since May 11, 2009, @leeclowsbeard has offered daily crumbs of wisdom about advertising, creativity and the challenge of fighting the proliferation of mediocrity. The account is the work of one person, me (Jason Fox), a CD/copywriter currently based in the Midwest. I am not paid by anyone to produce @leeclowsbeard (although I appreciate the continuing lack of a cease-and-desist order from Lee Clow and TBWA). After nine years, I have earned a small amount of internet fame, a smaller amount of influence and zero income from this endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s okay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if some of my 40,000+ followers feel compelled to help defray the time investment required to create something reasonably insightful or inspiring every day, I would appreciate it beyond measure. As a freelance creative, any form of steady cash flow is highly prized.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you think what I do is worth $.50 a day, become a patron for $10/month. If you\u0027re in the C-suite at a holding company, go crazy. Thanks."
