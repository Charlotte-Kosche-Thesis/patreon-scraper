    "summary": "First things first: all 3D models used in my images were not made by me. They were all ripped/extracted from various video games and, in some cases, made from scratch by talented and generous members of the Source Engine modding community. I only take credit for posing, lighting, setting up the composition and editing these images. These would not be possible without the work done by the modelers who made these models for the games they were taken from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that out of the way, my name is Ariel and I love making 3D fan art. My tools of choice are Photoshop, the Source Engine and a quirky little sandbox known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGarry\u0027s Mod\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been making art all my life, but have been messing around with Garry\u0027s Mod for about 5 years now. You can see most of my art on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lonefirewarrior.deviantart.com/gallery/31767304/Garry-s-Mod\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e page and some on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lonefirewarrior.tumblr.com/tagged/lonefirewarriorart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e. As you can see, my art can be a variety of tones. Some are dark, some are sad, some are happy and some are quite insane. Whatever\u0027s the case, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find something that will make you glad you found me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pretty much intend for this to be nothing more than a tip jar for people who like my work, with rewards of course for bigger tippers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a Patron\u0027s pledge is collected, character requests must be submitted before the end of that month."
