In 2018, he independently \npublished Four Years, a collection of poems that followed the narrative \nof his four-year descent into addiction, depression, isolation, \nloneliness, and subsequent journey and ascent into healing, growth, and \nrelative triumph.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour Years explores themes of happiness and its\n pursuit, love and loss, mental health, pain and panic, romance, \nself-blame, self-loathing, self-medication, sex as a coping mechanism, \nand suicidal ideation. It serves as a monument to the human condition \nand experience while illustrating the author\u0027s own phaneron of his \npersonal relationships with friends, family, lovers, loved ones, and, \nultimately, himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA note: by donating to my Patreon, you are supporting my continued efforts to write more material that I hope might speak to my audience very intimately, whether it be by resonating with them, identifying with them, reassuring them, or simply entertaining them. By supporting me via this means, you are also taking part in my journey as a writer and are able to witness the \"behind the scenes\" of my work and its creation. Thank you to everyone who might support me with your contributions, and thank you for your role in facilitating this opportunity for me to apply myself and my talents for your benefit.\u003cbr\u003e"
