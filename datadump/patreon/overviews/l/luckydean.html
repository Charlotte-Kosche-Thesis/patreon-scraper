    "summary": "The past 10 years I have worked my ass off as a photojournalist, videographer, director in often very difficult circumstances so I can fund some time to dedicate to making very necessary work as an artist. My work has never been particularly commercial, and that has never been important to me. \u003cbr\u003eWhat is important to me is how much my work as an artist feeds me as a human, how much it connects me to my humanity and how it allows me to connect to community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started a Patreon account which will probably save my life this year as I start an MA, move to a new city, and face a much reduced income stream. I have a scholarship, but that goes mostly to university fees and costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI helped a lot of other creators, and people in heavily discounted and often uncompensated ways and I would most often in collaborations, assisting, and support of other artists. Mentorship is essential to how I work. I will keep doing that, because that is me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for your help to keep making, and creating, with people, with purpose. This is not a transaction, I\u0027d prefer it to be a sharing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no real idea what kind of rewards people might want, so I\u0027ve thumbsucked a few, but I\u0027d also really appreciate suggestions, on copy and on rewards. I\u0027m leaving it in flux for the first week while I take suggestions. You are welcome to visit my website \u003ca href=\"http://2point8.co.za\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://2point8.co.za\u003c/a\u003e and suggest special rewards you many want to create and I can load them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a genderqueer artist interested in portraiture as co-authorship; social media as narrative; technology as self-reflection and performance as social provocation. I am exploring ways in which to build a love revolution, from my more personal work, to creating relationships and gathering collaborators to make our public and intimate spaces safer through artist-led creation, mentorship and community organising.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work on multiple levels of creation including photography, video, social media, performance and community action. I am very active on social media, creating conversations around queerness, and non-normative gender expression, and anti-racism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year I begin a two year Master\u0027s program with the University of Cape Town\u0027s Gordon Institute for Performing and Creative Arts (GIPCA), \u00a0as a method of dealing with some of the\u00a0frustrations I experience as a photographer with\nthe politics of representation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIhave embodied an avatar named Goldendean. Goldendean is an evolving public performance exploring the fascination with the flesh, in particular the flesh of non-normative queer bodies and how they inhabit and take space, challenging the arbitrary values we place on normalisation. My performance as Goldendean attempts to deal with issues around the gaze, whiteness, capital, body politics, identity and the inadequacies of the white cube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy project\u00a0will explore\u00a0how\u00a0site-specific performances can fluidify\nboundaries, and help provide a\u00a0reinterpretation of intersectional experiences\nof identity, queerness, colonialism and social justice. My work begins at\u00a0breaking the fourth wall, where both artist and audience\ncollaborate in a dialogue aimed at shifting ideas of power and public space.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe avatar of Goldendean is a spark\nthat grew from visual disobediences, acts of protest at the ways in which we\nare rendered silent in violent and mundane ways. Embedded in the image of\nGoldendean is a celebration of queer failure\u00a0as cultural currency. It\nis QUEER as in Fuck You. It\u2019s mediation is less than it\u2019s experience. It is not\ndocumentary. It is revolutionary. And it is love. Shifting boundaries, quietly\nfrom the centre of attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
