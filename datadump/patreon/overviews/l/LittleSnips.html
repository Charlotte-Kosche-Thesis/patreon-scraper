I have no fingers but I am in possession of opposable thumbs, making me a very clever monkey or, perhaps, just an ordinary human, after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...no, that\u0027s not entirely true either. I am human, yes, but I\u0027malso pretty creative, even if I do spread that creativity around on a number of things: writing, dyeing, knitting and spinning, beading, working with paper and felt...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the last of these that I\u0027m aiming to focus on here. I love working with wool felt, and piecing it together to make tiny people and critters. I started not that long ago, working from a pattern designed by another briilliant creator, but I\u0027m doing my best to change things up, design my own pieces and put them together in ways that appeal to all of you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also putting them in costume. Call it Critter Cosplay, if you will. Or, you know, come up with some other name that amuses you. Regardless, my goal is to use this Patreon to fund my creativity so I\u0027m not always dipping into my husband\u0027s salary, and hopefully to make a few of you smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will share progress pictures, design ideas, new creations and the thoughts that pop up in the process. I may also include tidbits from other aspects of my creative life. \u00a0If \u00a0you\u0027re willing to come along for the ride, I will do my very level best not to let you down. :)"
