I\u0027ve been making Magic: the Gathering content now for just over a year and loving every minute of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhile the Cube format is the main focus for my channel as it\u0027s by far the best format in Magic: the Gathering (at least to me anyway), it is not the sole focus of the channel! Over the coming year, all sorts of other videos will coming out from Pauper to Drafts and Openings. I can\u0027t wait to see where we can go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour direct support will be able to achieve so much more than YouTube Ad-revenue alone could ever do! I want to be able to improve the quality of my content, not only through the improvement of equipment, but also the visual appearance of the channel and expand on the content that I already produce. I also want to build a community and create the content that YOU want to watch and what better way is there to have direct communication with you all to help make this channel even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Patreon funds all go back into the channel! I want this channel to succeed and continue to grow and the best way I can do that is to continue to invest into it. With your help we can get there faster! Just some of the things that Patreon\u0027s money has helped with so far are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e - Improved Lighting\u003cbr\u003e - Upgraded Camera\u003cbr\u003e - Upgraded Computer\u003cbr\u003e - Products\u003cbr\u003e - MTGO Cube Drafts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there is still so much more I want to do to bring you the best channel I can make! 2018 will have a big content upgrade and I can\u0027t wait to get started. Cube, Pauper and more will really help push this even further. I\u0027d love to go to more events and bring more content there, plus paper gameplay is certainly on the cards! Your help will enable me to bring all of these things and more even sooner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen does your content come out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos come out twice a month, potentially more depending on how busy my week is. But I will provide high quality production value content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst of all I\u0027d like to Thank You for even considering to help support the channel with your hard earned money. Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s not 100% necessary to keep creating the content that I love to make, but it will go an awful long way to making improvements to the channel. Even at $1 a month level, it will make a huge difference to me over that of YouTube\u0027s Ad Revenue!\u003cbr\u003eOf course the higher the tier of rewards you choose will have a bigger effect on the channel and will receive all of the below tier benefits too. The more I can do to make your experience better with the channel content the better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo THANK YOU again for thinking about supporting this channel and I hope you have a great day!"
