    "summary": "I have a propensity for keeping a low profile, it\u2019s the way\nI feel most comfortable. Recently matters have tended to take on a life of\ntheir own and I felt it was important to communicate what I know to the world.\nI have always had the inclination to communicate. When I was a small child my\nbest memories were of my grandfather telling amazing stories of times past. For\nmany years I was a filmmaker and before that just a grunt in the motion picture\nbusiness. Because of all the films I worked on I had a desire to tell stories\nwith film and naturally it all starts with writing them down. A few unmade\nscreenplays were the result and a few films that actually got made.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter many years spent traveling the world and making other\npeoples ideas happen, my wife and I decided it was time to do something else\nclose to home. We had always been fervent animal lovers, dogs, horses, goats\nwhatever found its way into our life. We had tons of animals, we still do. That\nlove got us into raising and training search dogs. We mostly had Bloodhounds\nbut many other breeds including shelter and rescue dogs were a part of the mix.\nAs we got deeper and deeper into the whole world of dogs we began to formulate\nan idea that we hoped could change the world. We were raising some pretty\namazing dogs and what they were capable of changed our perspective completely. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"110\" width=\"434\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe looked around and saw some dreadful things happening in schools\naround the country. The world my wife and I grew up in was a safer place and we\nwanted to see if we could help bring a little of that back. The idea we came up\nwith was to match carefully trained Bloodhounds with combat veterans that had\nserved their country and needed a good job. That team of veteran handler and\ntrained dog would serve in schools as a mentor, a friend and a first line of defense\nwhen bad things happen. We called it Sentinel K9 and we poured ourselves into\nit. We developed a finance plan to enable one hundred and forty four of these\nteams to be fielded each year for many years. There would be good employment\nfor vets and a real purpose for the dogs we held in such high esteem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEverything looked promising, all the hard work was paying\noff with the dogs and an investor had agreed to jump start the financing. Then\nsomething completely insane happened. Some very dark and disturbing people\ndecided to kill our dogs. It\u2019s probable that they were taking revenge for when\na wolf killed a young colt of ours. He was the last son of a great stallion we\nhad owned that was killed by a rattlesnake the summer before. The colt was just\nlike his father and we hoped he could fill his shoes into the future. The wolf\nended that when he cornered the colt against a fence away from his mother and\nfinished him off. We were devastated and hunted the wolf that had done it. I\nfinally shot the animal from my front porch while he was attacking the mares in\nour field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEverything changed at that point and we have been living a\nsurreal life ever since. At the time of this writing we have had at least 48 of\nour dogs killed by these people. The method they used took years to uncover,\nthe toxin they used is a biological agent of the first order. The danger to\nunsuspecting people is why I am writing these words. I began on Facebook with\nthe story of what we had before the poisonings and moved on to the aftermath. The\nreaction is exactly what would be expected. Law Enforcement seems to be\nparalyzed by this obvious act of terrorism and powerless as a result. The toxin\nis nearly undetectable and the legal options nonexistent. My recourse is to\ntell the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn an effort to engage people in this tale of intrigue I\nposted on Facebook a picture of ice climbing in Antarctica. The photo was taken\nwhile we were filming a commercial and is truly an outrageous picture. My\nintention with the caption was to describe the level of danger in the photo as\nnothing compared with what we do to keep our dogs alive and safe these days. A\nfriend from many years ago commented on the photo remarking about what an adventurous\nlife I have led and how great it would be to hear the stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo here I am. I took stock of my life and what I have done\nand it has been an adventure. I found Patreon and an idea started to develop. We\nhave pressing needs in our life; we have lost a massive amount with the deaths\nof our dogs and Sentinel K9 that we had poured everything into. We need to keep\nwhat we still have alive and healthy. We also need to keep the fight alive to\nbring the culprits that killed our dogs to justice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople are intrigued by places and circumstances they will never experience in life, this is the essence of what I create with my words. Join my group of patrons and I will share a life of outrageous experience. It began when I was young and driven by sports, mostly\nskiing and climbing. I spent my early adulthood cross-country skiing for the US\nTeam. It was fun, I won some big races but my career inspired me less than I\nhad hoped and after five years I retired from racing. The next several years I\nspent coaching kids in the program that gave me my start. In the meantime I was\nclimbing all over the world. From Everest to Antarctica and Europe to Alaska, I\nmanaged to scare myself more times than I can remember. A few film projects\nlanded in my lap and lead to a full time career in the motion picture business. I had dreamed of\nbeing a filmmaker in high school and saw a way to make that dream a reality. I\ndangled 20 million dollar actors off thousand foot cliffs for many years and\neventually managed to produce and direct some projects of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy resume is long and convoluted but it is most definitely filled\nwith adventure. I have many stories to tell and all of them are true, unflinchingly true. I am working on a book of the long road to finding resolution\nabout our dogs. The chapters will be made available for the first time on these pages.\u00a0 My intention is to share all of this with my patrons on this\nwebsite. I also possess vital information about how to minimize the effects of\ntoxins like what killed our dogs. There are untold numbers of toxic\nenvironmental dangers we all face everyday. When we were faced with dogs dying\nslowly and painfully from an unknown toxin we tried everything under the sun to\nhelp them. Those lessons learned saved many of our dogs and today they are\nmostly free from the toxic effects.We\nare even toying with the idea of manufacturing a dog food that has the\nproperties that saved our dogs from a multitude of issues.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u2019t have a secret formula for doling out this story so\nI\u2019ll have to figure it out as I go. I don\u2019t know how long this will work or\neven if it will, but I\u2019ll keep it alive as long as someone finds it of value. This\nplan seems like a fair trade, some value for some value, something I\u2019m much more\ncomfortable with and it all seems like the right thing to do. If you decide to\nbecome a patron you have mine and my wife\u0027s undying gratitude and know the money spent to experience this adventure will be\ngoing to care for something truly noble. \u003cbr\u003e"
