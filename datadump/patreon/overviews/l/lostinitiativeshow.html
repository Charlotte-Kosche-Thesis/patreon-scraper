    "summary": "A little over a year ago we started up Lost Initiative Show here on Twitch and Patreon. And what a ride it\u0027s been throughout. From D\u0026amp;D 5e, World of Darkness and Fantasy Flight Star Wars, we\u0027ve told a great amount of stories and had some amazing adventures. I (Mike) got to DM for the first time and loved it. We wouldn\u0027t trade it for the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the thing about starting something fresh and new is that for all the good and all the successes, there was some bad and failures along the way. In that bad, lessons were to be learned. While we put on some amazing shows, we also bit off more than we could chew. We wanted to grow faster than we were ready for, took on too many responsibilities without the know-how and backup to do it. Shows would get cancelled as people couldn\u0027t show up last minute and we\u0027d have no backup plan to fill in. We were ambitious to the point of impossibility for a team of 2 people. So after the end of Edge of Morality (our biggest and longest running show) Scott and I took a step back. We looked at everything we learned, both good and bad, evaluated our mistakes and how we could improve and grow and decided it was time to take a small break. So in February of 2018, we did. All shows ceased and Scott and I went through everything. The show structure, how often we put on a show, our Patreon reward tiers and how we could improve everything. In March, we slowly returned with hints at the new campaign, some character gen and solo sessions. And in April, we return in full force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Year 2 of the Lost Initiative Show. New shows, new art, new players, new stories, same amazing moments. The biggest and most obvious change will come to the Patreon and its rewards. We\u0027ve removed the $75 tier altogether and added two new rewards to the $10 and $25 dollar tier to involve you, our supporters, more with every show. We want you to be involved in the story telling and with these tiers you\u0027ll be able to influence (for better or for worse) the party and the stories. $10 tier will get you the ability to create an item one of the party members (or all) receive. $25 will allow you to create your own NPC that will show up and mess with or help the party along, with their own story and backgrounds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother change coming is the MP3s. We\u0027ve been terrible at getting the MP3s to you the viewers and a lot of that has to do with how we were attempting to distribute them, hosting them on a site that was too expensive for what we needed. So instead, we will be directly sending the MP3s to those of that tier and higher through Patreon for you to download.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom here on out Scott and I are pumped to bring you the revamped and relaunched Lost Initiative Show. We\u0027ll be starting with the new Star Wars Fantasy Flight system and story with Mathas as GM and expanding from there. Lots of new 1 offs trying out new rules, new epic campaigns, new players and everything inbetween. We love and appreciate all those who\u0027ve been with us from day 1 and hope to see you all through our newest journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Lost Initiative"
