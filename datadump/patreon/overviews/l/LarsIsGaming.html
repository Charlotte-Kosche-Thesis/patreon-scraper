I\u0027m self employed, and any time I spend on the game is time I cant spend on commercial projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make the best videos and game that I can, so I\u0027m creating this Patreon campaign to help out with the costs of running the project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a bonus, people pledging to the campaign will have early access to the development builds of game, and I\u0027ll be running more personal Q\u0026amp;A videos for patrons who have questions, or need advice on their owen projects.\u003cbr\u003e"
