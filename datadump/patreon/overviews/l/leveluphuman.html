In 2018 we have some big ideas to make the podcast better and reach further. We wouldn\u0027t be able to do it without you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit about us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLevel Up Human is a fortnightly programme where academics and comedians discuss what the human body should look like to be truly fit for purpose. We have invited geneticists to tweak the human genome, memory experts to explain how to download memories, archaeologists to promote the merits of war, we are happy to go down many a comedy cul de sac in pursuit of the ultimate body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur podcast has always been and will continue to be free to anyone who wants to listen. You can help to keep it free by joining our band of patrons. We have lofty ambitions of a monthly London residency, tours of music and science festivals, and of course bigger and better guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who has joined our community. We could not make this project what it is without you. We go further and do more awesome things with your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeam Level Up Human\u003cbr\u003eRachel and Simon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimon Watt is\u00a0is a biologist, writer, science communicator and TV presenter.

As a writer he has written dozens of articles for national newspapers and websites including The Times, The Sunday Times and the Huffington Post. He is perhaps best known as a presenter on the BAFTA winning documentary series Inside Nature\u2019s Giants and the Channel 4 special The Elephant: Life After Death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRachel Wheeley is a comedian and podcaster who runs many weird and wonderful gigs promoting science, history and obscure sci-fi books from the \u002770s.
