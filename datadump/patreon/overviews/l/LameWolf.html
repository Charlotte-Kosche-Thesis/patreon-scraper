Firstly, we\u0027d like to thank you guys for the incredible amount of support you\u0027ve always given us. As a result, we decided we\u0027d set up a Patreon in order to fund our bots- eh, I mean... dreams of being professional goofballs! Secondly, we must say that \u003cstrong\u003ewe don\u0027t expect anything, but we appreciate absolutely everything we get. \u003c/strong\u003eScorpion Jesus really appreciates those donations though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re just a couple of losers who started off playing games together and realised \"hey, this stuff is pretty funny\" so we went and threw it on YouTube, and so started the wacky rollercoaster that is Lame Wolf Productions. Since then, we\u0027ve specialised on sketch comedy and funny short films both in games and the real world. We\u0027re full time college students and what we do takes a lot of work, but it\u0027s worth the effort because we love doing it and love \u003cstrong\u003emaking you guys laugh\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0027re pretty proud of what we do, and would love to some day do it full time. We have come up with some really cool characters like Scorpion Jesus, Tek Tier Guy, The Lone Rider, Sally \u0026amp; Peanut, etc., and we\u0027d love to keep making wacky characters like that full time for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, as it stands, this is our \u003cstrong\u003ehobby\u003c/strong\u003e. The kind of stuff that we do takes a lot of work, and it\u0027s work worth doing. One day, \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027d love to be able to devote the most time and effort we can to our projects\u003c/strong\u003e, and with the help of our Patrons, we can. We want to continue to produce content that \u003cstrong\u003econtinuously increases in quality\u003c/strong\u003e, and not get slowed down by \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube demonetizations\u003c/strong\u003e. We love what we do, and \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027d love for it to be what we do to pay the bills\u003c/strong\u003e. If you\u0027re one of the people that helps us with that, then \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e.

Don\u0027t worry, we don\u0027t actually buy bots. \u003cbr\u003eYour money will go towards \u003cstrong\u003emaking our content better\u003c/strong\u003e for you guys. Whether this is through buying new equipment or giving us the money to budget certain projects, the collection of photons that make their way into your optic nerve will definitely be of a better quality. The support we have been given so far has already led to us being able to start a second channel and get more frequent content out to you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eSo, what\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, there\u0027s the aforementioned increase in content quality and the expansion of our channel and what we do for the sake of your entertainment. But wait, there\u0027s more! We\u0027re going to have all sorts of extra behind the scenes content on this site exclusively for patrons. Well, by pledging any amount, you aid us in our \u003cstrong\u003equest to be full-time Lameos\u003c/strong\u003e, and help us get through YouTube flagging our videos left and right. Also, you can gain access to our \u003cstrong\u003ePatron-only Discord\u003c/strong\u003e, where we have gaming nights and also source body actors, so you can get a peek behind the scenes! We also have all sorts of different goals and rewards for different levels of patrons, including \u003cstrong\u003eLame Wolf t-shirts, Lame Wolf Posters, and a bunch of other cool rewards\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne of the main rewards is our Patreon Discord\u003c/strong\u003e. We try to get to know our Patrons and are quite active in the Discord, but the main thing is joining our ever-growing community of wonderful Patrons. We try to take the time to game with them, abuse them for body acting for our skits, and try our best to make the pledge worth it through things like our Patron D\u0026amp;D series. The closer we get to the goal of doing this thing full time, the more time we can invest into it. That means more streams, better videos, more often videos on the Lounge, and all sorts of cool stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eScorpion Jesus thanks you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you\u0027re under 18, make sure you have permission from a parent/guardian before pledging. But even so, if you\u0027re too young, keep your money and go buy something cool with it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
