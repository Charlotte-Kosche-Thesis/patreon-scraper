Although I have several books listed on Amazon, most of my work has never been published. But now I am working on a new type of autobiography that I plan on putting immediately into the Public Domain. So rather than look to future book sales to pay for my time, I\u0027m asking you to become a part of this project and send me a few dollars each month so that together we can give this book away free for anyone who wants it.\n(\n\u003ca href=\"#MoreAboutMe\"\u003eAlso see: More About Me\u003c/a\u003e - at the page bottom).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat is a Postmodern Autobiography?\u003c/h4\u003e\nOn my 74th birthday I decided that each day during the next 12 months I would write a new short account of something that I\u0027ve done or experienced along the way in this life. It is now 2018, and Volume 1 of \n\u003cem\u003eLorenzo\u0027s\nChronicles\n\u003c/em\u003e is complete and available for free downloads.\nHere is a link where you can go to download your own free copy of Volume 1:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://lorenzohagerty.com/freebooks/\"\u003ehttps://lorenzohagerty.com/freebooks/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"300\" src=\"http://psychedelicsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LorenzoLawStudy.jpg\" width=\"400\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nLorenzo studying for the Texas bar exam in 1972.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the things that I\u0027ve realized as I worked on this series of books is that this is a very easy and simple way for all of us to preserve a few little bits about our lives that our distant descendants may one day enjoy reading. For instance, wouldn\u0027t you like to know what your great great grandmother did for entertainment? What about your grandfather\u0027s boyhood adventures, wouldn\u0027t it be fun to know a few of them? And with these little stories, wouldn\u0027t you have a better picture of the stories that make up your family history? In our community discussion section I\u0027ll be sharing a few tips that I have learned since beginning this process, and hopefully I will also create a spark in you to do something similar.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/h4\u003e\nMost likely already know about\nKickstarter, which is essentially a crowd-funding platform for\nspecific projects of all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, that isn\u0027t\nactually a very good fit for some of us starving artists. However, Patreon has\nnow organized a way for \n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epatrons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e of musicians, artists, writers, and other\ncreators \n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eto come together and collectively provide\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e their favorite artists with a more steady form of income.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd while a pledge of just $2 a month\nmay not seem like a lot to you, it can actually make a noticeable\ndifference in an artist\u0027s life. For example, I do most of the cooking\nin our family, and so a pledge of $2 a month by you will allow me\nto take my wife out to eat once a year, and it will give me that night\noff from my cooking chores.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo these small pledges that are made\nhere through Patreon can really add up. And, BTW, you can always stop\nor change your monthly payments at any time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs of 2018 my landlord has raised my rent by $400/month. So it is with \nthe help of my patrons here that I am able to remain in the apartment in\n which I\u0027ve been living for the past seven years. And this is a Really \nBig Deal for me!
