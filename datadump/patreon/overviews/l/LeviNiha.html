My goal with the Youtube videos has always been to create content which is not only entertaining to watch, but also fun to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few of months I have had a huge amount of people asking me to create more informative and tutorial-styled videos which is basically where the whole idea of this Patreon stems from. I thought it would be a great way for me to create educational content without disrupting the flow of my Youtube channel, while also giving me a chance to have a more reliable income than Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this Patreon isn\u2019t just for people who are music producers.\u003cbr\u003eI have created the lowest level tier for everyone who isn\u2019t interested in music production but is still wanting to support the channel, you also get some preeeeetty great rewards too!\u003cbr\u003e"
