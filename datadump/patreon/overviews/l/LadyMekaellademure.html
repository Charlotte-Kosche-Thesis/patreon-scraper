    "summary": "Hello Darlings,\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying Patreon to see if it\u0027s a good vehicle to help support all that I do as your fav traveling nerdy \u0026amp; naked showgirl. I do everything from fire eating \u0026amp; spinning to stilt walking, not just burlesque \u0026amp; cosplay. I\u0027m a well rounded sideshow gal. But alas this can be expensive to do PROPERLY, like specialty circus insurance, business insurance, work-shoppes \u0026amp; classes that improve myself \u0026amp; my craft, \u00a0travel costs, costuming maintenance \u0026amp; creation for every act I offer at every gig. \u0026amp; living in FL often means not being paid enough to break even, despite charging going rate. That\u0027s where you come in! \u0026amp; I\u0027m so grateful for your support and love! We showgirls would be nothing without you all in the audience! \u0026amp; this is a great way for me to keep track of you so you can be thanked in a more personalized fashion! Let\u0027s try it shall we?\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be getting unique thank you gifts \u0026amp; rewards along the way too! Plus sneak peaks at my work \u0026amp; special shout outs!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m normally not one for artists using crowd funding, how ever with my experience in classical theatre \u0026amp; opera settings, I am familiar with the concept of having \"patrons\" so when this page came across my path \u0026amp; I saw the similarity to the classic concept of a patron of the arts, as opposed to contemporary crowd funding I figured I would experiment with it, and give it a chance.\u003cbr\u003eYou might be familiar with my work from either my productions like The Marion At Midnight series, Or my charitable \"cosplay for a cause\" hospital visit style volunteer group named United Universes, or even my independent work across the state of FL (\u0026amp; now New Orleans) with other productions and shows doing burlesque fire \u0026amp; more. if so THANK YOU for getting me this far, whether it was buying my merch, going to my shows, or tipping us performers, or even sharing our events online.\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to myself \u0026amp; those involved with all my projects!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eKisses \u0026amp; Kocktails,\u003cbr\u003eLady Mekaella DeMure"
