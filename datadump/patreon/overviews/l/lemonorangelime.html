As a multiracial woman of color, I understand what it\u0027s like to see constant negative representations, or lack of ones for that matter, everywhere you look.  I want to change that, and that\u0027s why with my work, and your help, I can broaden my horizons, and create work that can inspire those less represented.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mLXZpcv.png\" style=\"width: 629px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little About My Comic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on creating a webcomic featuring a diverse cast, and I would love to dedicate my full time towards it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story features a young man named, Eli, who has been able to see the dead for as long as he can remember. \u00a0Unfortunately, he has absolutely no idea how to talk to people that are alive, much less ones that are no longer breathing. \u00a0When he moves to a new, small town, he gets a lot more than he bargained for, meeting new and interesting characters that turn his already extraordinary life into even more of an adventure. \u00a0This story will be filled with fun, ghosts, witches, and much, much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/c010c5e781897934d1822566e3705514/tumblr_nuqnwxx74j1qgworxo1_540.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9a7JhmE.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that people will be able to enjoy this comic just as much as I enjoy creating it, and my goal is to have characters that will appeal to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with helping me to create this webcomic, you will get access to other art I haven\u0027t posted anywhere!\u003cbr\u003e"
