This has been heavy on my mind, was there something that I could have done to prevent that from happening? I came up with many scenarios, but there was really nothing I could have done to prevent my son from dying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have decided that I could help in trying to prevent this from happening to somebody else. I\u0027ve done a few things to raise some money for the American Diabetes Association, but nothing really major. I had a dream In the second week of January 2018 that I was raising money riding my motorcycle all over the country and that I raised $90,000.00 in one year. I thought this is a great idea so I\u0027m pursuing it.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAll the money raised here on my Patreon site goes to help keeping me on the road to raise money to help cure and support family with\u00a0diabetes\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Journey along with me on the ride of my life, as I travel around the country on my motorcycle, raising awareness, and\u00a0my goal to raise $90,000.00 in one year.\u00a0 See the incredible roads I will travels, the amazing people I meet along the way,\u00a0working at events, recording videos, and taking photos!\u003cbr\u003eYou Can Donate Here\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://main.diabetes.org/goto/LoneStarRider\"\u003ehttp://main.diabetes.org/goto/LoneStarRider\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNearly 30 million Americans have diabetes and another 86 million are at risk for developing diabetes.
