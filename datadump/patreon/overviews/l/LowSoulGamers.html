I quickly realized that I didn\u0027t enjoy it at all, and what I was really passionate about was what I had been doing already - creating gaming videos. I decided, after thorough discussion with my closest family, that maybe it was time I take a step back from college until I find something I want to do, and take a shot at following my dreams while I\u0027m at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think my favorite part of creating videos, is just seeing the feedback, and seeing what people think. It always makes me so ecstatic when people tell me they enjoy my content, and I would like to dedicate my life to being able to do just that."
