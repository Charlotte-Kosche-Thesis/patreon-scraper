I\u2019m\nlooking forward to longevity as an artist and designer and those whom support\nme are the key.  I\u2019ve been wanting to\nkeep a more consistent practice of creating so thank you again for allowing me\nto continue by providing me the means to do what I love AND eat. Currently,\nI\u2019m a Doctoral student and am accruing debt in order to learn. I\u2019d like to\nbalance the stress of that, after graduation, by developing an income with my\nart.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy Current Project:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eInk-saving friendly, Printable Tarot\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been interested in creating a deck for YEARS. I was\nrecently looking at printable decks because I was curious about what was out\nthere. I found many files that took an incredible amount of ink, and unless the\nfiles would be taken to a third-party printer, it wasn\u2019t very economic\u00a0for\nthose of us DIY-ers. Or there were decks that were so simple they were hard to\nread intuitively and would need quite a bit of memorization. So, I thought, why\nnot create a deck that was minimalistic enough to save on ink, yet complex\nenough to capture the essence of each card without purely using traditional\nsymbols?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eVoil\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00e1!\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eThe Thought-Space Tarot\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/e30%3D/patreon-posts/jxEUTTkgiHhJetpx3FWXq0zWSFz3UgmPkNqWOX904n-EWBprvRUMqZ7FllOoFSor.jpg?token-time=1518048000\u0026amp;token-hash=Mg_4Tb-pPI3VXsx3KDVsozTyrYfrcV0g5PRfkyl0zZI%3D\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow does the current Project affect the Tiers?\u00a0Good question!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEssentially all the goodies will be based off of\nthe current project that I\u2019m working on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u201cThe Patrons\u201d will get to see what designs I\u2019m\nthinking of before working on them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u201cPeanut Gallery\u201d will be helping me figure out\nwhat tweaks the designs need\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u201cFreebies\u201d Will be getting PDF files of each\ncard as it is finalized and as I finish a suit or Arcana will get the PDF file\nwith all of them together.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u201cCard Connoisseurs\u201d will be getting printed\ncards that may have different back designs or different positions of art work\non the front or different face designs altogether.

I would love to continue my artwork even while engaging in the Healthcare field. Currently I Intern at NAVOS Psychiatric Involuntary Inpatient Hospital and actively see patients at the Bastyr Center for Natural Health. My current occupation is in Medical Massage, as a Licensed Massage Practitioner.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to address the psychology and physiology of the body within my artwork, I am exploring how to distill or capture essence as well as how to portray the uncomfortable that lies just beneath the surface of our daily lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is along those lines, I\u0027ve been fascinated with the Tarot because of how many interpretations can be taken from readings. It\u0027s a peek into your own internal world which is created from a pictographical language ruled by the right hemisphere of the brain. Each meaning of each card is an interpretation of the self through your own experiential perception, so I see it more as a tool for self exploration. I\u0027m excited to work on and complete the project!",
