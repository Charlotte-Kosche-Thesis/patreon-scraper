MK acts and Rachel writes. Sometimes those two things tend to go pretty well together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe met working working on \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/lizziebennet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e, an Emmy award-winning modern day video blog adaptation of \u003ci\u003ePride \u0026amp; Prejudice\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0where MK played Lydia Bennet, and Rachel wrote a lot of the words she said (particularly when she got \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/thelydiabennet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eher own spin-off\u003c/a\u003e). Over the course of working on those shows, we discovered that we work really well together, and are both interested in telling edgy, character-driven stories that hopefully make people look at the world a little differently than they usually do. Some people liked what we collaboratively brought to the show and asked us to make more things together, so we were like hey, yeah, sure, we can do that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also both really, really love Fall Out Boy, so we stole a line from one of their songs and made it the name of our YouTube channel. Loosely Bolted. You probably got that part, we\u0027re just being exhaustively clear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Q8B33xnMww8?list=PLrKMig6HOjnjtw4_8RaDcUo5D1aK9TZ73\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat we want to do.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMake stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTa-da! That\u0027s it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReally though, we want to keep making our own stuff and eventually create more ambitious projects like ongoing web series and movies. (You like those things, right? ...right?) Rachel has a (super totally useful) degree in \"film/TV,\" which is to say, assorted things related to making film and television, like not holding a camera upside down and putting tape on the ground so actors know where to stand, and MK has a lot of on-set experience, acting in well-known web series such as \u003ci\u003eSquaresville\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eSchool of Thrones\u003c/i\u003e, as well as several feature films, so we aren\u0027t going into this as two people who completely don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing. Promise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIdeally, our YouTube channel will be a place for us to share one-off sketches and short films as well as test out scenes for bigger projects we have in mind. It will be a mixture of funny stuff, angsty stuff, and westerns. Lost of westerns. \u003ci\u003e(Note: We aren\u0027t serious about the westerns. Probably.)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also like music (are there people who don\u0027t?), so we would like to come up with some fun covers of songs for videos. MK is really good at singing, and Rachel is really good at tapping empty beer bottles with her thumb ring. If that doesn\u0027t sell us as serious musicians, probably nothing will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/aWJmVfYNOdo\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhere you come in.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make a short film, we come up with ideas, pick one to write, write it, get together any props, locations, and additional actor/crew friends to help out, shoot it, log the footage, edit it, color correct it, edit audio, and do anything extra like find or write music, create title sequences, add in special effects, etc. To make a cover video, we find a song we want to cover, come up with an arrangement, learn it, practice it, record it over and over until we actually get it right, edit it, color correct it, and edit the audio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasically, this stuff takes a lot of time.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the less time we have to spend worrying about bills and finding other ways to make money, the more time we will have to spend working on these videos so we can release things more frequently and make sure they\u0027re the best they can be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond that, we also want to make sure we have a contingency for any video expenses that pop up, like paying any actors and crew who help us out (we try to keep it to an absolute minimum by doing as much as we can ourselves, but sometimes we can\u0027t do everything), buying props or costumes we can\u0027t find/borrow/make, and other small expenses that add up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe aren\u0027t trying to get rich off of YouTube, or off of you; all we want to do is make things that we love, and still be able to do things like pay for car insurance and buy food every day. So if we make things you love, too, and you have a couple dollars to help out, that would be super cool of you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eObviously everything we make will still be available to watch for free on YouTube. If you can\u0027t afford to help us out, or just don\u0027t want to, but still want to see the things we make, we ABSOLUTELY want you to be able to do that. That\u0027s way awesome of you. We hope you enjoy it!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eQuestions we\u0027re assuming you may have:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow many videos will release each month?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRight now, we\u0027re going to try to release a video every other week, but we\u0027d love to eventually get to the point where we\u0027re making more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eYou have unscripted videos on your YouTube channel as well, will I get charged when you upload those?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNOPE. The only videos that will count towards our Patreon video count are scripted videos and videos where we make music. Any videos we release that are vlogs or just us goofing around or answering questions are extra. The reason for this is that scripted things and covers take a lot more time for us to do than unscripted, and they also seem to be the things our audience wants to see more. Also worth noting is that any covers or scripted vids we post on our own personal YouTube channels won\u0027t count either. This is only to support projects we are creating together under the name Loosely Bolted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow much money should I donate?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhereas Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns are often focused on getting the largest donations possible from each person, honestly, Patreon seems to work best so far with a lot of people donating a little money each. So if you\u0027ve only got $1 to give us per video? Freaking great! If everyone who watched our stuff gave us a dollar per video, we\u0027d be making way more money than we even need. So please don\u0027t think that doesn\u0027t help, because it really, really adds up and helps us out so much. But if you don\u0027t have money to spare, don\u0027t worry about it. We totally get it. And we still think you\u0027re super cool and thank you for watching our videos and caring enough to read all of this!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat happens if you release 189342 videos in one month??\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, that would be absolutely crazy and we seriously don\u0027t think that will ever happen. BUT in case you are still worried, you can set a monthly limit for how much you want to spend. For instance, if you pledge $10 per video but know you can\u0027t afford to spend more than $20 a month, set that as your maximum, and if we make more than two videos in a month, you won\u0027t be charged more than $20. Simple!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eCan I just stop donating?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah dude, totally! If you decide it\u0027s not for you anymore, or money is tight, please feel more than free to opt out. You can always come back later if you want. Or don\u0027t if you don\u0027t. We promise we will still like you just as much as we already do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAny more questions? Just ask!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"
