I\u0027m pleased to offer behind-the-scenes photos, time-lapse, and occasional videos stories about my life and my journey creating art through this platform.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the years I\u0027ve been able to develop a tiny family of artists, collectors, patrons, and most of all friends, through our interactions and sharing through this page. I love that this space offers the perfect hybrid between a blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Laura.W.Garabedian\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/lauragarabedian\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e. I can share all my art and photos with those who are interested in knowing more about how I work and what I do. With the added bonus of not worrying about views being throttled or what algorithm is currently working best for any of those sites.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site is also somewhat less curated than the above sites, this is where you can see more process, see whats behind the scenes. Sometimes messy studio pics, or videos where the dogs may feel the need to add their two cents to my conversation. So if you want to be a part of my art family I recommend you check out my tiers available or even click the follow button. I\u0027d love to have you join my little art nest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
