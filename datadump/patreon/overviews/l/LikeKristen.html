My name is Kristen and thank you for stopping by my Patreon page. In my free time I make mental health videos on YouTube to help teens and young adults who are struggling with their mental health. I take it upon myself to let these teens who are struggling know that they are not alone. I give tips and tricks on how to cope with illnesses like depression, anxiety, and stress and advice on how to reach out for help to professionals and loved ones.  I teach that recovery is possible and everyone deserves a second chance! On top of recovery support I also make educational videos to spread awareness for different mental health topics. I believe that the more awareness gets spread the less stigma there will be surrounding talking about mental health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 227, 188);\"\u003eDOESN\u0027T YOUTUBE PAY YOU?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eKinda?\u003cbr\u003eThe current problem that LikeKristen is facing is \u003cem\u003ecensorship.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"51\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FHQupTAaQdkp3suTo6Ud5VNm_zMys1WFLHpOaUs1775z0vqlVAkyzjzAx7GPykJIeX_drviXVO7gPgwLsQo0PaPE8NM2OLZc_LB0LBBJcsLNzZ_7oYbfMjRQdh5sO2Tq6Dq3Cv9V\" width=\"624\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the current Youtube climate, videos about mental health and awareness are claimed as \u201cnot-advertiser friendly.\u201d Because of this change I am not getting very much money for videos I have put so much time and love into making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(251, 213, 181);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 224, 236);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003eWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my channel you are not only supporting the production of my videos but you are also supporting the spreading of mental health awareness that could potentially help a struggling teen or young adult who is looking for a community of people who understands. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube has become a home to me where I am not afraid to be who I really am.
