I have done everything from working in the graphic design industry to working on films and creature design. This comic series is a new endeavor that I want very badly to succeed. After scouring the \"verse\" for scraps to sustain me, I realized that there were none, not just for me but for everyone who ever pledged to being a Browncoat. So I took matters into my own hands and built this comic from the ancient ruins of what was once an amazing story that was never to be.",
