I run things at Last Line of Defense, which means I spend countless hours doing research on gear, topics, skills - and then spend another chunk of countless hours creating content to relay the things that I\u0027ve learned, to you guys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support ($$) will go DIRECTLY and ENTIRELY towards creating content. I won\u0027t spend the money on lobster dinners, fancy vacations, or anything like that. In fact, I\u0027m going to let you guys choose where 100% of the money will go, via polls that only you will be able to vote on. Want the money to go towards a new camera for better quality video, new gun to review, a trip to that expo so that I can cover whatever? That\u0027s for you to decide."
