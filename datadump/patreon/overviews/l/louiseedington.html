Sometimes even paying for the privilege of writing my daily posts and doing my live calls, videos and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I really, really desire is to be able to write every single day and to be able to offer live videos without the blah blah\u0027s of list building. And, quite honestly, without Facebook....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook has become an energy drain for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a kick ass, magical, astrologer. And building a sustainable income as an astrologer isn\u0027t the easiest thing in the world. I\u0027m a writer and a Shamanic Practitioner. I write prolifically when I can justify the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet it\u0027s all I really desire to do. I want to speak and write astrology. I want to help YOU through astrology! And I want the freedom to produce voluminous content! I want a space where I can invite you to have mini astrology readings and trainings without me having to do the blah blahs of \u0027marketing\u0027 to get you to them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am asking for your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd........ I have a very special project I want to work on in 2018. Which will require more time and freedom to open up to focus on the project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I ask for you to support me in any way you can. $5 or $50 monthly. There is something for everyone. And all voluntary, of course. Check out the rewards. They are freaking awesome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you in advance so very much. And I love you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut about me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I and how did I get here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter wandering for most of my life, I could feel something pulling me forward, but it wasn\u2019t coming together in one central purpose. It felt scattered plus I was disenchanted with the hard work (and dollars) I was investing in because it was leading to dead end after dead end.\u003cbr\u003eAnd Dr Wayne Dyer saved me. Well, not literally because I believe we save ourselves from our selves. But one day, after being moved to Utah from Adelaide, Australia to Salt Lake City, Utah (can you tell I wasn\u2019t keen), I happened to catch Dr Dyer on PDS speaking about his quote, \u2018if you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change\u2019.\u003cbr\u003eLightbulb moment!\u003cbr\u003eI realized that I was letting the energies of the world do me rather than using those energies to CREATE the life I desired.\u003cbr\u003eI dived headlong into a quest for my own meaningful and purposeful life.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not saying it was easy. I have many passions.\u003cbr\u003eIt felt hard to put all of the pieces I was passionate about together in a business that not only made me money, but fulfilled my sacred calling - the activist within that deeply desires to change the world\u2026starting with MY inner world.\u003cbr\u003eMy work felt meaningless.\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a difference and I didn\u2019t feel that I was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eDo you have a secret like I did?\u003c/h4\u003eI kept trying to make businesses work, but it was always someone else\u2019s system or way. I desired to create my own thing and the huge talent I have with astrology was tucked away, neat and \u2018nice\u2019, because I thought I had to have a degree or some kind of certification to share it with people, let alone charge for it.\u003cbr\u003eThen all of that changed. I discovered my power and passion had been there all along. I had been studying astrology for 25 years, but back then I didn\u2019t have faith in myself. I didn\u2019t even know that you could do this kind of work as a business. I hired mentors and coaches to guide me. Then my long time passion for Native American Shamanism and Indigenous peoples found it\u2019s way back to me and I undertook a year long Shamanic Training. Now I magically and alchemically mix them to create healing, purpose and meaning.\u003cbr\u003eGradually it all came together. As it can for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"200\" src=\"https://louiseedington.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/print_Louise-Edington-5107-Edit-300x200.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; float: left;\" width=\"300\"\u003eNow who am I?\u003cbr\u003eA connector, I connect to YOU deeply whether we meet in person or not. I see you and I hear you and I create very real and long lasting connections.\u003cbr\u003eHighly intuitive and empathic with insights that come through me not from me.\u003cbr\u003eI see the whole picture of you and your life.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an ass kicker and truth teller. I will likely make you cry because you are so seen and heard, but tears heal and I am right there, loving you through it.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a rebel and an activist. I want a world where EVERYONE is equal and where we have peace. Yes, an idealist - and what the heck is wrong with that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"225\" src=\"https://louiseedington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5130-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; float: left;\" width=\"300\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"300\" src=\"https://louiseedington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_1513-225x300.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; float: left;\" width=\"225\"\u003eYes, that\u2019s me with Bernie and Jane Sanders behind me. And me at the DNC where I was a National Delegate for Bernie and we did a silent sit down protest in the media tent.\u003cbr\u003eIncidentally, this was my first federal election as a New Citizen. I tend not to do things by halves.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve actually lived on three continents and five countries. Yeah, I like to travel too.\u003cbr\u003eMy lovely husband and I love going to rock concerts. I get pretty wild. In fact I am still feeling some pain from a fall after we went to see \u003cimg height=\"225\" src=\"https://louiseedington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5385-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 15px; float: right;\" width=\"300\"\u003eMotley Crue on their last tour in Vegas. Alcohol may have been involved. I never want to grow up! Yes, that\u2019s us at that fateful gig.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a mother figure, real and welcoming yet practical and true.\u003cbr\u003eI am Sagittarius. But, more than that, I have four planets in Sagittarius plus Ascendant. This means I am Sagittarius in spades, optimistic, freedom seeking, and constantly seeking my truth.\u003cbr\u003eI have a ridiculously large book collection and am always studying something new. I studied American Studies with study of religion in college and my favorite areas of study were Native American art and literature and philosophy. Really can\u2019t get more Sadgie than that!!!.\u003cbr\u003eI am a traveler, student and philosopher at my core and astrology is a form of philosophy for me.\u003cbr\u003eI wonder and I wander\u003cbr\u003eI have a really, really strong Saturn in Capricorn in the First House. Though not my ascendant he is strong enough to temper the excesses of Sagittarius so let\u0027s look at how he tempers.\u00a0 The ascendant is the mask we present to the world. It\u2019s our receptionist, if you like, and it\u2019s through this sign that we express ourselves. Saturn in Capricorn means that I am seen and hide behind the mask of the hermit, the authority figure. I am seen as dependable and ambitious. And of course, I am.\u003cbr\u003eMy Moon is in Gemini and this means I have the soul of a teacher and storyteller. I like to teach and I also like to write.\u003cbr\u003eI also have a ton of Scorpio energy in my chart. I am a Shaman. I like the dark, deep murky places. I am not afraid to hold the space when you go to your dark places. I am fascinated with death, depression and metaphysics.\u003cbr\u003eI am a loyal and faithful partner in life to my fabulous husband Chaz, who is also a Sadg. We move, a lot. We have some amazingly strong connections between our charts. He\u2019s the love of my life and that Venus in Scorpio is loyal to a fault when I find the one \u003cimg src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/svg/1f642.svg\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.07em !important; height: 1em !important; width: 1em !important;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"225\" src=\"https://louiseedington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_1261-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; float: left;\" width=\"300\"\u003eI have two amazing and unique daughters. A Scorpio who has Sagittarius Moon conjunct Pluto and a Cancer with Aquarian Moon conjunct Uranus. They are both highly unique and brilliant yet did really badly at school. They are indigo children. The youngest is Wiccan and loves the Tarot. The family all love Star Wars, we even have a cardboard storm trooper in our hallway. He\u2019s guarding the front door lol.\u003cbr\u003eOur home is full of Sadgie optimism and Scorpio depth. And we are deeply connected as a family.\u003cbr\u003eSo, there you have it. A taste of me and my family. But here\u2019s a few fun facts also.\u003cbr\u003eI love Spaghetti Bolognese. I would eat it every day if I could.\u003cbr\u003eFavorite movies include The Godfather parts 1 and 2, Bladerunner, Apocalypse Now and Dirty Dancing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"251\" src=\"https://louiseedington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5045.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; float: left;\" width=\"196\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"225\" src=\"https://louiseedington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5202-1-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; float: left;\" width=\"300\"\u003eI may have been known to speak in public occasionally. The pic on the left is me speaking at an event in Park City and the one on the right is me kicking off a Love Rally at the SLC Capitol building. With the media\u2019s camera\u2019s on me no less.\u003cbr\u003eI actually used to be terrified of Public Speaking. Just so you know how much things can change when you make a different choice in life.\u003cbr\u003eAnd I would like to know YOU. I truly love to get to know clients and followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be so very grateful if you could support my work. I promise to give extreme value in return \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay Free\u003cbr\u003eLouise\u003cbr\u003e"
