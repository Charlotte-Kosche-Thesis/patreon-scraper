    "summary": "First of all, whether you decide to donate or not, thank you for at least checking out my Patreon page. And then an extra thank you to those of you who decide to help me out, be it a large donation or small, thank you. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI find it very difficult to write these kinds of things, I have written, deleted, and rewritten this About Me section a few times already, but I will give it a shot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI moved to Finland in 2013 as I had met a Finn and fallen madly in love with her, and it was the best decision of my life. Luckily, I got a decent job rather quickly. It wasn\u0027t anything glamourous, but it was the most stable and high paying job I had ever had. Things were great for us for a long time and I asked her to marry me, to which she said yes. Unfortunately, I was laid off. My contract ended when they were looking to downsize... something to do with Russia and exports and a bunch of bullshit... but the end result was the same. I lost my job. And we had a kid on the way... great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went to a day school after that, an \"Induction Course\" of sorts, where I (almost) learned to speak Swedish (we live in a Swedish speaking region of the country)... however, my language skills are still not that strong, and since that course has ended, I have been unable to find work again as every place I apply to has the requirement that I speak fluent swedish (or fluent swedish AND finnish)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while looking after our newborn son, Logan, I had a lot of free time on my hands. I\u0027ve always been an avid gamer, so I decided to try doing this youtube thing again (I had a couple dozen or so videos of Minecraft before I moved to Finland), and while I am still small, I am very proud of what I have created so far. I love recording, and despite the meagre payout I get from youtube (thanks adpocalypse/demonetisationgate), I want to continue it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now we find ourselves in the present. As I write this, I am about to breach 2,000 subscribers, and that is something I scarcely believed would be attainable when I started.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few things I would love to do to improve the content, but currently I am not in the financial position to be able to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, while my PC is not bad, it was not built with the games I play in mind, nor was streaming and recording a consideration when I built it. The problem is the CPU, I currently have an FX 8350 (overclocked), and while on a price:performance scale, it is pretty good, for what I want to do, it really isn\u0027t the CPU of choice when you play CPU bound games and your I would love to be able to upgrade it (and hey, maybe even record the build process?) and with that I would be able to stream more and have more stream integrations than are currently possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI think most importantly though, is the ability to put my son into part time daycare, this would leave me with some free time to do some more recording, record and stream without the possibility that my son wakes up from his nap and starts screaming, as right now the only time I have to record that won\u0027t be interrupted is when he is asleep... and as he is not even 2 years old yet, that happens far less infrequently than is ideal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, that\u0027s my story, that\u0027s why I have a patreon and that is why I am requesting the help of you lovely folks. Whether you decide that you want to help me out or not, I want to thank you very much, from the bottom of my heart, for taking the time to read this, for watching my videos, and for being an awesome individual.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
