    "summary": "I fell in love with writing and blogging while working in a women\u0027s rehab in Brazil. It was there that God birthed the desire in my heart to write about my struggles with depression, addiction, and fear to in turn give hope to the hopeless. I was sitting outside absorbing the luscious flora and fauna\u2014sun shining, birds singing, flowers blooming\u2014and I thought, \u201cWhat a beautiful day You have given me God. I am so blessed by You. Life is beautiful. Beauty-full. Full of Your beauty. \u201d\u003cbr\u003eI then remembered a time when my life was not so beauty-full. A time when it was full of destruction, chaos, pain, addiction, isolation. When Depression and Fear were my constant companions. It was on that sunshiny day that God birthed the blog in my heart. Lifeisbeauty-full.com. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to reach the one person surfing the web at 2am looking for anything to distract them and help them escape from their life; because that was me. I want to reach the ones who are just like I was. I want to say, \"Me too. Addiction, depression, sexual trauma, isolation, unsafe eating habits, product of divorce, severe emotional suppression and wounding; me too. I\u0027ve been there. I was a\u00a0prisoner in my own life thinking there was no way out.\u00a0I was living in the chaos and destruction I created for myself, from one drink to the next.\"\u00a0 But I also want to tell them The Truth. There is a way out. There is hope, peace, freedom, and true joy. The way out is up. His\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0name is Jesus Christ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis world gives us many reasons to doubt God\u0027s goodness. But if you take a second look, life is teeming with His beauty. LifeIsBeauty-full.com. Finding His beauty in a fallen world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
