I started\nout as a \"Keyboard Warrior\" while still part of the working world as\nan IT guy. I hate to admit I worked in the square mile [Lonon] for a few months (and\nsaw the stock market crash as well.) I cover various topics ranging from human\nrights to environmental issues, basically anything that threatens life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel\nit is my duty as a member of our planet and a conscious being to take measures\nto alleviate the situation that capitalism has caused [namely the distinct\npossibility that we may be facing the sixth mass Extinction Level Event.] I\u0027m but\none person, but one person can inform others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI create videos, livestreams, documentaries, pictures and commentary on a wide\nrange of topics, as well as posts ranging from outbursts to philosophical\nmusings. My main focus of the past... year... has been fracking \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople say they like my voice, and thank me for the effort I put into this\ncalling. I like to think my views are rational and based in a place of common\nsense. Patreon is a way that people can say thank you for the time and effort\nand help me bring original material to them, it is a way that I can give back as\nwell by engaging with people who follow my work. I am not totally comfortble singning but maybe people vote for me to do just that, or talk about something off topic perhaps. I don\u0027 know where my Patreons will take me with the weekly and monthly engagments but I hope it\u0027s fun.\u003cbr\u003e"
