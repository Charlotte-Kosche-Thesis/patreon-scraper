Patreon is a platform where you can pledge to support us monthly (any amount that works for you) and you\u0027ll be able to receive special access to behind the scenes content, updates, contribute ideas, (if there are video concepts that you\u0027d like to see us work on) and be a part of an exclusive supporter community. You don\u0027t HAVE to contribute to us in this way, just being a fan and checking out our videos is already more than we can ask for, but if you\u0027re really passionate about our work and love the content that you see here and feel that it adds value to your daily life, this is another way for you to support us. With more support from platforms like Patreon, we should be able to continue on with Lucky Crit and potentially even produce more high quality content at a steadier pace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question. Making videos at the quality that we strive for is time consuming and work intensive. We love making them, but it\u0027s not sustainable off of YouTube ad revenue alone, especially during this year\u0027s YouTube Adpocalypse situation (\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/ytadpocalypse\"\u003einfo about this here\u003c/a\u003e). Let\u0027s jump back in time a bit. This channel began in April 2016, and in that same month Stevie was laid off from his job. Instead of diving right back into the job market and looking for something else, he really wanted to create something of his own and spend his days working on something he could be truly passionate about. With the help of close friends, Lucky Crit was born. He then proceeded to spend most of the following year attempting to make YouTube work full-time. It\u0027s not something we\u0027d recommend. Starting off on YouTube takes quite a while to get the ball rolling and really earn back what you\u0027re putting into it. He\u0027s now picked up a part-time job and may seek other forms of employment moving forward, and that could potentially effect the content for the time being, until a day comes where Lucky Crit earns enough to fill that void. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not all about the money though, as we would have produced the type of content that we wanted to see on YouTube regardless, but the dream of creating a business and brand out of Lucky Crit continues to entice and excite us. Patreon presents a way to help realize this dream, and in an even better manner than the ad revenue from YouTube. With YouTube, we earn money on our videos when advertisers slap their ads on them for viewers to see, in the hopes that people will watch them and potentially buy their products or utilize their services. With Patreon you can just support us directly and cut out the middle man trying to sell you their stuff you\u0027re probably not interested in. With time and support perhaps we can lessen these ads on our content and be more independent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Lucky Crit?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe term \"Lucky Crit\" was derived from the hours Stevie and friends spent playing videogames like Fire Emblem and other RPGs where characters can occasionally perform critical hits. Fire Emblem, in particular, serves as a fairly exciting and interesting purveyor of this phenomenon. You may often find yourself in tight situations where your beloved characters may die, until lady luck shines upon them and provides them with a lucky crit, decimating the enemy. These emotionally exciting clutch moments are some of the best that the series can provide. Cam and Stevie thought this name would fit their brand of content (and the RPG genre in general) nicely. They came up with many show concepts like Armory, Reflex, Hit Chance, and even a podcast concept, though these are still works in progress and there is more to Lucky Crit than just these content series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027re About\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a certain beauty to the feeling of nostalgia, and we seek to provide that. Born in 1992 we were a bit late to the NES and SNES party, and some of our first forays into the videogame world were with the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance. Many of these games we grew up with are shining aspects of these consoles and videogames in general, and helped excite and inspire kids and young adults all around the world. Unfortunately though, many of these games, like Advance Wars and Golden Sun, are also now just distant memories. Today\u0027s video game market can be pretty sparse at times and doesn\u0027t always fulfill our desires as well as these old games did. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time passes these games become closer and closer to \"retro,\" and since \neveryone else concerned with \"retro\" is busy talking about the NES era and THIS is the era we \nknow and love, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll focus on. We want to bring back the love and excitement for some of these older games, and potentially showcase them to a new generation of players that will enjoy them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, that\u0027s not all we\u0027d like to do, but there\u0027s the \"retro\" part that we want to harken back to. Releases like Fire Emblem Echoes \u0026amp; other game series are exciting for us too, and we\u0027ve begun developing a niche of the YouTube and internet community for our take on these games as well. Mobile games like Fire Emblem Heroes and Pokemon GO also excite us and provide us numerous ways to get out and develop more fun content as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFire Emblem has been one of our all-time favorite game series, so the channel will always have a heavy focus on these games, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eIn short, it\u0027s these concepts that we\u0027re passionate about, and when you\u0027re really passionate about something, you put 110% into it (and it shows).\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re hungry for more content like we make now, or have ideas you\u0027d love to see us work on, please consider supporting us through Patreon. We are looking forward to speaking with you a little bit closer to one on one. Thank you so much for supporting us thus far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

With increased funding we\u0027ll be able to deal with life matters more easily and knock expenses out of the way, providing us with more time and space to continue creating better and better content for you to enjoy. Lucky Crit is not currently a full time gig, and while that\u0027s nothing for you to have to worry about, it\u0027s a dream worth pursuing as far as we\u0027re concerned. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust watching our content is more than enough support than we could ever hope for, but for those of you who have supported us here on Patreon, thank you so much for the love and I hope to continue interacting with you on a closer level, as well as producing more exclusive content and making stuff that you guys are super excited about as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e",
