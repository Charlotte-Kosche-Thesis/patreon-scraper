    "summary": "Nobody here will know me, at least I hope so because, if that\u0027s the case, then I\u0027ve been doing my job right. \u003cbr\u003eSince 2010 I\u0027ve done a lot of work for a certain evil genius called \u003cstrong\u003eAkabur\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027ve been his editor, game-tester, legal advisor, PR-manager, advertising expert, lawyer and (I hope) a good buddy, but my most important job for him has always been checking and re-checking his texts, fixing grammar, adding missing words (especially articles, as their rules remain a mystery to most russians forever), rewriting weirdly worded or unfitting passages, connecting sentences, fixing typos, replacing unfitting terms, deciphering garbled, semi-english lines and so on.\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t have the intention to make an account here, but after a couple of weeks filled with mails from the Maestro in which he urged me to make one already I gave in. The funny thing about that is that originally it was me who annoyed him for weeks about making an account here, back when he was still a starving artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the work for the Maestro, I also help his Friend \u003cstrong\u003eSmersh \u003c/strong\u003eout with \u003cstrong\u003eBHB\u003c/strong\u003e, I do pretty much the same that I do for Akabur for him, except that the BHB texts usually take a lot more time, work and re-writing as they have to be translated from russian to English first before I can make readable english out of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also started working with \u003cstrong\u003eLoganID\u003c/strong\u003e, whom most of you will probably know from his game \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dark Lord\u0027s Trip\u003c/strong\u003e (and those of you who don\u0027t should check it out ASAP).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon says that I should be telling you people here why you should support me, well, that\u0027s a very good question because I can offer you nothing that I do not already give you.\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t really show you anything of my work because I wouldn\u0027t want to release spoilers of the Maestro\u0027s creations after he worked so hard on them.\u003cbr\u003eThe problem with being Batman is that even though you spend hours on your job, people will or at least should never know, because an editor is only ever noticed when he fucks up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo none of the money you give me here can be compensated by me, all I do is sacrifice a couple of hours every week (and sometimes more than a couple when something like BHB knocks on my door) to polish the rough diamonds the Maestro gives me, I work through the night if I have to (finishing the remastered version of BHB took me until 5 in the morning) and do what I can to help a good buddy out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a poor student who studies english and latin to become a teacher someday, so the money I receive here will probably go towards school books, food, my gym membership and rent, since that\u0027s pretty much all I spend money on nowadays. So basically, it\u0027ll help me survive and stay fit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent goal: Paying the rent with patreon money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUseful Links:\u003cbr\u003eAkabur\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027s works can all be found on:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.test.akabur.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.test.akabur.com/\u003c/a\u003e (on the right)\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the \"galleries\" section you can also find his drawings, a simpler alternative for that is probably his hentaifoundry account:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/RUBAKA/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehentai-foundry.com/user/RUBAKA/profile\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIf you want to see the newest version of BHB check out \u003cstrong\u003eSmersh\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Smersh\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/Smersh\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor The Dark Lords\u0027s Trip \u003cstrong\u003eLogan \u003c/strong\u003eis your man:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/logan\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/logan\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
