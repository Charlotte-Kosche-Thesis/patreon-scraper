By becoming a Patreon patron, you would be investing in supplies for the show, expanding my knowledge for the art of magic, as well as helping me pay for different ways of marketing my show and services. I hope my magic provides better quality of life to anyone and everyone who tunes in. With that being said, I hope to hear from my fans and patrons in the not-so-distant future, and I want to thank anyone who helps support my dream of doing magic full-time so I can continue to make content that inspires wonder and awe.\u003cbr\u003eHave a wonderful day!\u00a0"
