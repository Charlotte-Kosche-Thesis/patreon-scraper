    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Loonride?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLoonride is a website filled with coding tutorials and videos where you can learn how to make popular games. Loonride also offers online games and essential tools for 2D game development. As a creator, I use Loonride to show off my projects and turn them into learning experiences for others. You can find my tutorials and creations on the \u003ca href=\"https://loonride.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLoonride Website\u003c/a\u003e and on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOMoPihYOcUZn9cs9OMFhEw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLoonride YouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Makes Loonride different?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most unique aspect of Loonride that I am building is the \"Popular Game Clones\" theme. In 2017, I created a successful tutorial series called \u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow to make Slither.io with JavaScript\u003c/a\u003e. I think that learning about game development is most engaging if you learn how to create something that piqued your curiosity when you first saw it. By writing tutorials and making videos about popular games, I hope to engage a massive community of aspiring game developers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I contribute?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI created a Patreon page for Loonride because I want to create what the community wants. Any contribution you give, no matter how small, will help in giving me the time, motivation, and financial resources to continue creating.\u003cbr\u003eIf you contribute, you will become an influential part of the Loonride community. I want to know your ideas for the future of Loonride, and contributing is the best way to make yourself heard. Communication is key in building a community, so I will strive to talk to you on social media, YouTube, Discord, and my newly created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://loonride.com/learn/blog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLoonride Blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution could benefit you directly. I am making many advertisement opportunities available to my patrons on the Loonride website, including image ads on tutorial pages and links to your games from the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://loonride.com/games\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egames section\u003c/a\u003e of my website. If you don\u0027t see a reward tier that is useful to you, I welcome you to propose your own reward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs Loonride a big, popular company?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLoonride is a one-man show. I am telling you this because I want to be completely transparent with my community. I wish that Loonride could be more than just my side-project, and you can help me get there with your contribution.\u00a0This Patreon page was created in January of 2018, so I am just starting off when it comes to getting contributors. I hope this shows that you can really make a difference in Loonride\u0027s evolution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn case I haven\u0027t said it enough already, every contribution means so much to me. If you choose not to contribute, you can still be a part of the Loonride community. Feel free to talk to me on Twitter or the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/Sfbg2Sh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLoonride Discord\u003c/a\u003e, subscribe to the Loonride mailing list, and stay tuned for more Loonride tutorials and blog posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
