My name is Lazyboy and I\u00a0am a\u00a0variety twitch streamer/Youtuber, who has become known to make funny and hilarious\u00a0streams on Twitch and videos on YouTube. I love playing video games, watching movies, reading comics/manga, and other geeky/nerdy stuff. I love watching D\u0026amp;D be played and other role-playing\u00a0games. Don\u0027t have friends to play D\u0026amp;D with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wr_Jgrv_nGI\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWell\u00a0as of right now I am a very small streamer/YouTuber who has come into a situation where I can not find a job or catch a break and I love streaming and making funny content for my fans/viewers, but as of right now I am in need of funding. As much as I would love to keep streaming and making funny videos for you guys and the world to see. It is just not possible without proper funding to do so. So I was given a great idea by a family member \"why don\u0027t\u00a0you create a patreon page\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhere Do I Come In?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eGood question and you guys come in as the funding. I have tried reaching out to Twitch for a partnership and to sponsorships but no one wants to touch someone that doesn\u2019t have or barely have an audience. So if guys could consider supporting me just \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003eOne Dollar\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (or more) a month then that would get me the funding I would need to be able to make the streams and Youtube videos I love to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat Do I Get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWell If you take a quick look at the rewards, you will see I have\u00a0several rewards for my patreons. I am going to start making videos that will be available\u00a0to patreons\u00a0a week early in advance from the rest of the world. I am also making YouTube Videos and content that is patreon only. I want to do more for my patreons but I can\u0027t because of limited funding. You also will get some limited edition merch and art for \u003cstrong\u003e\"PATREONS ONLY\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat If...I Don\u0027t Want To\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eThat is fine too. You can continue to watch my live\u00a0streams and YouTube Videos as you please. My audience is what keeps me going and making streams and YouTube videos.
