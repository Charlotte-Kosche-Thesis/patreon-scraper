I create material and drawings on sexual health and radical menstruation outside of imposed cisheteronormativity. I make zines. I create written and visual material on misandrist feminism that centers and honors femmes + women thriving and resisting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create MORE. I want to write more. I want to produce more videos. I want to fundraise to provide free/open videos and articles specially around yerbeteria in spanish. I want to write Queer Post Apocalyptic Erotica. I want to blog about nerdy sex health stuff. I want to share medicinal preparations. I want to write about abuelita knowledge and herbal medicine. I want to talk about my garden, plants and seed. I want to do vblogs on settler tourism, on destroying the cisheteropatriarchy, on menstrual blood, on chihuahuas and pretty much about everything! This is where you come in.
