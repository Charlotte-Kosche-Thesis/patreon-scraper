On my channel, I explore the many wolds of live action role play and document the adventures the take me on. Also on my channel are videos featuring content about larp combat, costuming, roleplay and even a few DIY spells/rituals. I have a lot of fun making videos and deeply appreciate being able to continue to create content about larp. Larp has taught me so much about myself, and I hope to introduce more to the amazing worlds larp has to offer. As I trek the wilds for breasts to slay, I also believe in the power of larp for therapy and used as organic storytelling art. Thank you for all of the support. I hope that one day you will join me and my companions on the battlefield.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fbed1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/30123877_1227698914029630_1793285241356419072_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=1f10bf86b861ec0daa503679eaad9fce\u0026amp;oe=5B9BF2F2\" style=\"width: 429px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nOther Important Links\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/LGREQUEST\"\u003eRequest Larp Girl at your larp!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/kazaspeaks\"\u003eRequest Kaza Marie as a guest speaker.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ko-fi.com/kazamarie\"\u003eHelp fund upcoming larp adventures!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2AHWYXNZSYTF7/ref=cm_sw_su_w\"\u003eDonate supplies for upcoming video projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fbed1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31171399_1238502542949267_4972918632314044416_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=3570414e3b52940ac5d6254294d7fcf5\u0026amp;oe=5B5C45AD\" style=\"width: 356px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is LARP?\u003c/strong\u003e LARP is short for Live Action Role Play. It can be improvisational theater mixed with an evil horde of undead attacking your town! Generally I describe it as any time you remove yourself from a role you are used to and play as something or someone else. This can be similar to when you were little and played tea party or house with your friends. It can also be when you put on elf ears and fight off an orc with a magical sword. Larp can be very fun, full of combat, but it can also be an emotional experience that you wouldn\u0027t get to test in your every day life. For me, LARPing is a safe place to try new things. There are players around you with their own stories and usually a game master designing scenarios for you to encounter. Unlike Dungeons and Dragons where you roll the dice, you get to actually swing the swords at LARP. Typical LARP Genres are: Fantasy, Sci-fi, Post apocalypse, with so many more in-between.\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fbed1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/30727889_1234407293358792_8672031732221870080_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=dba1ac708dc5a028798ebb2d53a41bbe\u0026amp;oe=5B53188A\" style=\"width: 431px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLARP can teach us many things about ourselves and others. As Larp Girl, I\u0027ll be your battlebuddy, and guide you through these amazing journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take a moment to give thanks to the people of the Larp Girl Patreon.

     "description": "Travel expenses, crafting supplies, equipment and video editing time are a major contributors to the cost of making a video. I spend hours finding the cheapest ways to make quality content. For years, I have been paying for this out of pocket and have barely been getting by. Within the larp community, many larps do not have the budget to help with these costs. I am hoping with the love and support of patrons, I can balance out some of these costs. If we are able to reach our goal, I can take away more time to focus on creating videos. With this budget I can even afford to dive into harder projects and demonstrate more\u00a0 of live action role play.",
