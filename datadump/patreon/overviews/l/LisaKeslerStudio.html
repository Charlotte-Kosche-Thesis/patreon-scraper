    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome To My Studio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for visiting my Patreon page. I am a painter,\nprintmaker, and illustrator. I aim to create new editions of hand-carved\nlinoleum block prints every month. I print them by hand or use my vintage\nletterpress. Some of the images I print become illustrations and some are fine\nart prints that I sell online and in person. I also love to share what I know by teaching workshops in different printmaking techniques.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSee more samples of my work on my website:\u003ca href=\"http://www.lisakesler.com\"\u003e www.lisakesler.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eand on my Facebook page:\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/LisaKeslerStudio\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/LisaKeslerStudio\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have degrees in painting and illustration and have worked\nas an art professional for many, many years. My studio practice isn\u2019t just my\njob, it\u2019s my identity and my way of life. My work reflects who I am today and\nalso embraces all of the places I\u2019ve lived, cultures I\u2019ve experienced, and\npeople I\u2019ve known. As a graduate student in illustration, I learned many of the\ndigital techniques I use in some of my illustration work today. But I am also\npassionate about the importance of preserving the traditional, non-digital\nprinting, drawing, and painting techniques that seem to be slowly fading from\nour culture. When the \u201chand of the maker\u201d is visible in a work of art, it\ncreates a unique and special connection between the artist and the viewer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to create a similar connection between my studio and\nmy collectors so I have created this page where my past clients and collectors, and people who are just being introduced to my work for the first time, can\nbecome actively involved in my process by subscribing to brand new editions of my original linoleum block prints. Monthly donations from\nsubscribers will provide funds to help with the overhead of operating a\nfull-time art studio, purchasing supplies, and maintaining equipment. It will\nalso allow me to be able to spend a few hours each week experimenting and\ndeveloping new ideas and techniques, which is an essential part of the creative\nprocess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen You Subscribe\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a contributor to my studio practice, you will be able to\nsee updates and images of my creative process directly from my studio. From\ntime to time I may also post tutorials on various techniques and helpful\ninformation about materials and resources. There may even be discounts on the\nart in my online shop at different times throughout the year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a subscriber at the \u003cem\u003eMini\nArt Print of the Month\u003c/em\u003e level, the \u003cem\u003eBi-Monthly\nArt Print\u003c/em\u003e level, the \u003cem\u003eQuarterly Art\nPrint\u003c/em\u003e level, or the \u003cem\u003eAll of the Above\u003c/em\u003e\nlevel, you will receive a shipment of new linoleum block prints from me at\nregular intervals throughout the year.

At this point in time, Patreon hasn\u0027t added a \"gift\" feature yet, but you can still give a subscription as a gift like this: Enter your own information as the subscriber, including your OWN address as the shipping location. (The shipping address must be the same as the subscriber\u0027s address.) \u003cem\u003eTHEN, \u003c/em\u003esend me a message (message icon in the upper right corner of the page) and tell me the name and shipping address of the person you\u0027d like me to send the rewards to. Easy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for showing your support by your generous donation/subscription. It means that you believe in the work I\u0027m doing and want to be an important part of the process. You are awesome!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
