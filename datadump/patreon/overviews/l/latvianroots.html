Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Latvian genealogy would be such an in-demand niche that I would be able to make a career out of, but it is, and I am so thankful that I can combine all of my interests into something amazing like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA year ago, I made the move to Latvia, to concentrate on genealogy and associated work full-time, and it has been wonderful! I am so happy that I am able to do this work as a career, and help people connect with their Latvian roots, long-lost relatives and ancestral homes and significant locations. But between the client work, genealogy courses and the work I do with the \u003ca href=\"http://www.lapamuzejs.lv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLatvians Abroad Museum and Research Centre\u003c/a\u003e, I haven\u0027t been able to devote myself to the Discovering Latvian Roots blog as much as I would like to - and I really would like to, considering it was what launched me on this journey in the first place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve committed myself to getting back to blogging, and I hope that you can help! I learned about Patreon by way of one of my favourite musicians, \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/peterhollens\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePeter Hollens\u003c/a\u003e, and it seemed like a fantastic way to continue to grow my genealogy projects, re-commit to my blog and create more new content for my website! See below for the new publishing schedule that I am committing to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the blog posts and the additions to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.celmina.com/surnames\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLatvian Surname Project\u003c/a\u003e, I am also working on genealogy-related board and card games, fiction and non-fiction!\u00a0 You can read my short story \"A President For His Country\" featuring my genealogist/private investigator lead character Aila Rudzite on my \u003ca href=\"http://www.celmina.com/fiction\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efiction site\u003c/a\u003e, and also find out about my upcoming novel \"Sailor in the Civil War\", and soon there will also be emerging details on an as-of-yet untitled novel that will involve the Faberge eggs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has a very simple premise: You pledge a certain amount of money, either per creation or per month. In my case, because of the format of my work - lots of smaller creations and some creations that are difficult to quantify - I\u0027ve chosen the monthly option. This means that by choosing to pledge, you will be charged that amount every month as long as you want to take part - this is important to note! Patreon is ongoing, rather than a one-time contribution on a site like Kickstarter. In return, you get all sorts of goodies on a regular basis!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kind of goodies are available? Well, besides a hearty THANK YOU! to everyone who decides to pledge, each level of pledge comes with its own rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 per month...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Insider news! This means that you will have access to the Patreon-only stream that announces my new projects - books, games, etc. - before the rest of the world sees them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5 per month...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Insider news!\u003cbr\u003e-BMD weekly newsletter! - Every Saturday you will receive a newsletter dealing with Latvian BMD (birth, marriage, death) records. This patron level will get you a weekly newsletter that will have one birth record, one marriage record and one death record, with full translations and analysis of each one. Since this is a monthly Patreon campaign, you will be charged on the first of the month, and then the first newsletter you will receive will then be on the first Saturday of the month (first newsletter will go out July 4th!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10 per month...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Insider news!\u003cbr\u003e-BMD weekly newsletter!\u003cbr\u003e-Bonus record weekly newsletter! - Every Saturday you will receive a supplementary newsletter which will also have translations and analysis of one Revision List record and one 1897 Census record. Since this is a monthly Patreon campaign, you will be charged on the \nfirst of the month, and then the first newsletter you will receive will\nbe on the first Saturday of the month (first newsletter will go out July\n 4th!).\u003cbr\u003e-In addition, you also get to submit ideas for blog posts you would like to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$25 per month...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Insider news!\u003cbr\u003e-BMD weekly newsletter!\u003cbr\u003e-Bonus record weekly newsletter!\u003cbr\u003e-Submit ideas!\u003cbr\u003e-Submit records for the newsletter! - Have some tough records that you just can\u0027t translate? Submit them to the newsletter and they will be included there, with full translations and analysis!\u003cbr\u003e-Once the $250 milestone level is reached, you will also be able to request cemeteries for me to visit!\u003cbr\u003e-Access to print-and-play games - I\u0027m working on a variety of games at \nthe moment! Educational and fun, they will help you learn about Latvian \nhistory, genealogy and geography. By sponsoring at this level, when I \nrelease a new game, you will receive a PDF with the game, that you can \nthen download and print at your leisure. Eventually I hope that this \npatron level will also receive discount codes for ordering \nprofessionally-printed copies of the games (this will be subject to \navailability by the game publisher I am considering).\u003cbr\u003e-Access to \nebooks - There are a lot of ebooks forthcoming! In addition to the \nfiction I am working on, there will also be non-fiction books, including\n different types of how-to guides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$50 per month...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Insider news!\u003cbr\u003e-BMD weekly newsletter!\u003cbr\u003e-Bonus record weekly newsletter!\u003cbr\u003e-Submit ideas!\u003cbr\u003e-Submit records!\u003cbr\u003e-Request cemeteries!\u003cbr\u003e-Access to print-and-play games!\u003cbr\u003e-Access to ebooks!\u003cbr\u003e-GENEALOGY COACHING! If you pledge at this level, you will also be able to join my Latvian Genealogy Coaching program. This isn\u0027t one of my structured courses, but you will be able to join a private group with other coaching participants, where I will provide advice and answer questions, help you formulate your research plans and get your research off the ground. You will also be able to benefit from an hour of private one-to-one live coaching with me each month, to take place on Skype.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$100 per month...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Insider news!\u003cbr\u003e-BMD weekly newsletter!\u003cbr\u003e-Bonus record weekly newsletter!\u003cbr\u003e-Submit ideas!\u003cbr\u003e-Submit records!\u003cbr\u003e-Request cemeteries!\u003cbr\u003e-Access to print-and-play games!\u003cbr\u003e-Access to ebooks!\u003cbr\u003e-Genealogy coaching!\u003cbr\u003e-One-Name or One-Place Study! - If there is a Latvian surname or location that you want to have a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-name_study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne-Name\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://one-place-studies.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne-Place\u003c/a\u003e study for, but you don\u0027t have the time/experience/web skills to run it yourself, then I can help out with that! With this level, I will set up a one-name or one-place study for you, and spend some time every month that you\u0027re a patron working on improving it. I will host it on my website, so you don\u0027t even need to worry about that! (If you want it hosted on a unique domain, we can also discuss that.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf your financial circumstances change, you can always stop your pledge.
