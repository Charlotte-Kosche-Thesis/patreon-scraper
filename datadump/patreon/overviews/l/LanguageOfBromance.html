    "summary": "Proof that an idea can come to fruition even years after a conversation comes The Language of Bromance. A show that comes from the brains of Richard and Shawn. \u00a0A weekly comedy podcast that releases every Sunday. Richard a self confessed geek that has spent more time huddled around his dungeons and dragons books than seeing the sun talks with his friend Shawn. Shawn, who has a love of horror movies that rivals some of his relationships, is the willing copilot on this ship of fools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether they formed the podcast called The Language of Bromance and from there it has been nothing but fun. The duo laugh about things they go through, stories in the news and even getting serious discussing net neutrality along with other issues. Every so often their friendship turns to a bitter rivalry with their nerdiest creation the draft episodes. An original take on a best of or a top 10 list. The draft episodes are done like an NFL Draft 7 rounds where Richard and Shawn flip flop picks on various topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bromance team want build a community of people that are creators and encourage people to use their perspective and story to entertain or even change lives. Everyone has a story and everyone has a contribution to make to the world. This show and everything that Richard and Shawn do only serve the notion that we all can do something. Your story has value and you perspective is unique from anyone in the world, go share your story.\u003cbr\u003e"
