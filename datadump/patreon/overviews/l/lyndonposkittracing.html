We\u0027ve already been able to remove adverts and make longer episodes of my regular series Races to Places with the Patreon support we have to date. \u00a0However, the project is always evolving with new ideas we are trying hard to catch up with editing so that we can share more real-time going forwards and to be able to do this we\n need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I (Lyndon) am the \u0027film crew\u0027, and the project has a single full time editor back in the UK working on each weekly episode (and occasional feature length \u0027specials\u0027). \u00a0As the project had evolves, the need for additional editors and out-sourcing of tasks has become more apparent and I cannot continue with the level of funding I had at the beginning. \u00a0The quality is always increasing and unfortunately along with it the costs. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe latest large project was the film \"Malle Moto - The Forgotten Dakar Story\" viewable here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/JjF_m99VAv8\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/JjF_m99VAv8\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0Despite high production costs, it was made free to view, just like all my other episodes and I want to continue to deliver free media but this is where you come in.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON26m_Mq2DI\u0026amp;list=PLebjQbsuu9jBz4-Ato5216RaxLpzyynvG\u0026amp;index=7\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIf you like what I do, you can help by voluntarily paying a small donation to the future of the project and in exchange I\u0027ll promise to use every penny to keep making the media that you tell me you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little help from many of you makes a huge difference to the project. \u00a0Thanks to all those who have already signed up and I hope you will consider doing the same. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
