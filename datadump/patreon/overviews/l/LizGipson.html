    "summary": "I have been hanging out on the warped side of yarn for most of my adult life, and I like nothing more than helping weavers weave better, happier, and with less worry and strife.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you probably first met me through my first book,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eWeaving Made Easy;\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0or maybe you stumbled upon my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.yarnworker.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYarnworker\u003c/a\u003e;\u00a0or you read my\u00a0\u003cem\u003eKnitty\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0column; or you took a workshop from me at your local yarn shop or fiber festival; or you follow me on Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube; or you read my newsletter. However you found me, I\u0027m glad you did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTechnology is a wonderful thing and it allows me to live where I live and for you to live where you live, and yet we can still hang out together and learn things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have a background weaving on many types of looms, the rigid-heddle loom is my muse. When you ask me a question, I give you specific answers tailored to this particular weaving journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create more content that speaks directly to the rigid-heddle weaver. First and foremost is to keep the weave-alongs going and to get them a bit more organized. (Not sure what that is all about? Check out the video.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hustle of finding the next good-paying gig keeps me from building the focused, quality experience I\u0027d like my readers to have. A little bit of monthly seed money will keep me in my studio and traveling less.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy big fat hairy, scary idea is to build an online weaving school.\u003c/strong\u003e A place where you can take classes, participate in weave-alongs, and pop in on seminars. How cool would that be?! I know many of you don\u0027t have access to a weaving instructor, nor can you travel to workshops. Let me offer you these resources right in the convenience of your own home without sacrificing that special community that is built when you gather together with weavers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying a new approach to this work and going directly to the source for support. I don\u0027t really want to start loading up my content with affiliate links or adding advertising to my YouTube videos. I\u0027d rather just ask you right up front to take a risk, pay a little bit each month, and let\u0027s grow this thing together.\u00a0For less than the cost of a workshop per year, you can help me help you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow about it? \u00a0Are you in? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep up on the latest happenings, check out this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://yarnworker.com/yarnworker-weave-alongs-and-school-faq/\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e page on my website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
