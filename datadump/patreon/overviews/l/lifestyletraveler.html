    "summary": "Hi English-speaking friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thanks for making your way into this page **HIGH FIVE** :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome background\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs you may or may not already know we\u0027ve decided to quit our \"more common\" lifestyle of Mon-Fri 9-5 routine to something we believe to be a better fit, and that\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003etraveling\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will start this new phase of our life with what we\u0027ve got at the moment: a motorcycle and some camping gears. As we don\u0027t have any savings we also had to figure out a way to pay the bike\u0027s expenses (insurance/petrol/maintenance), food and a place to sleep. Thanks to today\u0027s connected world we quickly found apps/websites that would get that sorted for us (eg. couch surfing) and so we thought to ourselves: \u003cstrong\u003ewe are all set!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is all this video making noise about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should come naturally the desire to document this \"once in a lifetime\" journey we find ourselves on board into and nowadays it\u0027s just so easy/cheap to do it in videos that it also felt like the obvious thing to do. That was the reason one for creating videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe we can all agree on the fact that we\u0027re in a privileged position in relation to many (many, many, many) other people in the world and being able to do what we are doing now put us in a even more privileged position.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem comes when people believe this privilege is directed linked with money giving up their dreams because of it and that\u0027s where the second reason for creating videos was born. We want to use this experience to inspire people to chase their own dreams and show them that the only thing between them and living their dreams is themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we making videos in Portuguese?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn reference to the \"privileged position\" topic we mentioned above, it\u0027s very common for us to have a friend or know someone that have traveled for a year or has done something similar and it\u0027s inspiring to hear those stories from people so close to us. That\u0027s not true when we think about the people we know back in Brazil and that\u0027s pretty much the reason behind the decision of making videos in Portuguese.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what are we doing at Patreon.com?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs noble as this whole thing might sound every time we talked to our non-Portuguese-speaking friends, they got upset as they won\u0027t be able to follow this adventure. That said, we thought it would be a good idea to ask you guys for support so that we can make it possible!\u003cbr\u003e"
