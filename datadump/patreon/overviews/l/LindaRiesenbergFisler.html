I\u0027m an award-winning author and artist who began writing when the first crayon was placed in my hand. I left my\u00a0day job to live a more creative life and it has been a hoot! I published the first book in the Blind Series in 2015, followed by two more books in 2016 and 2017. Right out of the gate, my first novel placed in three book competitions. I\u0027m currently writing the next trilogy in the series and editing the fourth book, which will be called \u003cem\u003eCloaked\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 This brings us to the mission and your objective should you choose to accept it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://blindseries.lindafisler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WhyOnPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2015, I\u0027ve been funding my writing/publishing efforts with money generated through art commissions\u00a0and teaching oil painting. Let\u0027s just say that is my cover--I\u0027m an artist, but my true identity is being an author. While I\u0027ve managed to publish the books (along with art instruction books too), build some assets (as in truly awesome super fans), and moved up through the ranks along the way, I find myself still largely on my own as an undercover spy usually does. I need to cultivate a better spy network to support the podcasts, editing, and publishing of the series, and that is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to give you an idea of the cost of this operation, I\u0027ll supply some of the necessary items for this mission. Monthly costs for producing a podcast (from the software needed to create it to hosting the podcast), keeping the websites up, software for book cover creation, software for creating the books, software for creating videos (podcast related and beyond), research, and creating propaganda (bookmarks, business cards, postcards, etc) for book signings typically adds up to over $250 a month. Travel on this mission has been limited (book signings/speaking engagements), but the scope is widening and offers are always entertained and appreciated.\u00a0 Editing from my amazing editor adds another $1500 per book and Blind Influence has just launched as an audiobook which cost close to $4000.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission is to convert Blind Persuasion and Blind Alliance into stellar audiobooks just like Blind Influence was while continuing to write the next trilogy of the series. Ultimately, my goal is to get this book series made into movies or a series (think Netflix). As you can imagine, I\u0027d like to raise the funds to continue this journey without having to dip into personal funds. What I make on art instruction and on commissions (chasing down the commissions takes time away from my writing) doesn\u0027t cover the editing of the books or the audiobook creation. It barely covers the monthly costs. And it would be awesome to use my art instruction money to cover the cost of art supplies again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://blindseries.lindafisler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/valueexchange.jpg\"\u003eWhat do you get for joining the mission? You\u0027ll have exclusive access to podcasts, author readings, Blind Series Chapters, free member access to the Blind Series website, deleted scenes (along with explanations on why they were cut from the mission), and depending on what level you join, access to a monthly meeting of the spy ring (aka question and answer session), coffee mug which features the book covers, greeting cards featuring my artwork (blank inside for you to write your secret messages), and discounted or free autographed copies of the paperback novels (This depends on how much funding is received). Possibly, you, as a member of my spy ring, could join me on a podcast to talk about the books and your favorite scenes--only if you want to blow your cover! ;-) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, along with Sean (MI6 agent), Nicole (attorney), and Senator Jenkins (3 of the characters in my novels), we might just be able to change the course of history.\u00a0 Join us for this thrilling ride of mystery, espionage, and political intrigue.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Born and raised in Southwest Ohio, Linda spent her formative years writing and entertaining her friends with stories. Little did she know that 18 years later she\u2019d be testing toilet paper\u2013well not literally testing it\u2013not on her buttocks anyway!  After a few years of becoming a toilet paper expert, Linda entered the world of testing baby diapers. Waylaid by real life, Linda worked for 26 years at Proctor \u0026amp; Gamble where marketing, computer programming/software development, and consumer research accompanied her expertise noted above. She remembers sitting in her office feeling the creativity leaving her body. She continued to write, her desire to be a screenwriter ever present.  She wrote a script for Star Trek: The Next Generation, sending it registered mail directly to Gene Roddenberry. He graciously signed for the script and gave it to Eric Stillwell.  Mr. Stillwell wrote a rejection letter. It wasn\u2019t until the year 2014 that she realized that Mr. Stillwell provided all the information needed to resubmit the script successfully. After knocking her head against the wall several times, Linda decided it was time to revisit the novel series she began writing in the 1980s.\u003cbr\u003eEnter the Blind Series! Linda\u2019s interest in politics, Robert Ludlum and Ken Follett novels, and to a lesser degree the law, she began handwriting scenes for a novel while working her full-time job. Writing on breaks, lunch hours, and throughout the weekend, Linda had generated over a foot-tall stack of scenes. She had kept these scenes, and in 2014, she began to compile them into what became her debut novel, \u003cem\u003eBlind Influence\u003c/em\u003e. It has garnered three awards-Paris Book Festival, Great Midwest Book Festival, and the Hollywood Book Festival upon its release. \u003cem\u003eBlind Persuasion\u003c/em\u003e was published in 2016 and received an award at the Paris Book Festival. \u003cem\u003eBlind Alliance\u003c/em\u003e debuted in 2017. \u003cem\u003eBlind Influence\u003c/em\u003e will launch in audiobook format (created by Skyboat Media and narrated by Audie Award winners Gabrielle de Cuir and Stefan Rudnicki) on April 3, 2018.\u003cbr\u003eThe Blind Series follows the lives of three people. In \u003cem\u003eBlind Influence\u003c/em\u003e, we meet Senator Robert Jenkins, whose ambitions include a run for president and is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Sean Adkins is an MI6 agent, who is tracking an world renown assassin. The Serpent murdered Sean\u2019s wife and young child. Nicole Charbonneau is a star attorney at an elite Washington, DC law firm. Both Jenkins and Sean draw Nicole into their web of deceit. Linda is currently working on book four in this series, Cloaked, which will be released later this year.  The historical mystery/suspense novels center around the question: \u201cCan three people change the course of history averting the dysfunctional divide we face today?\u201d\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to writing, Linda is an award-winning artist, teaches oil painting at the Middletown Arts Center, and is producer/host of two podcasts. The \u003cem\u003eAll Things Creative\u003c/em\u003e podcast focuses on interviews of creative entrepreneurs, marketing, interviews with other artists, authors, and creatives.  Linda just launched \u003cem\u003eThe Blind Series Network\u003c/em\u003e where she presents author readings of her work and discussions about her series of novels.\u003cbr\u003e",

You still need and will receive everything the previous three tiers receive, but to make sure we can identify you out in the field, you\u0027ll receive a 15 oz ceramic coffee (or tea or hot chocolate) mug with the Blind Series book covers on it. \u00a0You will also receive an autographed, free copy of Cloaked (paperback) when it launches. To cover the costs, you must remain a patron at this level for three months and we are limiting the number of agents. \u00a0There are only a few really elite secret agents--right? And just for fun, I\u0027ll assign you a agent number!",
