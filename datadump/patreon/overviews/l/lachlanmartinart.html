But, my practice will soon be expanding. I have been fortunate enough to be offered a place at the University of the Arts London for Animation, and will be commencing study there in September 2018. Traditionally, Patreon is used as a means for creators to gain a steady income whilst providing rewards for their patrons. For me this means providing an exclusive insight into my creative development from the beginning and if you\u0027re a fellow beginner artist, allowing you to develop your skills alongside me, as I will be sharing skills and techniques as I learn them. I will also be using Patreon as a way for friends, family and any generous soul who feels like supporting me financially to help me out for the heck of it.\u003cbr\u003eFor now, my Patreon is mostly a way people can support me through everything between where I am now to the other side of my education at University of the Arts London. BUT I will be developing my Patreon feed with exclusive and original content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow It Works -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you make a pledge to a Patreon page you are making a monthly subscription. On the first of each month, you will be charged to price of your pledge. Any rewards for your pledge will be sent out after I receive payment confirmation from Patreon (except for my feed, which will be updated fairly regularly, at any time). If you would like to pledge a \u003cem\u003eone-time payment\u003c/em\u003e, simply pledge, wait until the start of the following month, and then cancel your subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Will Receive -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am in the beginning of both my Patreon and my art (and moving country...), rewards will be limited for now, whilst I will try to create as much exclusive content for my patrons as I can, it will not be nearly as much as I hope to in the future. My goals section outlines where I would like to reach, and what that will mean for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money is going -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor now, I will be saving every cent earnt here to help me get to London and survive there. This support will help me cover travel and living expenses, going towards my funds and helping cut down the amount of time I need to be working, therefore - more time for art and you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
