    "summary": "Greetings and Salutations! Welcome to my Patreon page. I appreciate the fact your even reading this. My goal is to become a full-time content creator focussing mainly on youtube but also Twitch, putting all my time and effort in to building a great channel and just as important a fantastic community and to do that I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBefore I go on I would just like to say please do not donate if you cannot afford it. there are much more important things in life than my youtube channel and if you are in any way short of money then use the money you have to look after yourself and your family first.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for me to work full time building this channel and to continue building our fantastic community, I need to earn money (one of life\u0027s evils). Youtube does pay ad revenue but what is not helping is youtube\u0027s\u00a0\"algorithm\"\u00a0 now makes every video I make \"not suitable for all advertisers\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your donations, I will first and foremost be able to become a full-time content creator, but it\u0027s much more than that. \u00a0with your help, we can build a community that goes far beyond Youtube and Twitch. A website, meetups, forums and much more. The internet has become a cynical place, a place of arguments and drama, I want to create a safe space for like-minded people in our little corner of the internet. and with your help and support, we can make this a reality. This is only the start, I will need your help and input to come up with new ideas and things we can do with our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of building a community, I want to reward our community by doing giveaways and competitions for the community and reward those people who go above and beyond and help shape the future of our little corner of the internet. \u00a0in other words. \u00a0expect lots of free games and merch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have purposefully not made any large rewards because I will not withhold any content from you guys. I have seen many Patreon pages with exclusive content for large donators, special private games or videos, private servers. I hate that. Whether you can or you can\u0027t donate, you are all just as important to me. you have helped me get to this stage and I will be eternally grateful to each and every person regardless if they donate or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003efor any donation, i will give you a shoutout in one of my videos (so you might want to use your youtube name) for any donation of $5 or more, \u00a0for as long as you continue the donation your name will appear in the credits of every gaming video I do. $20 or more and I will use your name in games such as darkest Dungeon and Xcom 2.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you decide to donate a large amount or small, or not at all, you will always be welcome into our growing community with open arms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read about my Patreon. Love and hugs to you all"
