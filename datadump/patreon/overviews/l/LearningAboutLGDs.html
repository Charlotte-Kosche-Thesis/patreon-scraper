    "summary": "Learning About LGDs was formed in 2012 when its founder became disillusioned with the current forums available to people trying to train their first working livestock guardian dogs. Due to the lack of true working LGD culture in the United States and Canada, bad information has become widespread and good information difficult to differentiate for those who lack the experience to tell them apart. It started out as a Facebook discussion group but has expanded to live seminars and educational events as well as an On Site video series where we answer questions, demonstrate training exercises, and otherwise create educational content. Our goals are to continue our educational efforts by connecting beginners with LGD experts from around the world for coaching and support, to promote the use of LGDs anywhere livestock producers come into conflict with predators, to advocate for laws protecting the use of LGDs, to encourage accurate and in-depth studies into the use of LGDs for predator control, and to develop more audio/visual materials for use so that others can go forward with their own live seminars in their local communities. Most of what we have accomplished so far has been paid for out of pocket. This includes supplies and materials for live seminars and educational events, travel expenses, and presentation and video equipment. Unfortunately we can only afford to do so much ourselves, and we have BIG plans so we are reaching out to our supporters to help us take Learning About LGDs to the next level."
