We\u0027re developing c++ code of a game client to make it able to work with any type of a L2 server like l2j, frozen, pts... Just any, like the original client. Also we\u0027re having some graphics additions, and we are introducing an ability to remake the whole old game with a modern graphics, models etc. Also we\u0027re interested in making a final \"jump\" as a modding tool, that can help admins of l2 to make their own world with Go and geishas...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
