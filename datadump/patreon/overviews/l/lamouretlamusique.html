    "summary": "Salut amis!\nI\u0027m Mercedes, and I\u0027ve been making videos on YouTube about eco-beauty and\nalternative health and lifestyle since 2014. I always describe myself as a\nbifurcated person - in my \"real\" life I hold a Ph.D. in Sociology and\nwork as a researcher at an academic medical center in Boston. And yet, I have\nbeen on a lifelong quest for discovering, curating, refining, articulating, and\npresenting an evolving vision of beauty. During graduate school, while deeply\nimmersed in French theorist Michel Foucault\u0027s work on self-governance, I came across something he wrote in 1984:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\"What strikes\nme is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is related\nonly to objects and not to individuals, or to life. That art is something which\nis specialized or which is done by experts who are artists. But couldn\u0027t\neveryone\u0027s life became a work of art? Why should the lamp or the house be an\nart object, but not our life?\"*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis idea, that our lives can become works of art, has been an underlying tenant of L\u0027Amour et la Musique.\u00a0\u00a0Beauty, as a concept, has many facets for me - it includes of course the immense enjoyment and\ndiscussion around beautiful skincare and makeup that you\u0027re used to seeing on\nYouTube, but expands into music (how I first learned what something divine could *feel*\nlike, in an expansive vibrational sense), aesthetics and design, critical social theory, esoterica\nand mysticism, among other topics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside my\nquest for beauty, I have maintained a significant interest in health and\nwellbeing since a very young age, interested in understanding both\nphilosophically and empirically how we can live optimally as individuals, but\nalso the social stratification around health. In fact, this was one of the\nunderlying problematics in my doctoral research - unpacking the class politics (and accompanying moralization) around the alternative food movement (farmers\u0027 markets, urban farming, farm-to-table,\ncommunity food councils). As a sociologist, I am inherently interested in how different life opportunity structures result in health (in)equality, and the sphere of alternative food/health/wellness is ripe for analysis and commentary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs for my personal foray into the world of eco/green/organic beauty and lifestyle, I stumbled on the book \u003cem\u003eNo\nMore Dirty Looks \u003c/em\u003eand started shopping on Spirit Beauty Lounge (one of the\nfirst online luxury eco-beauty boutiques) around 2010. This coincided with the decision to stop taking hormonal birth control around that same time, and I was finally confronted\nwith the all the imbalances my body was dealing with (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7RDZVELbH0\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI made a whole video about this\u003c/a\u003e, if you want to hear more). The short version is that I started\nseeing an acupuncturist (who I see bi-monthly to this day), which not\nonly rebalanced my system, but ignited a totally different way of relating to\nand understanding my body. I fell in love with what was at the time a nascent\ngreen beauty movement (it has changed a lot,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzjyVbGdXhc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eand I also made a video about that!\u003c/a\u003e), and during graduate school had developed a fascination with the YouTube\nbeauty community (ok maybe I was procrastinating reading for prelims?). Videos about the beautiful green beauty\nproducts I felt were so special and unique were lacking, so in the spring of 2014 I started\nrecording product reviews and makeup videos on my iPhone, with no idea how to\nedit video footage or that lighting mattered. As every one who undertakes this\nkind of endeavor can attest, the learning curve is steep and ongoing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFast forward\n3 years and here we are, the summer of 2017. L\u0027Amour et la Musique has grown to\ninclude the most engaged, supportive, and knowledgeable community of\nlike-minded, creative, and forward-thinking individuals I could have imagined.\nI\u0027ve had the opportunity to work with many beautiful makers/brand founders, and\nhave formed inspiring friendships with many of you. L\u0027Amour et la Musique has\nenriched my life in so many ways, and I\u0027m grateful to have had your interest and support as the endeavor has grown and evolved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that L\u0027Amour has a home on Patreon, I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me here so that I can continue to create the type of content you\u0027re familiar with, as well as expanding into new content areas many of you have asked for. This will include more lifestyle-centric videos (vlogs, everyday conscious living, nutrition and other daily health practices), and videos in which I bring a more explicitly sociological perspective to a range of topics (consumption, materialism, capitalism, the science versus spirituality divide, gender politics in the beauty space, and class-based commentary on health seeking/wellness, among others). Your support will also allow me to invest in new equipment and software to continue refining the content I produce, as well as allow me to explore new formats and platforms. A few possibilities include a revamped and easier to use website, a podcast, downloadable lectures, articles, and live dj mixes (yes, I dj too!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, I\u0027m motivated by the desire to make academic discussions more relatable and grounded, and to applying social science frameworks and theories to the content areas the L\u0027Amour community is passionate about - beauty, what it means to live a good life, our interactions with the world, and  becoming socially conscious and responsible beings. These are big and important questions, and I\u0027m excited to tackle them with and for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn closing, a HUGE merci\nbeaucoup for any and all donations - from the bottom of my heart, thank you. I very much look forward to interacting\nwith you on here, and am always open to your feedback and thoughts.

     "description": "We all love makeup Get Ready With Me videos on YouTube, and adding an interactive q+a element during a livestream is what this tier provides! Each month I will invite you to a private livestream where I\u0027ll apply makeup, experiment with new products, provide impressions and reviews, and answer your questions as they come in live. If you aren\u0027t able to attend live you can submit questions prior and I will repost the footage for you to view at your convenience. With 10 patrons and under I will host these monthly, 10 - 20 patrons bimonthly, and 20+ patrons I will host them weekly. Remember that at this level you also get a monthly petit conseil/email correspondence, and access to all Patron-exclusive content (videos and posts).",

This stretch milestone will allow me to launch\u003cstrong\u003e a new L\u0027Amour monthly series\u003c/strong\u003e, one that is dear to my heart, and has been highly requested. As yet untitled, the project will be a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly video lecture\u003c/strong\u003e in which I apply sociological insights to thinking and commentary on the current beauty/health/wellness/new age communities. As my doctoral research was rooted in theories of governmentality, body policing, and morality under neoliberalism, I am well-situated (and trained) to offer these insights. I would prepare for these lectures similar to how I would prepare \u003cstrong\u003eto teach a university seminar\u003c/strong\u003e, yet would make the material grounded, and the theories real-world applicable. I would also like to extend sociological thinking to topics like \u003cstrong\u003ebridging the science and spirituality divide\u003c/strong\u003e, weaving in my own experience at working through the many polarities and contradictions one encounters in living a conscious life, or pursuing the spiritual path.\u00a0With this new monthly project, my goal is to introduce my viewers to new perspectives, and support you in exploring what resonates.",
