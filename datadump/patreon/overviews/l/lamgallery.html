    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhen\nI was young, I used to stare at paintings in the museum for hours.\u003c/strong\u003e  I\nstill do.  How was it that the Old Masters got their paintings so\nsmooth, so fine, so realistic?  How did they make the tiny brush\nstrokes when painting hair?  What did they know that we have\nforgotten?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://lamgallery.com/lindatigersqsm.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI\ngrew up with that mission in mind.  Over the past 30 years, I have\nbecome a traditional realist oil painter.  I have exhibited in\nnational and international art shows as well as solo exhibitions, and\nhave won many awards for my work.  Yet I still find that many of my\nquestions remain unanswered.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs\nan artist and an experimental archaeologist, I find myself in a\nunique position to answer these questions.  Over the past several\nyears I have been learning the techniques of the Old Masters \u2013\npreparing panels, grinding pigments, and painting as they would have\npainted.  The more I learn about their techniques, as I study old\nmanuscripts, the more I realize how much more there is to know.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\ninvite you to take this journey with me.  Over the years, I will be\nposting my painting experiments here, both historical and\ncontemporary work.  I encourage you to follow my artist page on\nFacebook, where I will continually post new work, and sign up for my\nmailing list on my artist portfolio page.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some links to help you connect with my work!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/silverheronstudios/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.facebook.com/silverheronstudios/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInstagram:\u00a0 @lmerchantart\u003cbr\u003e\nPortfolio Page: \u003ca href=\"http://www.lamgallery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.lamgallery.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEtsy: \u003ca href=\"http://lamgallery.etsy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://lamgallery.etsy.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your support and I look forward to sharing my work with you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
