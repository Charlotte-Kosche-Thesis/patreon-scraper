    "summary": "For the past 4 years, I have directed a blog for modern dancers of all ages. At the heart of the work is the \"artist profile,\" when I ask a dancer in his/her 30s-80s 12 questions about his/her career path and life within dance. The stories are honest, heartfelt, and current. To date, I have profiled over 120 artists. The blog has become an archive and advocacy tool as well as being a \"living textbook\" for college dance courses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach year, more features have been added to the blog, including:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy Dance Week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuilding a Dance Company\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecoming a Teaching Artist\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecoming an Arts Administrator\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blog partners with artists and organizations throughout the country to run special features. For example, in the summer of 2015 Leah Cox of the American Dance Festival wrote 6 posts as a window into the work going on at this iconic dance festival.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date, my work on the blog has been 100% voluntary. All of the writing by nearly 200 artists has been voluntary as well. We all are doing the work because we believe in the work and the mission - of sharing our stories, learning from others, inspiring others, and supporting a thriving modern dance community within the United States.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy using Patreon, I will be able in 2016 to begin paying artists for their time writing for the project. I will be able to use a graphic designer to help with more projects, such as the new downloadable journal for college technique courses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife as a Modern Dancer averages 5,000 readers a month. If you are willing to pay $35/year for a Dance Magazine subscription, would you consider the same for this blog and its content?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am actually asking for less. I am asking for a cup of coffee - meaning $2/month. Your commitment to Life as a Modern Dancer will support the project in 2016 as we run nearly 60 posts a year, including 30 new artist profiles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time and consideration! Here\u0027s to a great year ahead with more dancing, more dialogue, and more inspiration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmly,\u003cbr\u003eJill Randall\u003cbr\u003eFounder and Director, Life as a Modern Dancer\u003cbr\u003eBerkeley, California\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Jill Homan Randall is a professional modern dancer in the San Francisco Bay Area. She resides in Berkeley with her husband and two young sons. Jill has spent the past 18 years active in dance as a performer, teacher, arts administrator, and writer. As a performer, she has danced extensively with Nina Haft \u0026amp; Company, Paufve Dance, and Dana Lawton.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJill grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She was accepted into college after her 3rd year of high school, and attended the Modern Dance Department at the University of Utah. She gratefully thanks professors Abby Fiat, Donna White, Phyllis Haskell, Jon Scoville, and Anne Riordan for inspiring her and encouraging her to follow a path to connect service and dance. Starting a career with teaching in public schools was the action that kept her in dance and believing that modern dance had value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJill has taught throughout the Bay Area in K-12 schools, including with the Lincoln Center Institute Program in Berkeley. For 7 years, Jill was an arts administrator at the Julia Morgan Center for the Arts and then Shawl-Anderson Dance Center. During that time, Jill had the opportunity to \u201cbring her kids to work\u201d and balance being both a mother and administrator. (Both children worked alongside her for 6 months each.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJill has served on the board of Dancers\u2019 Group and the California Dance Education Association. She has served on committees for the Alameda County Alliance for Arts Learning Leadership, Teaching Artists Organized, Service-Learning Program at Cal State East Bay, and Paufve Dance. Jill recently joined the Advisory Committee of Now Next Dance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Bridget Frederick, Jill co-founded and co-directed the Dance IS Festival, which produced a multigenerational festival for 7 years and highlighted nearly 100 dancers each festival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2010, Jill has been on staff at The Hamlin School, a private K-8 girls\u2019 school in San Francisco in which she teaches dance full-time to students in grades 6-8. In 2013, she received the Herbst Foundation Award for Teaching Excellence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJill wrote, with co-author Valerie Gutwirth, the book Dance Education Essentials: 55 Objects and Ideas for New Preschool-12th Grade Teaching Artists. This pocket guide/journal can be purchased on amazon.com. With Co-Editor Katie Kruger, Jill is in the process of publishing a book about teaching dance to middle school age students, Middle Dance. The book will be available in Winter 2016 (www.middledance.com).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the web, Jill maintains two websites and two blogs. Jill created the only website on Service-Learning in Dance (www.servicelearningindance.org). In 2011, she started blogging about children\u2019s books on dance (www.dancingwords.typepad.com). In August 2012, her second blog, Life as a Modern Dancer, was created to make a \"living textbook\" for college students about the many ways to have a life and career in modern dance and currently has 5,000 readers of all ages each month (www.dancingwords.typepad.com/life_as_modern_dancer).\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, Jill created \"MFA Dance in Review\" to develop a website specifically for reviews of MFA concerts by emerging dance writers (www.dancingwords.typepad.com/mfa_dance_in_review).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJill\u0027s articles about dance, performing, teaching, and arts education have appeared in journals, magazines, newspapers, and blogs including:\u003cbr\u003e-In Dance\u003cbr\u003e-Teaching Artist Journal\u003cbr\u003e-The Horn Book Magazine\u003cbr\u003e-Book to Boogie Blog\u003cbr\u003e-Dance Studio Life Magazine\u003cbr\u003e-Connections: The Newsletter of the National School Reform Faculty\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with her other artistic pursuits, Jill is in the inaugural class of the MFA in Dance: Creative Practice program at Saint Mary\u0027s College in Moraga, California (a low-residency program). She anticipates to complete her MFA in June 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJill strongly identifies as a \u201cmodern dancer\u201d \u2013 an umbrella for all that she does including performing, teaching, arts administration, volunteer work, mentoring, dance writing, and arts advocacy.\u003cbr\u003e",
