    "summary": "Hello Fellow Starcraft Lover!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made (and continue to make) LifeForce because of my sheer love of the game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly problem is, there are very few really amazing single player campaigns beyond the Blizzard-made one that ships with the game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to make one. From scratch. With zero programming or video game making experience. It\u0027s taken me 4 years of raw learning and 1 year of actual building to be at a point \u00a0where I can confidently do anything in the SC2 editor, and it\u0027s my pleasure and honor to bring you my campaign.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI built my own website to host LifeForce (lifeforcecampaign.com) and try to get the game into as many people\u0027s hands as possible. But then... a problem. And I wish this was a joke. But it\u0027s not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMultiple times a week, hackers try to inject malware into my site, as seen here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/rHQtxEO.jpg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have to pay an online security company, SiteLock, $80/month to reactively remove the malware, and it shows no signs of slowing down. I\u0027m obviously paying the $80 out of my own pocket, just so I can keep the site up and the game available for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why I created this Patreon. I hope you will at least help me cover the costs so I can keep building this content and keeping it out there for all to play. Your donations also help me take time away from my real life job so I can keep cranking out amazing content. Every single dollar, no, every cent helps. So if you love sweet, 100% custom campaigns with new units, new stories, and incredible gameplay, please help me bring it to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, Magistrate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003egg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBilxor, AKA Bill Wheeler\u003cbr\u003e"
