    "summary": "Many of you arriving here are already familiar with my written work. You know I have struggled at times to produce my stories, and I know some of you have struggled to keep going. After three years of writing My Little Pony fanfic, my passion for it is still burning, and more than ever I want writing to be a big part of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to meet my goals, I have to buckle down and force myself into some new habits. Discipline is essential. I was born with the gift for words and language. I\u0027ve known that my whole life, but somehow never truly realized it. So here and now, as I work towards perfecting my craft, you can put the wind to my back, and light the fire under my ass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love the stories I write and want to see them released more regularly, then put your faith in me here by becoming a patron. Even if just one person pledges just one dollar a month towards my work, then I know I will feel the weight of that pledge. I will know that I now have an even greater responsibility to work diligently, discard the distractions that keep me from my goals, and create the stories that you want to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t pledge, or don\u0027t want to pledge, that is fine. I will keep going, regardless, as I have been for three years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you can pledge, then I invite you to be my burning determination. You will be rewarded not only with my writing, but with the rewards shown below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh2USgQldPBwdRnSKrnHbl6oHoP7PdA40Ycv3V6ShfA/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere is the story listing and suggestions document for the $5 tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UA2yt9iBO2fpb9B0hfpEYx_KkxyuOpGHmJZm0jPlTUU/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s a long form story listing document, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOnce I actually have commissions and suggestions coming in, I\u0027ll set up a tracking document for that, as well."
