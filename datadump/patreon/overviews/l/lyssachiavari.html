My name is Lyssa Chiavari and I write science fiction and fantasy for young adults. I love creating worlds that are both fantastical and familiar, and above all inclusive. I\u0027m also an indie author, a member of two co-op publishers (\u003ca href=\"https://www.snowywingspublishing.com/\"\u003eSnowy Wings Publishing\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.krakencollectivebooks.com/\"\u003eThe Kraken Collective\u003c/a\u003e), and a somewhat-obsessive studier of the publishing industry, and I love sharing the things I\u0027ve learned with other authors in the hopes of making publishing a more accessible and diverse industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating and sharing stories is not just a hobby for me, it\u0027s consumed my life. But it\u0027s become more difficult for me to support myself with it in recent years due to some\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lyssachiavari.com/2017/02/13/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-lyssa-but-were-afraid-to-ask/\"\u003eongoing health problems\u003c/a\u003e. My medical bills have gotten a little out of control, and many months it\u0027s a struggle to make ends meet while also being able to stick to a consistent writing schedule. It\u0027s my hope that by connecting with readers and creators like you here on Patreon, I will be able to write more, worry less about finances, and be able to share some magical new stories and publishing insight with all of you as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t read any of my work yet, you can see my book list\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lyssachiavari.com/\"\u003ehere on my website\u003c/a\u003e.
