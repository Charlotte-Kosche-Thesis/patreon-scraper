    "summary": "The greeting on pages like this are by far the most intimidating part, in my opinion. It\u0027s like the introduction to that essay that I wrote in tenth grade where my teacher circled the first sentence and drew a big, fat question mark above it with a red pen. She was confused, and good hell, so was I. Introductions are tough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, the power that the written word holds is insurmountable. Growing up, I was lost in the worlds and lives of others from a few simple written words, and I found solace and comfort among characters that have never truly existed. That didn\u0027t matter to me -in my mind, they were real and tangible and true. I imagined them outside of their chapters, the things they did when the curtain came down and the lights on the stage went off. I imagined them growing old with me, changing, maturing, becoming greater than they already were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, I started telling stories, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always loved writing. I\u0027ve found old essays and short stories as far back as third grade where I struggled in a hideous rendition of cursive to make the people in my mind come to life on a wide-ruled piece of paper. I fought to understand why \u0027no one\u0027 was two words. I wanted every single heroine to wear heavy chainmail. They always slayed the dragon, and the prince had to ride on the back of the horse during the long trip home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dreams have always surrounded me writing and inspiring others the way stories have continuously inspired me. The most difficult lessons I\u0027ve learned, I overcame through writing. The greatest hardships that I have had to endure were softened by my favorite hero enduring it, too. I have always wanted to give back, to bring my own characters to life in a way that could help someone else the way that I have always been helped since I first began reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re here, thank you. I have always believed that you can never succeed alone. There was always that scraggly old man on the side of the road in fantasy novels that spoke up in defense of the hero, the same as there was that one woman that helped me collect twenty-four dented cans of corn from the Wal-Mart parking lot after I tipped my shopping cart. We succeed through the support of others, be it through their contributions and encouragement, or be it between the pages of a novel that resonated through you so powerfully that you had to pause in your reading in order to compose yourself because the protagonist just \u003cem\u003eunderstood\u003c/em\u003e you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you. I wouldn\u0027t be here without you."
