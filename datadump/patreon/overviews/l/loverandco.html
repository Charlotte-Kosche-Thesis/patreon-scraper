    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://loverand.co\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLOVER\u003c/a\u003e (click to read) is an online lifestyle and visual arts publication that offers its readers a glimpse into the work, minds, homes, studios and travels of some of India\u2019s creative people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLOVER is a slow magazine. That is, an issue comes to life bit-by-bit over the span of six months and we put lots of care and thought into each one. We try and feature people and projects who do the same. We aim to be \u003cstrong\u003ebiannual\u003c/strong\u003e (that\u2019s twice yearly) so if you pledge at $3, you\u2019ll contribute just $6 to us over one year for two issues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really love to interview people so instead of clickbait content or hurried reviews, you\u2019ll mostly hear straight from your favourite creatives. In our first year, we interviewed everybody from Dayanita Singh to the designers at IKEA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re India-specific (but shoutout to the subcontinent) interested in covering stories from all parts of the country, and also reaching out to the diaspora to showcase their work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRead why our founder Sheena started LOVER:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWhen I was growing up in New Zealand, I didn\u2019t know people like me could be creative. I\u2019d never heard of or saw visuals about anybody I could identify with. The types of stories I read were either Bollywood-centric, or an orientalist, cliche loving version of India\u0027s\u00a0 \u201ccolour, chaos, kitsch\u201d, or as I grew older, that of the call-centre generation (Outsourced came out just as I graduated from school). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was delighted when I moved back to India as an adult that I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong, and I dreamed of creating a magazine that showcased the country\u0027s modernity, its visual art and the people behind it.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we need patrons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublications supported solely by advertising require hits, lots of hits. That means the focus is usually on quantity over quality and plenty of advertorial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking a magazine is fun and rewarding work but it also takes a lot of time and effort and costs money. We aim for a community-supported publication because it helps us bring you the best stories, so we can create more original content. Patreon helps us to raise money for each issue as we need it, so we can dedicate more of ourselves and the above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you in print too?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo. Printing each issue is simply not sustainable for us (financially or environmentally). Print requires a lot more funding, a lot more advertising, and a lot more work (for instance, we\u2019d need an in-house art director/graphic designer, a sales team, and better tech). However, we\u2019d love to do a print anthology sometime and we\u2019re working on our first book (2019).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019d love for you to feature us. Can we send you info about our brand?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes but we can\u2019t promise to read or respond. We\u2019ve made an executive decision to reply to all our patrons though (it\u2019s the least we can do). If you\u2019re serious about being featured, and your brand\u2019s goals are in line with ours, write to us about becoming a friend of LOVER. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow else can we work with you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe also run a small visual and editorial content agency that consults, and makes content for people or brands that share our ethos. Here are some things we\u2019ve done: made a printed 16 page zine, made a print magazine for a co working space, made travel guides for different hotels, and created tons of content for blogs, instagram and press kits. We also art direct shoots and cast interesting faces. Email \u003ca href=\"mailto:hello@loverand.co\"\u003ehello@loverand.co\u003c/a\u003e to work with us. If you want to support us, you can also help decorate our studio, stock our pantry or organise a giveaway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I receive my reward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAny physical rewards will be sent out at the end of one year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to make a one off contribution instead? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re overseas, use\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://loverand.co/paypal/\"\u003epaypal\u003c/a\u003e or buy us a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/loverandco\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecoffee\u003c/a\u003e or contribute\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/loverandco/contribute-to-lover/?ref=store\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e if you\u2019re in India (donate the amount of your choice and we\u2019ll give you the rewards that match)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you again for all of your support.
