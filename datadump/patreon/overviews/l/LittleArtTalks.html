Videos cover everything from the curious history of Mummy Brown (yup, that\u0027s exactly what it sounds like), to how in the world a \u003cem\u003eurinal\u003c/em\u003e can be considered art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of Little Art Talks is to make art history more approachable and open up a discussion about art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does Little Art Talks need MY help?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eHi! My name is Karin, and I created the channel almost three years ago as I was finishing up my dual degrees in Fine Arts (Studio) and Art History. It\u0027s been an incredible journey building the channel up, and in this time, I have created over 150 videos, and the channel has grown to 15,000+ subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough youtube pays a little, it is not even close to justifying the amount on time that goes into these videos. \u003cstrong\u003eI use all the money I make from these videos to improve the quality of my content\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- a better camera, a microphone/recorder for better sound quality, light stands, light bulbs (that break), and the most recently- the costs to repair my camera when it broke.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom day 1, I have done everything myself - from research and script writing, to filming and editing. Making a video is an incredibly time intensive process. Doing it all myself means that I don\u0027t need to spend money to hire someone to help me- I can work on Little Art Talks as much as I want, time permitting. However, it also means that there are tons of hours of work going into this channel unpaid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m incredibly\u00a0fortunate to have found some awesome people who watch these quirky, art history videos. I\u0027m really proud of all the work I\u0027ve put into them- though they\u0027re also pretty embarrassing to look back on- but I\u0027m also constantly thinking about how to make them even better. Better equipment, better editing, better animations, just better all-around content!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy your money helps!\u003c/h3\u003e- Currently I spend whatever free time I have to work on Little Art Talks. I work on them late into the night and often on weekends (and I mean, it\u0027s not like have better things to do...). But when I have to choose between projects that will help pay the bills and these videos, I have to think about how I\u0027m going to afford that next bowl of ramen. Make it easier by sponsoring my humble meal and I\u0027ll gladly make more videos on Little Art Talks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I can invest more time and money in improving the content, like taking the time to make longer content, like my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5P9k3ykmuk67bPn0DL1RV5KbGvUZnM1f\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJapanese Art History series\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- You get to directly support content you enjoy at whatever level you\u0027re comfortable with. You can choose any amount and support Little Art Talks on a per creation basis (charged MAX once a month), or make a one time contribution. So you can feel less bad (if any) about blocking those ads on YouTube and depriving me of those couple (fractions) of a cent. Yay!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for all your support! \u003c/strong\u003eI appreciate it so much (really, you don\u0027t understand how much it means to me) and it really helps me so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestions?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheck out this FAQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
