As you can see, I am nowhere near being self-sufficient in coffee consumption. I haven\u2019t even started growing actual food yet because I am terrible at priorities in gardening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis means that I spend a lot of energy working at a non-creative job that I wish I could be spending on music. The way this plays out is that I compose a lot of pieces, but don\u2019t have the resources to get them performed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFortunately, the internet exists! I will be publishing one score a month, and they will all be available to anyone who wants to play them. I am releasing these under a Creative Commons Plus license. You can perform them live commercially. If you\u2019re recording them for a commercial product, you\u2019ll need to pay royalties. Just contact me and we\u2019ll work it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo you might have noticed that you can do all of that without paying me upfront. I want to make it easy for musicians to perform and distribute these pieces, so I\u2019m putting up as few barriers as I can. Obviously though, that\u2019s not very sustainable for me when it comes to affording food. That\u2019s where Patreon comes in. If you like my music, or just like that I\u2019m releasing it, please consider becoming my patron. It will enable me to devote more time and energy to my compositions, and ensure that I can continue publishing new music for the forseeable future. And for coffee tree, it means that it gets to stay in a nice warm flat, instead of outside in England, where it would die. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
