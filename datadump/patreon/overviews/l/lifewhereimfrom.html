    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eThe Past\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe truth of the matter, is that I started this channel in April 2015 as a creative outlet. I used to produce videos for businesses back in Vancouver, Canada, and I missed making videos. Unlike those promo videos I used to make, this was purely for fun, trying to introduce the world to what different cultures are like from a child\u0027s perspective. Things got a little crazy from there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Present\u003c/h4\u003e\nThree years later, the Life Where I\u0027m From Channel has 600,000 subscribers! Just amazing for something that started as a creative side project. As much as those numbers are impressive, you might be surprised to know that even ad revenue from a couple millions views a month can\u0027t support a family, let alone all the equipment and travel budget needed to produce 4K videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile the types of videos being made have diversified, the goal is still largely the same. Show kids (and adults) what everyday life is like around the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile some topics are simple to film from home, like showing what breakfast or bathrooms are like, certain topics require more research and planning. Stories about what types of homes average people can afford, what working life is like, or what it\u0027s like to be homeless simply take time (which like the saying goes, does cost money, especially for a freelancer like me).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Future\u003c/h4\u003e\nIf finances wold allow, I\u0027d love to take this channel on the road to film the everyday lives of people in different countries. I\u0027d want to visit some countries that don\u0027t normally get seen on YouTube, and once there train some locals and even provide them equipment, so that they could start their own channels.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHonestly, the fact that I can make these videos in the first place and have such great discussions has always been enough for me. Even if I don\u0027t hit my goals, I\u0027ll still continue to do this, but I\u0027ll just do it on the side as always, instead of full time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eRewards!\u003c/h4\u003e\nWhile the vast majority of the content I create is free for the world to view, which I don\u0027t intend to change as my main goal is to show the world (regardless of their financial means) what life is like around the world, I do want to provide some special perks for those who are able to financially support (full list in the Rewards section).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause so many viewers are young, and to make everything as accessible as possible, the most popular perk (deleted and behind-the-scenes) is at the lowest $1 level. There\u0027s still cool stuff at the higher ones, but if someone is willing to even give a $1 a month, I want them to get something beyond a monthly update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs always, thanks for watching (and the support). What\u0027s life like where you\u0027re from?"
