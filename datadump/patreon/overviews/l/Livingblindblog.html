    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eWe are a community of blind and visually impaired bloggers from all over the world including: Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. We were started on July 21st 2009 by a lady named Stephie2010 who just wanted to talk about what it was like to be blind and to answer questions that she couldn\u0027t answer on youtube.\u003cbr\u003eEven though we have increased in number we have done our best to bridge the gap between both the blind and sighted communities. We still talk about what it\u0027s like to be blind, but we also include blogs on parenting if the parent or child is blind, technology that can be useful to blind and visually impaired individuals, techniques to best teach a blind or visually impaired student, and so much more. We do this through both blogs and podcasts and this is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to review the latest technology as it comes out and as it relates to blind or visually impaired people, but due to money constraints we are unable to do that. However, with your help we can review the latest technology through purchasing it, having companies loan it to us for the purpose of testing it, and, attending some conventions where new technology will be presented. In turn this will bring about new blogs and podcasts that you\u0027ll be able to be a part of and have early access to. We\u0027ll bring in more guest bloggers, conduct more interviews about a variety of topics that we don\u0027t or can\u0027t cover, and continue to improve and work on the series that have already been created. We might even create new series in the future with so many different bloggers with different perspectives and experiences you never know what will happen.\u003cbr\u003egoals:\u003cbr\u003eThe first goal is to get our site back up and running. To do this we need your help as none of us can afford to pay out of pocket for a server space. Once we launch we can start producing the great content that you\u0027re used to if you\u0027ve been around a while. We would like to review technology as it comes out. this could include, but is not limited to: braille displays, updates to screen readers, talking devices such as thermometers, and apps. In order to review the technology we might need to: 1 attend conventions where the technology is being displayed for the public. 2. Conducting interviews with the creators of the technology. 3. Paying for a company to loan us the technology for testing purposes. We would also like to extend our site to include things such as self care E. G. How to paint your nails, shave, clip nails ETC. We have several other series such as our cooking series that we will be working on as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
