    "summary": "I stream games. My schedule is a bit of a floating timeline, as I work around the moments I have free time. More income means more free time for me to work around, as I can more directly invest less of my time towards earning money to purchase parts, and do work in general. I try to include a variety of games, though with my lack of a nailed down schedule, the best way to get information is to join the Discord Group, where patrons get their own patron-only chat, while everyone else gets news and announcements via the normal chat and the news and announcement rooms. I also post ads to Twitter on occasion, as well as to a few other locations, but streaming six days a week, with most times being similar tends to make it easy to predict my streams most of the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do patron-only streams on Saturday mornings, and the list currently includes two games that rotate. More income means that there are likely to be more patron-only streams started during the week\u003cbr\u003e"
