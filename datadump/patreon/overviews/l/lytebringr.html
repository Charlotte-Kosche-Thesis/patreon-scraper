    "summary": "\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center; color: #2E0854;\"\u003eWillkommen, Bienvenue, and Welcome\u003c/h4\u003e\nYou have found your way to Lytebringr\u0027s monthly tip jar! If you\u0027re here, you know what I do, but you may not know that I do it while working a separate full-time job. So I don\u0027t need your money to live. I also feel no desire to host advertising for soft drinks, soaps, or video games that you have long ago made up your mind about. But you may not know much about your fellow viewers. So this will be a way for you to demonstrate how much my content is worth to you and for me to help inform everyone of who you are and what you do! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRemember that if you do not renew your payment each month, you will lose your rewards and someone might swoop in and steal your spot. Also, I will only announce family friendly names, so keep it PG everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center; color: #2E0854;\"\u003eClearly Better than Nothing - $1\u003c/h4\u003e\nFor a dollar a month, you show that spending time with me is comparable to going out to the movies a single time this year! For that seemingly insignificant amount, I could get a shiny new Indie game (albeit on sale) from your contribution alone this year. This will get your name put into the shout-out pool from which I pull a few names for when I say \"This episode/stream brought to you by...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center; color: #2E0854;\"\u003eWhen is a Park the Right Size? - $3.50\u003c/h4\u003e\nFor tree-fitty a month, you exclaim that I am more fun than a pair of ballpoint pens each and every month! I know it\u0027s hard to compete with the ability to make a permanent record of your innermost thoughts, but if I manage to that means I can get an extra random untested new release title that we can all mock if it is a buggy nightmare. The first 4 people to support at this level get a stand-alone advertisement of something they make, whether an art portfolio, your totally lit demo tape, or your one-man traveling origami show. If you are late to the party, you still get your name in the shout-out pool.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center; color: #2E0854;\"\u003eHow Big \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a Bread Box? - $5\u003c/h4\u003e\nFor five dollars a month, you demonstrate that you like my content more than 288 ounces of Big Box Store cola! That enjoyment could turn itself into a full price triple-A game or several Indie titles for us all to experience together. The first 4 people to support at this level get stand-alone advertisement of something they make, whether a game mod, music on SoundCloud, or artisan Cthulhu cupcake recipes on Etsy.\u00a0If you are late to the party, you still get your name in the shout-out pool.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center; color: #2E0854;\"\u003eI \u003cem\u003eCan\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e Be as Good as Netflix - $10\u003c/h4\u003e\nHow did you even read this far? For ten dollars a month, you can get Netflix. \n\u003cem\u003eNetflix! \u003c/em\u003eI guess you\u0027re here so I should make a pitch. Ummm... \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re awesome! \u003c/strong\u003eNot because you\u0027re thinking about giving me this much money, but because you took the time to read this far and didn\u0027t give up at my \"tree fitty\" joke. As with the previous levels, the first 4 people to support at this level get stand-alone advertisement of something they make, whether a new type of cheese, a vintage bicycle sculpture museum, or your old Magic: the Gathering cards on eBay.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center; color: #2E0854;\"\u003eReally? You want more? - ???\u003c/h4\u003e\nYou are welcome to pledge as much as you like, whether it matches any of the above categories or not. If the provided levels fill up, I\u0027ll make more allowing for more advertising. However, I will not go beyond one ad per video and one ad per hour in a stream. Thanks for being awesome and I\u0027ll see you in the next video or stream or something or other wiiiiiiiiith Lyte.\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
