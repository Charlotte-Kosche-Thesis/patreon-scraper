If you\u0027ve arrived here at my Patreon page, then chances are you\u0027ve seen a few of my films already.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is your opportunity to join the Living Big in a Tiny House Team! Through Patreon, you have an opportunity to be a part of my production. By supporting me here, you\u0027ll help me to create better quality, more frequent content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust subscribing to my YouTube channel and watching my videos is a big contribution. I really appreciate you for that and want to extend a big thank-you! If you get a lot of value from my videos and do feel like contributing more though, it will truly assist me in taking this journey to the next level!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me to continue creating my videos by helping to pay for travel costs, sometimes materials and equipment, but mostly the huge amount of time that it takes to produce these films.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to eventually be able to create at least one video every week, so for example if you become a patron and support me for $1 per video, that would work out to be around $4 every month. You are able to cap your monthly spend though, just incase I decide to go crazy and start releasing even more regular videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Living Big patron, you\u0027ll get access to special behind the scenes content via my patron-only feed, as well as special promo offers. In the future, I\u0027ll be opening a web store with e-books, as well as great products. These will be offered to Patrons at a significant discount\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike other creators on Patreon, I don\u0027t have tiered levels of support. So, whether you\u0027re able to pay $1 per video or $5, you\u0027ll ultimately get the same rewards. I want to make everything that I produce accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their income levels, and so I want to let you decide how valuable my videos are to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank-you for you\u0027re support! I look forward to having you on the team and continuing on this amazing journey with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBryce\u003c/div\u003e"
