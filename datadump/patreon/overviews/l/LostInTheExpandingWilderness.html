    "summary": "Welcome to the Expanding Wilderness, where things get really big for no apparent reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not entirely true, there are many good reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this story, you the reader are accidentally stranded in a mysterious jungle where the normal rules of biology don\u0027t apply. Life is quick and deadly, and things grow big and fast! As you (hopefully) survive, you may meet certain characters and do interesting and possibly lewd things with them, have them grow really big, perhaps grow really big yourself, or maybe all of the above. (Or, technically, none of the above if you fall out of a tree or something.) Most of the storylines will focus on growing your partner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m doing\nthis project for fun and I will try to keep adding content to it when I can,\nseparate from other projects. But, if you like it and want to support me doing\nit, go and either pledge or just follow the Patreon page. Here, everyone will\nbe able to vote on events and critters, while patrons will get access to high\nresolution versions of the free images.\u003cbr\u003eNot every story chapter will have an illustration, but I will do my best to focus on drawing the interesting scenes. New story chapters will be written and illustrated as I explore the various options, which I will usually do at my own discretion. I have no real plan, other than the creatures you will meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis Patreon\npage is on a \u003cstrong\u003eper-month basis\u003c/strong\u003e and will be either repurposed or deactivated once\nthis project is finished. I have no idea at this moment when that will be, but\nI *hope* that it will run for several months at least. It all depends on how much time I can afford to dedicate to this, and how much I like what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI do like\ngetting feedback on this project, either on Furaffinity or Patreon. Even if\nyou\u2019re unable to support it, I would like people to critique images and\nwriting, and let me know if they like or dislike certain characters or events\nand why.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enote:\u003cbr\u003eI am trying to make Patreon find the Discord server I set up for this project, bear with me while I try to figure out why it isn\u0027t working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ealso note:\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time, WIPs may be posted here for critique and feedback. Chapters and images may be edited without notice (but usually with notice) if I feel like they can be improved without too much hassle.\u003cbr\u003e"
