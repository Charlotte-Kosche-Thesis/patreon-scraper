    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eHave you ever read a novel, short story, poem, or narrative and then found yourself wondering about it\u0027s creator, their backstory, and what type of person could construct the piece of literature in your hands? Well, I know I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I am Whiskey Emerson, author of the historical-thriller, \u003cem\u003eWest of Hell\u003c/em\u003e, and I am here to bring you my very own podcast entitled Legacy: the Artists Behind the Legends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLegacy: the Artists Behind the Legends is a podcast that investigates the lives of deceased writers and what sort of events impacted their lives and their writing, all to give you a bigger picture of context for your library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeason one was a great success, and with the start of season two, I wanted to launch a page with Patreon to help this podcast grow and reach more listeners. To be fair, this is not strictly an educationally based podcast - I approach each episode with a no bullshit, no romanticizing, and filterless mindset. Just to spice it up, there is also a themed cocktail each week centered around the artist we are covering, which I provide at the start of every episode so we can all relish in our drinks together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon, you ask? Well, if there is one thing any podcaster learns quickly, it\u0027s that each episode takes time...LOTS of time. As a writer and podcaster who is trying to create art for others to love and enjoy, a little financial support is a fantastic thing that can only help the podcast improve, and additionally, bring me closer to those who want to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you love books, history, cocktails, crazy yet genius artists, or just want to listen to an honest and (sometimes) crass, perspective on what makes some of the greatest minds of human history tick, this is right up your alley, my friend. You will laugh, you might cry, you\u0027ll definitely be oddly surprised at times, but in the end, you\u0027ll walk away having learned something new...and with a mild buzz.\u003cbr\u003e"
