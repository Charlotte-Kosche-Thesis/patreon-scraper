    "summary": "Hey everyone!\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I want to thank you for taking the time to stop by my page! I\u0027m brand new to Patreon and I appreciate your interest, feedback, and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Chelsea and I\u0027m an energetic traveler. I have done solo trips, group explorations, road trips, and backpacking, all of these on a shoestring budget! My adventures range from long weekends to two month multi-country ventures. So far, I have been to 13 countries outside of the USA, and I hope you\u0027ll come along with me as I venture further into this beautiful world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI regularly post to my instagram, Little.Red.Roaming and (less consistently, I admit) to my youtube and my blog. However I would really like to begin connecting offline, which is the basis of starting this Patreon page. I love sending and receiving handwritten cards and letters, and I know I\u0027m not alone in that! My project will be mailing postcards from the countries that I visit, each one a handwritten, completely unique note. They could include a drawing, a poem, a detailed description of the cafe that I\u0027m sitting at, or a broader stream-of-thought about the city I am exploring.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many people, traveling the world is a difficult goal to reach. Financial hardships, or perhaps just the circumstances of your life, like having young children, can make it difficult to get away! I hope to be able to transport you to the places I go, and connect with others in a way that is outside the usual mode of correspondences, like social media. I love social media, don\u0027t get me wrong, but I think a lot of the human connection gets lost in the wavelengths, and I really want to reconnect to that. The old romanticism of letter writing, but with the added benefit that you don\u0027t actually have the obligation of writing back. Though I certainly encourage you to do so via the Patron-only page if you enjoyed what I transcribed to you! I will also regularly be checking in with the community to help decide where my next adventures should take me, and holding livestreams to say hello. The end-goal is to build a community of people who love expanding their horizons, both literally and figuratively.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you so much for taking the time to stop by, and I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting The Postcard Project!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXoXo!\u003cbr\u003e-Chelsea\u003cbr\u003e"
