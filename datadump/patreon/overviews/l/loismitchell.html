I work with extreme detail, patience, and realism to bring out beauty, fun, and usefulness in representations of the natural world.

Increasing your support gives\u00a0you more benefits. You\u0027ll have the chance to\u00a0vote on my next art project. You\u0027ll have access to pieces that are only available here. You can potentially download my work. You can get discounts and free shipping. By purchasing my pieces for others or for yourself, you will provide warm memories of special people, places, pets, and events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will give you insights into special techniques. I use CMY color theory and can explain why combining red, yellow, and blue gives you brown not black. I will show how I create colors by layering watercolor paints. I\u0027ll show you how I use my equipment and how I assemble 3D maps. You will get extra goodies now and then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease back me at $1 a month and ask your friends to support me!\u00a0If you increase your pledge, you will receive more rewards.
