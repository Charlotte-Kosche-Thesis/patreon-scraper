I taught myself how to play piano so I could write these angsty, passionate pre-teen songs. I sang my heart out. I wrote over 20 songs before I graduated high school. When I was 18, I decided to pursue a career in music. Best decision I ever made. 20+ years later, I am giddy, I am grateful, I am in love with my life as an artist and educator. \u003cem\u003eMusic heals. Music brings people together. Music tells stories that often can\u0027t otherwise be told. This is why I make music. It\u0027s bringing us together RIGHT NOW. If you believe in the power of music to change the way we live, to enrich our lives and to cultivate community and connection, you are in the right place. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYOU CAN HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I LOVE PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo, here I am now living the dream on Patreon. \u003cem\u003eThis platform is all about meaningful and reciprocal relationships between creators and the people who believe in their creative work.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll be giving: \u003c/strong\u003emy heart, my honesty, my music.
