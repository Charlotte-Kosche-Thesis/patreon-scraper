    "summary": "My name is Daniel Rocha, and I\u0027ve been writing, developing, and animating amateur cartoons for the past several years. I\u0027m very proud and delighted to find that one cartoon, \"No-Luck Nora in: Home? Run!\" has garnered a devoted following. Everyday people ask when they will see more, and that makes me happy. Here, you have the chance to help make that happen, and even include your own input in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already have scripts and radio shows prepared for at least three more Nora cartoons. Animation, however, is slow work, and very difficult for just one guy. This is especially true if the animation is to be any good! I prefer classic, frame-by-frame animation to paper-doll tweening, so it takes a lot of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to consistently produce animation and video that you will all enjoy, but I can\u0027t do it alone! I need help with voice acting, inking, painting, and more. Sadly, such services aren\u0027t free. Nora and her friends need voices prettier than mine, after all! Become a patron today, and help me to produce the work that you all you want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne last thing. Please remember that your support is more than just financial; it gives me the encouragement I need to keep going. Thank you!"
