    "summary": "Aloha! Thank you for checking out my Patreon page! I created this specifically to ask my fans to help me out, so my latest artwork may see the light of day!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI installed LAYSAN 1902 at the Bishop Museum in early September in time for the IUCN World Conservation Congress. LAYSAN\u00a01902 recalls a specific moment in time of Laysan Island before humans irrevocably changed the native-dominated landscape, juxtaposed with the current-day manmade disaster of floating plastic debris which Laysan Albatrosses ingest and feed to their young. The artwork invites audiences to interact with the \u00a0jewel-like eggs made of resin and beach plastic cast from molds of real Laysan Albatross egg specimens from the Bishop Museum\u0027s collection. The work impresses upon the vulnerability of birds and habitats of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUnfortunately, I have never installed a piece at a science museum and didn\u0027t anticipate the \"kid factor\" that would ultimately shut down LAYSAN 1902.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter about a week of being up, I discovered that the piece was pretty much treated like a playground and unsuccessful as an interactive art installation. Kids played with the sand (while making a mess) and the eggs were damaged. A suggested solution was to add a plexiglass cover, however I do not have funds to cover the cost of adding a protective shield. Currently it is covered with a black sheet with a little sign that says \"Installation in Progress.\"\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, I can re-install LAYSAN 1902,\u00a0and allow the public to experience the artwork.\u003cbr\u003e"
