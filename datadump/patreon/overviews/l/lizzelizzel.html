I plan on refining my technique, giving my creativity a workout and becoming more a part of the arts community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSchool is expensive, living is expensive, art supplies are expensive, which brings me to why I am opening a Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me you will help me free my time up to focus more on my education and to create a wholly new body of work. It is also my goal to purchase a classy home printer in order to start selling prints of my paintings to the public instead of only offering originals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, please remember that you can cancel or change your patronage at any time.

     "about": "As young children we embrace superstitions to explain the world around us and imbue harmless objects with the power to help us control our lives or harm us. I remember playing with Ouija boards as a preteen, reciting the alphabet as I twisted off a soda can tab, playing at *MASH* notes to predict my future domestic life and always having a rabbit\u2019s foot dangling from my school bag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u2019t over think these toys or rituals. They were not a reflection of a faith purposefully instilled in me. They were common place, harmless and comforting. Now that I am an adult I can look back and analyze these past behaviors and often find surprising new ones that I see other adults practice now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my work I attempt to convey a feeling of need for control over the future and a desire for a spiritual explanation to the meaning of life. I am confronting my own lack of belief by attempting to make others think about their superstitions through the narrative arrangement of traditional still life and conceptual portraiture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not criticizing our superstitious nature in my work. I am admitting it. As secular as we may try to be in our everyday lives and actions our ancient need for mysticism reveals itself consistently. What everyday people wish to believe in and fear to believe in outside of organized religion can reveal more than confession.\u003cbr\u003e",
