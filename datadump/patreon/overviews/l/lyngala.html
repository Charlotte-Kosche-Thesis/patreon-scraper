I never thought of myself as a real author until my fellow fans followed me into professional writing.\u00a0 I have always appreciated how much support I\u0027ve gotten from my fans.\u00a0 But some projects have never made it off my computer because there isn\u0027t a market for them.\u00a0 They\u0027re too racy--too edgy--or they just don\u0027t make money.\u00a0 This is an experiment is seeing whether the ultra-supportive fans in the gay romance audience will follow me into a new adventure."

Westerns starring men with shady pasts gave way to science fiction with questionable protagonists, which eventually became any story with a morally ambiguous character. Even the purest heroes have pain and loss and darkness in their hearts, and that\u0027s where she likes to find her stories. Her characters seek to better themselves and find the happy (or happier) ending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen she isn\u0027t writing, Lyn Gala teaches history in a small town in New Mexico. Her favorite spot to write is a flat rock under a wide tree on the edge of the open desert where her dog can terrorize local wildlife. Writing in a wide range of genres, she often gravitates back to adventure and BDSM, stories about men in search of true love and a way to bring some criminal to justice... unless they happen to be the criminal.\u003cbr\u003e",
