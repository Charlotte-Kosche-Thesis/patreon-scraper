    "summary": "Hello you :) This is Gytis from Love The Climb VLOG on Youtube! This is my story. I\u0027m 23 years old. I left my parent\u0027s home when I was 18 in pursuit of learning through new experience and becoming the best version of myself. I found myself relocating at a young age from Chicago to Boston, where I started my chef career. I began working at the 3rd longest running raw food restaurant in the world \"Organic Garden Cafe\". Working my way up from dishwasher to chef in about a year. I learned many raw food recipes, honed in on my chef skills and built a great work ethic. Three years later working for this restaurant I decided to take upon a new adventure. I was offered an opportunity in Hawaii by an ex coworker to help create vegan food for a small start up business. Having a desire for exploration and the comfort of warm tropical weather. I decided to accept the offer! So that\u0027s where it leads me to now. Now this being a small start-up, the deal was that any profit we make will be split between me and my boss. A year and a half later we still have not made a profit. So with an increased amount of financial stress, that\u0027s the main reason why I\u0027ve decided to create this Patreon account. It was mainly to give myself the chance to be supported by my viewers and audience on Youtube. One of my biggest passions that I developed in the past five years was creating Youtube videos. The videos ended up evolving into video blogs also known as \"Vlogs\". Vlogging was the niche that helped put me on the map in the \"Youtube World\". I now have almost 7,000 subscribers on Youtube and 2,000+ viewers watching per video. Which I\u0027m EXTREMELY grateful for. However in the grand scheme of things this is a small audience compared to most Youtube channels. So that means my financial return from Youtube Ad Revenue is minimal and no where close to a sustainable part time job. So I thought I\u0027d give myself this opportunity through Patreon and allow my viewers to help me out if they wanted to :) All monthly income from Patreon goes to the time I spend creating and distributing Youtube content. As well as the camera and equipment that I have to pay for. I really love creating videos and content to hopefully inspire others to live a more simple, active and healthy lifestyle. You guys help me to keep doing what I\u0027m doing. Blessings :)"
