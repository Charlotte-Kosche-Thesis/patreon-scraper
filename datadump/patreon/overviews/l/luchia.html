    "summary": "Dear Patron,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! It\u0027s nice to meet you. I am Luchia. I am extremely passionate about writing, and I\u00a0\u003cem\u003eam happy to say I have a temporary part-time job!\u003c/em\u003e I lost my (full-time real person) job due to depression/Type 2 Bipolar Disorder since I couldn\u0027t get to work, which is fair enough. I would\u0027ve fired me too. However, if you look at it in a desperately optimistic way, this just gave me extra time to write! What fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that you have the story behind why I\u0027m on Patreon, what exactly is it that I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m writing a fanfiction series which I\u0027ve been told can more or less be read as original fiction if you want. The specific story I\u0027m currently working on is called Nocturlabe, and is the third \u0027book\u0027 in a series I rather lazily called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/series/42515\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStupid Terrorist Boys\u003c/a\u003e (link leads to AO3/Archive of our Own). It\u0027s about obsessive emotionally idiotic militant extremist boys who are French and in love. It is based off of Victor Hugo\u0027s Les Miserables. All of the \u0027book\u0027 titles in the series (Gnomon, Clepsydra, and Nocturlabe) are archaic timekeeping devices. It\u0027s supposed to be symbolic and stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://gnomonfic.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis\u003c/a\u003e is a link to a tumblr blog devoted to supplemental STB stuff.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gnomonfic.tumblr.com/tagged/nice-people-keep-making-amazing-things!\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis is the link\u003c/a\u003e to the amazing wonderful things people have made related to the series. (And I do mean amazing.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also writing an original book that is people in 839 AD trying to survive an alien attack. I think it\u0027s pretty cool, but it\u0027s on the back burner for the moment since I want to write stupid terrorist boys being forced to deal with a child and also confronting the reality of their incredibly messed up relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what do you get for becoming a patron? You get to read the next chapter of Nocturlabe (or any other written works I produce) EARLY! Yes, that\u0027s right, beloved patrons receive early releases of absolutely everything I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be posting little teaser snippets for those patrons who pledge $3+.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you somehow pledge $10 or more, you will be asked for your address because I\u0027m going to send you a thank you letter, since $10 is easily an entire day of food, if not two or three, and you\u0027d better believe I can afford a stamp to thank you for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I am really, really poor.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your time, and I hope you have a wonderful day!"
