Also, I\u0027m not having much success at finding an entry-level job in the media industry, so I just need something to tide me over until I get settled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you donate to me, there\u0027s the chance that I\u0027ll be able to record more since I\u0027m making more money from music. That\u0027s why I put \"album\" instead of \"month.\" I should probably put \"song,\" but \"album\" just seems right. I can also afford to go to a proper studio instead of being a mere bedroom rocker - and maybe, just maybe, I can get a band together. And better equipment too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do have some rewards - early access to my albums, discounts on prior albums, demos of songs in FLAC, multichannel mix tests, and the privilege of talking to my inarticulate dopey butt in a one-on-one Skype session.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

And you know how they always sell them for $75? It\u0027s because it costs money to press these records (and design and master them and so on - you want to have a product that looks AND sounds good). Well, that and they tend to sell them with weird vinyl colors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this, you\u0027ll get a good vinyl pressing (read: 180g with a gatefold cover) of my first album under the Lesbian Concentrate name: \u003cem\u003eSchaeffermusic\u003c/em\u003e. It has its fans. According to one girl, it sounds like a weird mix of Cardiacs, Captain Beefheart, and the National. According to another guy, it\u0027s the most inaccurate album ever made. It comes with not only a proper back cover - one that looks like one of those back covers you might see on the old Atlantic and Columbia albums of the 1950s (with liner notes blabbering about how \"important Lesbian Concentrate is\") - but it comes with lyrics in the gatefold (the only way to put lyrics) and a free digital download of the album.",

     "description": "Be a guest vocalist on a song (even customs and requests)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an alright singer, but I know there are people who want to get their voices heard. So, if you pay me the right price, I\u0027ll let you sing the song for once. I\u0027ll send you a melody line, a vocal guide track, the lyrics, and the instrumental. Be sure to learn by ear - I\u0027m not exactly good at tabbing out and notating stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it\u0027s a request cover, you already know the melody (more than likely). I\u0027ll send you the instrumental and the lyrics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have a bum voice, I don\u0027t mind. You\u0027ll still be on a release. However, if you want this to be private, I\u0027ll make it private and just send you the final mix in FLAC or WAV so you can show your friends that you sang on an Lesbian Concentrate song.\u003cbr\u003e",
