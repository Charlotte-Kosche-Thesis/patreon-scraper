My name is Richard Moss.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer, journalist, and historian, with seven years of experience covering video games and technology. You may have read one of the many hundreds of freelance articles I\u0027ve written \u2014 perhaps something on Ars Technica, where I write big features on things like \u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/it-felt-like-robbery-tomb-raider-and-the-fall-of-core-design/\"\u003eThe Fall of Core Design\u003c/a\u003e (the original Tomb Raider creators) and have a long-running game genre history series (\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/from-simcity-to-well-simcity-the-history-of-city-building-games/\"\u003ehere\u0027s my favourite entry\u003c/a\u003e, on city-building games); or maybe on Polygon or Rock Paper Shotgun or Gamasutra or any of two dozen other publications. A lot of my past work is on \u003ca href=\"https://richardmoss.contently.com/\"\u003emy portfolio\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a book on \u003ca href=\"https://unbound.com/books/macgaming/\"\u003ethe Secret History of Mac Gaming\u003c/a\u003e coming out in March. I also produce a \u003ca href=\"http://ludiphilia.net\"\u003epodcast about play\u003c/a\u003e, and I love music, dance, film, and learning new stuff. \u003ca href=\"https://d.pr/i/8JGaBe\"\u003eMy cat\u003c/a\u003e is named Max.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this thing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Life \u0026amp; Times of Video Games is an audio documentary series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past, and how they came to be the way they are now. \n\u003cbr\u003eThat means that each episode is scripted, edited, and deeply-researched, with interviews and archival audio used whenever appropriate (and possible).\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy audio? Why not make videos instead?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy skills are way better suited to audio production than video, but I also believe that the experience of just listening can be more powerful \u2014 more evocative of a sense of place or being \u2014 than having lots of pretty pictures to distract your imagination. Audio is also a growing storytelling medium now, thanks to the popularity of podcasts and audiobooks, and there\u0027s nobody else doing this kind of show out there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m new to Patreon, how does this work? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the documentaries I produce will find their way into a podcast feed, available for everyone \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/the-life-times-of-video-games/id1279383027\"\u003eon iTunes\u003c/a\u003e and through other podcast platforms with one or two ads per episode. If you\u0027d like to support me, however, you\u0027ll get access to patron-only stuff like a special interruption/ad-free podcast feed and \u2014 depending on your level of contribution \u2014 extra content like extended interviews and research findings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best thing is that by supporting me here you can have a real impact on how The Life \u0026amp; Times of Video Games evolves over time. I\u0027ll be paying close attention to comments and ideas from my patrons, and will conduct polls and group chats from time to time to make sure we\u0027re all happy about the show\u0027s trajectory.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen can I expect new episodes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEpisodes will come out fortnightly(ish), in seasons. \u003ca href=\"http://lifeandtimes.games/1-race-to-the-bottom\"\u003eEpisode 1\u003c/a\u003e is about the race to the bottom in the early iOS App Store, where developers found themselves locked in a price war that none of them wanted. \u003ca href=\"http://lifeandtimes.games/2-airfight\"\u003eEpisode 2\u003c/a\u003e is about one of the first flight simulator games, Airfight, which is \u003cem\u003efrom the 1970s\u003c/em\u003e. More recently, \u003ca href=\"http://lifeandtimes.games/6-rom-hack\"\u003eEpisode 6\u003c/a\u003e looked at the history of a 1990s ROM hacking and translation group, while Episodes \u003ca href=\"http://lifeandtimes.games/7-tomb-raider-grid\"\u003e7\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://lifeandtimes.games/8-tomb-raider-grid-p2\"\u003e8\u003c/a\u003e delved deeply into the underappreciated significance of the grid-based level editor to the success and enormous cultural impact of the early Tomb Raider games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeason 1 has 13 episodes, most of which are between 15 and 35 minutes long. After that I\u0027ll take a break, and if we\u0027ve reached the Season 2 goal I\u0027ll return with 13 more episodes. If we don\u0027t hit the Season 2 funding goal, I\u0027ll ask patrons to vote on a future direction for the series that\u0027s less time-consuming for me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOccasionally I\u0027ll release one-off audio stories \u2014 both shorter ones, about specific events or milestones in games history or fun/interesting soundbites (\u003ca href=\"http://lifeandtimes.games/soundbite-1-steve-capps-on-bill-gates-playing-bridge\"\u003elike this\u003c/a\u003e story about Bill Gates) from interviews I\u0027ve conducted, and longer ones that dive deeply into a meaty and complex subject. But the core show is 15-35 minute documentaries.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you actually pull this off?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a master\u0027s degree in journalism. I\u0027ve written dozens of multi-sourced long-form feature articles about games history and culture, some of which have \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.spjnetwork.org/kunkel/2017/03/30/best-feature-writing-2016/\"\u003ewon\u003c/a\u003e or been nominated for awards. This kind of research and interview-heavy storytelling is totally my thing, and I\u0027d much rather do it than continue to freelance full time (which requires doing other less interesting kinds of work to pay the bills). \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been a musician most of my life, and I\u0027ve spent the past two years learning audio engineering and production in my spare time. Listen to any of my newer audio work and compare it to my early stuff \u2014 I\u0027d like to think my talent speaks for itself, and I\u0027m only going to get better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m committed to making this show work long-term, but in the end it\u0027ll come down to you. Will you join me on this journey?"
