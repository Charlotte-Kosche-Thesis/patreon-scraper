Stemming from a life changing series written by R.A. Salvatore I was pulled into Menzoberranzan and I never looked back. I was invited to Misscliks to do a campaign with those most amazing crew ever Brit Weisman, Jess syldenn Timmons, Rob Ishtara Dyer, and Nadja Tristarae Otikor. (Whom I did not etc. btw...) and they allowed me to bring Calithra to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom that amazing journey I was inspired to bring this story to life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to provide adventure where anyone can play no matter what kind of time limits they have in their personal lives. Create your own character, provide your own history, change the way the world is shaped and leave permanent impressions. Brand new player to veteran everyone is welcome. To join the weave of like minded people is one of the reasons I started playing games in the first place.\u003cbr\u003eI can not thank my community enough for all their hard work and dedication. Never giving up on our dreams. I have an amazing community and team of people that want to help make your goals our goals. To always remember that even when we are looking to the future that we are still helping every single person in the present. \u003cbr\u003eI look forward to reading your stories, watching your videos, admiring your art. Seeing what each and every single one of you love about this world that I am trying to create.\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t walk the road already built, weave a web all your own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLauralania\"\u003eTia \"Lauralania\" Zimmer\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
