Every day, hundreds of thousands of professionals in these fields go to work to defend us from threats foreign and domestic; yet few civilians really know anything about us -- what we do, how we do it, and why we do it. \u00a0I wanted to bridge this \"civilian gap\" and represent an often shadowed, overlooked element of our foreign policy. So, I started a blog called The Defense Quorum, and had no idea what kind of response we\u0027d get -- but we quickly grew to be one of Quora\u0027s most popular blogs (we breached the top #20 in 2018). \u00a0I was named\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-Rosenthal-6\"\u003eTop Writer four years in a row\u003c/a\u003e, and my content has been published all over the place, including Slate, Huffington Post, Forbes, Gizmodo, Newsweek, etc. \u00a0And with your help, I want to take it even further.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAren\u0027t you a game developer? Is this Patreon about games too?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, it hasn\u0027t really been. To be honest, I\u0027d really love to write more and produce more video content about games. Unfortunately, a lot of what I do as a developer has to be kept under wraps, as I work on teams that deal closely with revenue and design decisions. Plus, I recognize that because of my diverse history -- games, military, diplomacy, intel, etc., I have readers with vastly different interests. So I will include games coverage where I can, and you\u0027ll see it under the \"Games\" tag.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow your patronage helps:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will go towards things that help me keep creating great content to share with you -- things like research subscriptions, editing software and video equipment, building a home for our community online (Patrons are absolutely welcome in our active community on the Defense Quorum Slack!)\u00a0\u00a0I give back a portion of my pledges to other Patreons, Kickstarter campaigns, blogs, and other communities I\u0027m passionate about and that I think you\u0027d be proud to help support. These range from veterans and public servants, to undiscovered gems that tell an important story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all else though, I\u0027m thankful for your support as viewers, readers, and consumers of my content. Listening to what I have to say is the most meaningful thanks you can give. It helps shine a light into dark and scary corners of the world, in the parts of our lives where we rely on mythical heroes in green and tan to protect us. Your support keeps that light shining, and for that I cannot be grateful enough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuns up fam, let\u0027s do this.\u003cbr\u003e-Dan \"Leif\" Rosenthal\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
