Lou?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI know what you\u0027re thinking, who is Lou exactly? Well, Lou is a writer and self-taught artist with a love of the fictional, fantastical, and sci-fi, and a serious writing/drawing habit that she just won\u0027t quit. (She\u0027s also going to stop talking in the third-person now because it\u0027s getting a mite ridiculous). I\u0027m currently unpublished, but with your help, I\u0027d love to change that and become a full fledged published spinner of tales! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy traveling companions in this endeavor are a super hyper basset hound named Sherlock, and a laid back hound dog named Apollo. You\u0027ll see plenty of them on the feed as we go. They\u0027re both stubborn, silly, and a completely\u00a0adorable. The perfect companions for this kind of journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s with Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI consider the journey into the land of the published to be a quest of sorts, and as any good adventurer knows, one does not go on quests alone. For they are dangerous and not without pitfalls. Which is why I\u0027m asking for your help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution, however great or small, will allow me to focus more on my writing and drawing and worry less about... well everything else. I\u0027ll be able to spend more time focused on my personal projects, and less time trying to find new freelance work so I can pay my bills. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlso, this will allow me to connect directly with the most important people in an author\u0027s life, my audience! Or in other words, you guys!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you learn more about what I\u0027m up to?
