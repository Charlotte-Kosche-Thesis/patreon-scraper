    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello people! Thank you for visiting my Patreon. I\u0027m David Kang or Legendav on Youtube and I make video game/anime covers in rock and sometimes metal styles. I have been making Youtube covers for a couple of years and have been loving every minute of it. The amount it has shaped me as a musician as well as the people that I\u0027ve connected through it has been incredible. I would like to keep doing this until the day I die. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic has been my passion\u003c/strong\u003e since I was maybe 12 years old and always dreamed of one day doing it for a living. This is where YOU come in. You, the fans, can donate anywhere between $1, to $50, to a million(not really, please don\u0027t do that to yourself) for every cover I upload! You guys will be directly responsible for any new equipment or software I buy to make my content the best it can be for everyone. Fingers crossed, you guys will be able to help me do this for a living!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet me emphasize that NONE OF THIS IS MANDATORY!\u003c/strong\u003e If you can\u0027t afford to pledge or do not feel comfortable at all with the service, please don\u0027t worry about it. I will still love you all regardless and I will keep uploading every week! Of course donating will get you guys some cool prizes so look to your right for those! Once again I do my best to upload one cover every week. Now this doesn\u0027t entirely mean you\u0027ll be charged every week because you have the ability to limit how much you donate per month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those of you who believe in me enough to support my passion thank you very much. Whether it be through your pledges or even just liking, favoriting, commenting, or sharing my videos, I love you all! I hope that if this ever becomes my official career that I will be able to pay you guys back with some of the best content that my abilities as well as your donations can get. Thank you guys so much for your support, and here\u0027s to a rockin\u0027 future for the Legendav channel! \u0026lt;3"
