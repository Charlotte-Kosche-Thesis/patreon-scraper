Until four months ago,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hustlermagazine.com/#!anniversary-2017-features-madam-lydia-faithfull-brothel-queen/pub1704\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI was the youngest brothel Madam in Nevada.\u003c/a\u003e A classic Type A martyr who often worked eighteen hour days and went months without taking time off. Despite my rigorous commitment, when professional promises went unfulfilled, I left quietly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life in the Mojave Desert is solitary and spartan. I\u0027ve always lived hard. For years, the bulk of my income has come from sex work. First illegally as an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/vv59ey/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-sex-work-but-were-afraid-to-ask\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eindependent escort\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brothelcast.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethen legally in Nevada brothels\u003c/a\u003e, sometimes through phone sex and webcamming, and most favorably as a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fetlife.com/users/4821709\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eProfessional Dominatrix\u003c/a\u003e. For years, I managed to convince myself that I felt indifferent toward sex work. Writing has been my lifelong passion, but the pay is often low and infrequent. As a freelancer, I typically wait weeks to receive a $200 - $400 check. When funds are low, I purchase a few erotic ads online and turn a costly trick or two. Likely not what my mother had in mind when she suggested I \"get myself a trade\" as a wayward youth, but I digress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast week, the independent publisher\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://badlandsunlimited.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBadlands Unlimited\u003c/a\u003e (Founded by New York artist Paul Chan and inspired by Maurice Girodias\u0027 legendary Olympia Press, the publishing house of Bataille, Beckett, Nabokov, Jean Genet, etc) contacted me at the suggestion of my new friend, brilliant novelist\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZDDK84/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awdb_qB0tzbYXRPS71\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTamara Faith Berger\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0She\u0027d sent them a link to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/topic/lydia-faithfull?topic_id=584787de068ed4026771f71c\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Ask a Hooker\"\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0my sexual advice column for VICE Media\u0027s women\u0027s channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBroadly\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Micaela Durand, director of Badlands, wondered if I\u0027d be interested in writing a novella for their celebrated erotica fiction series,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/03/10/new-lovers-an-interview-with-paul-chan/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew Lovers\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0There are nine books total, all authored by women and each uniquely different in tone. Badlands was founded by artists in hopes of shaking up the publishing industry. They create book trailers and have premiered erotica readings at the Guggenheim, receiving praise from the Paris Review and New York Times. Without question, I\u0027d be proud to attach my name to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Badlands does offer a commission, I assure you that it\u0027s quite modest and doesn\u0027t cover one month of my rent. Not knocking them; it\u0027s tough to be an independent anything these days. I feel immense guilt and shame in asking for assistance to write this book. A bit like if I called my parents and begged to move into their basement. I\u0027m asking for your help so that I can focus exclusively on writing this book and abstain from sex work in the process. While it does put food on my table, it also serves as continued disruption to my creative self.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is that I\u0027ve come to loathe sex work and resent objectifying myself. To be clear, I don\u0027t begrudge those who find it liberating or wish to contribute to the stigma that plagues sex workers. I have no love for the evangelistic, anti-prostitution rescue industry or believe sex work to be inherently problematic.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/7855dg/a-sex-worker-explains-how-she-separates-her-work-from-her-sex-life\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIt has, however, become harmful to me.\u003c/a\u003e Saying so publicly will likely be interpreted as treasonous by my peers, but this is my truth. I support sex worker\u0027s rights but refuse to glamorize my experience to keep in line with my politics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t regard this as me essentially holding a gun to my vagina and threatening to rent her out without your patronage. I\u0027m responsible for my own choices. My hope is that perhaps you can afford me the opportunity to write untethered while hanging onto my humanity.
