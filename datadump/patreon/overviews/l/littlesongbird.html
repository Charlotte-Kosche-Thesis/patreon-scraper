    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Delaney Little, also known as Little Songbird Cosplay. I\u0027ve been cosplaying for over two years now and I have a passion for bringing characters to life through carefully constructed cosplays. The most important thing for me when creating my cosplays is accuracy, as I feel that it\u0027s crucial to pay attention to fine details the creators saw fit to add to designs. This has led to requests for patterns from some other cosplayers. So far my most requested patterns are for the skirt of Elizabeth Comstock\u0027s first outfit in the game \u003cem\u003eBioShock Infinite, \u003c/em\u003eCiri\u0027s corset from \u003cem\u003eThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0and Mad Moxxi\u0027s jacket from the \u003cem\u003eBorderlands\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0series. I would love to make patterns available to other cosplayers, but it is an arduous process which requires me to take time away from my own cosplay projects, as well as commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to produce content which will help others create the cosplays of their dreams. Because of this, I am going to post patterns, tutorials, budget cosplay guides, and reviews on a variety of products found in the cosplayer\u0027s arsenal. If you would like to support my work in a monetary fashion, that would be amazing! However, please do not feel obligated to do so. I will be leaving this as an open Patreon, accepting donations, but not requiring them in order to view any content. All I ask is that if you use a guide or pattern I created, that you properly credit me. Artists get most of their business through word of mouth, so it\u0027s important to credit them. This community should be about supporting one another and helping newcomers as much as we can, so please enjoy the content posted here at your leisure."
