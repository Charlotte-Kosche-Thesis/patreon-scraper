I have stories I been dying to share with everyone but was too afraid to show anyone so this is my way of getting out of my shell and giving it a shot. My comic Is not perfect but because it is not perfect doesn\u0027t mean i can\u0027t finish it. So I\u0027m hoping you will join my on this adventure with my old and new characters including Ligax (ME) and how she came to be the person she is today. I also have other small stories that will post up from time to time. I love you guys thank you all for your support! I can\u0027t wait to see what you guys think.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/x34f9la.png\" style=\"width: 267px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mzZxW0f.png\" style=\"width: 256px;\"\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bzkNbZf.png\" style=\"width: 200px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sAirWEo.png\" style=\"width: 192px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/j7XrktQ.png\" style=\"width: 208px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit about my arts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like Digital Painting,drawing cartoons both human and animals alike but my focus on this page are my Web-comic,creating meaningful art pieces and drawing my characters. I like using super saturated colors and unusual background too i try to stay away dull colors unless it is needed to show a particular emotion using colors.I really wanted my drawing to show places you can only imagine, an escape from our reality, like a happy place you know.\u003cbr\u003eI will be working hard to provide some quality enjoyable content for you guys! Drawing has been my one and only passion since I was little...so any support to keep doing what I love most is more than appreciated. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goal\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI started this patreon as a means to fund my passion and my stories. Basically this Patreon page will help me live my dream, and hopefully bring my patrons some happiness too. \u003cbr\u003eI want to keep this as my full time job. I have many plans for art books, comic book (SFW + NSFW), more process videos, 3d statues,private and public livestream events and much more.\u003cbr\u003eIf things take off on here and I reach some of my goals, I\u0027ll be able to offer much much more! Like full colour monthly sexy pin ups ;) With NSFW options (gasp) So stay tuned and tell your friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat to expect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of original my comic and personal work, I plan to do a number of fan art works as well. As tiers unlock I\u0027ll also be holding polls where my patrons will be deciding who I draw next each month! So expect a good mixture of my own characters,\u00a0 comics and fan art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is how Patreon it works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will now charge first-time pledges upfront. This means your payment will be processed right away and once cleared, can access the feed with content in it. After the initial pledge, you\u0027ll then be charged every 5th of each month. \u003cbr\u003eJust choose whatever amount you feel you\u2019d like to donate. Keep in mind that depending on what you pledge, you\u0027ll receive certain content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample:\u003c/strong\u003e So if you sign up on the 20th of January, you\u0027ll be charged right away that day, and then again on February 1st, and from then on, only the 5th of each following month. You\u0027re not getting charged twice, the pledge on the 20th is treating it as if you had pledged on the 5th of that month, and you\u0027d be welcome to the files and stuff I sent out to the rest of the Patreon on that month\u0027s start.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support for my artwork!\u003cbr\u003eIf you have suggestions or ideas, don\u0027t hesitate to voice them i\u0027m still new to patreon so ill take any advice i can get!\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more of my art as well as all my free and finished content in the following places:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ligax.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ligax.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/ligax/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/ligax/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://gailkitty.wixsite.com/goodwinanimations/por...\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://gailkitty.wixsite.com/goodwinanimations/por...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://gailkitty.wixsite.com/kawaiiarts/gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://gailkitty.wixsite.com/kawaiiarts/gallery\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/peritian/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://youtu.be/uCYISuLL8-0\u003c/a\u003e - here you can see a speed paint video i did check it out this is where ill upload my videos sometimes."
