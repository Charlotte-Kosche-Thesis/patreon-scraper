Mike here, I\u0027ve recently started my career as a YouTuber(https://www.youtube.com/c/LittleFattyGG) after learning from Jumpcut Academy(a group of successful YouTubers training people who work hard, to succeed in the platform.) \u003cbr\u003eAfter starting off my YouTube channel, within a week I got close to 100 Subs!(Some people don\u0027t even get 50 subs in years!). But we\u0027re not gonna stop there! So let me get to the point, I\u0027ve started a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eIt took me 27 years of my life, but I finally found what I\u0027m passionate about. I want to do this full-time, but I need your help by becoming one of my Patrons! For as little as $1 a month(you probably have that much in loose change somewhere), but $1, although not much by itself, but when enough people pledge\u003cbr\u003eyou can enable me get closer to doing this full-time that much faster. Thank you in advance! All the best, Mike.\u003cbr\u003e"
