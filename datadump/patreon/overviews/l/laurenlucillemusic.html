    "summary": "I can\u0027t help but write music. It gets\nme out of bed in the middle of the night, or tugs at me as I just sit down to\neat lunch. There are many voice recordings on my phones of ideas from the years past and I want to put them all down in recordings somehow....\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove and Beauty is what I strive for.\nDoesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m \u0027fantastic\u0027 at BEING those things at all times - but it means\nthat\u0027s what I strive for!  I feel like I succeed when someone comments on\nmy youtube videos, requests their favourite song at a show or say to me after a\nshow \u0027Damn you Lauren, you made me cry!!\u0027  with an overwhelmed look in\ntheir eyes!  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m an honest songwriter. I speak it how it is\nfor me in a simple way coz that\u0027s how I am!  Most of my songs are\nstories straight out of my own life (mostly love life).  I love how there is soooo much music out\nthere and there\u2019s always someone out there who\u2019s going to relate to someone\nelse\u2019s music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you relate to my music, if it\nmakes you smile, if it makes you cry, if you feel you need to share it when you\nhear it, if you play it every time someone comes to dinner, if it inspires you\nto paint, learn, create\u2026 If it moves you in any way, then please support me\nhere \u2013 even the tiniest bit of help counts! I promise! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve lived in London since October\n2014. I had a successful music teaching business in Australia but I always\nwanted to come back to Europe to travel and sing and build my career!! But geeeez this town is hard\nwork!!!\u00a0 I work hard (like every other budding artist I know!!), building up my teaching business and my music\ncareer. I have music I want to sell to other artists, and I have music I want\nto keep as my own.  I want to put out\nmore videos and merchandise. I want to get more creative and I would love a\nlittle more incentive (hence coming onto Patreon!) As I said \u2013 every little bit\ncounts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU:\u003cbr\u003eI can write music for you - words and music, or I can write music to your poems... I will send you things - snippets of new material, ask for feedback maybe..\u00a0 and give you opportunities that only Lauren Lucille patreons will get.. I can also draw a little.. so maybe I can draw you also! If you can think of anything you would like from me - as an artist - let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you to all of my fans/friends/family\nso far for supporting me the way you do. Please help spread the love and beauty\nI am always going on about\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLove to you all\u003cbr\u003e\n\nxoxo"
