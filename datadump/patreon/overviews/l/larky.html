I see this as a new reality for humanity, emerging as a new human experience made possible by a physical and virtual (digital) network of \u0027co-creative hubs\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin this network of hubs everyone collaborates and shares unconditionally, so that everyone in the network is provided with food, water, shelter, energy, and anything else they need to pursue their passion in good health, in alignment with source (\u0027the whole\u0027). What they co-create within the hub network is shared freely, and where a creation is monetized outside of the membrane of the community, the profit is used to scale up and expand the community, and support those inside it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community is open and welcoming, and expands organically; everyone recognises they are all inter-dependent, as they have always been, and always will be (this is the nature of existence).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see this emerging network of \u0027co-creative hubs\u0027 distributed throughout the planet, and co-creators travelling freely between hubs, \u003cstrong\u003eliving within the network\u003c/strong\u003e rather than a fixed location. Ultimately we will be able to live in the planet as a whole. The\u00a0Earth will be our home, and we will know ourselves as the Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePAYF = Pay What You Feel\u00a0(in your heart)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this time of transition I have been inspired to adopt the above philosophy of \"pay what you feel\".\u00a0Based on the value you receive from what I share, if you have money to share please give what feels good and appropriate for you. In this way, when I receive something I will perceive it as a gift, and/or a symbol of appreciation and encouragement, from your heart to mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will not perceive $3 dollars a month as any more or less of an expression of gratitude and appreciation than $300, as I am aware that how much money one has to share and gift varies massively. However, the more money I have access to, the more I can share and give back, and the more I can channel my creativity...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not afraid to use large amounts of money. I am serious about my vision, and I fully intend to have a global impact with my work and co-creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recognize how money can be used in a negative way, which is harmful;\u00a0I want to have a healthy relationship with money, and use it for the greater good of all. I want to be an example of what is possible; I want to be part of a growing eco-system, a community, where we use money fearlessly and couragously to benefit everyone on the planet until \u003cstrong\u003ewe are \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e abundant and free\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCo-creation in The Now\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I am working on the following things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eVisions and ideas\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHealing and personal empowerment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCosmic reality\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSystems and technology\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonal (vlog; my story)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoftware\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eProgramming, R\u0026amp;D (research \u0026amp; development)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCo-creative (tools for collaboration)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHolographic, holonic/holonomic, noospheric, synergistic (tools for expanding consciousness and augmenting perception)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArtificial intelligence (automation, labour saving devices)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGlobal Community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNetworking, building relationships\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eForming new connections and synergies\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSharing and co-creating a global vision\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFacilitating\u00a0coherence and perception\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCo-creating a new language (of co-creation)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
