    "summary": "THIS PAGE IS NOW SHUT DOWN. WE ARE MEETING IN THE SPACE BEYOND THE NOISE. THE SPACE OF NO ENERGY CREATION. THANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, friends! My name is Lauren Hutton. I\u0027m a writer and adventurer in the embodied enlightenment experience. Patreon has become a sacred space to share my experiences at a deeper level than I do on my website and in my books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, patrons report feeling safe to share intimately and interact with one another. We are a fun, supportive community dedicated to the embodied enlightenment experience, or Triple E, and we also have a private Facebook group page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom March 13th - April 13th, I facilitated a \"30 Days of Self Love\" experience. Each day, I explored through blog posts and videos what allowing self-love looked like for me as my dog, Professor Ollie, and I traveled down the coast of Oregon and California in my truck. Patrons interacted and explored what self love meant to them, and many shared their journey as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting July 3rd, we explored senses of the soul. Soul senses are ways of perceiving reality beyond human thoughts and emotions with an expanded state of awareness. Also,\u00a0El Morya \u00a0took us through a journey exploring the systems in which we \noperate in, diving deeply into the concept of sovereignty, the \nself-governing nature of the soul, and the differences between human judgement and soul discernment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next series began September 1 with the Magic of BEING, which will run through January 1. El Morya maintains enlightenment is not a destination but an existence, a way of BEING, and I explored that as I travel across the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround September, we also began to explore moving from human free will and stepping into divine will, or the third circle of creation. No energy creation is also synonymous with the Ahmyo life, talked about in Crimson Circle materials right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 75 percent of patrons did come out of the the Crimson Circle and have graduated. The other 25 percent came out of other schools of conscouisness that vary widely and provide a fresh perspective. We are all graduates of spiritual/ conscious teachings, though we do talk about it some as it applies to no energy creation and sinking deep into the embodied enlightenment experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here, you know there is no one size fits all model in this embodied enlightenment experience, yet there are commonalities among us. This is not the space to teach but rather open energetic pathways through sharing with each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, (Ascended Master) El Morya serves as the friendly advisor from the \"other side\" and adds the ascended perspective as well as sharing his own embodied enlightenment experience from the late 1800s in linear time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI greatly appreciate your time, support, and friendship. If we have\nnot virtually met, please reach out. I would love to hear from you! I can be reached at beingenlightenment@gmail.com and you can read my public writing at beingenlightenment.com. I have recently left newenergycreator.com for good. \u00a0After two years with the project, I have stepped full time into no energy creation and, as I wrote in my book, being a vessel for the will of God (self).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally of note, the $1 commitment per month is simply a buffer to keep this place from turning into a Facebook group page. It\u0027s keeps the community small - limited to 77, we have 55 right now. I do not need the money for anything, so if you are concerned about your pledge amount, fret not, for we are in the age of SELF that is no energy creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe overhead costs here are only the energy needed to type with my hands. Thus, I have no professional editor, so if you have problems with the errors, you have just signed yourself up for the editing job, which pays $0/ hour. Who cares if we\u0027re not always perfectly shiny and sleek.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the proceeds from Patreon go directly to publishing costs of my books. That\u0027s about $2,500 to date. You will find I am extra transparent - almost to a fault - that is if I had anything to lose or hide - I don\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn gratitude and in the JOY of BEING,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eLauren/ Sar\u0027h \u0026amp; El Morya\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
