We will refer to you as \u0027My Lord\u0027 and watch with glee as all other patrons grovel in your majesty. Ownership of the Crown, and title, is dependent on duration of sponsorship level and total contributed. You\u0027ll get a mention in every episode and the opportunity to record the occasional cold open (pending reasonable limitations). Don\u0027t let one of those upstart plebeians take your crown though, renew that membership tier and cement your royal reputation.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is also a clever way to force us to advertise your product, service, or site.
