    "summary": "Greetings and welcome\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming to my Patreon page! :)\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my music, and would like to help me to be able to create more of it, while getting access to exclusive patron-only content, then you\u0027ve come to the right place! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way to directly connect artists and their appreciators. For as little as mere pocket change a month, those who love an artist are able to donate whatever amount they please so that the artists they love are able to create more of the art that they love. Pretty simple, aye?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what does that monthly contribution go towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my case...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Studio time. Do you know that, on average, a Living Light track takes about 3 weeks to produce? This means 3 weeks of full time studio work with extra little time for earning other income during those hours. Your pledge goes directly into giving me MORE time to write MORE of the music you love!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. System upgrades and equipment. Producing electronic music is not cheap. Programs need to be purchased, software needs to be updated, and gear costs a pretty penny. With your support, I will be able to upgrade my extremely outdated digital audio workstation programs, which will allow me to update my operating system (which is still from 2012 because I can\u0027t afford to purchase new compatible music software). I will also be able to upgrade my DJ gear so that I can get even more creative on stage. All of this will greatly enhance the quality of music I will be able to make and perform!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Mastering. My new album is halfway done, and then I\u0027ll need to figure out how to afford the thousand+ dollars needed to master it somehow. Your monthly support will allow me to final and most important phase of the album production process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Album artwork. I\u0027m hoping to have a spectacular cover for the upcoming album, and visual artists need to be compensated, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Moar shows! With your support, I will be better able to step away from my daily grind to play in your area, including benefit shows, and for-exposure shows, for which I need to pay for my own transportation and lodging. And yes, this includes my big dream of playing Europe and Australia!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Other awesome Living Lightey things. \u003cbr\u003eStickers? Shirts? Music video? The skies the limit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, artists have no safety net and no guarantee of regular income. Your monthly support here means that the artists you support can rest easy and focus more on the ART and less on becoming homeless or wondering where their next meal is going to come from. Plus, you\u0027ll get access to content not available anywhere else. So it\u0027s a win/win!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf every fan on my Facebook and Soundcloud Living Light pages pledged at least $1-$3 a month, I could focus on music 100% and never have to worry about where my next meal was coming from again.\u00a0That\u0027s half the price of a cup of coffee. Would you pledge a half cup of coffee per month if you knew it was helping an artist you love make more of the things you love? :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and for you consideration of support. So much love to all of you that have been with me so far on this journey. I couldn\u0027t do this without you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEartha Harris / Living Light\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eps.
