We have been cosplaying together since 2013. We are also big fans of video games! Video games were the thing that brought us to cosplay: we just got a spontaneous desire to bring our favorite game characters to life. In addition, we like creating stuff with our own hands, bringing to life different scenes by making beautiful photos, and transforming ourselves in many different ways. All of these aspects met together in our main hobby and passion \u2013 cosplay. Although we adore video games, now our choice of characters is not limited to them only. We are trying to pay attention to our favorite heroes from movies, tv-show and cartoons, so everyone will find something to their liking in our creations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c841436/v841436212/63414/Hm2bSXjj89I.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen we\u2019ve just started making cosplay five years ago, we didn\u2019t know much and weren\u0027t capable of anything, so we used the help of different masters and creators. Now we are doing our best to become masters ourselves. We learned a lot of new, got different skills, bought some equipment, and these days we are trying to make our cosplays completely by ourselves (down to the smallest details). Moreover, we\u2019ve started to take commissions of some props, and we are really happy that not only we like what we do, but our customers too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c830208/v830208218/62f8c/FOCHbhyltJs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to your support we can achieve even more, use advanced technologies and sophisticated techniques, buy expensive and high-quality materials, find more unique and magic locations for our photoshoots, visit more conventions in different cities, and bring to life more of our favorite characters, making cosplay more often, faster and better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you will decide to support us and become our patron, in addition to our endless gratitude there also will be a lot of different exclusive materials available to you: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA bunch of additional photo- and video materials, such as \u003cstrong\u003ebackstages\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003emakeup tries\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ecosplay tests\u003c/strong\u003e, shots from conventions, \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive photos\u003c/strong\u003e from photoshoots and also \u003cstrong\u003eHDs\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eprints\u003c/strong\u003e; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInformation about our current cosplay projects, such as \u003cstrong\u003efuture plans\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ecostume and prop making inprogresses\u003c/strong\u003e, our \u003cstrong\u003esecret ideas\u003c/strong\u003e for photoshoots, \u003cstrong\u003eplans\u003c/strong\u003e for travel to the conventions and so on.

There also will be some cosplay parts (not ours, brand new pieces, of course) - it can be some kind of weapon, or piece of clothing, or a wig with hairstyle, all made by us - anything our fantasy will let us offer to you!",
