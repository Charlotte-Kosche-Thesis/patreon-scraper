It all started back in college when I started my first little business out of my dorm room (selling t-shirts). From then until now I have had one overall theme in the choices I made, and it was all about deconstructing conventional wisdom to \n\u003cstrong\u003efollow an unconventional path.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI have found that my experiences in these pursuits help a lot of others looking for the answers when it comes to figuring out how best to follow to the beat of their own drum.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why I began building a community around this exact philosophy. The community is called\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.lifenomading.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLife Nomading\u003c/a\u003e and it is made up of people just like myself. Those who want more out of life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd this is where you come in. You see, for the last two years I have been creating a lot of content for the community whether it be podcasts, blog articles, and now videos. This is a lot of work, and don\u0027t get me wrong I love doing it. However, with work comes a lot of time and it is making growing these efforts harder and harder as the community grows.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon seemed like a perfect solution. I want to be able to lead the charge in providing insight to this growing community, and I need your help. The funds raised here on Patreon will not only go towards my ability to keep the content regular, but help to heighten the production value of the podcasts, videos, and blog articles.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are examples of our Life Nomading podcast episodes!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247730932\u0026amp;color=ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247729912\u0026amp;color=ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor a rough example of what taking to the skies in video could be like:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zw1GKsN3tw\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnywho,\u00a0I want to let everyone know that it is my intention to keep the content I provide always free to the public. You as a patron will be providing your dollars towards any new podcast or video produced. I anticipate that you can expect 2-3 new pieces of content a month. Mind you, blog articles will never count towards what you are contributing for. Those come along for the ride fully free and fun :)... It\u0027s because of you that I will be able to do this, and I thank you in advance for any value you put on my creations, it means the world. I look forward to meeting you in episodes, videos, and articles to come."
