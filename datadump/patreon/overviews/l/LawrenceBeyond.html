Movie and Cinematic Game-Trailers are my realm of work and enjoyment and at this point of my life I too wanna be part of this huge Community of Content-Creators. Growing, learning, improving my English the best I possibly can and make some bright new connections, \u003cem\u003ebeyond\u003c/em\u003e the confines of the Swiss neutral-zone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I SEEKING FOR YOUR HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, let me tell you a bit about a live-episode of mine: In 2011, due to re-organisation, changes of management and multiple acquisitions taken place within the company I worked for and the following mobbing experiences I had to go through, I decided at long last to quit my job, in order to free my self from the daily psychosomatic stress and depression I was subjected to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA tough decision. Since then I tried to find a new job elsewhere. I did, but they didn\u0027t last long and ever since the economic crisis, finding a job, finding a good company carrying on morally, human-friendly conditions, has become very rare these days. By the time being I\u0027m very much unemployed, relying on and eating up my savings. All of this can bring any person to loose faith in him self - to doubt in this world, the actual economical system and its saturated, employment market, which is just unable to offer reasonable jobs anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNonetheless, I intend to use that time to create and shift my present and future life for the better, by producing creative and entertaining contents on weekly basis - making out of this my daily job, hopefully. And I\u0027m going to do it with proper passion and dedication. So, if you think my content is worth a donation,\u00a0and if you wanna help me to\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eprevent my loss of freedom and dignity due to social assistance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eplease, reach me an helping hand! I\u0027d rather be dependent by people, but by an institution.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEACH HELPING HAND CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHerewith, I wish to address my call of human support to you, to all my Subscribers out there and to whomever is reading this and feel kinda connected with my situation.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d like to state furthermore, that if I could afford the money my self, I\u0027d not ask for that kind of support in the first place - in true honesty.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not able to support the channel financially, I totally understand it. Your participation as a viewer and commenter is as equally precious - just in a different way. Besides that, \u003cstrong\u003ewithout your subscription\u003c/strong\u003e, I couldn\u0027t have started this campaign in the first place. \u003cstrong\u003eSo, thank you for that alone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
