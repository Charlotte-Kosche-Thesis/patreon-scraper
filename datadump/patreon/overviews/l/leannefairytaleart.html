Having suffered depression for a while I have realised just how important it is to stay creative and help to inspire others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for fantasy and fairytale creatures and places. I work from my mind to create unique OOAK pieces and my Patrons will receive little bonus gifts like cards/bookmarks that contain my paintings and illustrations. As well as those gifts I will create tutorials and youtube videos of my creations which only my patrons will have access to. I\u0027m fully qualified as an artist and teacher so my skills in the field will enable me to help guide you in your own journey too (if you are also creative)\u003cbr\u003eFinally, without babbling too much, we all know how tough it is to make it in such a tough industry, but I hope my unique style will appeal to you, and my friendly hippie nature will help you to feel happy and grow. Thanks so much for your time and I look forward to sharing my work with you!"
