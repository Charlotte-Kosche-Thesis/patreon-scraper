    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eThe most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time\u003c/em\u003e.\" - Mary Oliver\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Midwest-born-and-raised, currently California-based multidisciplinary artist. I make daily illustrated stories in ink and watercolor, and I am an adventurer, traveler, and visual journalist. My life started out on a much more conventional path, as I marched through school and collected degrees that were supposed to bring me security and comfort. Instead of asking, \"What will I get out of it?\", I started asking, \"Who will I become as a result of this?\". This question has guided each of the important and difficult decisions I have made over the years, to give both power and time to my creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2009, I have done the work of discovering a creative practice I can do daily, with joy and consistency. In the process, I have invested my own savings, used credit cards, worked retail, taught classes, and been supported by family and clients, doing everything imaginable to keep alive this clear calling to create my own art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy daily art-making started in earnest in 2014, with my acceptance into an exhibition featuring 50 small artworks created in 50 days. You can see the blog of that process\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://5050art.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days, I am into ink and watercolor sketches and illustrations with words and images woven together. I am interested in a long-term project of creating a nonfiction book of all illustrated text and images, in the re-emerging genre of painted stories or visual journalism. I create a one-page daily illustrated journal, called \"Before 10am\". I have been doing this every day since July 2016, and sharing it on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/drlisachu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/drlisachu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and with my Facebook friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wildtomatoarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LISA-CHU-Teton-ArtLab-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fascination with public land conservation and travel have led me to create sketches as I journeyed through the Southwestern United States, as a volunteer at Yosemite National Park, and most recently, at Gettysburg National Park and surrounding Civil War battlefield sites.

Through this site, you can make a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly donation\u003c/strong\u003e in support of my \u003cstrong\u003eongoing\u003c/strong\u003e work, and discover other independent artists and opportunities to support their ongoing work. Unlike project-based crowdfunding sites you may already know about (like Kickstarter), which are designed to raise large amounts of money for a single project, Patreon is designed to cultivate long-term patrons of artists\u0027 work, with monthly amounts to fit any budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a bold new model in the quest to keep artists independently creating and sharing work with more people, not just collectors but anyone in the world who has access to the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a way to pay people directly for their work. Work that you personally enjoy or benefit from in some way, or work you simply believe in. It\u0027s a way for you to vote with your dollars, at whatever level works for you. It\u0027s a virtual tip jar where you can symbolically high five, offer encouragement, and say to your favorite independent artist, \"Keep going! I love you!\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArts patronage has existed throughout the centuries. But now, patronage is not limited to the few aristocrats and their tastes. It is wide open to the world to participate in. We\u0027re all in this together! From $1 to $100, \u003cstrong\u003eevery single patron makes a difference\u003c/strong\u003e in my ability to continue creating and offering Wild Tomato Arts, wild and free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow much of my donation do you actually get?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon collects 5% of each donation, and PayPal collects 2% of each donation, capped at $1 per transaction. The rest goes to the artist (me).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow committed are you as an artist?\u003c/h3\u003eThis is what I do. I have been, and will be, making the art anyway. I am very self-motivated, and reaching out to ask for support has been a stretch for me. Many of you have watched me start from scratch and teach myself art for the past three years. What I hope to create with this Patreon community is the foundation of \u003cstrong\u003esupport\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003etime\u003c/strong\u003e to complete my projects and reach wider audiences by pursuing partnerships, while continuing to grow and develop my skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat if I want to give a one-time donation?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!
