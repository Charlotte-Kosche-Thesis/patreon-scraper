Everything from celestial bakers to the trials of a woman with mysterious scars. If you relish the freedom of a man who can turn into a roe, or would follow a lady through the nine circles of the Underworld - then this is the place for you. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e - I\u0027m Lisa Stock, an award-winning filmmaker and photographer based in New York. My films have been featured in festivals and screenings around the world including London, Cannes, New York, Boston, Hong Kong, Sydney, aired on PBS, and been chosen as a Kickstarter \"Project of the Day\". My work combines the glimmer of magic with gritty reality - and a bit of humor.

I truly believe art has the power to heal in so many ways. As an extension of the kindness and generosity shown me here, I\u0027ll donate ALL contributions I receive through Patreon in the month of December to a charitable organization.\u00a0(Last year the AWARE Wildlife Center, helping injured wildlife in urban areas, was our beneficiary)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMagic realism is not an escape from reality - but wraps our world in metaphor and gives a new perspective on the issues around us.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eCurrent and Coming Soon: Giants in Windows!
