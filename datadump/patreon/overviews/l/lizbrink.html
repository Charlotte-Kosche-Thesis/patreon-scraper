I\u0027m Liz, and my life got kind of fucked up in 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomewhere around May 15, I was preparing to move out of the house that I had shared with my soon-to-be ex-husband and our children, and I felt like the weight of the impending change was going to stop my heart from beating right there in my therapist\u0027s office. \"I can\u0027t do this,\" I said. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You are innately and infinitely resilient, Liz. You are already DOING this,\" she said to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here I am, in the middle of a transformation, and I want to capture it. The heartbreak of divorce and the struggle of split custody and single mothering is testing my resilience, and I want to share this part of my story as it\u0027s happening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next 12 months, I am going to bring you into the process of creating a book that documents my journey from here to there. Each month, I will share essays, poems, playlists, and photos that chronicle my challenges and memorialize my metamorphosis as I learn and grow in this new life as a single mom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a great song by Gregory Alas Isakov called The Universe that goes, \"The universe, she\u0027s wounded, but she\u0027s got infinity ahead of her.\" This project finds me at that precise moment, looking at my wounds, and staring at the expanse ahead of me. It\u0027s overwhelming and invigorating. And I\u0027m grateful that you\u0027re here with me. Let\u0027s go.\u003cbr\u003e"
