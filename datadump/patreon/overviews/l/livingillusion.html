    "summary": "First of all, thank you for your support.\u00a0 I am extremely grateful you are here. Allow me to introduce myself and share with you my creative madness...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an artist and I am working on several projects while maintaining the day job at a local theatre. Between shifts, I carve out time to feed my creative soul. I have several projects in progress that are ultimately interlinked. I consider myself a storyteller and I am passionate about spinning tales in both illustrated and written form. I need your help to make the stories running through my imagination come to life in both\u00a0 written word as well as illustrations and paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI participated in NaNoWriMo 2016 with a goal of writing a 50,000 fantasy novel during the month of November. I have achieved this goal and more! By the end of the challenge, I had written over 60,000 words and the rough draft had only been 75% complete. NaNoWriMo was a successful catalyst for creativity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of February 2017, I have completed the very first rough draft of my novel only to discover that I have the potential to delve deeper and develop my fantasy world and characters further, giving it far more layers and depth than I had ever imagined. With a manuscript now over 400 pages long I realized quickly that I did not just have one single story to tell. Currently, I have begun to critically edit the novel, Part One: The Anchor, The Sword, and The Fugitive no in the hands of it\u0027s first editor. I am both excited and a bit intimidated by the task, however the hardest part is over: I have the story down on paper! It no longer exists just in the depth of my imagination. Now I have begun to work on the visuals. I am sure I drive my loved ones bonkers with my mad ravings about plot points and my struggles with character design and development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have thus far met all of my creative goals for these fantasy novels. The next one has been set!\u00a0 I would like to take you along this journey and share with you my creative process and samples of the story. Now that Part One: The Anchor, the Sword, and the Fugitive has been written and being edited, I am story boarding and mapping out where I want the story to go visually as well as editing and writing Part Two: The Blood Born Sun. My personal rough deadline for this Summer 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA daunting task, I know. One that will take a great deal of creative time, effort, late night coffee in the studio and maybe a few tears, but in the end it will be worth it. Since I was a teenager, I had wanted to write these stories, doodled these characters, and there they sat in the back of my mind stewing in my imagination for over a decade. Heck, I was so dedicated to these stories, when I turned eighteen my first tattoo had been symbols that represented the characters and world of Rathvyn. Here I am, over fifteen years later returning to what I started. These people that live in my head never went away, never faded out of my imagination. Instead, they have returned with fervor wanting their stories told. Who am I as an artist and a storyteller to deny them?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
