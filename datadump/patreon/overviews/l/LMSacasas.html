    "summary": "Broadly speaking, I write about technology and society. But once you start to think about technology, you realize that it\u0027s complicated. Technology intersects almost every conceivable dimension of our lives. So when you start talking about technology you may very well end up talking about philosophy, sociology, history, economics, law, psychology, art, language, medicine, and much else besides.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of the writing we\u0027re likely to encounter about technology focuses on pragmatic considerations and aims at either affirmation or denunciation. In both cases, there\u0027s not a great deal of thought involved. What we tend to get is a cost benefit analysis to determine whether a technology is \"good\" or \"bad.\" What we need instead is reflection and thought about the meaning of technology and how it shapes our experience of the world. It is this kind of thinking and writing about technology that I aim to provide. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work on technology and society I conduct as an independent scholar, or a recovering academic if you prefer. It has been a labor of love. I earn my keep as a teacher. My goal for this page is both modest and straightforward: to enlist my writing in the work of supporting my family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my writing appears at my \u003ca href=\"https://thefrailestthing.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, occasionally\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thefrailestthing.com/writings/\"\u003eelsewhere\u003c/a\u003e. Writing on my own platform grants a measure of freedom regarding the themes that are taken up and how they are addressed. I write about current developments and about the history of technology, and, while I tackle a variety of issues related to technology, the question that is never far from my mind is this: How can we live well and wisely with technology? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProjects that I hope develop in the near future include a sustained exploration of the meaning of parenthood and, to a lesser degree, childhood in the digital age as well as a reconsideration of modernity as a technologically enchanted reality. If this page is at all successful, I would also aim to provide a regular digest of important developments in the world of technology, a resource source for those who want to better understand how technology is shaping there lives and the world around them but don\u0027t have the time to hunt down wise and well-informed work they can trust. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think this kind of work is useful and valuable, consider lending your support to make more of it possible.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
