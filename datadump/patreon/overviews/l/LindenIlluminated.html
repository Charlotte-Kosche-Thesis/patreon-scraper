Painting gives me contentment, keeps me sane, and makes me feel like a positive force in the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I play with paint, sew with thread, and generally art all over all the things. What sort of Art you ask? Interesting? Often. Historical? Why sure. Period appropriate? Some of the time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically I make period illuminations for SCA. Historically inspired arts for other groups, Larps, and mundane clients. I also sew a lot with various degrees of competency.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpreading knowledge is my ultimate goal. Keeping everyone inspired and learning. Even if that inspiration is to fix something that I entirely failed to do. Honest and open process removes that layer of mystery, and enables everyone in your community to improve. And when you help raise the level of your community, your community makes you better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would rather help out by sending a one time gift of materials, here is my wish list!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fregistry%2Fwishlist%2F2H64W2H6TGW55%2Fref%3Dnav_wishlist_lists_4\u0026amp;h=ATMkqTfDQ2gAWOYnUiVemToiY5xG-dPm91urB-5n1Hl-TBSZEa19afZ98Mi7ZYG_fAe0LCgiL47ViF0y6hqV4AIHA7BU1hpc0fvjRajboh72dEYFGCeAHBDqaJxykf723ApX2tgH\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2H64W2H6TGW55/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_4\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!
