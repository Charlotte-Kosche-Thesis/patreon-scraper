My name is Liam Alexandre, and I\u0027m a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gettingtheretv.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideomaker\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been making things for YouTube consistently since I was 12. Since then, I\u0027ve made vlogs, music, sketch comedy and more, none of which I\u0027m especially proud of, and so I decided in April 2015 that it was time to move on from these things and start a new chapter. For this reason, I deleted almost all of my old videos and have started from scratch to pursue my real passion, which is film. See, I don\u0027t want to sound pretentious and call myself a \"filmmaker\", because I\u0027m not. Being a filmmaker takes years of hard work and often a formal education, neither of which I\u0027ve accumulated, and I don\u0027t do this for a living (for the moment). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy you should sponsor me\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m not a professional, I\u0027m just some kid with a camera who loves what he does and wants to do it all the time. I have so much ambition, and to get to where I want to be with all of this, one thing I absolutely need is equipment. I\u0027m currently saving up for new lenses and a camera, as well as a computer to edit on. These will all be instrumental in the creation of a short film I hope to have out by May 2016. Not getting paid for the work I do means that I have a budget of essentially zero, so it\u0027s difficult to build up a portfolio. I\u0027m hoping this campaign will allow me to afford some more equipment, so as to continue doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSorry that this was so cheesy. Expect less cheese in the future. Thanks for reading, and don\u0027t forget to be awesome.\u003cbr\u003e"
