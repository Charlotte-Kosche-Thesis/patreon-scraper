You possess few talents except that of Truthsaying, the ability to magically tell if someone is lying.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day news arrives that the King is dead of old age\u00a0and that his daughter, Princess Selena, is coming to your town for her coronation. When a person close to you gets murdered soon after, and you learn that you are the only person who can save the world from an unspecified calamity, things get rather heated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eServing under a powerful sorceress, you are taught the ability to magically remove people\u0027s inhibitions. With this knowledge in hand and a potty-mouthed pixie in tow, you are told to prepare for the arrival of the Princess so that you can seduce her and save the world (the details of this elude you). Until then, however, you must practice. How appealing, then, that this practice means using your magic to seduce as many of the town\u0027s girls as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife is about to become... satisfying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGameplay\u003c/h2\u003eDo you like Persona? Do you like Ace Attorney? There are elements of both in this game. You have a limited number of in-game days to prepare yourself for the Princess\u0027 arrival. Each day allows you to take three separate actions. Your choice of actions will dictate whether or not you are ready when the Princess finally arrives, so choose wisely. Carefully balance the various aspects of your life, such as practicing your spellcasting, improving your abilities, building relationships, earning money, and so on. Don\u0027t worry, there is no grinding in this game, and every action will be meaningful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile doing all this, you also have to uncover the deepest, darkest secrets of the girls in town so that you can affect them with your spells. When you feel confident that you have figured out a girl\u0027s secrets, confront her and reveal the knowledge you have uncovered at the precise time needed for maximum effect.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong Live the Princess is not a linear game, and you might very well end up failing in your quest. Replaying will allow you to keep some of your abilities from the previous playthrough, increasing your chances of success the second time arund. Can you find all the game\u0027s secrets?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379689700560207892/438426191347843073/thegirls.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eScreenshots\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379689700560207892/438426281965781012/screenshot1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379689700560207892/438426388287193088/screenshot7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379689700560207892/438426442590715906/screenshot9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379689700560207892/438426516963983361/screenshot6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379689700560207892/438426608483827723/screenshot8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379689700560207892/438426807012687873/map_preview.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h2\u003eI am a professional software developer with experience in creating and delivering products, and I am also able to create art, sound, and music. I have semi-professional writing experience and take great pride in my ability to tell a story. I have developed and released story-based mods for popular games, to great acclaim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an ambitious perfectionist, and will usually take my ideas one step beyond what is necessary.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Am I Here?\u003c/h2\u003eLet me be very clear: I\u0027m not one of those \u0027me-too\u0027 Patreon creators who toss together a basic visual novel simply to earn a quick buck. I take pride in my work and will go to great lengths to make myself worthy of any trust put in me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have put significant amounts of my own time and money into this game already, and I plan to spend a vast amount of my free time developing it over the months to come. To maintain this level of commitment, I need support. Art assets and software cost a lot of money, money I don\u0027t currently have. By becoming my patron, you give me the opportunity to obtain the assets and resources I need to make this game what I\u0027ve envisioned in my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCan I Play This Game for Free?\u003c/h2\u003eYes, you can. While my patrons will always get the latest release first, everyone else will get access to it one month after its Patreon release. If you want to support me without paying me anything, spread the word about the game instead. I appreciate it. Regardless of whether or not you support me in any way, you are always welcome here. For me, having you play and enjoy something I\u0027ve created is rewarding in itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Become a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eBy becoming one of my patrons, you give me both the means and the motivation to continue making this game all that it can be. You get access to updates about the current state of development, and at higher levels will get previews and exclusive renders. I will post regular updates where I talk design philosophy and dive into the nitty gritty details of the game and my concepts for it, and you get to give me your feedback and ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons at the\u00a0$5 level and above gain access to the latest version of the game one month before the rest of the world. I plan to release new versions monthly. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, you should get a completely fresh version of the game every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading all this text and for your interest in my game. I hope you will join me on this exciting journey.\u003cbr\u003e"
