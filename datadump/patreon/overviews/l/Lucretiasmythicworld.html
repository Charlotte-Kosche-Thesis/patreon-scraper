Join me as I take\na shamanic journey to other realms, discovering new perspectives and ideas\nalong the way.  My creations are born from these inwardly focused journeys, fueled by my love for nature. These creations show up in the form of sculptures, paintings, drawings, art to wear, story\nbooks, and more. No one particular medium has\ncaptured my interest. There is so much\nto create and explore that I can\u2019t limit myself.\u00a0 Each day I am born anew, so each day I reach for whatever medium calls to\nme the most.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Lucretia, a name I did not know until I was 7 years old.  I was\ncalled by my middle name until my first week of college when I claimed my legal\nfirst name.  This was not my first act of independence and definitely\nnot my last.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaking art is what I do best in the world.\u00a0 Art feeds the soul and without it, well let\u0027s face it, we\u0027ve never been without it.\u00a0 Art shows us new ways of being, and interacting with others, with ourselves, and with nature.\u00a0 Can you imagine a world without art?\u00a0 Would you want to live there? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you will see in the reward tiers, I will be giving you actual physical works of art which you will be able to choose from a selection.\u00a0 If you would like to support me, but don\u0027t necessarily want more physical objects to take care of, I will donate your artwork reward to someone who would not be able to purchase the piece.\u00a0 I love giving art dolls to children who really connect with the energy of the piece and you can donate a work of art as part of your reward.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour donated dollars will help me get 3 books published,\nmove forward with an invention I\u0027ve been working on for many years, purchase supplies, explore animation video projects and last but definitely not least, help pay for living expenses.\u00a0 Once I am able to support myself, I wish to be a Patron for others as well.\u00a0 Help me bring soul nourishment to the world.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!!\u00a0 MAHALO!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Since I was a small child I have walked the line between the\n inner imaginary worlds and the outer physical world.  Through \ncreativity and exploration, I strive to unify and balance the inner with\n the outer.  The inner realm is even more vast and complex than the \nouter.  Yet, through deep meditation with nature, I am able to build a \nbridge between the two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach time I create I \nunveil new worlds, ideas, energies, and otherworldly beings.  A symbolic\n language emerges through my art, revealing messages of higher truths \nfrom the inner realms.  While I am not always able to translate these \nmessages into human language, I do understand them.  They are uplifting \nand supportive messages which often go directly to the heart, bypassing \nthe mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom exploring many different forms \nof media over the last 40 years, I have found mixed media to be the \nideal form for expressing these messages.  Much like how a composer \nblends many different sounds into a symphony, I blend 2D images and 3D \nobjects to form a visual symphony.  Each element is like a piece of a \npuzzle, and I get a sense of joy and satisfaction when all the visual \nelements come together to form a whole. When each element has room to \nevolve, a project can be an ongoing journey, with room for further \ninvestigations and discoveries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating art is\n the most engaging, fun, exciting, fulfilling activity in my life.  \nThrough creating I connect with the Creator and my higher self, giving \nthem expression in the physical world.",
