I\u0027ve been able to attend conventions, meet wonderful artists and meet many new fans all over the country because of this comic and I\u0027d love to see it through to completion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://polterguys.laurbits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/POLTERGUYS-PATREON-sample.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nVol. 2 is in the process of being finished. I\u0027ve been working on it between my day job, ongoing art classes and freelance projects. It can be a huge challenge for a one-person operation like me to keep at it but with your help, I can create pages more regularly and share even more behind-the-scenes processes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePolterguys\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPolterguys is the story of a nerdy, young college girl who ends up moving in\u00a0a house that\u0027s filled with ghost guys and since she\u0027s the only one who can see them, she has to help them resolve their unfinished businesses.\u00a0It\u0027s a black/white, multi-volume love letter to shojo harem manga, ghost movies from the 90s and TV shows like Buffy and Veronica Mars. It\u0027s also set in a fictional campus that looks a lot like UC Berkeley (because why not?) :D\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can read reviews, interviews about me and even more Polterguys-related stuff over\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://polterguys.laurbits.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eShort comics/Other graphic novels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would relish the opportunity to work on shorter comics and stand-alone books, as well. I have other ideas I would love to share and with your help, we can make that happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can\u0027t support me right now, you can always tell a friend about this project,\u00a0share this page on social media, pledge in the future or buy the comics when they come out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease be sure to check out the \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003epatron FAQ\u003c/a\u003e for more info about how Patreon works.\nThank you very much for checking out my page!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e"
