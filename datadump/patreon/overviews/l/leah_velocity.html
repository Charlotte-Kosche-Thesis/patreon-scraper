I specialize in art nudes, creative concepts, edgy fashion and anything with a bit of asymmetry and/or dialogue. Henceforth, I will be releasing most of my work exclusively via Patreon, and will also be revisiting some favorite throwback shoots once every week or two! \u00a0I also am a fire performer, dancer, and performance artist (albeit a bit out of practice) so I anticipate some exciting movement based projects that will also be exclusively shared with Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy travels \u003c/strong\u003etake me far and wide, a determined whisper of \"Adventure forever\" lingering on my lips. The road is a fickle mistress, she sometimes takes without returning any favors, but I feel she has taught me more in my quarter of a century on this planet than I would have learned from any other companion, school, or singular place. I am constantly afforded opportunities to learn about and contribute to causes worthwhile because of my nomadic lifestyle.\u00a0I have previously kept much of these experiences to myself aside from the occasional photo or thought shared, but want to share both personal reflections and comprehensive DIY style travel guides for the locales I have the opportunity to visit. Many of my goals will be oriented towards taking specific trips, and I will also have at least one international location a year that is voted upon by my Patrons!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy lifelong calling\u003c/strong\u003e is to design and develop off grid, sustainable community-style housing with a focus on recycled or natural materials, zero waste systems, and modular space. Eventually I want to build these communities in developing countries, with a business in more privileged sectors to support that initiative. I plan to be back in school for this ambitious goal (and living outside of the US!) by 2020, but would love to spend some time working under pioneers in this field before returning to academia. Some of my financial goals will be related to this, and I would love to start a blog dedicated to sustainability in design and living (if I can find the time!) or make posts on the subject if Patrons are interested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goals \u003c/strong\u003eare innumerable, but one of the joys of Patreon is narrowing them down to short-term accessible dreams that can be achieved and shared on this platform. They will center around travel, activism and further delving into sustainability practices, which are both initiatives that often give me incentive and pause to pursue modeling work around the globe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy perspective \u003c/strong\u003eis forever evolving, and I am excited to start writing again: sharing my experiences and thoughts in literary form. I have worked as a fine dining chef, performance artist, seamstress, gluten free/vegan entrepreneur and many other odd jobs aside from modeling, and the experience of surviving a terminal illness forever changed me. I will be writing on topics ranging through personal inspiration, interpersonal mechanics, political philosophy, functional magic, DIY health remedies, mental illness navigation, and cultural perspectives. Some of my goals will be related to projects aimed at providing more resources and support on these, issues as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy gratitude \u003c/strong\u003efor you, just for reading this whole rambling diatribe (I tried to keep it\u00a0brief, promise!) is immense. Any support that I recieve is so wholesomely appreciated, and motivating beyond what words could express.

My personal experiences with this, the collective trauma of women everywhere demands a response of direct action. I have a small project in mind which would be the test-run of a much larger, but still simple, project. This is a media-oriented initiative to mediate these problems through increasing safety for women or those assigned female at birth, while improving communication within, and offering compassionate information to, the general public.",

     "description": "As detailed in my profile, sustainability- specifically in relation to home design and architecture, is the initiative I want build my career and better the world through. $600 for a month would be enough to cover my meager basic living expenses in most places, so if I reach this goal I will make plans to volunteer or intern with a non-profit sustainable building project for up to two months. Due to the nature of these opportunities (and a perpetual uncertainty about the future) decisions on where to apply and offer my time and energy would be made at the time of reaching the goal, but an organization like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pushbuffalo.org/\"\u003ePUSH\u003c/a\u003e would be a good example of groups I will contact. Ideally, I would seek out an individual project in a less developed nation working with people with a lot of experience with the unique challenges of building in underserved areas, but I am eager to give back and learn more about my chosen field, so priority would fall to making it happen vs making it perfect. :)",

I am lucky to be alive, luckier still to always be surrounded by solution oriented friends, some of whom helped me to explore and obtain alternative treatments for my illness. $200 will cover the start up costs and allow me a day or two of \"down time\" to design and implement an online resource which will provide information on natural approaches to healing, CBD therapy, food-based medicine, as well as detailing of my personal battle. I am frequently personally contacted by old friends, professional contacts and fans who have a loved one who is struggling, or who themselves are struggling, with this monstrous disease... and I feel a responsibility as a survivor to try to shed some light on less-talked about options for cancer patients.\u00a0",
