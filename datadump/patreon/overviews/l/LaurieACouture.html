    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a patron and help me fund a sabbatical to finish my 2nd book, \"Nurturing and Empowering Our Sons\"!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the book is about and why it matters:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work on the front lines with the traumas of youth and families as a mental health counselor. There are many awareness and empowerment campaigns for girls, but our boys need understanding and consideration, too. In fact, our sons are in severe distress. They are demonstrating that distress by sounding the alarm in every aspect of their lives, in the form of emotional, behavioral and learning struggles. Our social institutions-- the educational, mental health, medical, legal and social services-- are not meeting even a fraction of the needs of boys. Yet, these institutions are reacting to boys\u0027 distress signals with punishment, control, medication and pathologizing boys and natural boy behavior. These institutions (along with the media) try to coerce parents to go along with this treatment of their sons, causing only further harm and damage to boys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been researching mammal parenting and the peaceful, nonviolent Hunter-Gatherer tribes and their parenting and educational customs for many years. I have combined this crucial ancient wisdom with my expertise in supporting children\u0027s brain development and healing child trauma. My book will help parents, families, professionals and anyone who loves the boys in their lives to heal the emotional, behavioral and learning problems at their root, with nature\u0027s intent as our guide. Parents will be able to reconnect with their sons, heal their relationship and help their sons rediscover their joy and love for learning. My book will help bring peace and healing to families and to our society!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your help to make it happen:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am taking a sabbatical from the mental health field in order to research and write the book full time. I am relying 100% on sponsors and patrons to continue my sabbatical until my book is completed and in the hands of the parents and professionals who need it most!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you get out of it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am very excited about the rewards I will be offering to my patrons! Not only will you be supporting my sabbatical and this book, but I will be offering you many opportunities to really involve yourself in my creative process. In fact, depending on the level of your monthly contribution to my goals, I will be offering monthly updates only for patrons, sneak-peaks of sections from my chapters, Q and A sessions with me, a chance to review chapters before they are released to the public and a thank you mention in my book! I will also be offering signed copies of my book once it is published and opportunities to have you or your family featured as a case study in my book! You\u0027ll be part of the process at every stage!\u003cbr\u003e"
