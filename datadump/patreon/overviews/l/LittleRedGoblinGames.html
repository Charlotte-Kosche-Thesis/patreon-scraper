    "summary": "Little Red Goblin Games is a fantastic RPG developer. We have earned recognition within our industry (Endzeitgeist\u0027s Top Ten of 2013 and Ennie Nominated for Fan Favorite Publisher 2013). After a few Kickstarters, we decided the best (and cheapest!) way to get our new products to our fans is via Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a $5 pledge, you will get access to a new upcoming product that is 15 pages or longer in our standard PDF form. (However, the product must reach a minimum of $60 in order to be released.) Products that are less than 15 pages, you get for free! This Patreon does not cover large launch products such as our Kickstarter backed projects or back products (only upcoming new products). We will, however, endeavor to reward Patreons with free materials from Kickstart projects to order to share the fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a product reaches $100, all Patreon backers will also receive digital copies of all artwork, whether in-house or freelanced, presented in the product. This artwork can be freely used for personal measures, such as desktop wallpapers or printed and framed for personal use. However, we still retain all rights to the artwork, and Patreons must not upload or share the artwork with other sites. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a product reaches $200, we will give all Patreon backers a glimpse behind the scenes! This could be an art livestream or a Q\u0026amp;A session via Google Hangouts. We reserve the right to change exactly what this livestream/Q\u0026amp;A session may entail, but generally, a questions and answer session runs for roughly 30 minutes, and viewers are welcome to ask questions about current, past, and future products or anything in regards to Pathfinder. However, we retain the right to refuse to answer a question. We are located in the Arizona (Mountain and Pacific time zone, given the time of year) time zone, so Patreons who may miss the schedule livestream may be able to privately view a recording of the session.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust for backing, at any level, we will give you an archive of some of our best artwork to date (for personal use, non-commercial).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe graciously thank you for stopping by our Patreon site!
