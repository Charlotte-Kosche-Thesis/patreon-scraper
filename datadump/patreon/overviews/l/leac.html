My name is Lea Carosella, otherwise known as Lea C.! I\u0027m a content creator who focuses primarily on Cartoons! I\u0027m mostly known for my videos that are based off of the Cartoon Network series: \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSteven Universe. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWhile I am known for my Steven Universe content, my goal is to cover several new animated series/movies by the end of 2018!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I cover mostly theories and speculation videos, I also make short parody videos and AMV\u0027s as a regular video editor. I have big dreams and aspirations to one day work on Cartoon Network as one of their video editors. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eJoin me as my channel grows to cover more shows and content!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eAbout the Channel\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe channel has existed since May of 2010, and started off as a channel to post random content on. But as the channel grew from 40 subscribers to 1,000 the content became more serious. However it wasn\u0027t until May 2017 that the channel actually became active with regularly posted and scheduled videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe video posted back in May 2017 titled \u0027Pearl Shattered Pink Diamond!?\u0027 quickly became the turning point for the channel, where it became more than just a hobby. Since then the community has grown into a group nearly \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e20,000+ subscribers strong with over 5 million video views in total.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e As the channel continues to grow from theories and other cartoon news, so does the community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe channel\u0027s main series right now is \u003cstrong\u003eToon Ruins\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a theory based show that covers theories anywhere from the bizarre to the well supported. Other shows on the channel are \u003cstrong\u003eLea C.\u0027s Top 10\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eIn Different Languages (IDL)\u003c/strong\u003e and soon \u003cstrong\u003eCartoon Critiques\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eToon News\u003c/strong\u003e will be added to the ongoing series list. See below for more in depth show descriptions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLea C.\u0027s content is written, recorded, edited and managed all by \u003cstrong\u003eone person. \u003c/strong\u003eThis is why Patreon is such an important in the channel assets, especially as YouTube becomes harder and harder to rely on for a source of stable income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eToon Ruins \u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTheory based show covering cartoon theories from shows both old and new, uncovering some of the most wanted and undiscovered answers in cartoon history.
