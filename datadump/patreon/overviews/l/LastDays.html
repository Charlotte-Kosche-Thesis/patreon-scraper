By pledging an amount that is comfortable for you, you help motivate me to keep on working hard to make this game the best that it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting the project will also allow me to upgrade my hardware, software, buy custom 3D models and help accelerate the development of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledges are collected by Patreon on the first day of each month as long\n as you continue to support this project.

Bear in mind that because this game contains many more images\n and much less text than standard visual novels it reads more like a \ncomic so the monthly progress may seem small but actually requires a \nlot of work. I try to average about 75 new images per month which is a lot for one person working part-time on the game. I will be able to create more images per month as Patreon goals are reached.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe october of 2017 release of the game contains a total of more than 1000 images!
