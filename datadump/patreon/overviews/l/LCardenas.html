The way it works is simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll post the newest update to Patreon\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe last Patreon update gets posted to LINE and Tapas\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe readers who want to support the comic (for just $1) don\u0027t have to wait as long, and the readers that can\u0027t still get the comic for free at a later date.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThis puts less pressure on me as a creator since I wouldn\u0027t have to divide my focus, and less financial pressure on you as a patron.\u003cbr\u003e$1 may not seem like much, but if 1000 people gave just $1, that\u0027s $1000 a month. Any little bit helps, and I\u0027m here to tell you right now not to be ashamed of the size of your contribution. The simple fact that you enjoy my work means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I\u0027ll probably spruce the page up more at a later date, but for now i\u0027d just like to get something functional going and get back to doing what I do best; making comic pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your continued support of my work, be it financially or simply through your readership \u0026lt;3"
