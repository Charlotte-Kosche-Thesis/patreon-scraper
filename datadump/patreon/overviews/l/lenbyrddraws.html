I would really love to make all of this into more of a full time dream job instead of something that keeps me afloat on off days of work! As work likes to cut on hours, this work helps me to keep from having to struggle at the end of the month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis helps me keep up and going without having to worry about rent or food, yes all rather sad personal stuff. But my end goal is so I can make more amazing content for the rest of you! I do want to make better videos, and I want to eventual make comics as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs well as a huge thank you, there are various rewards you can get! Artwork, special stream additions when you join in, even a mention in my youtube videos!! The possibilities are endless, but within reason. I want to give back just as much as you guys give, and rest assured no patreon will go unrewarded!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to give a huge thanks to those that support any work that\u0027s done. It means a lot to me and it keeps me going to put out even better work! I adore each and every one of you, and I hope that you guys enjoy the work just as much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Patreons over 15 dollars, you will still get something, but it should be discussed with me first, as anything higher will obviously take quite a bit of time!!\u003cbr\u003e"
