Since then we\u2019ve produced tons of stuff people may have described as \u201cintelligent\u201d, \u201cinsightful\u201d, \u201cfunny\u201d, and \u201coffbeat\u201d \u201cwriting\u201d surrounding \u201cgames\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, we launched the popular Let\u2019s Play Video Games podcast, our reviews became Metacritic-accredited, and we have built up a lovely community in our Discord server. All of that couldn\u2019t have been done without your support! All this before our first anniversary!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLPVG has always prided itself on its independence, both in editorial tone and in its strict no advertising policy. These allow us to cover the games we find interesting and are enthusiastic about, rather than chasing whatever gets us the most hits. Unfortunately, that independence costs money, and so this is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, LPVG can not only continue as it has for the past year, but also improve and grow. With enough support we\u2019ll be able to dedicate more time and resources to the site, covering more games and hardware, sharing more news and journalism, and producing more video and audio content."
