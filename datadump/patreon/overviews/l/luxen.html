I\u0027m currently catching up with my backlog of pending content and rewards as fast as I can. Please keep this in mind if you\u0027re planning to support me during this time and\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/internets-back-16631114\"\u003evisit the following post for more info\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everyone! Welcome to my Patreon! I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eLuxen\u003c/strong\u003e and I draw gay erotic artwork, though sometimes I enjoy working on character concepts and imagining short stories about them in my spare time. Most of my artwork consists of large, hairy, sexy men in pin-ups or growth sequences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of the content that is posted here is available as early-access for up to a month (since its completion) or available publicly after another monthly drawing of the same goal category takes its place. Depending on how many people pledge per month more pieces of artwork will be made for that particular month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e By pledging, not only will you be able to see the above, but you\u0027ll also have the chance to vote on monthly polls (to determine who or what I should draw), WIP (Work-In-Progress) sketches of my artwork, and join the Discord server to chat with me and other current patrons. Other rewards obtained via higher tiers include: access to unseen sketches, Patreon-exclusive content, and personal monthly artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a 25 year old Freelance Artist from Puerto Rico. I love video games (JRPGS, Platformers, etc.), junk food, mystery/comedy shows, figurines, etc. If I tried to be as specific as I could about myself, I could probably write up quite a few paragraphs of just that, haha. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll get to know me as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as long as I can remember, I\u0027ve always dreamed and planned to move away from my family and Puerto Rico (due to various reasons and experiences I\u0027ve had throughout the past few years). Unfortunately, my plans have yet to come to fruition and I still find myself on this island today. Patreon (and commissions as well) is my only source of income, so it\u0027s taking quite a while to get enough funds for some of the stuff I need to purchase to help me get my work done, improve my living conditions, and eventually leave Puerto Rico for good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it wasn\u0027t obvious, I love both muscular and fat guys, which is why I decided to offer them both on my Patreon in the first place. I know most people don\u0027t like both of them, but I decided to stick to my guts. (See what I did there?) There\u0027s just so many different types of combinations and bodyshapes that result in hunky, manly, and cute guys; I honestly can\u0027t get enough of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support my work, I\u0027ll be eternally grateful and be able to create new artwork that everyone would love to see!\u003c/div\u003e"
