    "summary": "Hey guys Little V here! Thanks for taking the time to check out this page! So for those of you who don\u0027t know who I am, I rearrange and remix Video game, Movie, and Anime music on Youtube! Sometimes it\u0027s rock, sometimes is funk, and sometimes it\u0027s full on ear annihilating death metal! Depends on how I feel that week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with the volatile nature of Youtube and the internet in general I turn to you, my fans! The long and short of it is that I don\u0027t make a lot of money on Youtube and I\u0027d really like to move out of my grandparents basement (yes you read that right). Gigs are drying up locally and my only real stable form of income is teaching which barely pays the rent and bills. Hell I make so little money, the Canadian government doesn\u0027t even want it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow let me make this clear, this is NOT a pay wall to my content. You will still be able to see every one of my covers past, present, and future assuming of course this whole internet thing doesn\u0027t blow up in my face! In fact if this does well I will turn off ALL THE ADS! The last thing I want is more money going toward a large company instead of a content creator. Not only that but by supporting me, you will get access to extra content ranging from early videos to lessons to tutorials on mixing! I just want to be able to devote more time to making music and content in general for you guys without worrying about eating next month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/shilling end\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again thanks so much for stopping by and checking this page out! Rock on, peace out, and we\u0027ll see you next time! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
