    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Alexx Stuart, founder of the Low Tox Life. Well this is a bit exciting that you\u0027ve come to consider joining the Low Tox Club. We\u0027ve got rather uplifting plans for it as it grows. Just a little note first, that the payments on Patreon are in USD.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Low Tox Life podcast is something I created as an extension of years of blogging and running e courses for our low tox community from 2011 - Back in 2009 I started the blog - secretly just for friends and family because I was too embarrassed - and coined the term \"low tox\" to articulate a life I felt was worth us all considering living - Doing our best for a healthy us and a healthy planet. We started mid 2016 and can\u0027t wait to celebrate the 2nd birthday milestone in a couple of months. Year 3 is going to be EPIC. Thanks so much for tuning in and being a part of this. We cover all the pillars of leading a low tox life - food, body, home, mind, planet, kids... When it comes to food I believe there\u0027s no one way other than the wholefoods ethical and regenerative way, so we\u0027re not a food \u0027label\u0027 in our food topics. When it comes to the whole low tox philosophy we\u0027re not \u0027zero\u0027 anything because the world isn\u0027t black and white, right? You walk past a car or something gets delivered and there\u0027s plastic. You can\u0027t win every battle and always be in control so I say we do what we do MOST of the time, to be ok with going with the flow some of the time - except throwing plastic in the ocean. Definitely do NOT copy people who do this to \u0027go with the flow\u0027! You catch my drift on the balance front about the rest though hopefully. What we ARE is passionate about inspiring, practical conversations to move you forward in your health and our beautiful planet\u0027s health. Thanks for joining me here as the podcast has inspired the creation of the low tox CLUB. I can\u0027t wait to get started over in the Facebook community as it builds and start rolling out all the Low Tox Club peeps extras x"
