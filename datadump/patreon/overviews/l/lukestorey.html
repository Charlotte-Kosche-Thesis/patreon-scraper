Thank you so much for recognizing that fact enough to make it to this page, and for your interest in helping to create our show. Yes, our show. After you\u2019ve made a donation you are in this thing with me officially, and I\u0027m incredibly grateful. No, seriously. I wish the internet did hugs because I would give you one right now. If you\u2019re still here, you\u2019re one of my people, and I humbly thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m asking you to help fund my podcast: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I had the dream of launching my very own show, \u003cem\u003eI had no idea of the costs involved.\u003c/em\u003e After the initial investment of thousands of dollars spent on recording equipment, a website, a copywriter, a show producer, a graphic designer, and a sound editor, I quickly realized that if I were to continue releasing a new show each week, I would need a monthly budget of around $3000. So far, I\u0027ve been paying this out of pocket, because I simply can\u0027t stop doing my show. It\u2019s proven to be one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. And now that I\u2019ve been doing the show for some time, I\u0027ve seen what a huge impact it\u0027s having in the lives of so many others. I\u0027m in too deep to stop now, but I  need your help to not only keep the podcast going but also to keep improving the production value and the caliber of guests I feature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe purpose of The Life Stylist Podcast:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent the first half of my adult life terribly unhappy, addicted to drugs, and in horrible shape physically, mentally, and emotionally. 21 years ago I made a decision to turn my life around, and so began what would become my deepest obsession- and ultimately, the birth of The Life Stylist Podcast. That obsession was and is finding the most powerful principles of health and spirituality, applying them to my life, then finding the world\u2019s foremost expert on each one, and sharing their message with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Life Stylist is a show for people who are dedicated to living life at the highest level of human potential. Each weekly episode delivers powerful, and thought-provoking interviews with the biggest experts in the fields of health, spirituality, and\npersonal development.
