    "summary": "I am a creator in every sense of the word. I create art, comic books, novels and anything else I can. I am a fine artist with training as an Impressionist painter, yet I am in love with comic book art. I am also a writer. I have focused primarily on screenplay previously, but NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) has returned me to my first love - prose. \u00a0You can check out my artwork at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://http:www.art.lifeonitsside.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArt.LifeOnItsSide.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://art.lifeonitsside.com/Noir/Pages/Deco_Noir_files/Media/dad%20b%26w.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy creative path has been weird and winding, and took me on my current adventure, which is teaching art to children in China. My  grandfather was from China, so this is the trip of a lifetime. I am here on a yearlong contract, which has had its own trials and tribulations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing this far from home, it has been challenging to use my artwork to help support myself. Most of my tools and references are in a storage room way back in Los Angeles. But I am determined to continue to create while I am here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will allow those who would like to support and encourage my current exploration and adventure to contribute consistently, helping me to be able to continue creating without worrying about my weird income here in China. It will also allow those who are just discovering my work the opportunity to see firsthand how comic books are created and to get a sneak peek into my process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out how I create a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtu.be/inHhcwYy05E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecomic book page.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will use the income from this endeavor for a variety of things. First, to finish the second issue of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wraith.lifeonitsside.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWraith of Love.\u003c/a\u003e This will help me maintain the website and publish hard copies of the first and second issue as needed. It will also allow me to purchase equipment, such as a scanner, printer and maybe (gasp!) a new laptop, since my current one is almost eight years old. Patreon support will also allow me to publish my new novel, \u003cstrong\u003eShadow of the Knight,\u003c/strong\u003e which I began as part of NaNoWriMo and am now almost finished. In addition, this support will allow me to continue to draw and paint and create new content without worrying about watching every penny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will find the content interesting and I am grateful for all the support!"
