Unfortunately, since I provided the bank with a couple of tax returns that were not exactly what they appeared to be, in 1992, I was sentenced to three years in Federal prison. However, representing myself on appeal as a jailhouse lawyer with only a high school education, my term of imprisonment was declared \u003cbr\u003eunconstitutional, and after serving just 15 months, then-Judge Stephen Breyer (now Justice Stephen Breyer of U.S. Supreme Court fame) ordered my immediate release.
