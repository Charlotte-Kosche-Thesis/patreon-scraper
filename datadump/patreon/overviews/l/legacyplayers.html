    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHistory \u0026amp; Introduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLegacy Players is the upgrade of Legacy Logs, which is the result of my first project DPSMate, that I started in 2015. The goal of DPSMate is to give the legacy community a professional tool to review the fight in an easy and intuitive manner. After almost half a year after release, LegacyPlayers finally stabilized and is now a reliable companion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter soon 1 year of development, LegacyPlayers provides an Armory, PvE and PvP Rankings and numerous tools beside the raid evaluation. It is designed to not only be useful to the TOP 1% raiders but rather to everyone. Therefore it is supposed to be intuitive and easy to read. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy this way I hope, I will be able to unite the legacy community and provide a place where people can compare themselves in an \u003cstrong\u003eeven\u003c/strong\u003e environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture \u0026amp; Community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill being a very young project, I am very proud that it is already used by over 2500 people every day. But I don\u0027t want to stand still. I want to continue introducing new features that make this game a little more interesting again. Although it may seem like very slow progress at times, I care a lot about this project and work as much as I can on it. \u003cbr\u003eI receive so many suggestions and so much feedback, which really thrills me and enables me to go on.\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOperating Costs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLegacyPlayers keeps growing everyday. I tried to write it in a very efficient manner, but as more and more people start to use it, I have to the server in order to handle the load at spike time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother problem is the disk space. LegacyPlayers archives all uploaded logs. Which means you can go back to your very first upload, which is very awesome. The problem is that it requires and increasing amount of disk space, which is not an insignificant factor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will keep you updated and try my best. Currently 30\u20ac per month is sufficient in order to cover the cost of the server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo thank you for sponsoring me, there are some rewards available for you that will give you some nice percs on the website.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently there are three reward levels: Bronze, Silver and Gold. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will pull the patreon list every Monday ~ 11 AM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease make sure that your mail address on patreon matches the mail address on LegacyPlayers in order to receive your reward. If that is not the case, you need to contact me (Preferably on discord).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
