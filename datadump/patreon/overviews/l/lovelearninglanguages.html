My native language is English, and I have been teaching French as a foreign language for about 20 years. I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and French, then taught French for a year and moved to France for a year before pursuing and earning a Master of Arts degree in French.  I taught French at Saint Louis University High School, a Jesuit college preparatory school for young men, for 14 years. In the summer of 2013 I relocated to France with my family, and spent the summer working as Dean of l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de France in Montpellier, a French immersion program for teenagers from around the world. A while before relocating to France, I began publishing French video tutorials on YouTube and teaching French online via Skype.  This is now what I do full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s my job to guide you and help you along on your journey to learn French. Learning should be fun, and I do my best to make sure that enjoy yourself as you improve your listening, writing, reading, and most importantly your speaking skills. I love creating free French tutorials and sharing them with you. \u00a0Most importantly I love to hear from you and for you to tell me about your progress in French :-)\u003cbr\u003e",
