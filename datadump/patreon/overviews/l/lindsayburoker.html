Because dragons and spaceships? You can\u2019t have too many of them. Ever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u2019m rolling, I\u2019ll write a novel a month, most under my name, but some under my pen name, Ruby Lionsdrake. Don\u2019t tell anyone, but those stories have naughty bits in them. Your mother wouldn\u2019t approve. At all. But there are still dragons. And spaceships.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI sell lots of books to lots of awesome readers, so I didn\u2019t start Patreon as a way to make piles of extra money. I\u2019m basically using it as a way to sell books in a way that lets me keep more of the cover price (95% instead of 35-70%) and cut down my reliance on bookstores and publishers (currently, more than 80% of my income comes from Amazon).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u2019S IN IT FOR YOU?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIf you support at the $5 level, you get my novels EARLY. Typically about a week before I publish, I will upload the final ebooks and send the download link to Patreon subscribers. I may also upload my \u201ctypo hunter\u201d copies earlier than that (these have been edited but haven\u2019t yet passed the eyes of my typo hunter patrol). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $10 level, you get my novels early and anything else I happen to put out, such as pen name novels, short story collections, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you prefer to keep buying my books from the bookstore, that\u2019s absolutely fine. If you want, you can kick in $1 to get access to the behind-the-scenes posts I will do here. This extra money will go toward editing and cover art costs for the free fiction I post on my blog (short stories, bonus scenes, etc.). I will eventually bundle those shorts into ebooks that I\u2019ll put in the free library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs I write this, it\u2019s a huge advantage to participate in Amazon\u2019s exclusivity program, which allows books to get extra promotional benefits and be enrolled in Kindle Unlimited. Because of this, I have been publishing some of my new fiction this way, exclusive to Amazon for a time. This Patreon is a way for you to get those books even if you\u2019re not an Amazon shopper (they will go out to Patreon subscribers BEFORE they are enrolled in that exclusivity program).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eHow are the ebooks delivered and in what format?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI use Bookfunnel for ebook delivery. They are good about providing tech support for devices that I know nothing about, so if you have any trouble getting the ebook from Bookfunnel to your e-reader, just click the help link at the top of the page, and they will answer your questions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will share the link to the Bookfunnel page, and you pop on over to download it in your chosen format (.mobi for Kindles and .epub for all over e-readers).

What\u0027s your publishing schedule?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy publishing plans tend to be tentative since I often get shiny new ideas and can\u0027t keep from darting off to work on them. Also, sometimes what I think will be a single book or a trilogy expands into a whole series. That said, here are my tentative plans for the first half of 2018:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHeritage of Power, Books 1-5 (a spinoff in my Dragon Blood world)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOaths, Book 8 in my Dragon Blood series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChains of Honor, Book 3\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSomething science fiction... either Book 4 in Sky Full of Stars or a new book for a character that\u0027s been waiting patiently.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA new summer series -- not sure yet if it will be scifi or fantasy, as I have ideas for both!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eScience fiction romances under my pen name sprinkled in here and there -- Patreon subscribers don\u0027t get charged for these, but they are automatically included at the $10 level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I only want your fantasy or only your science fiction titles?

You can subscribe and unsubscribe to my Patreon campaign whenever you want or upgrade and downgrade the level at which you subscribe, depending on what\u0027s coming up.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuy the books in the stores so you make sure you don\u0027t get stuck with ones you don\u0027t want (you can always support at the $1 level if you want to help out and be kept in the loop without receiving the books this way).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGive away the books you\u0027re not interested to scifi or fantasy loving friends.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you publish?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did about 12 novels last year, between my name and my pen name. You usually won\u0027t be charged more than once a month, but sometimes I will write the first three and sit on them so I can release them rapidly (this helps gain more visibility on Amazon, in particular). So you might not get charged for a couple of months, but then get charged for two things in one month. I\u0027ll try to limit this. Also, you won\u0027t be charged when I publish ebooks under my pen name. You can sign up at the Gold Dragon level if you want those included for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I loan your ebooks to friends and family?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, you can share them with friends and family. All of my ebooks are DRM-free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you start a Patreon campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s something I\u0027ve been thinking about for a while, but the catalyst was Amazon and their exclusivity program. \u003cbr\u003eRight now, Amazon is set up to give preference to books in their KDP Select/Kindle Unlimited program (more visibility and promo opportunities are given to those books and less to those not in the program), and it\u0027s hard to compete there, especially as an indie author, with titles that aren\u0027t exclusive. So I\u0027ve started enrolling new releases for new series there, sometimes for as much as a year before going \"wide\" to the other stores.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I have readers on Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, Kobo, Apple, Google Play, etc., and they have made it clear that they\u0027re not pleased when they have to buy the books on Amazon (many just won\u0027t buy them until they\u0027re available in their store). This is perfectly understandable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy using Patreon to deliver ebooks early (before I officially launch and enroll them in Amazon\u0027s exclusivity program), I can get the books out to anyone with any type of e-reader.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther, I get 95% of the price when you buy through Patreon. On Amazon and the other stores, I get 35-70% max, depending on the price (typically even less for books that are borrowed through Kindle Unlimited). I could sell books directly from my site, but that would involve collecting sales tax (different amounts for each sale, based on the state and country where it originates), and that gets complicated. Patreon handles all that and seems like a win-win situation for me and for readers. I make more per book, and you get the books early.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
