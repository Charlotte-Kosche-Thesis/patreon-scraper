With this goal being met, I\u0027d be able to afford to pay rent and continue living with my friends while being able to provide basic necessities such as food for myself without relying too much on donations from Twitch. i will also be using ab it of this money as pretty much a \"pot bonus\" for my subscriber only events on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My primary source of income comes from Twitch,That\u0027s where i need some help.
