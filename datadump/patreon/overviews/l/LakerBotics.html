I\u0027d like to secure a lathe and a few more saws, but mainly I\u0027d like to get enough wood that I could teach a unit on basic hand tools and the necessary safety for that equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, as I\u0027m able to slowly and sustainably build the program, I\u0027d like to add other wood-shop equipment, metal-shop equipment, and to eventually also teach units on social media \u0026amp; business outreach, fundraising and entrepreneurship, which are skills that, when combined with a knowledge of the industrial arts, can help one to successfully navigate the fast-paced economy of the modern world."
