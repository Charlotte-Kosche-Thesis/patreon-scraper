    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my Patreon! It means a great deal to me. Longthoughts with Baloo is a podcast dedicated to creators and their stories. \u00a0I have a focus on spoken word artists but anyone who creates, musicians, film directors, tabletop game makers \u00a0all have a home at LongThoughts. Whatever funding I make through Patreon goes back into the show. First is new dedicated recording equipment with a long term goal of going to the creators and recording (and financially supporting) them in their worlds. My dream is to pay my guests for their time and talent. Exposure doesn\u0027t pay rent Many poets travel to their gigs. As fun as that may be, it costs money. The penultimate goal is for creators to get paid just to be themselves. Help me finance creativity. We\u0027ll change the world one creator at a time. Thank you again for your time and interest."
