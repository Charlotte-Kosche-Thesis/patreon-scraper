I already have \u003ca href=\"http://learningmodular.com/training/\"\u003efour Learning Modular Synthesis courses\u003c/a\u003e online, am co-writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://learningmodular.com/patch-tweak/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea book on modular synthesis\u003c/a\u003e, and have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://learningmodular.com/\"\u003ea web site\u003c/a\u003e with additional information such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://learningmodular.com/glossary/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea glossary for beginners\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon page is the next level\u003c/strong\u003e. Here I share module deep-dives and general synthesis techniques. The videos and articles I create are not just simple unboxings or filter sweeps; I spend a lot of time with my electrical \u0026amp; software engineer hats on learning how each module works, then explain the important bits to you. Along the way I share multiple ideas of how to use it in your own sounds and music, as well as reaching into the past for a bit of history. Learning Modular Patrons get exclusive additional material on modular synthesis, plus see exclusive videos for a variety of modules. I also bounce ideas off of you for new projects I am working on (such as Patch \u0026amp; Tweak, the new modular synthesis book I\u0027m helping write), and in general share my thoughts on modular synthesis based on my many years playing and designing these beasts. This is also a great community where you can feel free to ask questions and share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who the heck am I?\u00a0I learned synthesis as a teenager in the late 70s on a modular Steiner-Parker\nSynthasystem. A PAiA modular was my college dorm companion; shortly after graduating,\nI landed an engineering job at Sequential Circuits where\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://learningmodular.com/the-story-of-the-prophet-vs/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI created Vector Synthesis\u003c/a\u003e, and went on to work for\nDigidesign, Tom Oberheim, and Roland.
