We have had a few false starts over the years, more than one boat, and a near bankruptcy which saw us sell our house and lose all our savings. We have raised two beautiful boys who are happily living independently and are super supportive of us living our dream. If we don\u0027t go now we may never have the chance again.\u003cbr\u003eBoth of us have loved the water all our lives and are both Scuba Diving Instructors (although lapsed). We are also avid foodies, so we hope to show you the best of underwater exploring and the culture and food of each new location. We are willing to go to great lengths to have gourmet experiences which we will share with you (both self created and via new people we meet)."

A large part of our travel has centered around the tropics and diving. The other part is focused on our belief that food and wine go hand in hand with travel, opting to enjoy local cooking classes whilst overseas and to splurge and experience the theater of degustation menus in some of the world\u2019s finest restaurants. In each instance, adding to our joy of entertaining friends and family with the culinary delights discovered. Regards Jamie",
