I have joined the Patreon community for a number of reasons, but none of them are as important as the main one. I want to be able to educate and spread awareness to the world about the LGBTQ+ community that we are all human, we live our lives from day to day just like every one else, the only difference is, who we choose to love. I am an inspiring author, and want to use my writings of non-fictional LGBTQ characters but real situations to show people that we have just as much right to love who we want to love, live where we want to live, and raise families just as well as anyone other couple around the world. Also I want to utilize my magazine entitled LGBTQ+ Unlimited and a tool to reach the masses while my books are being written and waiting to be published. So please help me to get my project going by becoming a patreon. Thank you in advance.\u00a0"
