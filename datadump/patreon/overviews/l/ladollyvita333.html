    "summary": "Hi everyone! Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Siobhan, and I\u0027m a professional freelance hairdresser from New York City. I\u0027ve been making DIY tutorials on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/ladollyvita333\"\u003eyoutube\u003c/a\u003e for the last seven years, and it\u0027s been one of the coolest journeys I\u0027ve taken thus far! Not only has it connected me with awesome friends from all over the globe, its also allowed me to teach others the techniques that I\u0027ve always been so incredibly passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content is primarily hairstyling tutorials, with an emphasis on \"cosplay\" and \"fantasy\" styles. The objective has always been to demonstrate that we \u003cem\u003eCAN\u003c/em\u003e recreate the glamorous braids and curls we see on our favorite characters, while embracing the idea that its ok to be, feel and think outside of the typical beauty trends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the tutorials themselves, I also provide my viewers with general haircare \"hacks \u0026amp; tips,\" as well as actual crafts, like\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tntgekD8TVI\"\u003e crowns\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=195ZbLjOrZ8\u0026amp;t=1s\"\u003ehead pieces\u003c/a\u003e and various\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEdykXZYxNE\"\u003eadditional adornments.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy start on youtube was rocky, to say the least. In the beginning I knew \u003cem\u003enothing \u003c/em\u003eof content creation, sound, editing or lighting. All I had was a small flip camera and the desire to befriend, and network, with like minded hair and cosplay enthusiasts from around the world. In this regard, I\u0027ve been extremely successful, and the relationships I\u0027ve built, have and continue to be, priceless! \u003cbr\u003eThrough practice and experimentation, and with the supportive encouragement of my amazing subscribers, I\u0027ve come to a place where my videos are the best they\u0027ve ever been.\u00a0I\u0027m currently working with a new microphone, camera, lights and backdrop. Every hairstyle I put forward is rehearsed at least twice, all products and tools are researched at length, and every script is written with sincere care and thought. The prep can take me somewhere between two and four days, depending on the project. Filming can extend anywhere from three to five hours, and editing will sometimes take me somewhere from 12-72 hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope that in describing my process, I\u0027ve demonstrated how genuinely devoted I am to my craft, and my audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy content is, and always will be, free. This won\u0027t ever change. However, by pledging to my patreon you are not only helping to support future content, you\u0027re gifting me with the means of continuing to improve it! As of right now, I\u0027m working towards purchasing new editing software.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the technical gear, donations will also sustain some of the smaller things that I use regularly, like hair products, tools and artistic supplies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to upload once a week on Fridays, but occasionally and if time allows, I\u0027ll put up a second video. Because of this, I\u0027ve set my patreon account to a \"once a month\" donation. I didn\u0027t feel it would be fair to ask for a pledge every time I put out new content, especially if that happened more then once in a week.\u003cbr\u003eNo contribution is too small! Even a dollar is incredibly generous and sincerely appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got several incentives set up for now and you can check them all out in the side bar to hear more about them!\u003cbr\u003eIts very likely that I\u0027ll continue to add to them, and when I do, I\u0027ll make sure that all my patrons are made aware.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for coming past my page and giving me your time! As I always say, have fun, and keep braiding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of Love, Siobhan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
