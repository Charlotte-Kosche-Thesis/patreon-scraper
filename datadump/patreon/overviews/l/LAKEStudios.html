    "summary": "Hello! My name is Lynn Larsen. Most people call me Ms. L. I am a professional artist and an art teacher. I learned about Patreon through my volunteer work with Nature of Sound who got in contact with me through my volunteer work with VYVA Inc. who are now both on Patreon. Because of the nature of volunteer work \"and let me tell you teaching falls under volunteer work\" I need to start earning money so I have more to give back to my community. Therefore, since I can not really add hours to the day I need to add options to my pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am venturing into another Social Media platform (note Social Media is not my strong suit) but I will do my best to add new pictures of my art as I create it. It may be animation tutorials I create to teach my students how to use as ruler or we all might get really lucky and I will finally finish an oil painting I have been working on for 4 years {hint it is an homage to Star Wars}.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope you enjoy my work whatever it turns out to be.\u003cbr\u003e"

Once I reach $200 I can take one day off to start working on it. I, along with every Star Wars Fan in my circle, wants to see this painting finished. I always say work is easier when you have a team.
