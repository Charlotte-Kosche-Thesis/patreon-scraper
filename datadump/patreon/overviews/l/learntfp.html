    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my exclusive Patreon community! I am working super hard to bring quality flight instruction to YouTube videos and Podcasts. I know people are getting a lot of information through these channels and I want to make sure they get the best information out there. I have been teaching flying for the last 20 years and have worked to perfect the art of instruction. I love helping pilots make connections and find solutions that will make them safer in the skies. When I\u0027m not teaching or editing, I write for FLYING magazine, teach for AOPA\u0027s Air Safety Institute, work with the FAA,and do whatever I can to support this habit of professional flight instruction.  I launched the Finer Points podcast in 2005 and have continued to produce it ever since. But after 2009 and 5 years of weekly production (and a baby!) things started to slow down. It\u0027s been a lot of effort to get back onto a regular publication schedule and grow into a YouTube channel!\u00a0But I\u0027m doing it. In 2018 I\u0027m back with videos or podcasts every week. This take a LOT of time to put together. A lot more than most people realize and your support here is a part of what makes it all possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs one of my Patrons you\u0027ll get access longer form lesson videos, multiple camera angle edits (when we get there), raw phone calls from audio episodes (most of this stuff usually ends up on the cutting room floor), all of the Finer Points Safety Session podcasts and archived podcast feed with all the greatest legacy episodes intact."
