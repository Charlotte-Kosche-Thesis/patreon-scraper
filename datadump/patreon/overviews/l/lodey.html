I\u0027m very dedicated to Twitch, having done this for about three years now, so quitting just doesn\u0027t seem to be one of my commands. I come from very humble origins, when I started, I was only casually streaming with no camera or overlays on an old rig, but I\u0027ve always made improvements until I got to where I am today. Of course, I couldn\u0027t have done it without the support of everyone that allowed me to buy games or equipment, like consoles, a capture card, a green screen setup, etc.\u00a0At the very core of what I do is entertaining and interacting with my community on a friend-to-friend basis. I am not a personality, but I\u0027d like to think of you all as my extended family. Formerly, I used to stream late nights, but now as a morning caster, I\u0027m hoping to reconnect with some old friends and a different side of Twitch! I used to work a job in conjunction with my streaming schedule, but for the time being, I am solely streaming to support myself. Therefore, under these circumstances, your support means a heck of a lot to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to eventually take streaming to the next level and go full time. If the numbers work out and it\u0027s feasible for me to do so, I want to take the Abraham_Linksys brand to the next level. I am always improving my content and quality, so it\u0027s more about fostering the community and getting everyone more involved with each other, even off stream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you made your way here to help ensure that I can continue to do this and live within reasonable means, you have my utmost gratitude.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt goes without saying, content creation is a time-consuming pastime that doesn\u0027t come without sacrifices, whether that\u0027s a social life or free time, we rely on each other--there is no me without you all there as the backbone. Your support not only helps the stream move forward, but simply inspires me to keep innovating my show. It\u0027s humbling to rely solely on the gratitude of others, so hopefully what I offer you is worth your time! Thanks!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

I\u0027ve worked extremely hard to get to where I am, never sacrificing personal values for the sake of success. My stream is a jovial little bastion of silliness, miscellaneous banter and interactivity that will always be at the forefront of what I do. I don\u0027t take myself too seriously and neither does my community! I stream 6 days a week and can\u0027t thank you everyone enough for helping me do this, Twitch is by far the most fulfilling thing I\u0027ve done with my life thus far and will continue to build upon the framework I\u0027ve laid out already.
