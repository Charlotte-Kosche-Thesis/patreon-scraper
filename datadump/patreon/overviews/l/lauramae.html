My name is Laura-Mae, and I\u0027m one of those folks that is crazy enough to try and draw cartoons for a living! I am currently twenty-six years old and living in Texas with my fianc\u00e9 Marty and our four furry children Ringo, Piper, River, and Yolandi. Right now the majority of my income is made through \u003cem\u003eSteven Universe\u003c/em\u003e adoptables and/or \u003cem\u003eAdventure Time\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0commissions, as well as the occasional commission and graphic artist gig from my local community. Art-wise my main focus is on creating pieces that are cartoony, cutesy, colorful, and polished! When I\u0027m not drawing SU trash and wondering why I exist, I really love to design characters and make comics. Ahh, comics~ My one true (art) love...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/bf76/f/2017/183/1/c/title_2a_by_lmshangout-dbet0t2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eAs the saying goes: I\u0027ve been drawing since I could pick up a pencil. I remember doodling in many a storybook and drawing little gifts for anyone and everyone when I was a wee gremlin. When I was a bit older, I started to share my art online. I joined deviantART as Kajikonjou in the early 2000s to do just that. (Fun Fact: Kajikonjou is Japanese for \"Fire Spirit\" according to some random, and I\u0027m sure \t\u003cem\u003every credible\u003c/em\u003e \twebsite on Google.) And what did I draw? DOGS. Lots and lots of dogs. All facing to the left, and all with oddly blocky mouths.\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cimg src=\"http://orig02.deviantart.net/03ae/f/2017/182/2/4/allaine_cm_by_lmshangout-dbep7xy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\tI continued to draw a wide myriad of dogs until high school. During this time I wanted to be a voice actor despite my obvious passion for drawing. When I started taking art classes in my sophomore year, I began to feel accepted and appreciated by my peers. I was in my school\u0027s National Art Honor Society for the rest of my high school career. In addition to that, I was the NAHS\u0027s secretary in my junior year and its president in my senior year. During this part of my life, I began to gear all my focus into making my art something that I could dedicate my whole life to. It was also during this time in my life that I began to take a strong interest in something I still feel passionate about to this day: CAHMICS!\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cimg src=\"http://orig04.deviantart.net/a968/f/2017/182/1/4/sandf_cm_by_lmshangout-dbepmqx.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\tOnce I graduated high school I took about a year off to just...\u003cem\u003echill\u003c/em\u003e. During this time I was, of course, spending much time on deviantART, creating all kinds of fan characters and clubs. I was soon able to get my first job as a cashier at my then-local Target. Just about every lunch break I would be doodling on napkins or on the note pages and margins of my planner. Other than that, I had little time to work on my art. This job helped me to pay my half of rent at the apartment I lived in at the time, and maybe get a video game or two on the side. I loved being able to buy my own shit, but feeling too exhausted to draw every day was a little heartbreaking I must admit. A year after I started my job I hit my \"lucky break.\" I managed to land a graphic artist job in my city at a local shirt and sign shop. It was here that I learned more about advertisement and logo-based work. After another year I began to work from home for...let\u0027s say...personal reasons! It was a good gig for a while but after about a month I \t\u003cem\u003eguess\u003c/em\u003e they hired another artist because my tiny white ass never heard from them again!\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cimg src=\"http://orig10.deviantart.net/46bd/f/2017/182/1/2/beelady_cm_by_lmshangout-dbepvmt.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\tSo there I was, moved back in with my dad, single again, and out of a job. What did I do? Well...I did a lot of soul-searching...as anyone in their early twenties often does! And I had something of an epiphany with my work. I created my magnum opus \u2013 my one project that I wanted to dedicate my life to: \t\u003cem\u003eLooking Up\u003c/em\u003e. It was an autobiographical comic with a focus on life lessons and also fart jokes. For a few months I dedicated whole days of time to just brainstorming, sketching, and writing \u2013 basically I was allowed to dedicate everything to it. I started to share this comic online and I really felt like I was going in the right direction with my life. \t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\u003cimg src=\"http://orig06.deviantart.net/e2f3/f/2017/183/4/6/ringo_cm_by_lmshangout-dbessmk.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\tSpeaking of life, it\u0027s got a funny, funny way of working. I was single for a couple of years and had planned to stay that way for a long while. But one fateful February I met good ol\u0027 Marty while I was visiting my mom in Texas. It wasn\u0027t long before we started talking, hooked up, and I moved halfway across the country to live with him. Now, two years later, Marty and I are just settling into our own place. So...I\u0027m gonna have to start paying some rent! While I\u0027m more than willing to get a job to do this, I know from experience that this will leave me with little time to give to creating my artwork. This, of course, is where Patreon comes in. The less I have to focus on getting money, the more time I can devote to my passion. It\u0027s as simple as that! I hope that you will consider helping me in the process of getting to this goal. And of course, there are all kinds of things that you can get in return for lending me a hand.
