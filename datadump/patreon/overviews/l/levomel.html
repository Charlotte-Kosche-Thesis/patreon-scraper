I choose this medium because of its collaborative nature - every project is an opportunity to work with a new musician, dancer, carpenter, painter, actor, activist, explorer, entrepreneur etc. When our work is successful we share in the fruits of our labor, strengthening our connections to each other and to the communities that we represent. In a world that\u0027s reaching its boiling point, authentic and powerful human connections are an imperative to our survival. Creating and sharing art is one of the best ways to build community. I choose to create beautiful things because we need beautiful things in our society to remind us of the collective human potential to love. \u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to contribute to my efforts, you are not just supporting me but everyone I work with. If you choose to contribute to my efforts, I consider you a collaborator from the depth of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I CREATE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy cinematic work includes Narrative Films, Music Videos, Documentaries, Visual Installations, and Promotional Content (for organizations/causes committed to doing good in our communities). The people I collaborate with are local artists and activists. I choose to work with them because I believe in their voices, appreciate the beauty of their creations and admire their courage to use their resources to dismantle systems of power that oppress the majority of our brothers and sisters. For that same reason, I avoid more commercial or corporate work as I do not want to further empower those who already control a large portion of wealth and attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFILMS I FINISHED IN 2017:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDead Ends\u003c/em\u003e - 12 minute - Experimental Documentary exploring the dead end streets of Atlanta.

If I continue honing my craft, exploring, and surrounding myself with diverse, talented, open-hearted people, I have faith that we will build a powerful force. My hope is that this force can challenge the institutional problems of our society including the patriarchy, white supremacy and ecological destruction. \u003cbr\u003eAs we begin 2018, I hope to use your support to realize projects that channel this communal force towards sustainable artistic and social change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. I plan to lay down the foundations to finish and direct my first feature length film\u00a0exploring the question of parenthood in an ecologically, politically and spiritually unstable world.\u003cbr\u003e2.\u00a0I would like to produce a Docu-Fiction Web-Series featuring local artists trying to make ends meat, in surreal situations. \u003cbr\u003e3.\u00a0My work with Sequoyah Murray and the greater Atlanta music scene has inspired me to make my craft available to young musicians who want to bring the songs to life on the screen.\u003cbr\u003e4.\u00a0 And of course, I plan on continuing to provide my services to organizations dedicated to the pursuit of a better, more egalitarian world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD HELP ME WITH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. I want to pay the people I work with! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect this to be an alternative to more traditional forms of funding. However, at the moment, a lot of my projects rely on the incredible generosity of my collaborators time and labor-power. I\u0027m fortunate to have a network of people willing to create without the expectation of income, but we all got bills to pay. My first priority would be providing some material compensation to the amazing designers, actors, production staff, and crew for their hard work helping me realize my visions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Equipment costs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently my gear consists of: Sony A7S camera, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm Olympus Zuiko Prime lenses, 18-105mm Sony E Zoom lens, 70-210mm Vivitar Zoom Lens, Manfrotto Tripod, Audio Recorder (Tascam DR60), Shotgun Mic AT897, 23\u201d Revo Track Slider.\u003cbr\u003eI also have recurring costs which include: Subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud, Camera Insurance, Dropbox Subscription and Website fees. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis gives me the flexibility to offer my services to people without having to rent everything. However, there are essential tools that I would like to acquire with the goal of keeping long-term costs down and to approach self-sufficiency.\u003cbr\u003eI would like to expand my kit with: Lavalier Microphones for better audio recording, Lighting Equipment for higher quality images and a Camera Monitor to more accurately interpret the footage. \u003cbr\u003eThese tools would be available to my community with the same goal of minimizing costs and overhead for local creatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Festival Submissions and Travel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to get my work out there, festival applications and submissions necessitate specific and individual fees for entry ranging from 10$ to 60$. Being accepted to a film festival is a great opportunity, except it means taking time off work to travel to distant cities. Your contribution would allow me to submit work and travel to local and national film festivals including Atlanta Film Festival, Austin Film Festival, New Orleans FIlm Festival, Camden Film Festival, Denver Film Festival and  Hot Springs Documentary Festival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Stability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work in the service industry, so a big part of my income comes from tips. It\u2019s not the most stable source of income since a rainy weekend, a\u003ca href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/local/things-know-now-about-the-bridge-collapse/Wge6pwVF4kPJx6J0TuaTHL/\"\u003e collapse of a major highway\u003c/a\u003e or a big festival on the other side of town can mean the difference between affording car insurance or paying off a medical bill.
