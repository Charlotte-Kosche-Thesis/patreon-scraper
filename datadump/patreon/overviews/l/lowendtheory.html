    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhy am I doing \u2018this\u2019\u2026 Really easy to answer. I am decolonizing theory; I am introducing the a of the far-left into considering needs that exist outside of Eurocentric salvation. Non-white theorists, deserve attention too\u2014 moreso in America. Why? Because in America, our communities are much more heterogenous than any other place in which a successful anti-capitalist, decolonial movement has occurred. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy beliefs I stand, within an anti-capitalist framework, heavily influenced by NeoZapatismo, Bolo\u0027bolo, The Black Panthers, Ocallan, and Ho Chi-Minh Thought. \u00a0All of the above are nationalists who believe in freedom from the very bottom, up. All listed movements were and are horizontally led by of people of color. The NeoZapatismos reject eurocentric thought, as well as The Black Panthers. Ho Chi Minh was the first to decolonize within the Marxist string. The Black Panthers, becsuse they knew where to find and how to build Black radicals. Bolo\u0027bolo because it is the modeen day take on inter-ohase revolution. Ocallan because, no Black or Brown individual is the same, so we need to learn how to operate as islands of thought that can form consensi locally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, I am not a Third Worldist in the Western sense. I am an afro-pessimist/optimist (a la Frank B. Wilderson), and also deeply influenced by Gramsci.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to learn how to build this movement for all of us. Why is the well-hidden racism on the Left important to recognize if The Right is already so blatantly racist and obviously an enemy? From an early age, all of us, around the globe, are imbued with varying levels of racism being brought across borders directly through America\u2019s insistence on neoliberal imperialism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout dealing with our racism, and our preference towards white scholars who believe they knew best, we are at a loss. We are unable to unify as an unstoppable mass with momentum driven by love from the barrel of Farthest Left theory in the direction of capitalism, and through its burst belly. We will need to aim to be so true that our argumentation will be undeniable, moreso than that of the discourse of dialectics. Does this mean Marx was Wrong? Absolutely not. That is a red herring of an argument. However, Marx is lacking in his presentation of solutions for the heterogenous, multicultural, and colonized communities of subaltern not only domestically, but internationally. We are more than a proletarian mass. We are more than a mass of individuals, as well. We are a mass of populations with lost histories and cultures who are in fact able to cooperate regardless of the bourgeoisie version of nationalism that defines a winner and a loser through both explicit and implicit representations of subordination. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can preserve our populations and maintain heterogeneity and variety regardless of Marx\u2019 insistence on our homogeneity as proletarian peoples. We are subaltern, oppressed in more ways than one. It is lost to me as to why the suggestions of subaltern populations in America are invalid if they do see through a Marxist lens. So, what do you propose? To destroy the biggest threat to humanity, America, we need to unite regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, age, level of able-bodied/mindedness, and work together to decolonize our movement\u2014 to move beyond our dependence on white academia predominantly sold to us at \u201chigher education\u201d, and into theory brought to us from subaltern populations here. What does this mean for the makeup of the movement? There is no room for racists. There is no room for dogmatism. There is only room for absolute autonomy of an oppressed peoples. Tactics? We need to identify these populations, and listen to what they need, what they want, and the means they seek to achieve it. Then, we need to call upon consensus. Consent. That is the program I am campaigning for. The insistence on an ideology a white man has developed to suit a proletariat will not work without nuance. Those who refuse to know more about Marxist history than that of the struggles of their ancestors pre-Marxism refuse salvation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with this, I\u0027d like to introduce what I\u0027ll be calling low-end theory for the time being, a combination of inner-circle Leftist critiques, long-form autobiographical experiences as a radical activist, as well as the translation of obscurist academic literature into vernacular and access to revolutionary tactics otherwise mystified beneath personality cults, sectarianism, and other noisy distractions. And as always, I want to answer questions people have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
