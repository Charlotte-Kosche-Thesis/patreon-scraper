What started as a conversation about WoWCrendor, Myndflame, and Oxhorn, lead to a serious discussion about making our own Machinima. I pulled out my phone, and started to write certain ideas for characters, story, etc. In the weeks to follow, I would buy Sony Vegas Pro 12, watch various tutorials on YouTube, and start work on what I considered to be one of my greatest adventures to date. Finally, on my 18th birthday, March 7th, I released the first episode of my passion project, \u003cem\u003e\"Aligning Azeroth\"\u003c/em\u003e. The show would later spawn 20+ episodes, art and music videos, sketches, and even top 10s, something that I didn\u0027t think was possible four years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P7xnhbhar24\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eSo, why come to Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been an avid gamer all my life, and a World of Warcraft player for at least \u003cem\u003eten\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0years\u003c/em\u003e, but in my time playing video games, I have learned to shape my storytelling ability into something greater. My purpose is to continue to improve upon this mastery, and eventually, work in the film industry. Recently, I was accepted into the Film and Science School at Columbia College Chicago, but due to the crushing amount of debt I would succumb after receiving my Bachelors, I have decided to take 2016 and 2017 off to work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as my ultimate goal goes, my \u003cem\u003ecurrent goal\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eis to continue to work more on Aligning Azeroth, Odyssey, and more sketches for the channel, all while working a part-time job and editing videos for other channels. You can imagine all of this equates to a lot, and I mean a \u003cstrong\u003eLOT\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0of stress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned, I have been working on my passion project, \u003cem\u003e\"Aligning Azeroth\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for at least four years, and I continue to expand my work into different projects, such as music/art videos (\u003cem\u003e\"Natural Light\"\u003c/em\u003e), sketches, (\u003cem\u003e\"Follow the Stars\"\u003c/em\u003e), a holiday special (\"\u003cem\u003eOh Snowballs!\u003c/em\u003e\"), and my mini series (\"\u003cem\u003eWhy I Hate...\u003c/em\u003e\").\u00a0Because of these projects, I have been able to work with other like-minded artists from here in my hometown, to Connecticut, to Vancouver, and even across the ocean to the UK and Sweden! My work has even caught the attention of fellow WoW Machinimator, Nixxiom, and he has recruited me this past year to be one of his fellow editors on his channel! Working on these videos and posting more frequently this past year has also made me come out of my shell and start streaming over on Twitch, which I will continue to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9GR3dJC5yNk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat does the future hold for Lawrencium Productions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we are focused on releasing:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe rest of Aligning Azeroth: Season 2\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAligning Azeroth Remastered Episodes (5, and possibly 6 are slated for release)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOdyssey: A Thunderhawks Tale Season 1\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShort Sketches\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTop 10s and Fun Fact Videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eAlright, so you finished babbling on about your works and the future.
