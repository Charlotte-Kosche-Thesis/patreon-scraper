    "summary": "Because, I AM a writer. \u00a0I write everyday. \u00a0I\u0027ve been writing stories since I was thirteen. \u00a0I have a concrete, multi-faceted plan which I have been acting on, which includes writing, blogging, counseling and guidance services, and selling of natural products, and more to be revealed in time. \u00a0Some days are more productive than others. \u00a0My health has been a\u00a0deterrent\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the link to ONE OF the websites I\u0027m creating: \u00a0It\u0027s not up yet, but soon to be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewww.vedaezmeralda.com\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of explaining why you might want to support me, let\u0027s keep it simple. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you like me?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDo you think I have talent?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDo you believe in me?\u003cbr\u003eDo you think I am intelligent, hard-working, detail oriented, determined, tenacious, bold, and passionate?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m supposed to do a video to explain how this Patreon stuff works. \u00a0It\u0027s in the works, but for now: \u00a0You can pledge one time donation, or any amount per story and limit the amount you pledge each month. \u00a0For example, if you pledge $1 a story, and I put up four stories a month, you will be Patronizing me for $4 a month. \u00a0If I put up eight stories a month and you pledge $1 a story, You will be Patronizing me for $8 a month. \u00a0If you want to limit your Patronage to $5 a month, and I post eight stories in a month, your limit of $5 will be honored.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, I am humbled to have received this compliment about some of my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"That is fantastic! YOU have talent.\"\u003cbr\u003e-Mark Opsasnick, author of \"The Lizard King Was Here\" and \"Capitol Rock\" among others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to share with you several stories. \u00a0 The first is for\u00a0all my peeps in Puerto Viejo. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParticular Personas in Puerto\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know the first time I saw Santa he didn\u0027t have a red suit on.  There were no reindeer about.  And I certainly wasn\u0027t at The North Pole.  I spotted him peddling on his rasta tri-colored  10 speed down the main Calle in Puerto Viejo, Talamanca, Lim\u00f3n,  Costa Rica.   Three braids with bright blue and orange beads in his long white beard, flowing back with the salty ocean breeze.  He was well tanned wearing only flip flops and board shorts.  His wire framed glasses were tinted against the sun.  His head wrapped in a purple and white  kaffeya.  His torso, which is lean and long, was gleaming with sweat from the humidity that swims along the shores of the Caribbean sea.  His red nose, slightly burned by the sun, was smack dab in the middle of a radiant smile.  Not exactly a sight you\u0027d forget.  Even though that\u0027s the picture in my head, I sometimes doubt myself, and been known to be wrong.  But I know Santa now and that\u0027s him, spot on.  And you know what he told me...  he can be anyone he wants to be, ....and he can.  After all, he IS Santa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn certain days he decides not to talk among people, only nodding, smiling, and using hand gestures.  I see him all around town.  Having an espresso and watching the ocean at The Puerto Pirata Deli, or picking up dinner fixings at Mopri\u0027s fish market. \u00a0Stopping in at La Ruka Hostel to buy a brownie.  Having breakfast at his everyday spot in Cocles or a very occasional drink at Tasty Waves or The Lazy Mon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned before, Santa does have days where he doesn\u0027t speak but when ride my Blue Diva beach cruiser down to his cabina, its different.  I kick off my flip flops at his front steps, settle into the adornadak chair, sip a pipa water and we smoke some naturale, we always talk.  What happen\u00bf.  Always the weather.  As much outside living as we do, it can\u0027t be helped.  Lluvia. Mucho lluvia.    We speak about many things.  Love at first sight, personal inherent abilities, the local indigenous Bri-Bri tribe, organic chickens and cashews, dreams and literature. Travel and Thailand.  Flowers and Fauna.  Drugs and money. Astronomy  and astrology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe tells a story about how he wanted to have something done to his specifications and someone  asked him, \" What\u0027s the problem?\"  He says, \"There is  no problem.  This is how I want it.  What\u0027s the problem with that?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSanta got news somehow that the ex- missus Clause wanted to sell the house up North.  With no phone and an email hack, he couldn\u0027t respond.   You\u0027d think in these times of technology and modernization, it wouldn\u0027t be a hassle to get it fixed.  But honestly, it\u0027s a pain in the ass if your living partially off the grid.  Particularly in Puerto where they didn\u0027t even string in the electricity until the 1980\u0027s.  Besides, Santa has a no bullshit, no problem,  laid back vibe and fuck whatever is a hassle attitude.  It\u0027s constant companion is a jolly laugh and a big old smile.  So he did what we used to do in the not so far distant past, and sent the ex-missus a postcard.  Because....  well.... he DID know the address as he DID used to live there.  The pony express still works, even internationally.   He wrote, \u0027Sell the house- Best Regards\u0027.  Santa was tickled with himself when he told me that tidbit and he laughed his jolly laugh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6 days from now it will be a year since seeing Santa or having my feet in the sand at the beach in Costa Rica.  I\u0027ve only have fresh coconut water served to me at a restaurant in a glass, with ice.  It\u0027s just not the same if a little Tico man with blood shot eyes doesn\u0027t chop the top off of a husk with a machete while you\u0027re looking at the ocean and balancing a bicycle. \u003cbr\u003eSanta is up North on vacation from his vacation, it is, after all, Spring.  I hope to see him one day soon, but if not, he sends me blessings all the time, and that\u0027s enough of a present.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShedding Skin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSnakes do it.  Why shan\u0027t we?  Sloughing off\nwhat no longer serves us, and feeling free in freshness and grass. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nhad a dream as a child, standing in the side yard where we played\nsoftball on top of the hill, looking down into the grass.  Then I was\nin the grass, in a snake body, seeing through my snake eyes,\nslithering towards my human body.  Through my snake eyes, I could see\nmy human form and I was headed towards it.  Then I was in human body\nyet again, and I was petrified and I knew the snake slithering in the\ngrass towards me was THERE!   Because I had just been there.  I\nknew exactly where he or she was, but I couldn\u0027t see the slithering\nsnake in the grass.  I was petrified and frozen.  I was\nwaiting with anticipation.  It\u0027s been to many years since that\ndream and I can\u0027t recall how many times I was in myself and then\nwithin the snake, but back and forth several times from reptile to\nhuman again.   \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow\nis the time to slough off the old skin and slither afresh through the\nblades.  Now is the time to slide into the snakes skin and see\nthrough the eyes of another creature, cold blooded as it may seem, it\nis just different, another point of view which maybe is time\nto be seen.  What\nskin might you like to slough off? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
