I started in digital video before I started in kink as a way of expressing myself and the stories that I enjoyed. Patreon is my way of bringing those passions into the kink world. It has enabled me to produce content more regularly and to increase the quality of that content over time. Thank you all very much for supporting what I am doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat am I doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI am steadily creating art and education on a regular basis. Since I do this in my free time it can certainly be something of a challenge. When you\u0027re associated in a genre that is flooded with low quality porn it can be even more difficult. My goal is to put out high quality content for a cost that gets spread out among those that want to see it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat do my patrons get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI post content on Patreon, Fetlife, Twitter, and occasionally on Instagram. The content that I put out there get trickled out over several months. My patrons get access to images, thoughts and videos before I post them anywhere else. Depending on your level of patronage you can get anything from my finished images, challenges that were faced in production, to even being able to make decisions and offer suggestions during pre-production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eAnything else?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eYou should know that my content is adult in nature and is not safe for work (NSFW). While I focus on sexual themes I do strive to avoid crossing the blurry line between art and porn. In the end I hope that you enjoy yourself and the content that I provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThank you all!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eMy patrons, friends, family and fans make these things even more awesome. Without you none of this would be possible.\u003cbr\u003e~LB"
