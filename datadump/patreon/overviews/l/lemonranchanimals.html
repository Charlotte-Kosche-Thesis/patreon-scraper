    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you for joining us in our mission to create more compassion for animals typically only seen as food. As a 501c3 non profit we are entirely funded by your generosity. Every cent goes to the care and support of our animals. We want to continue to offer forever homes to those poor souls considered unworthy, those kind spirits that have somehow ended up without a home full of love. Join me on this incredible journey!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow about a little backstory?\u003cbr\u003eThis story starts a long time ago. It wasn\u2019t in a galaxy\nfar, far away (it was actually right in this galaxy) but it\u2019s just as epic. During summer vacation my mom and I would stay at her friend\u0027s farm so they could take a much needed break. It was a glorious farm full of dogs, cats, goats, horses, a cow, chickens, a\nmean ass rooster (George), a burro and a bevy of house pets. All magically (or\nsometimes not so magically) drawn to the farm because there was nowhere else\nfor them to go. It was a paradise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI learned how to cut\ntrees to make fences. I learned how hard it is to shovel. I felt unparalleled\nfreedom and happiness when riding my horse, Angel, at full speed through open\nfields. I learned how to avoid George. I cuddled every creature there.\nEndlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis wonderful mecca has lived in my mind all of my life.\nI\u2019ve tried to be a professional in the advertising world. I\u2019ve tried to start\nbusiness after business to feed my hunger of finding my purpose but it wasn\u2019t\nuntil now that it seemed possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBehold! Lemon Ranch Animal Sanctuary. Named after my friends, the Lemons, who gave this independent, passionate but shy young girl her first\nvision of Shangri La. I want every child, person and troubled soul to know what\nit\u2019s like to be surrounded by every creature possible. To laugh at their\nsilliness and to revel in their kindness. To feel proud that they bettered a\nlife and to feel unconditional love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is the mission of Lemon Ranch Animal Sanctuary to rescue and provide sanctuary to homeless or unwanted creatures. Through contact with animals, we provide positive life-affirming activities for individuals with troubled souls. With the relationships built between animal and human, we plan to grow a new crop of animal lovers."
