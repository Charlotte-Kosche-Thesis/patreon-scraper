    "summary": "I\u0027ll start by telling you about myself a little. I\u0027m an artist based out of St. Paul, MN. I mostly focus on comics and illustrations, but I also do murals, graphic design and I\u0027m an art teacher at a local middle school.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a campaign I\u0027ve put together to support a weekly comic I\u0027m producing. It will start out being released weekly (every wednesday) until I\u0027m done.... ONLY ON THIS PATREON. No one else will see it until it\u0027s finished.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to explain what this project is for, or who it is for, I\u0027ll have to be candid for a moment so bear with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little less than a year ago me and my wife of almost 10 years split up. We have 5 wonderful boys together. They are a bright light shining on the world, perfect in every way. Needless to say, at times they\u0027ve had a hard time dealing with my ex and I\u0027s breakup. My middle son (Malcolm) in particular is having the most trouble, acting out for attention in ways I haven\u0027t seen before. I knew I had to do something, because I wasn\u0027t connected the way I should\u0027ve. I had an epiphany one day, why don\u0027t I use comics to connect with my own son, the way I connect with my students. So I asked him, \"do you want to make a comic together buddy?\"... I\u0027ve never seen him so happy. His happiness is contagious. This has not been an easy process for me either. It\u0027s all he talks about now. So then I thought, it would be really cool if he could hold it in his hands, bring it to school and show his friends, be proud of it and himself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s where Patreon comes in. Anything that you pledge goes straight into making this a book. Please don\u0027t think of it as a donation though. This is us working together as a team to create real, interesting comics. They design all the monsters and their costumes and powers. I make it into a comic. I will also be offering commissions in the art style of the book, as well as much more. Visit the table on the right and find the right pledge tier for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, if you support me in any way, I appreciate you more than words can say. It\u0027s not my goal to take over the industry with this comic, just to make a very special little boy happy and proud. I just want him to know that I will always love him, no matter what happens, and that he will always have me in his corner. If you want to come with us on this journey, you\u0027re more than welcomed. On behalf of me and my boys, Thank you!"
