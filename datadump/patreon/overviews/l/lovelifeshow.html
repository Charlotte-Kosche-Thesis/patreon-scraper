    "summary": "Hey gorgeous, wonderful to have your beautiful energy\nvisiting the show\u0027s Patreon page! The Love Life Show is a weekly podcast, created and hosted\nby me, Jane Donovan, which discusses all things to do with love, life and happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I am kept busy running a social networking and matchmaking business in Adelaide, producing this heart-centred podcast show is truly my\npassion. Starting back in January 2013 with my then\nco-host Rebecca Dettman, we produced 200 weekly episodes discussing everything from dating to family dynamics, emotional healing and spirituality. Since October 2016, with the divine support of our loyal listeners (which I fondly call the \u0027Love Life Tribe\u0027), I have been taking the show forward in a new format as a solo creator.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision is simple \u2013 no matter where they\nare in the world, people who might be struggling can treat the show as their\nown private and safe space to be nurtured, understood, healed, embraced,\nsoothed and loved. The Love Life Show\nembraces sensitivity, compassion and empathy as the wonderful gifts that they\nare. Whether a listener needs support with every day life, or if they\u2019re\nlooking to learn about a topic for a loved one or just shine their light a\nlittle brighter themselves, this is the spiritual and emotional health show\nproduced just for them. You can have a listen to all the episodes to date at\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.lovelifeshow.com\"\u003ewww.lovelifeshow.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo when I say the show is for them, what I\nmean is \u2013 it\u2019s really their show. Each week\u2019s topic is usually inspired by a\nquestion emailed in from a Love Life Tribe member. My favourite episodes are\nwhen I\u2019ve someone from the Tribe on the show, asking questions and sharing\ntheir stories of overcoming challenges, joys and achievements. I get a great\nsense of joy by giving the show\u2019s listeners a platform and we\u2019ve had people\ntalking about everything you could imagine; from communicating with the\nuniverse, manifesting their desires, facing their fears, learning to have\nhealthy and loving relationships, healing childhood wounds and soothing anxiety.\nThe Tribe definitely know what they\u2019re doing because I\u2019m humbled to say that\nthe show has a 5-star rating on iTunes. We have people listening from over 70\ncountries, from India to the UK and Canada, so the Tribe really are spreading\ntheir love and kindness all around the globe. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI cannot thank the Love Life Tribe enough \u2013\nthey have supported me each step of the way. They\u2019ve given me the strength to\nrecord and produce, what have sometimes been very emotional and difficult\nepisodes on my own. They\u2019ve encouraged and supported me at times when I\u2019ve\nreally doubted myself. Am I good enough? Do I have more to share? Do I have the\ntime to produce a show that my listeners really deserve? Can I keep doing this?\nIt will be their friendly voices coming to me from an email, message, phone\ncall or Facebook post that motivates me to do my best, and I plan to keep doing\nmy best for them for a long time to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow my goal is to have more time to take\nthe show forward to another level \u2013 I want to be able to interview more Love\nLife Tribers on the show, to spend more time editing and researching topics. I\nhope to improve the recording equipment, to have a PA help me with emails and\nscheduling, to create more online content, to host live Facebook events, to have a live real time chat room and to\nbuild a bigger, more intimate on-line community where people can help and\nencourage each other. I want to take the Tribe\u2019s ideas for new support tools\nand turn them into a reality for them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve got loads of ideas for the Love Life\nShow, but in order to move forward I need resources, time and finances. So this\nis where I ask my listeners to help me. If you enjoy the show, could you\nconsider becoming a Love-Life Patron and contributing? I\u2019ve created this page\nto ask those who can, and who feel like the show has helped them or a loved one\nin some way, to support the podcasts. Together we can continue to help those in need to carry on\nreceiving free resources that will teach them to live a happier, more\nself-empowered life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have thought of some different ways to\nsay thank you for any donations below, and very much welcome having you as a\nPatron of the Love Life Show. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFrom a very humbled Jane Donovan, with\nbucket loads of love and a big squishy hug. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJane x\u003cbr\u003e"
