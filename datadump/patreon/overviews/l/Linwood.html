    "summary": "Hello, My\nname is Masterjap. I\u2019m a Dutch Youtuber playing games for your and my\nentertainment since July 2013. I\u2019ve been playing a lot of old games since my\nbeginning but now that my channel grows and the new releases become more and\nmore interesting, I\u2019ve been playing those games as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy channel\nhas grown a lot in the last year. Since I started a series in Software Inc. my\nchannel has really taken off. I feel like I owe so many people so much that I\nwant to do more and more for my fans but can\u2019t because I just can\u2019t spent more\ntime and money on Youtube then I already do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat is the\nreason I started up a Patreon campaign. Some people have mentioned that they\nwould like to give me money to continue my Youtube story, but I feel I can\u2019t\nallow that without me giving back to them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s why\nmy goals are all the rewards are aimed at giving back to the people who go the\nextra way. For people who don\u2019t have the money to do this, I don\u2019t blame you.\nNothing will change for you, the only thing that will happen is that everything\nwill get better for you as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor now the\nrewards are a little bare because I don\u2019t have much to give back. But the\nlonger my channel exists the more there will be created and eventually there\nmay even be T-shirts, posters and things like that. At that point, my rewards\nwill get bigger and people who support me get more and more back."
