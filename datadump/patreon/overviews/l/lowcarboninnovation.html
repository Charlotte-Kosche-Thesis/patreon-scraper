    "summary": "Giving back is important to me. It\u0027s part of my upbringing and my values. The challenges of climate change and the incredible innovations underway in low-carbon technology and policy beckoned. But traditional volunteering has been impossible when work has taken me to five continents, ten countries and 24 cities in the past seven years alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started using my research, analysis and writing skills to give back from where ever I happened to be. \u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Barnard-14\"\u003eQuora is my canvas\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ve contributed almost 5,000 answers, many have of which have been re-syndicated to Forbes, Huffington Post, Newsweek, Slate and Quartz. I maintain a blog of my \u003ca href=\"https://lowcarboninnovation.quora.com/Low-Carbon-Innovation\"\u003ebest low-carbon innovation content\u003c/a\u003e there too. Quora has honoured me with Top Writer status every year since the first program in 2013 and my answers have well over 8 million views. My material has been published and referenced in text books and been translated into several other languages, including Taiwanese. I\u0027ve published more formally on a number of sites such as \u003ca href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/author/mikebarnard/\"\u003eCleanTechnica\u003c/a\u003e, RenewEconomy and New Atlas. And I was honoured to serve pro bono as Senior Fellow - Wind with a Washington think tank for a year and to produce a major report on \u003ca href=\"http://www.energyandpolicy.org/wind-health-impacts-dismissed-in-court/\"\u003eglobal wind energy and health legal cases\u003c/a\u003e with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u0027s time to take this unrelenting stream of content and make it more concrete. I want to gather it into three well-edited and designed books over the next year or two. And a video blog with professional editing and graphics would provide another channel for my communication. I\u0027d like to use the books as the springboard to leverage my public speaking skills to communicate to groups around the world interested in the massive low-carbon transformation under way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Quora answers will keep on coming regardless of your support. I can\u0027t help myself. I had to admit that writing was part of my identity and not just an activity when I \u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/story/49730029-guangzhou-future-tense?utm_source=web\u0026amp;utm_medium=email\u0026amp;utm_content=share_myworks\"\u003ewrote a novel\u003c/a\u003e in a month a couple of years ago.
