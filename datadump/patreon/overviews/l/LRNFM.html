First, to introduce existing liberty-minded people to new shows.  Second, to provide programming to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://broadcast.lrn.fm\"\u003efree radio stations\u003c/a\u003e.  Both of those things have been and continue to be accomplished.  My new goal is to expand our satellite reach to new ears globally with our ideas of liberty and peace.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLRN.FM has been available on Free-to-Air satellite in North and Central America since 2010. \u00a0We launched our African satellite channel a few years later, covering the Sub-Saharan portion of the continent.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow much does this cost?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn many parts of the world, Africa especially, cable TV installations are non-existent or uncommon due to their high up-front and ongoing cost.  Satellite is the most common form of audio/video entertainment in these areas.  It\u0027s common for homes to already have the Ku-band dish and \"Free-to-Air\" receiver.  For many of the \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm\"\u003e4 billion people in the world who have no internet\u003c/a\u003e (just over 50% of the world\u0027s population as of 2017), Free-to-Air satellite is a lifeline to the world, uncensored by the state.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFree-to-Air means that no subscription is needed to receive the channels.  They are TV or radio channels broadcast \"in-the-clear\", direct-to-home.  Some satellites, like Galaxy 19 over North and Central America have hundreds of Free-to-Air channels, including LRN.FM.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/freetalklive/ftl-talks-to-ako-yusuf-from-cameroon\"\u003eMeet Ako\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://s15.postimg.org/bb5hepjl7/20141231123412-_Ako_Satellite_1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAko lives in Cameroon, Africa, where LRN.FM\u0027s satellite signal has been available since 2012. \u00a0Ako says everyone has Ku-band dishes in Cameroon.  He has personally introduced at least two hundred of his friends to our programs and says they listen and meet regularly to discuss the topics they hear on LRN.FM.  You can \n\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/freetalklive/ftl-talks-to-ako-yusuf-from-cameroon\"\u003elisten to one of our interviews with Ako here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAko tells us the press is heavily restricted in Cameroon.  LRN.FM is the only channel on Free-to-Air advocating the ideas of liberty 24/7, and these ideas are inspiring people like Ako to take action. \u00a0Recently (2017), he\u0027s been involved in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2017/01/cameroon-english-speakers-170127041221360.html\"\u003eongoing struggle of the secessionist English-speaking part of Cameroon to free itself\u003c/a\u003e from the French-speaking remainder.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReaching the Unconnected:\u003c/h3\u003eThe internet is likely something you take for granted.  However, billions of people on Earth have no internet.  Free-to-Air satellite reaches those people, affordably.  New ears will find the message of liberty, as people are frequently \"scanning the band\" and sampling new channels.  That\u0027s how Ako found us.  Then, he spread the word to his friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s really exciting that the ideas of freedom are reaching some of the poorest, most oppressed places on earth.
