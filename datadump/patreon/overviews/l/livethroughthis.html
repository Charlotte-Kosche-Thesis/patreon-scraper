Stage\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m a photographer, suicide awareness activist, and writer based in Philadelphia, PA. I\u0027m also a suicide attempt survivor.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eLive Through This\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(\u003ca href=\"http://livethroughthis.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://livethroughthis.org\u003c/a\u003e) is a collection of the portraits and stories of suicide attempt survivors, as told by those survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://deseraestage.com/LTTIGtiles.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been attacking the issue of suicide from various angles for the past decade: As a part of my undergraduate studies at East Tennessee State University, I co-authored a self-injury self-report (SISR) measure and helped develop studies on suicide, self-injury, and intimate violence. I\u0027m trained in crisis intervention and even have a bit of experience as a hotline counselor and rape care companion. What I\u0027ve found consistently is that suicide is an incredibly difficult topic for most people to face head on\u2014even those in the mental health field. I have plenty of stories of doors closing in my face the moment I mentioned the word. It happened often enough that I took some time away and thought a lot about coming at it from a different angle\u2014one that would appeal to people at the most basic level: human connection.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you read that someone attempts suicide every 40 seconds, that someone dies by suicide every 15 minutes, or that it\u0027s the 10th leading cause of death in the US, it\u0027s pretty easy to move past that without thinking too hard because... well, they\u0027re just numbers. Statistics are a way of disseminating difficult information in an easily digestible\u2014and easily forgettable\u2014way. It occurred to me that an artful, humanistic document of the experience of suicide might help to break down the barriers I kept coming up against.\u00a0I decided to go to the source: suicide attempt survivors, like myself. The meat of \n\u003cem\u003eLive Through This \u003c/em\u003ecomes from talking to other survivors about their experiences with suicide and then, after each interview, making a portrait. Later, I publish that portrait with an excerpt of the survivor\u0027s story on the \u003ca href=\"http://livethroughthis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe idea is to level the playing field and minimize discrimination by showing the faces of real people who have attempted to take their lives, but lived instead. What led them to attempt suicide? What happened afterward? Is suicide still an option? What is treatment like? How do they cope?\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eLive Through This \u003c/em\u003easks the viewer to look into the eyes of the survivors. In doing so, it helps the viewer to realize that these people could be \u003cem\u003eanyone\u2014\u003c/em\u003esuicide does not discriminate. It becomes clear that these people have been through hell, but that they are also engaging, fascinating people whose voices deserve to be heard, and whose experiences should be used to change the way we conceptualize mental health, to inform policymaking, to develop training, and more. Hopefully, these realizations help foster a sense of empathy\u2014even in those who have a hard time understanding because they\u0027ve never been there. The honesty of these portraits and stories empowers the viewer to set their fears aside and to\u003cem\u003e talk about it\u003c/em\u003e, most especially if there is any fear that a loved one might be suicidal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eLive Through This \u003c/em\u003eis the first known project of its kind, exploring a world that has remained a taboo for far too long. It strips the issue of anonymity and encourages survivors to own their experiences publicly and proudly. Suicide is a dark topic, it\u0027s true, but the whole purpose of this project is to shine a light, to cast a line, and to celebrate life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need funding?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nAs of today (12/21/17), I have interviewed and photographed 182 attempt survivors in 35 US cities, from Florida to Alaska and places in between\u2014and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. Each one of these stories takes approximately 20 hours to produce (not including travel time), from the time I sit down to talk with the survivor, to making the portrait, to editing the portrait, to having the interview transcribed, to curating and editing the portion of the story I intend to publish, to formatting the photo/text for the web, to publishing it.\nWith the exception of my wonderful transcriptionists, I do this work alone.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCollecting stories across the country requires funding for travel (I sleep on friends\u0027 couches wherever possible). Gear occasionally needs to be upgraded. Registration fees for academic/professional conferences need to be handled. Cloud storage/backups. Web maintenance. In short, it requires more to maintain than I can give on my own.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery dollar donated goes right back into the project, and is much appreciated by myself, the folks who send me emails every day urging me to keep going, the attempt survivors who have shared their stories, and the ones who still want to share their stories. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nPatreon lets you become a patron of your favorite artists and creators.

Put any amount in the box above, enter your details, and your credit card or PayPal account will be charged that amount once monthly.
