    "summary": "Hi! Thanks so much for checking out my Patreon page. I am a professional guitarist and guitar instructor who is passionate about sharing GOOD, CORRECT education. Please check out the video to hear what I aim to offer, and read below for more about me. Thanks again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\u00a0a professional guitarist based in South London England. Over the years I have built up a diverse career, and am known for my ability to play many different styles in various situations including playing on West End and Touring shows such as; The Lion King, Mamma Mia, The Last Tango,  Jersey Boys, Jackie The Musical, Exposure, Beyond The Fence, Adrian Mole, WAGGS, Momentous Musicals, The Addams Family (UK Premier), Hackney Empire Variety Show, Legally Blonde, Fame, Hairspray, Grease, The Wedding Singer and many more. Live and recorded sessions with artists including; Gareth Gates, John Owen Jones, Asher D (So Solid Crew), Jon Lee (S Club), Jay Norton (The Voice), Hashall (Sony artist), Leona James, Alan Davies (Hawkwind), Fiona Cully and Rachel Button (Nashville recording artists), to name a few.

I hold the chair for 12 piece function band London Soul and London Swing, and dep for various other function and Tribute acts including Queen on Fire, as well as playing in a 19 piece big band and my own fusion trio.\u003cbr\u003eHaving started at an early age essentially self taught with some lessons in school, I eventually went on to study at the Guitar Institute in London, before taking private lessons with renowned guitarist Shaun Baxter. It was Shaun who gave me my first professional break offering me a teaching position at the Academy Of Music and Sound. I eventually left due to playing commitments, but during this time I also achieved LLCM, FLCM and PTLLS qualifications.\u003cbr\u003eI have found himself in a variety of playing situations over the years that have required me to learn other instruments from the Guitar family. As well as Electric, Acoustic, and Nylon I can also play, Banjo, Mandolin, Ukulele, and the percussion instrument Kalimba. www.lewisturnerguitar.com\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
