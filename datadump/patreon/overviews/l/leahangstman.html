    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\t\u2014Charles Dickens, \n\t\u003cem\u003eDavid Copperfield\u003c/em\u003e (1850)\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWelcome. I have built this page in order to achieve something few writers ever get to claim: financial security. Virginia Woolf said a woman needs a room of her own and 500 pounds per year. I have the room, but up until now, I assumed the rest of it meant pounds of candy. But if you like my writing, like me as a person, or just want to help me succeed with new ideas, please consider donating as a patron, making a \n\u003cem\u003erecurring\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0payment of any amount each month to keep me going with my projects. (Think of it this way: Would you buy me a coffee? Donate $2 per month. Would you buy me a cheap shot of well? Donate $4 per month.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe fact of the matter is that writing is a rocky road. The \"arts\" are often floundering. Most publications don\u0027t pay. Book advances are small and disappear fast. Royalty checks are tiny. A writer can\u0027t count on anything stable from month to month. With your help, I can change that uncertainty for myself. And in exchange, you\u0027ll get exclusive posts, sneak peeks, beta reads, unpublished work, historical research, and more that only patrons have private access to. This is a way for me to reach my biggest \"fans\" or audience most intimately, and directly, to share with you my new creations and ideas instantly and personally. It\u0027s a way for us to be a community, to engage with one another throughout my process. I love you and appreciate you and want to be close to you: this platform helps us stay connected and engaged, and it lets me reach you on a personal level, and THAT IS AWESOME.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd as much as I hope for financial freedom to be able to create unique work for the rest of my life, I also kinda sorta hope there\u0027s pounds of candy in it somewhere, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\nPatreon is a good, reputable service for ongoing support of creative projects and artists. You pledge an amount, and it is automatically deducted from your card at the beginning of every month. You can cancel or resume at any time, or change your reward tier for the future when you win the lottery. (Pssst! There are reward tiers on the right that come with some awesome stuff!) Patreon takes a small bit for processing, but still, every dollar helps, and it all adds up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n------------------------------------------\n\u003ch3\u003eLeah Angstman\u003c/h3\u003e\nis a historian and transplanted Midwesterner, unsure of what feels like home anymore.
