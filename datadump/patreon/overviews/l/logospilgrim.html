I write about the funky adventure that is my life, the silly shit I love, the stuff I\u0027m working on, my penchant for solitude, and various eclectic matters of vital interest to odd quiet people. I celebrate uncommon living and fierce self-determination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a coconut atheist and a gonzo maverick. I\u0027m\n genderqueer, asexual, bi-romantic. My favorite topics include joyful secular living and being a happy introvert tomboy. I also write wild, unusual fiction. I\u0027ve published \u003cem\u003eThere\u0027s a Hula Girl on my Dashboard: How I Left Faith Behind and Embraced Life\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRascal: A Manifesto\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eOutlaw in the Land of Perfection\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027m currently at work on a short novella series featuring Mozart and Salieri, a non-fiction book about the joys of solitude, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a degree in Religious Studies and a large toy collection. I love the 70s, making macram\u00e9, and drinking Jack Daniel\u2019s. I\u0027m also known as the quiet professor.\u003cbr\u003e"
