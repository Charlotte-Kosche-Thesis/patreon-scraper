My name is Louisa Coller, I am also known as Lou Lou on YouTube, Loulabelle for my art and some may know me as some other prior online personas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI create videos for entertainment, fun as well as in general to express myself as an individual, I do also, stream my artwork. I love drawing and I strongly admire and believe in the supporting of creative individuals within art, film, game development and so fourth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am quite a logical individual and though I may be human, I do also offer personal health support regarding those who simply need someone to talk to and being there for others is something I strongly believe in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eWhat do I get by donating to you?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eNot only are you helping me as an artist, you do help me in the regards of funds for everyday life, helping my parents and overall family out, funding for education purposes as well as personal use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will admit due to being a lover of art myself a lot of personal related funds do got to either helping other fellow artists through commissioning work. I do love commissioning artwork as much as making it and I can definitely assure you that some of the donation fund will go to helping sponsor other artists as well as myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, you do get sponsored at the end of all my videos, work in progress sketches of my current pieces as well as a patron-exclusive chat and role in my discord group.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are not obligated\u00a0to stay. If you can no longer donate as a Patron and simply can not afford to continue as a Patron, I understand completely and will not treat you any different. I can understand how tight funds can get for people and I want to let you know that even ex-patrons will be given a high amount of respect when leaving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Artist \u0027Dream\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy dream as an artist to at least sell my artwork somewhere at somepoint of my life. I love my art, and making art and sharing the fondness of making art with others. Something I dream about doing is going to conventions to express not only a love for those who simply attend, but to show off what I can do as an artist, support my fellow artists as well as aim to show people I am passionate about what I do and how it is okay to say you are passionate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strongly believe in encouraging younger artists and helping them follow their dreams. So I also, will gladly use this as an opportunity to express to younger people or people starting in art at any age that it is never too late to dive into art.\u003cbr\u003e"
