    "summary": "My favorite thing about youtube is having the ability to bring free painting and drawing tips and tutorials to my fellow artists. I love hearing how I\u0027ve inspired you to pick up that paint brush or try a new medium. It is so encouraging for me to hear these messages from you!  So much so that I\u0027m putting out 4 new videos a week. That averages between 60 and 80 hours a week. Yeah, I don\u0027t sleep. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put together a patreon account to help make even better youtube videos. And there are rewards!!! I\u0027ve got a few different options available for those interested in supporting the continued growth of my videos including hour long versions of my usual 5 minute weekly videos, group art challenges and some other stuff.  You can check out the details on that below.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is \u00a0a way that I will be able to offer some of the extras that some people have been asking for, while working towards upgrading my current videos and supporting myself as an artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to really thank every single one of you who watches my videos. I can\u0027t even begin to tell you how much that means to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
