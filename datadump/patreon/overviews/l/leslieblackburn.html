My name is \u003cstrong\u003eLeslie Blackburn\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you know me already - click the button (the big orange one: \"Become a Patron\") and let\u2019s ROLL!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMy first book is coming!! \u003c/strong\u003eBecome a\u003cstrong\u003e Patron to support me in this process and you will get amazing rewards, PLUS ongoing sneak peeks into the book process!\u003c/strong\u003e  Then co-create with me in our community page, comment with your thoughts, love, suggestions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s DO this!! :-)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you are like, \u201cwhoa wait, I need JUST a bit more information before I make this leap\u201d, then \u003cstrong\u003eread on!\u2026.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am a \u003cstrong\u003eSacred Sexual Healer \u0026amp; Transformational Guide.\u003c/strong\u003e  But I sure didn\u0027t start that way.  My corporate-hetero-normative life I had been living for decades blasted open 17 years ago when Something Happened.  I woke up. It wasn\u0027t easy, I found myself kicking and screaming as the guidance I was just beginning to notice - aka My Body - was screaming at me that things had to change.  I resisted, I cried, I screamed, I argued with myself.  SURELY I can just keep my eyes closed and stay in the misery of my comfort zone and everything will be ok right?!\u00a0 Wrong. Oh dammit. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs I begin to shift, to feel, to listen - things changed.  My body began changing in response to my listening and soon I was freakin\u0027 blown away at what started to happen.  Beginning with my G-Spot awakening 14 years ago (and it doesn\u2019t stop there!!), my yoni and my body began to feel pleasure like nothing I had ever experienced before.  I wanted to stand on the mountain and shout to the world that \u003cstrong\u003e\"EVERYONE DESERVES TO KNOW ABOUT THIS!!\"\u003c/strong\u003e  and indeed, Spirit made it clear to me that I needed to bring that voice into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNow here we are, having gestated and given birth to my authentic work in the world: powerful \u003cstrong\u003eSacred Sexuality teachings\u003c/strong\u003e that have now spanned over a decade.  I have now worked with thousands of people in workshops, classes and private sessions to support them into their own journey of connecting with their Sacred Sexuality, and for the past six years shared my deepest medicine annually in my Sacred Sexuality Shamanic Apprenticeship. I have also offered years of monthly Radio shows, VideoCasts, newsletters, a CD, articles, blog entries, social media posts, visual art and performance art at very little to no pay.\u00a0 This is big stuff, and I am so deeply honored and grateful for all of you that have been a part of this journey and made it possible!  \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are at a pivotal time.  \u003cstrong\u003eMy first book is coming!!\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe book I have been writing for the past eight years is nearing readiness.  Spirit got clear with me in the process - I cannot only write this from my intellectual \u201cbrainy\u201d-ness like I wrote my Master\u2019s thesis back in engineering grad school.  Oh no, it can\u0027t be THAT easy (ha!)  I must also write from my body, from my womb.  Slowing down, dipping into the deep awareness of self, opening to be the channel - being the vessel. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt also got clear that I can\u0027t just write all the ecstatic, blissful sacred sexuality teachings that have emerged and be like \"here ya go world, look at all this awesome stuff I learned, trust me\"  Oh no no....  I MUST also share the story, my story, the journey through the shadow, facing the fears, meeting the snot, tears and roars.  I must also share the unwinding of the deep spaces of my body that have held trauma and stories from my past.  In fact this very unwinding is what creates the space for the ecstasy, the bliss, the pleasure.  \u003cstrong\u003eTHIS is the root of the transformational keys that I offer to you to unlock that ecstasy for yourself.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSO this brings us to now.  I am so excited to be birthing this book.  I would so love your support!!\u00a0 It takes time and energy and resources to pour my heart, soul and womb space into this creation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027ve learned about myself and my process in all this is that I share deep powerful stuff \u003cem\u003ewhen I know you are willing to meet me in i\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003et!\u003c/em\u003e  So here you are. \u003cstrong\u003eMeet me in this and I will offer you the juicy stuff.\u003c/strong\u003e  Here in my Patron only feed is where I can geek out and share the deep terrain, beyond what I can offer out in the wider public on my Radio shows, VideoCasts and social media posts.\u00a0 This is excites me as a way to engage with you to new levels! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in, \u003cstrong\u003emy Biggest Fans!
