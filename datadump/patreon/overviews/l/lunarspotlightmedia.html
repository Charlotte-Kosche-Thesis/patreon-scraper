    "summary": "We are LunarSpotlight Media.  We create interactive radio broadcasts, websites, and media solutions to share with the world.  This has been something we\u0027ve done as a hobby since 2012, and with your help, we\u0027re turning it into our main focus.  It\u0027s what we love doing, and the dream is to make it our job to deliver something great to listeners and users worldwide.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat we Make\u003c/h4\u003e\nWe\u0027re best known for our work on an internet radio station called Gensokyo Radio.  The station focuses on playing a niche selection of video game music with its origins in Japan.  Since its beginning, we\u0027ve grown the station and built up a community around the music with listeners from over 140 countries.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore recently, we\u0027ve been building an interactive website which will enable users to collaborate and tell stories in a visual novel format.  If you\u0027re unfamiliar, think of how a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d story is formatted, and that\u0027s pretty similar to what we\u0027re building, but using a digital medium.  Visual novel stories have grown in popularity in the west over the past decade, and there are various ways to build a story, but none allow a storyteller to do so in a browser-based or cloud-based manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://lunarspotlight.com/files/lsm_group.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWho we Are\u003c/h4\u003e\nLunar has experience working on many smaller web-based projects since 2010.  He also has professional experience in aspects of business management, and has worked with enterprise-level development teams as a software tester.  As part of Gensokyo Radio, he\u0027s also taken the role of Audio Engineer during more than 50 live broadcasts since 2012.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNano has assisted throughout the years with building and maintaining some of the group\u0027s projects.  He has experience doing database maintenance as an intern and has done web development work for a small business.  Presently, he works as a Technical Duty Officer for an instant management vendor.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDMJ has been one of the larger personalities during live broadcasts on Gensokyo Radio and has experience independently running his own live broadcasts as well.  He enjoys writing reviews for the station as well as working on his own stories.  Presently, he works at a vehicle manufacturing plant.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Limitation of Time\u003c/h4\u003e\nAs with a great many things, one of our biggest challenges in continuing to do these things is managing time.  Over the years we\u0027ve run things like Gensokyo Radio, there have been many feature requests and other things that have come in from listeners that we think are really cool, but we end up having to prioritize what we need to do to maintain things over what listeners want.  That happens not because we don\u0027t want to do what our listeners want, but because we just don\u0027t have enough time to do those things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOur Plan\u003c/h4\u003e\nLunar is spearheading the effort as the first full-time member of LSM.  He is 100% focused on working on LSM\u0027s projects with the goal of enabling others to join the effort full-time as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo do this, we depend on supporters in this campaign (at least to start) along with other income sources resulting from the projects we develop, publish, and maintain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWe want to turn the work we live on, into the work we live for.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease consider becoming part of our campaign to gain early access to our weekly update videos and learn what we\u0027re up to week-by-week.  You can learn about our offerings at various levels of support on the sidebar of our campaign page, starting at just $1/mo.  Take a look at our milestones as well, where we\u0027ll be doing some cool extra stuff in addition to our regular content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eThank you for your consideration!\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- The LunarSpotlight Media Team"
