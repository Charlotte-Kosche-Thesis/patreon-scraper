By showing an interest in this information, you have taken one of\nthe first steps toward becoming one of my Patrons, and ultimately offering your\nsupport toward my goal of becoming a full-time minister and sharer of the Gospel! For the next few years I will be working toward this goal by attending Hillsong\nInternational Leadership College in Sydney, Australia, participating in the Worship Music Stream.\nThis stream focuses on developing music skills as well as building a theological understanding\nof what it means to be a Christ-centered worship leader and Minister. Hillsong Leadership College also\noffers me the opportunities that are necessary for my development as a leader, music director, song writer, musician, and creative producer. \u00a0Upon the completion of the three-year\nWorship Stream program, I will receive an Advanced Diploma in Ministry. Through my\neducation, I will be fully equipped to be a strong witness ecclesiastically as well as in the music\nindustry for Jesus Christ, and will stand ready to effectively make an impact through my gifts as\na leader and a musician in the future opportunities that open to me in ministry!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, if you feel led to support my goal, this website gives you the freedom to make a\npledge to me as little as $1.00 per week ($4.00/month). The money that you pledge will go\ndirectly toward my living expenses and annual school fees. Hillsong Leadership College offers\nno payment plan or financing of any kind. Throughout my enrollment in HILC it will be up to me\nto meet all of my bills: weekly housing costs, rent, food, health care, educational materials, tuition, etc.\n(Hillsong College recommends approximately $400/week). This will\nbe added to the monies I plan to make as a percussion instructor to other students and local\nemployment. \u00a0Any pledge amount is appreciated! \u00a0Your generosity will take a great weight off of my day-to-day endeavors and allow me the\nfreedom to focus on my training to become the minister today!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am thankful you have taken time to read about my future goals and my educational plan. \u00a0God\nhas truly blessed me through His perfect timing and His constant pouring out of grace and\nsupport. \u00a0I appreciate your prayers, your encouragement and your support - it means a lot to\nme and to my current ministry and training! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
