    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Laurie Tarkan and I\u2019m a widely published health journalist who writes\nfor the New York Times and many national magazines. I\u2019m also the author of\nthree books and have won a handful of health journalism awards. I want to focus\nmy reporting and writing skills on a single issue that is\nunder reported and certainly underfunded in the field of research--migraines. But there\u0027s another more personal reason I want to focus on migraines. My 16-year-old\ndaughter has been suffering them since fifth grade, so I know the struggle. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u2019m excited that I found Patreon, as it has been a challenge\nto produce high-level thoroughly reported pieces, while maintaining\nthe income I had even 10 years ago. As magazines have folded one by one, and\nweb journalism has filled their place, us journalists have seen our fees drop\nand drop some more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMigraines Need More Respect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBut back to migraines, it\u2019s actually a pretty exciting time,\nwhen finally there are some new drugs and techniques in the pipeline. People\nare starting to care about this once hidden disease. But migraines sufferers still don\u2019t get respect. Some of my own daughter\u2019s\nteachers treat her migraines like just a headache, and don\u2019t get why she can\u2019t\ndo the homework anyway (she\u2019ll share her stories here as well).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Articles and Your Stories\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePart of what I love about being a journalist is getting to\nhear and share people\u2019s stories. Stories can heal, connect and\ninspire in remarkable ways.\u00a0I want to hear your stories, I want to provide you with information\nthat can help you and bring you the voices of the leading experts in the\nfield (I can easily access them). I will talk about medications,\nsupplements, Botox and get into the nitty gritty of what causes migraines. I\nknow you know your triggers (duh); so I won\u2019t write some of the obvious and\nreadily available content you can find on any health site. \u003cbr\u003e"
