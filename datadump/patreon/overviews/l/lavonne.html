    "summary": "When I was eleven, it occurred to me to turn the tables on my mother and ask her what \u003cem\u003eshe\u003c/em\u003e wanted me to be when I grew up (another way of saying, \"But enough about me, what do YOU think of me?\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh,\" she sighed, wistful, \"I would love it if you became a writer.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApparently, she liked the stories I tried, without success, to sell to my sixth-grade classmates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"A WRITER?!\" was my horrified response. \"Do you know how much WORK that is?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the curse of the perfectionist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMom never brought it up again but the seed was planted. I knew from that moment that I was meant to be a writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn high-school, I wrote sci-fi stories, magazine articles (even sent one to \u003cem\u003eSeventeen\u003c/em\u003e called, \"How to Be a Failure at 17\" -- of course it was rejected) and a \u003cem\u003eTwilight Zone \u003c/em\u003eepisode\u00a0sent to Rod Serling (who wrote a personal letter, very gently letting me down.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen life got in the way, as it does. Work, marriage, baby, family tragedy, working on a presidential campaign, divorce, being a hippie, Hollywood, green card marriage, divorce, radio career, marriage again, another baby, another divorce, chronic illness, blogging, living/traveling in a van, supporting water protectors at Standing Rock -- you know, the usual. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStuff happened. I didn\u0027t write as much as I wanted, but I lived. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now I have stories to tell. Lots of them. Some will make you laugh, some might make you cry, and some will make you say, \"Good Lord, what was she THINKING?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 70 years old and in pretty good health. Do I have enough time left to write all my stories down? I\u0027d better hurry but I\u0027ve already written a few. My childhood memoir,\u003cem\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://completeflake.com/books\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Red Feather Christmas Tree\u003c/a\u003e --\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ebeautifully illustrated by Larah, McKenna, and Genevieve Ritchie -- is just the beginning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo first drafts of other memoirs are on my hard drive (\u003cem\u003eGreen Card, \u003c/em\u003ea fictionalized account of my marriage to a gorgeous Greek, and \u003cem\u003eDotty\u0027s Diner, \u003c/em\u003ethe story of growing up in my mother\u0027s cafe), waiting to be revised and readied for publication.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I plan a book of my adventures since I moved into a van and hit the road three years ago. (All of the above, to be self-published -- thank God and Jeff Bezos.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get on the stick, I might even be able to finish and get them all out by next Christmas. The commitment I am making here on Patreon to fulfill the rewards you see on the right will keep me on track toward that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease\u00a0support me in fulfilling my life purpose. You\u0027re gonna love my stories.\u003cbr\u003e"
