Ten years have gone by and it\u0027s happened so fast. I\u0027ve been through two labels, three booking agents, and four publishers. I played a peanut festival in Alabama once. I played Warped Tour twice. I\u0027ve been a support act and backup singer for the late great Lou Reed. I held a koala on tour in Australia. I rolled a van on tour in Wyoming. I helped rescue a puppy on tour in Arizona.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you have been watching from the beginning, and some of you are brand new. My name is A.W. Weiss. I live in Los Angeles on a small mountain. I\u0027m a songwriter\u00a0and a storyteller. I\u0027ve spent my young adult life spilling my guts on stages and social media because I love how it feels to share experiences.\u003cstrong\u003e Thank you for letting me share my\u00a0experiences with you. \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ex A.W.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u25b3\u25bd\u25bd\u25b3\u25bd\u25bd\u25b3\u25bd\u25bd\u25b3\u25bd\u25bd\u25b3\u25bd\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eSOME F.A.Q.s\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is this beautiful place!?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWelcome to Patreon!!!\u00a0Patreon is the future. As a recording artist without a record label, the biggest hurdle I have to face is lack of funding for my art.

If I haven\u0027t come to your city yet, it\u0027s probably because I can\u0027t afford it! Which is why this Patreon is so awesome. The more people who pledge, the more funding I\u0027ll have for touring! You can also message me about hosting a living room show. If you have enough friends interested in attending, we may be able to make it happen! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen are you gonna put out new music? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019ve got half an albums worth of songs I\u2019d love to put out ASAP, but I need the funding to rent studio space, pay musicians, and take the time off my day job to record the songs. Subscribe to A.W. and you can ensure I put out new tunes on the regular!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e When will I get my rewards?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJournals are posted in the first week of the month, and also any other random time I feel like it! Live streams happen every 1st of the month at 10:00AM PST. You\u0027ll find a link to the stream on my Patreon posts page. Merch of the Month is shipped out the first week of the month, as soon as your payment has been processed. Covers Club members should keep an eye on their inboxes, as I\u0027ll be writing to you at the beginning of the month to discuss what cover I\u0027ll be doing for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI can only donate $1 a month, is it even worth it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely!! According to Spotify, around 30,000 people stream my music for free monthly. Can you imagine how much art I could make if even 10% of those people contributed $1 a month?!! So yes, $1 is amazing. Thank you so much for spending it on me!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatreon is cool but it\u0027s not for me.
