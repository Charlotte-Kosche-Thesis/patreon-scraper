I have invested in state of the art computers \u0026amp; software licenses to create my video productions. I edit, write, produce, and direct all of the content on the channel. \u00a0Creating content is what I love, and by supporting my work, you will make it much easier for me to continue making videos full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Now many big companies have pulled their advertising dollars away from youtube making it even harder for creators like me to spend their days creating quality content. On top of all that people are stealing my videos by uploading them to youtube, facebook, and other websites instead of sharing my original YouTube url, it siphons views away from my channel. My YouTube revenue is just not that much these days for many growing reasons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I put a lot of hours an days into producing each video. I\u0027m always trying to keep the quality high. Despite having more subscribers and views, since YouTube is being flooded with content \u0026amp; spam channels non stop and the advertising revenue accompanied by many viewers now using adblock. It\u0027s hard for me to reinvest in the ch. My channel will always be free of course. Generous help from loyal viewers is always appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery contribution helps me no matter how big or small. I need your help to keep going and growing, so I can continue to bring you the quality videos you love to watch!!  I really appreciate your help and thanks for having my back guys!"
