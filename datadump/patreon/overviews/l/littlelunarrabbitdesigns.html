Trained artist by day, exhausted caffeine driven mom by night. If you\u0027ve stopped by here, it\u0027s clearly because you\u0027ve taken an interest in supporting my art, so why don\u0027t we get down to brass tacks, yeah?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved art, since I could pick up a pencil and put it to the paper. I decided to make it my choice of study for school, but when it came down to finding a profession for it, it was a struggle to find something that actually worked for me. As such, I stopped making art to other people\u0027s specifications, and kept making it to my own. I\u0027ve bounced from coffee shop to coffee shop in between school and now, but have finally found myself in a position where I can make art my full time career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where you beautiful humans come in. Some of you have taken interest in my work, and have expressed a love and desire for more. While I do all of my art for myself at the moment, I eventually would love to take on commissions, but I also would like to update a lot of the tools I use before that happens. By supporting me, you\u0027ll be helping me rebuild my studio, to bring you higher quality pieces. And as a thank you, I will absolutely give you insights to my process, let you see sneak peaks, have a say in what gets created, and sneak in some pretty fun other rewards along the way (\u003cem\u003edid someone say prints? Consider supporting me and get some!).\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Art:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m limited to line work that I can color:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1124.photobucket.com/albums/l568/bloop21/usagi_patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd traditional art that I\u0027ve been scanning in:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1124.photobucket.com/albums/l568/bloop21/aries_patreib.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do love both, I would also like to eventually cross into the realm of digital painting, that\u0027s what part of the upgrade in the studio is for - to buy hardware and better programs to be able to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThanks for stopping by!
