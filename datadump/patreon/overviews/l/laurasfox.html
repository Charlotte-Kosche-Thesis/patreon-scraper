    "summary": "Hi there everyone. Thank you for stopping by. I\u0027m Laura S. Fox, an author of gay fiction. That basically says what my main writing obsession is and that is writing about gay relationships that evolve through an interesting story and enrich through character development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories are all rated 18+, so they are NSFW, just to give you a heads-up. They are a combination of plot and smut, as I believe the two work together like a charm. That being said, you won\u0027t find in my stories scenes where the screen fades to black just as things get hotter, and you won\u0027t find endless sex scenes with no plot, either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have already read some of my stories, you\u0027re already familiar with my style. I hope that you also liked it since you are here, checking out my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that brings up the big question: Why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think Patreon is a great opportunity to connect artists with their audience. I find it a good way to run a test for the writing I create. If people are motivated enough to give me at least one dollar, that means that they like what I do. And, of course, the more people are engaged with my writing, the more motivation and time I have to create the stories they like to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, there are three reward tiers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 $\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards:\u003cbr\u003e- Access to patron-only posts, announcements, AMAs, polls, and everything involving the community\u003cbr\u003e- A small gift as \u0027thank you\u0027 for becoming my patron, in the form of a complete book that you can enjoy right away\u003cbr\u003e- I will also post any new chapters of works in progress, as well as standalone works, at the same time I publish them on other websites\u003cbr\u003e- All finished stories will be turned into books, and all my patrons will receive a copy\u003cbr\u003e- You will be mentioned in the dedication at the beginning of each book (only the first name, to protect your identity, of course) - this applies to all patrons who had an active membership at the moment I finish the book)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3 $\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards:\u003cbr\u003e- Early access to any new chapters of works in progress, as well as standalone works, up to two weeks in advance\u003cbr\u003eAll the rewards from the previous tier apply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5 $\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards:\u003cbr\u003e- A personal acknowledgment note at the beginning of each book I finish (it will be delivered via e-mail)\u003cbr\u003eAll the rewards from the previous tier apply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you can expect from me:\u003cbr\u003e- New chapters every month\u003cbr\u003e- Hot extras \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent works in progress:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBox Shaped Heart:\u003cbr\u003eSummary:\u00a0Carter Malis thinks he knows exactly when he turned into a self-identified homophobe, and that had to be the moment when Aron Ruskin, his best friend since forever, announced to him that he was going to marry a dude. Great. So there were going to be two Mr. Ruskin\u2019s, and that without counting Aron\u2019s dad. \u003cbr\u003eAnd here\u2019s this thing. The face staring back from the mirror, the moment he wakes up in a hospital bed, doesn\u2019t belong to him, but to douchebag Alex, aka Aron\u2019s husband. And now he\u2019ll have to talk to Aron, after two years of radio silence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Good Servant:\u003cbr\u003eSummary:\u00a0Cory is a 21-year-old sent to serve in Drena, after three years of grueling training. Although he is meant to remain pure, as Masters only use sex slaves to vent off their lust, his Master, a handsome dangerous man named Xavier, the ruler of the beautiful city, takes him on the first day in the household. From there, Cory gets trapped in a world of lust, treachery, intrigues and political machinations. Without his or anyone\u0027s knowing, evil lurks inside the white city, and little does Cory knows that he will be the center of a revolution that will change everything, not only in Drena, but on the entire continent. Seduction is a powerful tool, but it is love that will make Cory realize, in the end, what matters most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeries I\u0027ve completed with the help of my extraordinary patrons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollateral\u003cbr\u003eSummary: Jake is young, wild, and runs with his brother\u0027s bad-ass gang. But he has a secret he needs to hide. When he is saved from a rival gang by a guy with eyes blue as the summer\u0027s sky, all dressed up in an Armani suit and moves like Bruce Lee, the walls he carefully built around him start to crumble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you find my stories interesting enough to become my patron! That will make me really happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHugs and kisses,\u003cbr\u003eLaura."
