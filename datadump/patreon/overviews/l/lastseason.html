Welcome to my Patreon journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a musician and songwriter originally from Alaska.\u00a0 I have been writing and performing music for over 10 years now, formerly I toured as a keys player and backup vocalist in the hard rock circuit but have been off the road for 3 years.\u00a0 Recently I started writing music again and really wanted to find an alternative to the norm of releasing music.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNO big studios\u003cbr\u003eNO big productions\u003cbr\u003eNO massive funding efforts\u003cbr\u003eJust me and my instruments. Recording at home, doing what I love.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m calling this project Last Season, and over the next year I am going to release 1 song per week, for an entire year.\u00a0 I\u0027m calling the process A Year Of Music.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, and patrons like you are what make it possible for artists to thrive and grow while actually getting paid to do what they love.\u00a0 This is a much needed missing piece in an industry that exploits artists without giving them a piece of the pie.\u00a0 I want to thank each and every person who is stopping by this page because YOU are the difference.\u00a0 YOU are the reason that artists like me can still thrive and get paid for making music, art, and creating.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also raising money for an organization that I really believe in called, Hungryformusic.org. These guys donate instruments to children in hardship around the world.  25% of all the funds raised on this page, and through this Year Of Music, will be donated to Hungryformusic.org, and I\u0027m so excited to see how much we\u0027ll be able to raise this year!\u00a0 Your contributions are going to allow me to continue writing music, and produce a higher quality better product, but most importantly your contributions are going to make a difference in the lives of children around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are all going to be released on youtube, and a subscription won\u0027t be necessary to follow this year of music, but I wanted to put up this page as an avenue to give and support the process if you feel so inclined.\u00a0 I encourage you to follow and share the Last Season, and this whole Year Of Music as it unfolds, regardless of whether you feel compelled to give or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do however feel like giving to the cause, I encourage you to look at the list of rewards and see if there is an incentive program that fits you best.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support.\u00a0 It means the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDanny\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
