    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Lane Moore, writer, comedian, producer, director, actor, and musician and no, I do not sleep. Thank you for asking!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI host/produce a monthly Tinder LIVE! with Lane Moore hit comedy show that is the most fun thing in the world, and I\u0027m also touring the world with it hooray. I was previously the sex \u0026amp; relationships editor for Cosmopolitan.com, where I wrote funny and sometimes serious stuff about body positivity, LGBT issues, gender, consent, mental illness, and of course, Tinder, yes. I also won a GLAAD award for helping to make Cosmo super gay. That was rad. My band, It Was Romance, was named BUST Magazine\u0027s Best Band of 2015 and our record was featured and praised by Pitchfork, Village Voice, and BuzzFeed. We just put out our second music video for our song \"Hooking Up With Girls\" that I also directed and co-produced and featured a super diverse crew and was featured in Entertainment Weekly, NYLON, Billboard, The Huffington Post, The Onion\u0027s AV Club, New York Magazine, The New York Observer,\u00a0The Guardian, VICE, BUST Magazine,\u00a0Refinery 29, and numerous others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently writing a book about relationships and being an orphan, and\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on approximately 12,347 top secret projects.\u00a0I design all my own super weird and great stage costumes and my friend Steve makes them a reality. I also work with my friend Neal to create over the top hair and makeup looks for the stage because I think the world should be dreamier in general.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also like 590 other things that I can\u0027t even think of right now because I don\u0027t sleep very much at all. It\u0027s a problem.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, so why should you pledge to me? Well, because I\u0027m hyper creative and the majority of my creations were made when I had very low income and was struggling with chronic illness. Even now, almost all of my current projects have a zero budget and are made by a diverse group of incredible people who are low income, who, like me, are doing it because they love it, whether it makes money or not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make our second album and man, I would make a music video every single week if budget and time allowed. I want to make t-shirts and buttons. All of the things.\u00a0And it\u0027d be nice to be able to afford some more pedals and a full pedal board because they are very expensive in my opinion. I also really want to bring back my Are You Afraid Of The Snark? podcast which is comedians and famous people and former cast members doing riffs over Are You Afraid Of The Dark? episodes and it rules. There are a lot of cool things like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs that enough things? I\u0027m sleepy and now want cake."

     "description": "I\u0027ll let you hear rare or exclusive cuts of songs I\u0027m working on either by myself or with the band way before they hit the internet or make it to any album and you can weigh in on which ones you\u0027d like to hear on the future album, or just get a bonus catalog of songs no one else has. Basically, you get to hear songs as I write them and watch the process of how they become full album songs. If you\u0027re more interested in writings or comedy things, I can also do this with things I\u0027m writing and original pieces/jokes I\u0027m trying out or scripts I\u0027m working on.
