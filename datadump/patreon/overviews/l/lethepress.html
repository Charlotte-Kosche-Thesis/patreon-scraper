Since then we have won numerous awards and acclaim for our books. Many readers feel like outsiders because of their sexual identity--our books are welcome reliefs to this problem; the LGBT+\u00a0 protagonists in our books have adventures, chase danger, fall in love, lead rich lives, and overcome the taint of homophobia. Our speculative fiction is imaginative and strange and wondrous. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQueer books are a labor of love and often lost money (after we pay for the cover art, pay the contributors, purchase review copies, there\u0027s really not much of a profit to be made) but our mission to provide the best books for such an audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat awards have we won:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur books have won the Lambda Literary Award in such categories as Best Fantasy/Science Fiction/Horror (five times!), Best Gay Romance, and Best Gay Erotica. We have also won the Shirley Jackson Award. Our books are regularly finalists for these awards and have been finalists for the Andre Norton Award, the Golden Crown Literary Award, and even the World Fantasy Award.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we have a Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a small press and struggle to make ends meet. Many of our books may receive a starred review in Publishers Weekly or Kirkus but sell less than 100 copies in their first year. We want to continue providing unique books for readers. Your pledge can help us pay the many queer freelancers who we depend on to design the covers and interiors, copy-edit and proof, and narrate and produce our books (and they depend on us to help pay \u003cem\u003etheir \u003c/em\u003ebills).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur goals:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost: to continue publishing quality titles that offer the wealth and breadth of the queer spectrum and delve into the fantastical, the strange, and the eerie. We would like to offer more advances, secure greater publicity, and this Patreon can help all our endeavors while also rewarding our readers with some great swag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The key component for all of these stories is how relatively ordinary characters survive and thrive, given the traumatic experiences they\u001a\u0027ve had. Editors Mary Anne Mohanraj and JJ Pionke have done terrific work choosing over 100k of stories for this book. We offered the minimum fair author fee and still this will be a very costly venture for us. Ideally, we would like to publish the book traditionally, via an offset printer. If we can increase our number of Patreon followers this can be a reality.\u003cbr\u003e",
