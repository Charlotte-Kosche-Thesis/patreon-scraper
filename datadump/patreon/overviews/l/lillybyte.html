I do don\u0027t have a stream schedule, and I could be streaming during the day or during the night-- and sometimes, both.

In that time, Dymoria has grown from nothing but an inspired idea I had long ago to a concept world that you can log into, walk around, interact with the environment a little bit, and chat with people (if someone else is also around).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile most of the work on Dymoria has been server-side and functional in nature, every month or so when the live server is updated with new changes, progress can be seen visually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of Dymoria, I also have some very small tinker projects that, once in a blue moon, I will play with here and there; mostly born from Ludum Dares.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCurrent Projects\u003c/h4\u003eThere are a few projects I am currently working on. Primarily, I work on the large one while taking occasional breaks every now and then to work on smaller ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDymoria:\u003c/strong\u003e This is an online, multiplayer persistent world game I have wanted to make for over 20 years, but I never had the resources, skills, or time to make it happen. It is a survival/sandbox, tile-and-voxel-based MMO with low poly 3D graphics. The game design is centered around, primarily, a single player style experience, but in a large, persistent, and multiplayer world. Players will build homesteads, recruit or enslave NPCs, and then assign tasks to those NPCs such as: perform tasks around their homesteads, attack other players, or defend your homestead from attack. The game is designed for casual play, not for intensive experience grinding via combat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal\u003c/strong\u003e: I want Dymoria to become a free, community/Patreon supported indie game without paid subscriptions, micro-transactions, loot boxes, or other monetization schemes. My goal is to be able to work on Dymoria full time for as long as the community continues to support its development and continuation. Once we have established an inventory system, rewards will be given to Patreon supporters in the form of exclusive cosmetic items, along with rolling credits on the log in screens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlanned Game Features\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLarge, 10,000 x 10,000 tiled world, broken down into \"zones\" that can be \u0027conquered\u0027 and owned by players or groups of players.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3rd person strategy and survival with crafting system.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCasual, turn based combat; based on action points.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCraft and build and establish your own private homestead by yourself and become a nomad; or if you dare: build a village, town, city, or even Kingdom with a group of players.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUp to 1,000 players per shard; with zones and regions being able to be split across multiple shards, allowing the world to be scaled based on world and player growth.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMultiple races; human and furry races.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFocus on game play and mechanics with 100%, fully authoritative server; the client is a dumb terminal that contains no game play mechanics, meaning hacks that hack the client have no effect on the server.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTheme:\u003c/strong\u003e Dymoria takes place in the post-post apocalypse, long after World War 3, and long after the Earth has recovered. Humanity has been pushed to the brink of extinction. Plants have mutated and have become the top of the food chain, spending their energy hunting meat... meat like humanoids, for both food and procreation. In this world, you are not the hero, there are no epic quests, it is your life to survive a world that seeks to eat you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScope:\u003c/strong\u003e Building a MMORPG is no small feat, and this is something I am not ignorant of. The idea is NOT to build a World of Warcraft or Elder Scrolls or Knights of the Old Republic. That would be way beyond me. Instead, I am narrowing down the scope of MMORPG to a survival/crafting game that can be built with the skillset and tools I have at my disposal. First, instead of hundreds of quests which would require a degree of content that would take forever to produce, I am simply giving players a world; and within that world, they become the hero or the villain. You will write your own story- forge your own way- whether that will be a humble hermit who protects what is yours and keeps out of everyone\u0027s business or someone who seeks to rule the entire world, for better or worst. That world will be yours (and others\u0027) to build and destroy, if you can, or if you choose. Secondly, I am going with a tile/voxel based map and tile based movement that negates the need for physics and server\u0026lt;\u0026gt;client prediction and combat will be turn based. Together, this drastically reduces network load/complexity requirements. Finally, the graphics will be low poly 3D, meaning I can quickly produce hundreds of meshes and resources needed to provide an expansive array of resources and recipes for crafting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTry Dymoria\u0027s Testing Grounds!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can try Dymoria\u0027s testing environment here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dymoria.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDymoria Testing Grounds\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.dymoria.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s currently being worked on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eClient [Mar 2018]: Currently porting Dymoria client to the Godot Engine.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s complete?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eServer [Mar 2018]: Two long standing (and highly elusive bugs) that would \u0027lock\u0027 the server on a disconnect have been found... hopefully... dealt with, permanently.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eServer [Feb 2018]: Plant/crop growth; major functionality and prerequisite for crafting functions.

I loved games; and I played hundreds of them. More importantly, how games were made intrigued me;\u00a0how they went from things I typed on the keyboard to moving pixels on the screen, so that\u0027s how I learned my first programming language: BASIC. In my teenage years, I moved to the Tandy 1000 HX and played many more games from the classic giants such as LucasArts, Sierra Online, Microprose, Electronic Arts, Broderbund, Westwood, Black Ilse Studios, and many more... but, as I played games, I also learned how to make them. I picked up Turbo Pascal and C; and I had always thought I would become a game developer, but then life sent me on a 35 year detour.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, never did I lose my love of games or my desire to make them. That 35 year detour, at different points, allowed me to work in graphic design / photo retouching (art experience), multimedia (cinematography/animation/video production), and selling content in virtual worlds (3D modeling, texturing, and sales; working both independently and for commission). So, while I never became the game developer I wanted to be, I did get to work in a number of fields that gave me experience which lends itself well to developing games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, here I am today... coming full circle and, once again, \"chasing the dream\"-- and as per usual-- always the struggling artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eProfessional Background in Online Content\u003c/h4\u003eI made a living for several years creating adult content in the virtual world called Second Life; adult furniture, animations, scripting, plus content work for a number of corporations. I created a very successful Second Life business called the Dictatorshop (which I later gave up to pursue other passions). I also created the LockGuard protocol which now exists as part of millions of adult furniture/attachments within Second Life. I will, heavily, be pulling on the knowledge I learned in Second Life for building the world of Dymoria, for both its content and its back end.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOverarching Goal\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy goal here is just to make games, and maybe people will like the games I make. And if people like the games I make, maybe they\u0027ll support their development, just a little.... or a lot. And if you support their development then I can make more games! It\u0027s the circle of gaming life!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePatreon Support\u003c/h4\u003e\nAny and all Patreon support will be put into developing and expediting whatever games are being made; whether that\u0027s licensing new software, outsourcing to other artists, musicians, or programmers; or whatever else any project may need to succeed along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, if you feel like you would like to join me, or even sponsor me on this journey, please give a show of support, even if it\u0027s in a comment or message! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
