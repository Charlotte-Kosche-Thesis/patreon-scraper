You might be wondering.... What IS Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a wonderful platform through which friends and fans of artist can connect directly to the creators they love and support, essentially subscribe to their work, and receive special rewards and creative gifts in exchange!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes, But Why...?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0As I\u0027ve distilled it down internally, art takes \u003cem\u003etime.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eTime\u003c/em\u003e is hard to come by amidst a storm of full-time employment in the pursuit of \u003cem\u003emoney. \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0So, Patrons support granting artists more \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e in their schedules and therefore more \u003cem\u003efreedom\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to create better art, which the patrons in turn, hopefully enjoy more. \u00a0I\u0027ve been supporting myself and my art through a patchwork quilt of employment over the past year, and I can conclusively say that when money is less of a stressor, the art is \u003cem\u003eincomparably \u003c/em\u003ebetter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough contributing to my page, you are \u003cstrong\u003eenabling\u003c/strong\u003e me to grow into my full potential as an artist, purchase necessary equipment for recording, create some geographic flexibility to go to gigs and pursue projects, and again, fill my belly.

In the moment of history in which we find ourselves, I believe that Music is a tremendous tool for healing, growth, and reflection.
