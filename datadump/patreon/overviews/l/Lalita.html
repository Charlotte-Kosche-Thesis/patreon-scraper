When I\u0027m pulled away from it for a while, I crave getting back to it. My goal is to prepare a few select pieces for inclusion on my new website. I desire\u00a0to use the proceeds from ART\u00a0sales to fund my primary philanthropic goal to help women and children in transition. My monthly goal is $500.00",
