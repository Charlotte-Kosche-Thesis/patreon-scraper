    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLady Cactus is a small publishing collective based in Denver, Colorado. We work with several local artists, put on songwriter showcases \u0026amp; other shows, and produce the Overlook Sessions. We started this page as a way to support the Overlook Sessions financially while involving fans of the musicians who are playing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what are the Overlook Sessions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Overlook Sessions started with a big breakfast and our patio. We invited bands to come play a couple songs, choose their favorite, and get a video out of it! And then we made pancakes and mimosas like a big ol\u0027 family. Since then, we have decided to start taking bands on hikes with us and recording an acoustic video. Each band records an original song and a cover, and then they\u0027re ONLY available on Patreon for two weeks before their official release!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is my money going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe money goes toward investing in making the sessions even better, and will help pay for more tiny/acoustic instruments for artists to use, better recording equipment, and (most importantly) breakfast supplies. It also goes toward our other booking projects (songwriter showcases, rooftop concerts, etc.) and will help us grow in that regard. Once we hit a certain threshold (read: start to break even), we will pay artists to perform in showcases + video shoots.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is playing in these videos?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are choosing some of our favorite bands from the Denver music scene to play in these videos, and we\u0027re so excited about the lineup we have ready for this season. We\u0027re doing our best to maintain a diverse group of bands, but we always appreciate suggestions and recommendations!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often are you going to release these videos?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs often as we\u0027re able to get them edited, and you\u0027re only charged once a month! That means that if you pledge $1 per project, you\u0027re only going to pay $12 per year. We think that\u0027s pretty reasonable. ;) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe promise to release at least one video a month, and will do our best to release more. We don\u0027t get paid to do any of this - in fact, we\u0027ve invested quite a bit of our own money in this project - and that means sometimes we have to prioritize our other jobs, health, etc. We appreciate your support in this adventure, and are happy to spend time with people we love, doing things we love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShow me a video?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere\u0027s one of our recent Overlook Sessions:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p24k01O4QR8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
