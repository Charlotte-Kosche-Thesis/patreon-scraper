I have had an amazingly heartbreaking life full of trauma, therapy, dancing, taking shots, meeting bands and trying to navigate this thing called motherhood which included burying my oldest son who died by suicide on March 8th, 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am married to the love of my life who I met when I was four and helped traumatize me (long story), broke my heart when I was 14 and then began the long road of making it all up to me a decade ago. He has been everything I ever needed in a hero, especially on the day that we found Anthony dead in our garage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLosing Anthony has changed me in ways that I never thought possible. I am totally broken yet joyful and full of hope for what God can do with this pain. I never would have made it through this loss if I weren\u0027t Catholic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting me in my writing. It is what I love to do the most in life. Writing is where I meet God and where He teaches me about love, mercy and justice. I am currently working on my first memoir and already outlining my next book on grief.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy son has two beautiful children who are the light of my life. I love spending time with them, even when they wear me out to the max, and hearing their giggles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy family is the most important thing to me and I hope that one day each of my seven children will find a way to forgive me for all the ways that I failed them both intentionally and unintentionally.\u00a0"
