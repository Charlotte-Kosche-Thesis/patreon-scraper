Though these subjects are metaphysical, my readings are reality-based, relying on observation, conversation, and storytelling - no psychic powers required! I also have training in psychotherapy-informed group leadership, experiential and adventure education, and have had a lot of study and exposure to different modes of pyschotherapy, especially Gestalt. While I believe tarot is valuable as a \u0027folk therapy\u0027, I am absolutely not a therapist or other kind of medical or legal expert. Rather, I bring a diverse range of knowledge and experience to the tarot table. \u003cem\u003eRead more about my services and approach to tarot\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lioneltarot.com/readings/\"\u003eon my blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e Think of pledging to my Patreon as joining a Tarot club, where you receive a reading for every $78 you give along with some other small thank-you perks. This tracks roughly with my regular reading rates which are $75 per hour plus tips, and your monthly commitment to my tarot work gives me the enormous gift of inspiration and time to work on my other tarot projects, driven by a community of interest in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo learn more about me, my services, and my thoughts on tarot please watche the video below and explore\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://https://lioneltarot.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elioneltarot.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-S5nTdPFZ8?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWant more in depth info? Read on!\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMy Goals and Vision\u003c/h4\u003eI\u0027ve chosen to base my Patreon goals on people rather than dollars because I want to build \n\u003cstrong\u003ecommunity.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0New decks, books, and blogs proliferate, and some online spaces flourish, but since I began reading I\u0027ve seen so many blogs and forums close up shop, and subsequently lost connection to so many people. The tarot community deserves more: we deserve a \u003cstrong\u003eplatform \u003c/strong\u003eand a \u003cstrong\u003enetwork.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBetween my programming interests and my tarot knowledge, I have long wanted to create-open source apps and websites\u00a0which let people store, compare, and share their readings and spreads with one another. With enough people we can look for trends in the readings we give and receive in relationship to a whole community of tarot hobbyists and professionals. Novel tarot apps can use machine learning to delight and inspire new interest in the tarot. The sky is the limit, and with your help I can get there!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor now, I look forward to reviving the old blog with an updated design and dusting off some of the bit rot that has collected over the years. \n\u003cstrong\u003eEach new patron I get gives me the inspiration and the resources to learn and do more, bit by bit, to make modern, magical ways to use the tarot for fun, meaning, and a better life through reflection and conversation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003ePatron Rewards\u003c/h4\u003e\nRewarding patrons with readings rather than articles or videos lets me focus on my relationships with you as tarot enthusiasts and wisdom seekers instead of fretting over always creating content. Thanks to you I am free to approach my other tarot ideas such as writing articles, creating podcasts and video logs, and coding useful apps for tarot readers with freedom and curiosity rather than obligation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that in mind, I\u0027ve designed rewards to do two things: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGenerate tarot readings. \u003c/strong\u003eI want to offer real value for you in the form of tarot consultations and lessons, so here\u0027s the deal:\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eFor lower donation amounts every $78 dollars you give me earns you a coupon for an hour long tarot session, good forever. Gift them, hoard them, its up to you!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eAt $78 or above, you still get a 60 minute reading per month even if you give more. The exception is at $108, which is essentially enrolling as a student with me with a 90 minute allowance across either one or two sessions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eYou may always pay me the difference between your Patreon contributions to date and your next free reading, lesson, or any of my other tarot services.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eCompare the cost to buying a reading from me and tipping me $3 (minus transaction fees).\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs with all my services, the money you give me on Patreon can go towards readings or lessons on a sliding scale - if you feel compelled to ask for a reading or lesson for barter or a lower price, please get in touch with me, we can work something out!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGive positive rewards without paywalls.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve\u00a0tried to create fun perks that won\u0027t bar non-patrons from content or tools which could build and enrich online tarot community. For instance:\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eOffer ways to recognize supporters with badge instead of preventing non-patrons from commenting on articles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eMake my chat server open to anyone instead of patron-only, and give Patrons special roles and chances to become moderators in recognition of their commitment and support.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eOnly make posts patron-exclusive when they are behind the scenes content or requests for feedback which I wouldn\u0027t normally release to a wider audience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nSome rewards are experiments. For example I don\u0027t know if a tarot Discord server will ever take off, but I hope it may some day, and hope you\u0027ll try things out with me and suggest new ideas. I also hope to try new rewards in the future, like limited collections of my articles as a small book, special beta access to online tarot tools that aren\u0027t ready for prime time, and more.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat your support means to me\u003c/h4\u003e\nFinancial support helps me pay bills and reclaim time to work on my tarot projects. But through Patreon I realize I\u0027m not only asking for your financial support, I\u0027m also asking for your \ntrust that with a community cheering me on, I can make some amazing things to enrich all of us.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI want you to be excited for our readings together proud of what I create when you back me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for being here. If you aren\u0027t a backer yet and want to talk, especially if you\u0027d like a short one-card sample reading, please\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:lioneld+tarot@gmail.com\"\u003eemail me\u003c/a\u003e. Be well, and may you have a wonderful day!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
