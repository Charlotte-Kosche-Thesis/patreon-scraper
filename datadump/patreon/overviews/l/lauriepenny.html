I report and write features about politics, social justice, culture and mental health. I\u0027m a contributing editor at New Statesman, and I\u2019ve written six books, and am working on the next one right now. I\u2019m travelling the United States trying to get under the skin of the political nightmare we\u2019re all living in. And I\u2019m asking for your help. Think of this as my tips jar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a scary time for the world, and a scary time for media and the arts. Journalism is an industry in trouble-  at precisely the moment it most needs to be well-resourced, independent and not bound to clickbait, editors and reporters are having to make dreadful decisions about how to keep their business model going. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m going on a journey into a type of writing I haven\u0027t yet found a home for. The type of journalism I want to do is predictive, rather than reactive. I\u0027m as tired of hot takes as you are. What\u0027s needed in these livid times is less heat and more light. I\u0027m looking for the freedom to travel to interesting places and write about what happens there without waiting for a commission. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m lucky enough to have a loyal community of readers who follow my work as well as holding me to account when I need it. I\u0027m asking for your support, if you can afford it, because I want to be more directly answerable to my readers, not to advertisers. I\u0027d like your support to make more ambitious work, starting with the book I\u2019m currently working on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s hard to get taken seriously as a young woman working in media. It\u0027s even harder to get taken seriously as a woman who\u0027s no longer a messy 23-year old and wants to do considered, grown-up journalism. If you take my writing seriously and have the means, consider chipping in. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou could also chip in if you don\u2019t care about my work either way but REALLY want to piss off some right-wing trolls. Every dollar you donate makes an alt-right hatebot cross. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf a few hundred people give me five dollars a month, I can start to build a team around me and do more writing and less organizing. And that would be massive.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to engage with readers, which is why I continue to be active on social media despite an eye-watering amount of harassment. I\u0027m excited to see how being funded directly by readers and building a community of people who follow my work more intimately will work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, there are a great many projects and causes that need support right now- so if you only have two dollars to spend on social justice, don\u0027t spend it on me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe deeply in creating art and journalism that everyone can access, whatever their income level, and I know lots of you do, too. That\u0027s one of the reasons why I\u0027m going to keep on publishing my work openly, here and on on other platforms. However, if you become a patron, you\u0027ll get access to my road diary, journal entries, roundups, and longer versions of some pieces- and you\u0027ll also become part of a community of subscribers. You can send me tips and hints, whether that\u2019s books to read or things going on in your area.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe donations level is set low because I don\u0027t want to be elitist about who can be involved in this community- if all you can afford is a couple of dollars a month, but you still want to be on board and support, that\u0027s huge, and that\u0027s plenty. If you can afford more, that would be fantastic- the more I can be directly funded by readers, the more exciting things I can do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe this is a time for ambitious, innovative journalism, and I think I\u0027m in a place to contribute that- but I know I can\u0027t do it without help. Thank you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"

I won\u0027t have to juggle two or three writing jobs to keep the lights on while making the work I really care about. That means I can do a lot more writing on here, a lot more research- just a lot more, and more thoroughly. There are a lot of possibilities and if we make it this far I\u0027ll be canvassing all of you for ideas!\u003cbr\u003e",
