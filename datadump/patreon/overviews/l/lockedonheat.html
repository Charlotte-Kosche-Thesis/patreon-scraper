We are Wes Goldberg and David Ramil, and are credentialed NBA writers who grew up in Florida watching the Heat. We started a podcast called the Heat Check back in 2016 for the love of the game. The podcast was later picked up by the Locked On Podcast Network and rebranded as Locked On Heat. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe publish podcasts five days a week, ranging from in-depth recaps of the games, interviews with NBA players and media professionals, weekly listener mailbags and the most thorough breakdowns of the Heat\u2019s season available. We do our best to engage with our listeners through mailbags and Twitter (@LockedOnHeat) threads for our recaps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe joined the Locked On Podcast Network to make money doing the show. It\u2019s a simple equation: The more money we make on the show, the more time we can spend doing it, which means we can continue to make more compelling content for you. As much as we\u2019d love to make all of our money from our fantastic advertising partners, podcasting is still a relatively new medium, and that isn\u2019t yet feasible. That\u2019s why we created this Patreon page, in the hopes that we can build on some subscription content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may enjoy the free content and help us by donating $1 per month to support the show. For those of you who want more, a donation of $5 per month will get you exclusive content created for Locked On Heat Lifers. That will include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSalary cap and depth chart projections \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree agency player rankings during the off-season\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNBA player rankings by position\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRunning list of our favorite hypothetical trade scenarios\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAbility to submit to our monthly Patreon-only mailbag\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhatever else we come up with, such as publishing our game notes, lists or rankings we talk about on the show, and our NBA and Heat-related awards ballots.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eUnder construction:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLive recaps, at least one per month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo breakdowns, at least one per month or when appropriate (These ideas are being workshopped.

While we will continue to rely on advertising, we hope to build the backbone of our business through a great listener community. Together, we will continue to reap the benefits.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, and we look forward to serving you the best Heat content around for years to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWes and David\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
