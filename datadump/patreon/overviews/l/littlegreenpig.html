We\u2019ve created a ton of new work in our existence. \u003cstrong\u003eWe want to make more, pay our artists, and ensure that it is accessible to everyone regardless of financial circumstances for our 2018-2019 season: \"THE ZERO DOLLAR TICKET\".\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe PATREON model uniquely grants us financial predictability,\u00a0relieves donor fatigue, AND we directly exchange original art and tickets to shows for patronage, as if patrons were buying a CSA share of art. \u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re one of a few theatre companies in the world to do so\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE NITTY-GRITTY WISH-LIST\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e(1) achieve a level of monthly, financial predictability;\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e(2) continue to\u00a0pay our artists, designers, \u0026amp; crew for mainstage shows;\u003cbr\u003e(3)\u00a0a \"\u003cstrong\u003eZERO DOLLAR TICKET\u003c/strong\u003e\"\u003cstrong\u003e- \u003c/strong\u003eall tickets to LGP mainstage shows would be $0. \u003cstrong\u003eAnyone could see a show\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eregardless of their economic circumstances AND\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eall artists, designers, and crew still get compensated for their work\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"THE ZERO DOLLAR TICKET\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs not a free ticket.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSomeone pays for the art because the work is valued and requires a large expenditure of time and energy.

That\u0027s the wage we\u0027re aiming to pay our artists. Though of course, for theatre, it\u0027s very difficult to quantify all off-site hours (writing, line-memorizing) as well as on-site hours; so we define the wage by the amount of time spent in rehearsal and performance. We can\u0027t be certified by DLW just because our business model is so different from the usual\u2014e.g., every show employs different people for different amounts of time, and no one is on year-round payroll. Nevertheless, we\u0027re inspired and guided by the DLW ethos of paying a living wage to the people who make Durham what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I just want to support you and don\u2019t want anything in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all: Thank you.
