    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Janet. You can look at years of my work on my website at\u00a0\u003ca\u003ebruesselbach.com\u003c/a\u003e and more recent output at\u00a0\u003ca\u003ebruesselbach.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been painting since I was 12, and I\u0027m particularly good at humans, but use space and humanlike machines and systems as well. My signature seems to be a combination of representational figuration and figure-like horror-vacui abstraction inspired by science fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople seem to like my work, and if you are one of those people, this Patreon is a way to fund me making it, because supplies and resources I need to spend time making art cost money. You get a representation or part of each thing I make. Usually Patreon works monthly, but I feel like it makes more sense, for how I want to work and for your investment, that you\u0027re paying for part of a painting, with the value or amount of reward determined by the amount you pledge, and the size and effort of the artwork being determined by the total pledges. That said, I tend to make what I want, usually bigger than the level we\u0027re at, and share attachments with all patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://bruesselbach.com/img/DoMpatreon.jpg\" width=\"600px\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the past couple of years, I have been focused on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bruesselbach.com/projects/daughtersofmercury\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaughters of Mercury\u003c/a\u003e, a project in which I work with trans women painting portraits that depict each of them in the unique way they want to be seen. It was my way of using what I\u0027m best at to support people I love and admire and counteract the difficulties they face in a cissexist and transmisogynist society. Enough of these to make a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bruesselbach.com/store/book/daughters-of-mercury-2016-calendar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e2016 calendar\u003c/a\u003e were funded by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1720861557/daughters-of-mercury/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKickstarter\u003c/a\u003e, but I painted enough to make a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bruesselbach.com/store/book/daughters-of-mercury-2017-wall-calendar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e2017 calendar\u003c/a\u003e as well. Prints and some of the originals are available\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bruesselbach.com/store/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eon my site\u003c/a\u003e. I make sure to pay my models generously when they need it. While some paintings I make and will share through this Patreon will be of trans women subjects, since they\u0027re beautiful and should be painted and I know many I still want to paint, those portraits will no longer formally be part of the project, and only if/when this Patreon reaches the third or fourth level, at which I can both pay a model for that amount of time, pay for the materials, and produce rewards, will I again make paintings that size.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://bruesselbach.com/img/portraitspatreon.jpg\" width=\"600px\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon is for work beyond that, be it portraits (in person or video but rarely from photos) of interesting people, or new experiments in goofy algorithmic sci-fi figurative imagery, sort of like what I did in my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bruesselbach.com/projects/deterration/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egrad school days\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0but probably better; or both at once. I want to do more invention, particularly what I imagine as \"future people\" but in this anachronistic form. By subscribing to receive hi-res images, prints or paintings, or even commissioning your own portrait, you\u0027re helping a working artist dedicate her time to making beautiful paintings of awesome people and sometimes made-up conglomerations of humanoid bits in space or whatever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://bruesselbach.com/img/trilogypatreon.jpg\" width=\"600px\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t work if I\u0027m not paid, and I need to know I have a paying audience to produce work. By giving even a little bit, you are helping pay my working costs and getting introduced to the subjects that deserve to be celebrated in paint whether they can commission it or not. I promise I will not be so prolific as to tax you, so by supporting to have a piece of each artwork, you may be contributing fairly rarely. I will aim for about once a month, but sometimes I skip months due to having a day job or something.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI know how open ended this all sounds, but if you like what I do and want to see what happens when I don\u0027t have a structured project (I\u0027m sure excited to find out), pledge me a little something!"
