Of course not.\u00a0 I\u0027m still very much a novice at content production and have huge amounts to learn and refine still.\u00a0 I will continue to always be learning, refining and improving upon this philosophy and my skills, which will no doubt be constantly evolving as I go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn Ace Thunder!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Almost exactly the same principles apply, with the compromise of some content, such as the gameplays, being far more subjective in their perceived value of time spent watching.\u00a0 Overall though I try to choose gameplays that I think the viewer may learn something from, such as gameplay methods or tricks.\u00a0 The overall principle of Ace Thunder! is to always have in mind how to be of assistance to the viewer, so they may improve their game experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Trying Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a while on my first channel, I was focused on a single game; A real-time PVP mobile game, for which I sporadically produced content whenever I felt there was something worth the viewer\u0027s time and attention (My own time permitting of course).\u00a0 Now my affair with that particular title has come to an end, I wish to branch out into producing gaming content in a more general sense, alongside Battle of Titans.\u00a0 \u003cem\u003eBut\u003c/em\u003e, wishing to maintain my philosophy means I do not create \u0027filler\u0027 or \u0027lite\u0027 content that could be produced quicker and more frequently and monetised for ad revenue (on Lloyd Le-Mar), which would be no where near enough to provide a stable income regardless.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI very much enjoy producing content; It\u0027s by far the most gratifying and humbling hobby I\u0027ve ever undertaken and I never expected to get the amount of attention I\u0027ve received for what I have made so far.\u00a0 For these reasons I wish to give more time and energy to the pursuit of content making than I currently am able with working life\u0027s typical necessities leeching away at the majority of one\u0027s time and energy.\u00a0 And making the videos does take a lot of time and energy. The writing of the scripts, being typically 1000\u0027s of words currently is the biggest hurdle in the process that requires much focus, deep thought, many reedits, reading aloud and reflection.\u00a0 Recording and editing the voice-over itself coming a close second to this.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eHaving this process constantly disrupted obviously greatly increases the time it takes for me to make videos to what I\u0027d consider an acceptable standard, and limits my capability to give the proper time and attention needed to propel them to higher standards of quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dare to dream that one day, if my content is deemed valuable enough by the viewer, that I might be able to make this hobby into a full-time creative focus.\u00a0 I\u0027ve never asked for donations in any form for anything throughout my life (something I\u0027m sure is true for the majority of people who join this site), so this paragraph has been agonising to write for all the obvious reasons.\u00a0 But, if I look at this logically, especially with the recent instability of ad revenue on YouTube, this method of funding is a far more personal and dare I say \u0027pure\u0027 form of receiving support from those who truly wish to give it, instead of just being a statistic that flatly contributes to a predetermined number.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBefore You Consider Pledging!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirstly, thank you for even considering!\u00a0 Any pledges made here can be considered to support me, my content making, and channels, in a \u003cem\u003egeneral sense\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 If you are only considering supporting me in hopes of seeing more of a particular game then I ask that you refrain from doing so as you will likely be disappointed down the line.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFor Lloyd-Le-Mar\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027ve no intention of having this channel cover a specific game permanently, even though I may sometimes focus on one or two titles for a while.\u00a0 Being locked into one or two titles would be counter productive to the long term health of this channel and my creativity.\u00a0 But again, thank you for your consideration nonetheless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFor Ace Thunder!\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, it goes without saying, but I still want to stress that any donation you may consider would be for me as a \u003cem\u003egeneral\u003c/em\u003e content creator.\u00a0 There may come a day when the game this channel focuses on becomes corrupt and no longer has the best interests of the player in mind.\u00a0 In which case I would cease to a medium of promotion for said game, as any further attention given would be acquiescing to this behaviour, which will do none of us any good for the long-term future of our beloved medium.\u00a0 We all have a responsibility to make sure things are kept in check for the next generation, standards and principles must be maintained and passed on.\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, one day, the game will die out, and be replaced with a successor.\u00a0 In which case a natural shift would need to occur\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that being said, if you like what I do, and how I do it, and feel happy to pledge; Any amount you want to spare is always very much appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLloyd\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e"
