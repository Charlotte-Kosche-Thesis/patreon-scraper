    "summary": "Loserdex is a comedy/drama/romance comic about a bunch of young adults living in the same apartment complex! There isn\u0027t any big overarching plot, this comic is mostly focused on the characters, how they overcome their struggles (or try to), grow as people and have all kinds of misadventures. I started it way back in middle school as a fun thing to scribble during classes and share with my friend/co-creator, but I grew so attached to these characters and their stories that well, here we are....\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs You may know, this is my passion project, I do it for free, I don\u0027t get paid for it. I will continue to do so regardless weather I get money from Patreon or not, but it would be amazing if I could move away from taking any freelance work or commission I can find,and be able to afford working on something I\u0027m actually passionate about instead! \u003cbr\u003eBesides, there are so many stories I really can\u0027t wait to tell in this comic, but since I only work on it on the weekends, it is moving painfully slowly! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s some nice rewards, which You can read about on the side! ---\u0026gt; \u003cbr\u003eI immensely appreciate any amount of support I can get, and You will be doing every one else who likes the comic a huge favor as well, because more I make on here, the more I can afford working on this comic more often than just my weekends, which of course means more updates faster! \u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING!!! ILU GUYS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOW, FOR SOME EXTRA INFO ABOUT THE \"HELLA\" FANCY TIER\u003c/strong\u003e! (If You plan on pledging there, please make sure You read this!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often need background characters for this comic. Sometimes they\u0027ll even get a spoken line or two. I want to create a little database for myself, of other people\u0027s characters, that I will chose from whenever I need some extra people hanging out in the background, or having minor interactions with the main cast! So if You pledge here You can send me Your OC to use in the comic, yay! (I won\u0027t use them for anything else, don\u0027t worry) There are a few things to keep in mind tho;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-They need to be a Pokemon gijinka, obviously. \u003cbr\u003e-This comic takes place in a modern times of universe very similar to ours, so Your OC has to look the part! If they\u0027re designed to live in medieval Japan, for example, I\u0027m gonna have to change their wardrobe. (But it would be a lot easier if You just sent me a reference of them in what they\u0027d wear in the 21st century! ) \u003cbr\u003e-No legendaries, sorry. They are meant to be mythical and one-of-the-kind in this universe, so it would be very strange to have Arceus just walking around in a park.\u003cbr\u003e-Shinies are a-ok tho! \u003cbr\u003e-Feel free to make them any age/gender/etc as well. I will need all kinds of people. \u003cbr\u003e-IT IS PREFERRED You send me a colored, full body reference of them! I\u0027ll only draw what I can see. For example, the main comic is in full color, so if You send me just a sketch/lineart for reference I\u0027ll be limited to only using them in BW side chapters 8( \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, I think this is all for the rules about the OC, now some more explanation on how this works;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Patreon charges people on the first day of the month, and You will need to wait till that time to submit an OC!\u003cbr\u003e-You can submit more OCs if You want, one with each extra month You support me in this tier!\u003cbr\u003e-You also don\u0027t necessarily have to... You can just keep using this tier to support the comic more, but if not, it\u0027s totally fine!\u003cbr\u003e-When Your payment is successfully processed, feel free to send me a reference of Your gijinka OC, as well as any written info about them, either via Patreon message, or to my e-mail; nagorkakinga@gmail.com (make sure to mention Your Patreon name so I can make sure it\u0027s You if You send an e-mail tho!)\u003cbr\u003e-Again, I might have to reject it if it brakes any of the rules mentioned above, so make sure it doesn\u0027t! \u003cbr\u003e-I\u0027ll then put it in my folder for bg characters, and You can expect them to pop up in the comic from time to time! \u003cbr\u003e-Please be aware, this will not happen immediately. Sometimes a comic chapter will be taking place in a single room for few weeks! But Your OC will be in my folder for forever, and there will be plenty of opportunities for them to be plugged in, so just be patient and don\u0027t worry! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me know if You have any questions, I\u0027d be happy to answer them!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
