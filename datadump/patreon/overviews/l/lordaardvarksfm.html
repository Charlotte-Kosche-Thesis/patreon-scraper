My art has evolved and grown a lot over the years, and these days, I am focusing on making \u003cstrong\u003eanimated series\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eshorts\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003efilms\u003c/strong\u003e: complete with \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal voice acting\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003efull-fledged plots\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003ecomprehensive scripts\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile porn is a definite staple of my productions, it is not all there is. My series and films are written with comprehensive \n\u003cstrong\u003eplots and sub-plots\u003c/strong\u003e, engaging stories, and a healthy dose of \u003cstrong\u003echaracter drama\u003c/strong\u003e sprinkled with \u003cstrong\u003ecomedic relief\u003c/strong\u003e.

Where the films and series are serious endeavors in telling stories that pivot around the delectable act of\u003cstrong\u003e fucking each other\u0027s brains out\u003c/strong\u003e, the shorts often instead poke fun of either the tropes of the universe they are based in, or poke fun at the absurdities of porn in general.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are looking for 3d porn that is made with a passion for writing, intense attention to detail, and an insatiable lust for fast and intense fucking, then you\u0027ve come to the right place:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWelcome to the Aardvark\u0027s Den.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
