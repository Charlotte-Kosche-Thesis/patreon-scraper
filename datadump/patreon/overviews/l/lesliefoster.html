All of those various facets of myself get distilled and expressed in my experimental work. I\u0026#8217;ve been telling stories for as long as I can remember and love using that medium as a way to explore ideas and experiences.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work focuses on providing space for voices that are far-too-often ignored and is centered in the lives of marginalized people, especially queer folks and people of color. My films explore joyful resistance to systemic oppression and imagine new ways of being in this world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been incredibly luck to pursue my art and I\u0027m always working on ways to grow and learn in order to create content that is meaningful to you and many others. Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out some of my work here: \u003ca href=\"http://lesliefmuse.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://lesliefmuse.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/12719537_735672570881_106087022437722224_o.jpg?oh=ceeff63bef51ea4cceb19536858ee576\u0026amp;oe=58E29B2A\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Decided to use Patreon and How You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFilmmaking and installation building is expensive, time-consuming work, which becomes difficult when an artist is juggling healthcare, living expenses, and odd jobs. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is incredibly important to me that my collaborators and crew are compensated fairly and I won\u0026#8217;t create work unless this is possible. I\u0026#8217;m also committed to working with crews that are centered on marginalized people and your funding helps this become a reality!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFilm gear is expensive both to purchase and maintain and funding this Patreon allows me to use high quality equipment to create beautiful and thought provoking projects. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtist residencies can be vital to mid-career artists and serve to provide a network of other artists as well as a space to hone skills. However, without financial freedom, it can be difficult to take the time required for a residency. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I love getting the chance to mentor young artists and filmmakers and I love getting the chance to be vocal and participate in activism. Patreon allows me the time and peace of mind to be able to do this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/11147256_707797627491_6552097094807442695_o.jpg?oh=9d3d1b3c17c04fb799e48d917b25bd91\u0026amp;oe=59190C02\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m passionate about sharing the work I do and as a patron, you\u0026#8217;ll get an inside look at current projects, sneak peeks at future concepts, and get the scoop on what it\u0026#8217;s like to create a film-based gallery show from the ground up!
