    "summary": "These last two years of my life, and most of yours, have been quite the adventure: mind, body, and spirit.\u00a0 I have never been challenged the way I have while our earth transitions either from 3D to 5D, or the Rapture, or...who knows?!\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been blessed to see a lot of changes to our physical planet...enough to keep my Youtube channel running strong for the past year and a half, and I don\u0027t see any signs of it slowing down.\u00a0 I\u0027m here until the end!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amazing part of all of this is that a lot of the changes I am seeing are happening in our own backyard, and where I love to travel too the most: SouthWest America!!!\u00a0 Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada.\u00a0 I through Colorado and California as well.\u00a0 I\u0027ve only been out to the south-west once, and I plan on returning to see our new world!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I went out to Arizona...it was nothing the way it is now.\u00a0 And I\u0027m speaking to all my Mandela Eagles.\u00a0 I put out a very cool series called \"New Earth Series\", and in that series I show people a whole new world.\u00a0 A world that just appeared without any of us knowing it.\u00a0 During the making of this series, I was just screaming inside to go back and see this NEW EARTH in person once again.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI traveled to Arizona in the summer of 2014, and I must go back immediately!!!\u00a0 I have no idea on how to set this up right now...but I do know that it would be pretty cool to get some help from anyone out there to further my journey out to the south-west...so this is the reason for this Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am looking for support...though I will say this: I am going no matter what.\u00a0 I have saved up money to go, and would love the help though!\u00a0 Means I could do more!\u00a0 I am making a BIG DEAL out of this once I get my itinerary sorted out...roads and such.\u00a0 After that I will be deciding what I will be doing along the way and or in the cities I drive by.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really hoping to meet some of you on my journey, and already have a handful of close subscribers that I will be making arrangements with to meet and greet!!!\u00a0 This is so exciting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most new to Patreon...I have no idea on what to expect, so I expect nothing but what I already get from Youtube.\u00a0 Like I said, I am going no matter what, and whatever I can receive from this venue is a blessing and a bonus.\u00a0 I DO NOT NEED THIS!!! BUT...BUT...I will ask seeing as how much work I put into my Youtube channel.\u00a0 I get on average $120 a month from Youtube already, so I am already grateful of you guys...seriously...I am.\u00a0 I am so happy with where my channel is and who I have met.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never asked for anything like this from the public in my life, and I must admit it feels weird...in a good way, so I\u0027m having a lot of difficulty launching this campaign.\u00a0 I just wanted you to know that.\u00a0 Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying to figure out rewards and such...so things may seem lame at first.\u00a0 Just hang on!!!\u00a0 I have some really good ideas.\u00a0 Peace!\u00a0 \u00a0#ChooseWithLove\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much!!!"
