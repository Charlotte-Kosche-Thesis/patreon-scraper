    "summary": "Hey, so my name is Daniel, also known as Lonelion4ever on most places I post my work. I live... well all over the place. I have a wife and 3 amazing kids (cause I like punishment what can I say). I\u0027ve been drawing for years, and in the recent few years I\u0027ve really started trying to improve my skills as an Artist. I feel like my work has been improving with leaps and bounds, and with tons of support from my friends and family I find myself looking to do even more with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheres lots of projects I\u0027ve really wanted to do and start work on, and while its always been hard to make enough time, I think Patreon might be the thing to help me finally do what I want to do. While I struggle to make it through each month\u0027s bills like so many others out there, I want to make a job out of my art eventually. But I believe starting small and building up is the thing to do here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here it is, I can\u0027t do it alone. But with your help, I believe we can have a lot of fun and create some amazing and awesome things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Art work\u003c/strong\u003e - I take commissions whenever I am fortunate to get them. Love doing these.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.lonelion4ever.deviantart.com\"\u003ehttp://www.lonelion4ever.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.lonelion4ever.tumblr.com\"\u003ehttp://www.lonelion4ever.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture Projects Patreon will help me achieve \u003c/strong\u003e- Epic Comic (I have one I\u0027ve been writing for a bit and another thats still in early creation phases), Lots more fan art (both sfw and Nsfw)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy comic\u003c/strong\u003e - Its named Korheim, it is a big fantasy adventure starting a female lead. Think Viking and Barbarian in setting. With some twist and turns ofcourse. I\u0027ve always had a love of Norse Mythology and this comic is full of it. Not always keeping to the original stories or tales, but it is there in spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd a \"Personal Side Quest\"\u003c/strong\u003e - I had a lot of family issues awhile back and I dealt with them in ways that leave me now not doing that great Physically. I hope is to also use what I bring from patreon to help me get back in shape and make sure I can live to see my beautiful children grow up and have families of their own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 - Right now I am putting just a few. Once the comic is started up and gets posting I will be adding rewards to existing ranks as well as offering a lot more for the higher pledges. Know that no matter how much you sign up for, my family and I are grateful beyond words!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
