    "summary": "For the last few months, I have been working at perfecting my skills with 3D posing software and the endeavour, while very fun, has been very pricey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause it is such an investment of time and personal income, and because a lot of people expressed interest into helping out the cause, I am launching this Patreon page to gather support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I will still be releasing quality, regular shots on DA, Tumblr and Flickr, a lot of them will be part of a full set so you can see more than a single picture of a certain cutie, from more than the usual angles I post. \u00a0There will also be some sequences, of which maybe just one frame will be made available on DA/Tumblr/Flickr. \u00a0This is how I can come to peace with charging people for my art and still giving a couple freebies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBottom line, if you like my stuff and would love to see more of it, it would be super appreciated to get your support. \u00a0Thanks a lot and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-my-patreon-5076590\"\u003eHow my Patreon will work...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome everyone and thanks for the interest in my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are a few things to know on how Patreon works and how my page will operate:\u003cbr\u003e- Patreon charges you on the first of every calendar month.\u003cbr\u003e- Access is given out after being billed.\u003cbr\u003e- Patreon lets you charge either a monthly charge or on a \u0027per post\u0027 basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The pledge you make to me is on a \u0027per post\u0027 basis.  This allows me to keep prices low and enticing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s why...\u003cbr\u003eThe idea is that I do not have enough unreleased material (all of it is available on Deviant Art at the moment, with a couple bonus pics on Tumblr and Flickr) to charge a 20$/month for \u0027all my stuff\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy keeping the price low, people who want to follow me and get the latest stuff can do so at 1$ per post (of 5-10 pictures), with access to up to 5 sets, the older ones being rotated out as new ones come out.  Since I aim to post around 4 sets per month on average, this means for a whole month, it could cost you up to 4$.  Pretty reasonable.\u003cbr\u003eThe second tier is self-explanatory.  It will start to have proper value after 5 sets have been posted and you then get access to all retired sets as well, on a good month, it could cost you up to 8$.\u003cbr\u003eThe 5$ tier gives you all the bells and whistles and would possibly cost up to 20$/month.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the idea behind the \u0027per post\u0027 method is to keep costs low while they can still reach the 20$ mark some Patreons have for their \u0027everything\u0027 tier.  And the beauty of this is if I post less, it just costs you less.\u003c/p\u003e"
