Perhaps you have heard of me, or perhaps you are one of the unfortunate few who have to discover my pulse-pounding tales of adventure, as chronicled in my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lordlikely.com\"\u003ethrilling electronic journals\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose same journals have brought me a certain amount of infamy, what with them being mentioned in \u003cem\u003eThe Guardian\u003c/em\u003e newspaper, attracting celebrity readers such as \u003cstrong\u003eRob Riggle\u003c/strong\u003e (from \u003cem\u003eThe Daily Show\u003c/em\u003e and many notable moving pictures) whilst delighting some 20,000 readers a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuch incredible entertainment was provided for absolutely free by my good self, such was the enormity of my largesse. But now, some eleven years later, I feel the need to bring my tales to a wider audience - which is why I am here today, seeking your kind patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eA THOROUGHLY DECENT PROPOSAL\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy suggestion is this: I commence upon a programme of releasing the most action-packed, trouser-tightening novellas e\u0027er committed to print, to be put up for sale to an adventure-starved audience, thus befitting the entirety of humankind as well as my own pocket-book. The plan would be to set about releasing one such book a month, building into the most loin-achingly lovely library of terrific tales! Behold, the cover of the first planned book in the series, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Bellending Club\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://andyfanton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/likelybellcovfin.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, such an undertaking requires a lot of work, and in such instances I would usually turn to my scribe,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.andyfanton.com\"\u003eMr. A.D Fanton\u003c/a\u003e. He was responsible for transcribing my previous tales to my electronic journal, but since then the bounder has gone and got himself a family and a freelance career, finding himself published in all sorts of journals from \u003cem\u003eThe Beano\u003c/em\u003e, to \u003cem\u003eViz\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ePrivate Eye\u003c/em\u003e. As such, he is now demanding some sort of recompense for his time, which is just about typical for the filthy proletariat. Can they not just find reward in the fact that they have worked for their better, helping them further ascend the social ladder? Is not the exposure one attains from aligning oneself with a beloved public figure enough? Apparently none of that will feed his family, according to that cur Mr. Fanton, and so I find myself having to find a way to pay the blaggard, not to mention the various other costs associated with bringing a book into being. I would, of course, throw some of my own immense personal fortune at the project, only a few bad wagers on the gee-gees have left me in a rather perilous financial state, not to mention that I have now attracted the attention of a rather violent bookie known as \u0027Frothing\u0027 Jack McFrantic. That, dear reader, is where you come in. Along with your wallets and purses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI propose that together we unite to change the face of publishing, preferably to a ruggedly handsome, moustached face. With your generous support, I will endeavour to provide monthly adventures, full of action, thrills, humour, rumpy-pumpy, satire and many, many euphemisms for tallywhacker. As well as that, there are numerous rewards for joining me in this enterprise, from early copies of both the electronic and print editions of the books, signed pictures of my glorious self and your chance to see your name in print. Everyone is a winner - most notably, literature itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do hope you shall join me in this endeavour!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToodle-pip!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Lord Likely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
