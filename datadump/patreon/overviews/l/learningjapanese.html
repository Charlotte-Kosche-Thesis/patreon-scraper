The project was initially suppose to be a method to refresh the knowledge of the Japanese language that he was supposed to already know for his own studies. As such, the material presented is in fact presented by, by all means, a student. To be exact, a student who had only been studying the language of Japanese for two years at the time of this video series\u0027s conception. And a pretty bad student on record, at that. There are sure to be the occasional mishaps, mistakes and misinformation, so do always be keen on learning with your own attentive eye and mind.I look forward to continuing on with the series with videos about language as well as culture, so thank you for showing support by even just watching this one video or following along for the rest of the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATREON INTRODUCTION:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started as a way to review material has begun turning into a labor of love and obligation. As a long-time student but more importantly a child of the internet, a now changing-moreso-than-ever-landscape, I am highly attracted to the idea of contributing to the movement of free education on the internet\u00a0that rivals that of formal academic institution. While it is indeed ironic that I should say that on a social platform that is requesting monetary pledges, the fact of the matter is that each video lesson, regardless of how short or how long, easily takes more than two hours to film, edit, render, upload, and publish; support on Patreon will justify the time and work put into this video series that at times otherwise might have needed to go somewhere else just for the sake of living expenses. Pledges will also assist in improving the video over time, the very long amount of time that I intend to keep this video series alive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m not too much a fan of exclusivity when it comes to access to resources for education. This channel and project was started so that any given person with an internet connection could learn Japanese and be immersed a fair amount into the language and its culture, so I really don\u0027t want to have to offer things like extra videos or study text documents or private lessons to just patrons and deprive everyone else of the same content when I could be using the time put into all that to make free content for everyone and spread the knowledge as far as possible. As a result, the best I can really think of in terms of patron rewards is really simple things like early access to content and priority on the less substantial aspects such as the Q\u0026amp;A questions. All in all, no matter what, please just know that that you would go the extra length to support this project on a monetary level is deeply appreciated, so, truly, thank you very much!\u003c/p\u003e",
