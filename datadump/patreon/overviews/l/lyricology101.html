    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eLyricology 101 is not just a channel that deconstructs and teaches Hip Hop. It is a movement that represents a misunderstood, and underappreciated art form. We at Lyricology 101 not only listen to Hip Hop at an intellectual level, but experience its to full potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Andre Gainer and I represent Lyricology 101. I\u0027m an experimental Hip Hip artist, producer and teacher. I\u0027ve been creating music for over 12 years and I\u0027ve recently followed my ambitions to show the world the inner depths of Hip Hop music. I\u0027ve been using my experience to teach others how to truly experience music through Lyricology 101.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLyricology 101 is a teaching tool that represents true art and Hip Hop culture. It places Hip Hop music under a microscope and unravels its secrets and riddles. It shows new artists ways to approach their own creations and cultivates new original ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to spark a new era in the Hip Hop world and show outsiders of the culture that this is a highly advanced form of creative writing and poetry that needs to be taken seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe put out new videos every week. We have a number of series. We have Bar for Bar Breakdowns, where we pick a specific verse of a song and deconstruct all of its elements in order to educate those that are willing to learn. We have Rap Tips \u0026amp; Advanced Rap Tips, where we highlight a specific writing technique and explain how to perfect it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will go to expanding the quality of this content, as well as allowing for more time to create new shows and material.\u003cbr\u003eWe spend about 4 to 5 days per video with researching the subjects, analyzing the material, filming and editing. We spend a good 25 to 40 hours on each video. Every contribution helps give us time and freedom to create the best content possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your love and support! Let\u0027s all work together to keep this dream alive and bring respect back to the name of Hip Hop!\u003cbr\u003e"
