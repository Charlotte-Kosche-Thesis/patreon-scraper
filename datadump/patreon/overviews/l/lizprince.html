    "summary": "Hello!\u00a0 Thank you for your interest in my Patreon campaign!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like journal comics, then you are in the right place!\u00a0 For 2 years I have been writing and drawing a daily comic strip about my life, which a pledge to this Patreon page will gain you instant access to.\u00a0 You can either subscribe to read my comics here on this website as weekly digital digests, or you can sign up to have a unique mini-comic sent to you each month in the mail, to have and to hold.\u00a0 The print comic editions are ONLY available to subscribers, but the print level pledge also gains you access to the weekly digital digest, so there\u0027s no waiting to get your dose of daily Liz!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCAMPAIGN DETAILS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m using sliding scale pricing for this campaign.  It is really important for me to try to keep this project accessible to people with different financial situations, so please keep the spirit of pay-what-you-can to heart: if you can afford to pay the max amount, please do!  It will help me keep these comics available to the folks who can\u0027t afford to pay as much!  Every dollar helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor \u003cstrong\u003e$7-$10\u003c/strong\u003e per month you will receive a printed and bound mini comic version of each month\u0027s strips, starting with the month you sign up.  These books will be put together and mailed by me, and the only way to get a physical copy, is to pledge on patreon: I will not be making these collections available on my webstore or at conventions.  This is my way of making a product that is exclusive to my fans who contribute to this campaign.  Books will be compiled and sent out in the first 2 weeks following the month of completion (January\u0027s book will be sent out mid-February; February\u0027s mid-March, and so on). Please note that if you want the print subscription, but live in another country, the cost is $12- 15 per month, to keep up with the ridiculous amount that the U.S. postal service charges to send books internationally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf $7-$10 per month is too steep, or you don\u0027t care for material things, you can subscribe digitally for only \u003cstrong\u003e$3-$5\u003c/strong\u003e.  I will publish a weeks\u0027 worth of strips all at once, once a week on my patreon page for people who pledge at this level (and people who pledged for a physical copy can also see these posts, if they would like to read the comics online before the books are printed).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a \u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e Tip Jar pledge level for people who have been long time fans of my work, and just want to make a donation, without desire for any of rewards for pledging at a higher level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you can\u0027t contribute to this campaign at all, don\u0027t worry about it!  There is an extensive archive of comics to read for FREE over on my website,\u003ca href=\"http://www.lizprincepower.com\"\u003ewww.lizprincepower.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a smattering of strips from 2016, and a photo of what the published books look like, to pry your wallet open!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lizprincepower.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jan_feb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lizprincepower.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jan-june.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for your interest.\u00a0 Every pledge helps keep these comics going, and in turn, these comics keep me going, so you as a supporter are an integral and indispensable part of my everyday life!\u00a0 Cheers to you!\u003cbr\u003e"
