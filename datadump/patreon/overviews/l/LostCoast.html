    "summary": "Hello! Welcome to my brand new Patreon page. Four months ago I started producing electronic music as Lost Coast. As long as I can remember, I\u0027ve been drawn to the power that music has to bring people together in a cathartic shared experience. Now I want to be a part of creating those experiences with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdsourcing site where you can get cool rewards in exchange for supporting my music. \u00a0I\u0027ll be putting out about one song a month, which means you\u0027ll get these rewards about that often. \u00a0You can also set a limit to how much you want to pay, so on the off chance I put out more than one song and you only want to pay for one, you can set it up to not pay for any of the additional releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo Months ago, I posted my first song \u0027Trust\u0027 on Soundcloud and since then it has been played over 10 thousand times and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive. \u00a0Now I\u0027m inviting you to come along with me on this journey. In the coming year I plan on releasing a steady stream of music, going on tour to perform my work, and building a rich community of fans and friends to share the journey with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your level of patronage, you\u0027ll be able to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess exclusive free downloads of all my songs. (I\u0027ll be putting out about 1 song a month).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSee behind the scenes videos from my studio and preview unheard material.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGain access to stems of my songs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecome a member of the \"Lost Coast Crystal Club.\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet professional quality prints of the artwork that accompanies each single.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eMost importantly I just want to say thank you. Whether you choose to join me on Patreon or you\u0027re just passing through, I am so grateful to anyone I can share my work with. I can\u0027t wait to create amazing music and a strong community with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
