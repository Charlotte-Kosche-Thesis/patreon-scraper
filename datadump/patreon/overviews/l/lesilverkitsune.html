She dived into burlesque in the same fashion that \nexplorers have tackled uncharted wildernesses for millennia: because it \nlooked like a hellova good time. With a wildly creative mind, a rear of \nnigh callipygian perfection and an inability to recognize the phrase \n\u201ccan\u2019t\u201d, Silver has been taking leaps of artistic faith in her acts \nsince she first set rhinestoned heels to stage. Taking her name from the\n Japanese word for \u2018fox\u2019, Ms. Kitsune is an innovative performer who \ndepends on her own mixed bag of dynamic artistic experience to bring \nabout imaginative, ecdysiastic acts. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e As graceful as her name, \nSilver spends her time off-stage battling the forces of boredom, \ncostuming way too much, refining her performances and catching chickens.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Based out of her new home in Alabama, Silver Kitsune also frequents the Washington, DC  and Atlanta, GA areas.",
