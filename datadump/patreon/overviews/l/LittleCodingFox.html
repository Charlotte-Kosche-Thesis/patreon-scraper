It has been my biggest passion for all my life, and I want to share my creations with the world, and make fulfilling experiences that a lot of people can enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m working on Fairtravel Battle, a collectible card game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat is Fairtravel Battle\u003c/h4\u003e\nCard games are one of my favourite game genres, but unfortunately I have a hard time being able to play them as much as I want, due to how expensive they tend to get. So I\u0027m creating Fairtravel in an effort to create a more customer friendly experience that I, and I hope yourself, would enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFairtravel Battle is being created in a way to allow you to customize your experience in ways that other card games don\u0027t usually allow. You can customize the rules of your play session, as well as play offline with friends, reset your save slot if you lose, earn a booster pack if you win, among other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way I hope to monetize Fairtravel Battle is, rather than buying booster packs, you would buy an entire card set for a small fee, something around the $5-$15 range. This unlocks that set in all game modes, and allows you to use those cards in several modes, including Duel, Sealed, Draft, Highlander, Delver, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFairtravel Battle is already playable and in an enjoyable state. You can find it at \u003ca href=\"http://littlecodingfox.itch.io/fairtravelbattle\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eitch.io\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon\u003c/h4\u003ePatreon allows you to send regular payments to creators you wish to support, so people like me can have some extra income to help producing their creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get to choose the amount you want to give, and you can cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often are you going to charge your patrons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pay per month, and your get charged on the 1st day of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003c/h4\u003eUnfortunately, although I can produce the code for my games and make them functional, I am not able to get art for them without some extra income. I put a lot of time and effort into my work, and I want it to be as great as it can possibly be. I\u0027m also working on this by myself, and don\u0027t have all that many resources other than my ability to code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThank you\u003c/h4\u003eI would like to thank each and every one of you who chooses to support me. It\u0027s thanks to people like you that I get to do my best work, and I want to give back to you for your support by producing really enjoyable experiences. Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e"
