I\u0027m an independent video game writer and researcher, who has contributed to such sites as Unseen64, Nintendo Life, Did You Know Gaming, and ComicBook.com. I speak to game developers around the world to uncover the truth behind cancelled video games and preserve what was lost for historical and artistic interests. \u003cstrong\u003eVideo game preservation matters\u003c/strong\u003e, and by supporting this Patreon you can help me accomplish just that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy efforts include running an online documentary series called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO9mxFELVbbHM1dR6VumpP60zBENfQr0b\"\u003eGame History Secrets\u003c/a\u003e, which goes in-depth into interesting game industry stories, such as games that were never released. I interview developers personally, getting to understand the creative visions behind these games and preserving as much as I can by collecting assets, footage and sometimes even code from them. The videos I do tell the stories behind these projects; explaining what the games were intended to be, and how exactly they fell to cancellation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThpxKCT6EL0?list=PLO9mxFELVbbHM1dR6VumpP60zBENfQr0b\u0026amp;ecver=1\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy giving as little as $1 a month, you can help support the show and keep it going.\u003c/strong\u003e This entitles you to access to bonus material and early access to every episode of the show. You will also get exclusive access to my other scoops. I often unveil exclusive scoops and rumours (e.g. leaked games, behind the scenes gossip, etc.) in articles written for Patreon backers and my Patreon\u0027s exclusive podcast, which is available multiple times a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put a lot of time and energy into the content I create, and I love doing it. With your support, I can continue researching these games and bringing to light many more exclusive stories for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading and have a great day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Liam\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note that Patreon exclusive content (e.g. podcasts, articles etc.) is strictly not to be reposted.
