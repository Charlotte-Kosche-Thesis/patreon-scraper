Since I could hold a pencil I\u0027ve been creatively active, be it through Drawing, Origami, Painting, Costume making, Modeling, Photography, Retouching, or whatever else you could think of that is creative, and am always picking up new skills and hobbies. Creating things and making art is my life.

To set up my studio I have even resigned from my steady job, in order to commit fully to my studio and art!\u003cbr\u003eBecause I\u0027ve worked very hard in the factory for quite a while, I can live off my savings for the next 3 months, if I am capable of keeping my side job for one day a week. Your monthly donation will help pay for materials and tools for the creative projects, the projects that are the most creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a little push from my friend and first Patron I decided to get on Patreon, giving you all an opportunity to financially support me, inspire me to keep going and be the artist together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eDarkashterEXPO2018:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLate 2016 I announced #DarkashterEXPO2018. Unfortunately, the world changed after that through my job, then founding a Studio and then getting the opportunity to do an internship in America. The idea was to do a Solo-Expo in the summer of 2018, which will be featuring a collection of photographs, themed seasons and months. The expo will have 12 photo sets of max 4 pictures on display, and if all goes right the props used in this expo are also to be exposed near the photos. Those pictures were to go in calendars for 2019 and Books that contain behind the scenes as well. The expected date and location for this Expo are June, July, or August and somewhere between Amsterdam and Rotterdam. \u003cbr\u003eNow, I don\u0027t want to blow off this Expo at all, which is why I keep it in here for everyone to see, but there will be a delay. What year I will be doing this Expo?
