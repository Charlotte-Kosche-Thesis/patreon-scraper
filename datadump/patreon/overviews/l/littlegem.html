    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHello! \u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027m Gemma Baker and I have been performing Poetry since January 2015. I have performed at events around the UK, taken part in national competitions such as the BBC Edinburgh Slam, and Poetry Rivals. I have been published in several anthologies, featured in The Guardian, and commissioned by the BBC. I organise and run three Spoken Word events in Lincoln and am passionate about growing the local, and national poetry scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/uploads/project_images/a5/a8/385633/576abb3e980d7e8ffbf1c32056674e96bf769400.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHelp me do what I love \u0026lt;3\u003c/h3\u003eMaking a living as a full time poet is no easy feat, and I certainly haven\u0027t mastered it yet, but I\u0027m trying! I love poetry, I love what it gives people, I love how it connects people, and I\u0027m grateful for what it has given me. I want to keep making work, I want to keep helping others to make work, and to do that I need time, time and money *shakes fist violently at capitalism*. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of my poetry duties I home school my two teenage daughters, I lead a life like many, I have extortionate rent and bills to pay and barely make ends meet. But I LOVE what I do. This is where you come in... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly contribution would go towards enabling me to develop professionally. Currently I am very rarely able to afford workshops, short courses, shadowing opportunities, competition entries, tutored writing retreats, rehearsal space, residencies, visiting Spoken Word events and festivals, and the time to do so. \u003cbr\u003eAll these opportunities would help me to develop my practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all sounds very self-indulgent I know, but hear me out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am HUGELY passionate about supporting other poets through the events I run and through work outside of those events, but I need the skills! This kind of development would enable me to soak up a whole load of inspiration, skills, and experience and share it with the ever-growing community of poets in Lincoln (and beyond). It will also give me much needed skills to develop as a poet myself, and realize my dream of making a living from what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eMy current collection \u0027No Word Left Unspoken\u0027 is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.eu/fUvtyK5\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eYou can see reviews for my previous collection \u0027The Falling Architecture of Reality\u0027 \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Falling-Architecture-Reality-collection-poems/dp/151729794X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1515557762\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=the+falling+architecture+of+reality\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eWebsite \u003ca href=\"http://www.gemmabakerpoet.uk/\"\u003ewww.gemmabakerpoet.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/gemmabakerpoetry\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/gemmabakerpoetry\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTwitter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/gemmabakerpoet\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/gemmabakerpoet\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eInstagram\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/gemma_baker_poetry\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/gemma_baker_poetry\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLovely things people have said:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027Integrity, talent, grace, humour, poise, and more hard work than you would\u0027ve thought possible.
