    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lilly and I am a dabbler. I have many interests! Foremost is my novel Silvercore, which is the first of a trilogy, a country locked away from the world for over 300 years is dying of an unknown disease, the King decides to send his daughter and friends on a quest to find the cure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBullet journaling is my second love, it encapsulates most of my other interests: crafting, organizing, drawing, writing and mindfulness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrafts: I am currently making a carpet which is as awesome as it sounds. I am also teaching myself how to crochet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrench: I live in France and I\u0027ve taught myself how to speak French. I spend about 2-3 hrs a day studying French. I\u0027m working my way through the \u003cem\u003eEasy French Step-by-Step\u003c/em\u003e book, I make myself flashcards after each chapter to keep the new verbs and phrases fresh in my head. I\u0027m also working my way through a \u003cem\u003eC.A.P. Petite Enfance\u003c/em\u003e book which will hopefully prepare me to begin a childcare course here in France. I do flashcards to do with that as well. I speak it, write it, read it and watch it! French is intertwined with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrawing: I actually have a Bachelors Degree in Fine Art in Printmaking. Unfortunately I\u0027ve suffered from depression and eating disorders in the past, and making art got entangled in that web of negativity. It\u0027s been a slow process but I\u0027m starting to enjoy the simple pleasures of drawing again. I love mandalas and zentangles, they have reopened my eyes to the enjoyment of focusing on a drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHealthy and mindful: I run! I started running January 2017. I love it! I do yoga and I meditate daily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you subscribe to this blog or my Wordpress you will get monthly updates on all of the above activities. You can donate whatever you want. I hope to have some colouring books available in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my page, if you have any questions send them my way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLilly Casey\u003cbr\u003e"
