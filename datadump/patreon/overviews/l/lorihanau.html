    "summary": "Hello Fellow Change-makers! Welcome to this community, this sangha and dojo!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Lori Hanau. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been supporting people and teams in the field of leadership and community development across the sectors for over 15 years. I have integrated my experience as a mission-driven business strategist with my executive coaching, community building, teaching shared leadership at Marlboro College Graduate and Professional Studies, and writing on shared leadership for Conscious Company Media. To this end, I have been creating trainings on shared leadership and compassionate accountability. I love inspiring people to courageously open, awaken, connect and radiate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis community is part of a\u00a0global movement\u00a0to support and empower a new era of shared leadership. It is an enchanted environment full of knowledge, experiences, and exercises thoughtfully created and co-created with you to nurture your individual, and more importantly, your collective leadership potential. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has the power to awaken us from sleepwalking through power dynamics and leadership as it was to embracing the genius in the room, the genius of our grand diversity, nourishing more effective group dynamics.  It is a place for ongoing practice, mastery and realization of you as a collaborative, compassionate leader within a group. The only way to experience an experience is to experience it. We are glad you are here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis community is first and foremost one where I am asking you to support our ability to produce original work, while we also build this community. My team and I are working on courses and resources to engage in shared leadership, and we cannot, nor do we want to do this without your support and co-creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are grappling with power dynamics and your soul is being drained by the work your were originally so inspired to do, this is the community for you to restore, envision, share and develop within.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are feeling alone, overwhelmed, anxious or parched by your work - this is your oasis for nourishment and inspiration. Here, together in this community, we will co-creatively take great care of ourselves, as we care for others and care for this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are in a growth spurt of consciousness, this environment will strengthen and support your growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are here to be embodied together, encouraging you to make your difference, showing up as a whole person in your work. Each one of us can be the change we wish to see in the world...together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our sangha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our classroom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our party.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a our dojo. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a different approach to leadership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get this party started!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA thousand thank yous for your support and contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith deep gratitude and a full heart,\u003cbr\u003eLori\u003cbr\u003e"
