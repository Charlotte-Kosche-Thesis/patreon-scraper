Creating and self-publishing my own comic book also requires a hefty penny and a lot of time. Contributions from patrons here will go towards making Mayflower and my art a reality, from paying for printings of the comics, to website hosting fees, and to buying tables at conventions. They\u0027ll also assist in paying for basic human survival requirements like food and shelter, allowing me to have more time dedicated to actually making my art.\u003cbr\u003e"
