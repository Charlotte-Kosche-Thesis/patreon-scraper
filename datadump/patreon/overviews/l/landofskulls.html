    "summary": "Hey guys, first I\u0027ll tell you a little about me. \u00a0I (Michael Cooley, Alias: Gaiyoku) have been creating programs and games in my local community as well as for friends and family since the age of 16. \u00a0I am currently 31 and now attempting to launch my first video game to the public. \u00a0This is where I need your help, because this is a pretty hefty project that I now have been working on almost 2 years without any income in my best effort to get the core features into the game. \u00a0I have managed to get a lot of them in, but still have a few I need to knock out before it\u0027s ready to go into the Alpha stage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0 Now I\u0027ll tell you a bit about the video game. \u00a0The game is called Land of Skulls, and it is about a pirate crew who gets stranded on an Island after their ship gets demolished in a big ugly storm. \u00a0They all get washed on a shore with an ugly welcoming of skulls laying in its soil. \u00a0Now, you\u0027re job as the captain of the crew is to settle on this dangerous land and make a city/kingdom for your crew members to survive in. \u00a0With this said, you will need to craft, build, farm, tame animals and hunt for food. \u00a0Not only will your crew just munch on all of the hard work you been doing to gather for them. \u00a0These guys are trained in a major skill that will most benefit you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcagFKONzdo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0 With the knowledge of the skill your NPCs know, they will craft better \u00a0tools, weapons, and items for you to use while you scavenge the world. \u00a0You will have to earn their greatest respect though, they won\u0027t just make you better things if they aren\u0027t treated well. \u00a0This is handled by a \"Reputation System.\" \u00a0Each time they are fed, and earn proper cash flow by delivering goods of their own to your trade person, they will earn a better reputation with you. \u00a0So, it is also up to you on how well you treat your crew members on this island. \u00a0Either feeding them low end food, or cooking them home cooked meals, this is your choice, but they may or may not like you for what you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmDvOdgPkI8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0 This and many other features are to come into the game as the game progresses through Pre-Alpha all the way to Launch, and then after as well. \u00a0With your help in support for this game I will be able to jump from working on this project part time with little money to live on to a full time position, and maybe even get into hiring someone for the art. \u00a0I am not a very good artist, but I currently use Voxel art to get the job done. \u00a0I also do the animations within Blender and Unity depending on the animation I am trying to make. \u00a0If you do wish to support me on creating this game, I really appreciate it! \u00a0Thanks guys for reading this, and I hope you enjoy Land of Skulls! \u00a0You can currently download Pre-Alpha 7 and 8 for free! \u00a0You will also be able to gain entry into Pre-Alpha all the way through Launch if you support this project. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Pre-Alpha 9 will return to a Patron/Land of Skulls Donation only download. \u00a0This game is also featured on IndieDB.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n$5 Per Month Rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBe a Patron for up to 4 Months Get these Rewards:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAccess to Patron only GoTM Dedicated Server\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI run Dedicated Servers for Indie Games I support just like you are for me whenever I get extra funds to spend.
