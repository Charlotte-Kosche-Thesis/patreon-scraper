A lot of them are labors of love. (Translation: I would have to ignore paying gigs to put any time into them). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of these projects is \u003cstrong\u003eTenState,\u003c/strong\u003e the series I co-created with my friend, collaborator and writer \u003cstrong\u003eT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eom Merrritt.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 To date, Tom and I have done five issues of TenState, that you can purchase\u003ca href=\"http://lenperaltastore.com/products/tenstate-issue-1-5\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e here\u003c/a\u003e or download from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.comixology.com/TenState-Vol-1/comics-series/12730\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eComixology.\u003c/a\u003e We had another five issues of Season One to set up.  Beyond that, another four seasons are in the works. \u00a0It\u0027s a lot of content. And through Patreon, we can complete this project!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut wait, Len. \u00a0Haven\u0027t you funded projects through Kickstarter? \u00a0Why not use that platform?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. Both Tom and I have been fairly successful funding projects like \u003cstrong\u003eGeek A Week \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eSword and Laser\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0on Kickstarter. \u00a0(In fact, TenState became a reality on that platform as \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lenperalta/tenstate-a-comic-book-project-by-tom-merritt-and-l\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe first five issues of \u003cstrong\u003eTenState \u003c/strong\u003ewere funded via Kickstarter\u003c/a\u003e) But Patreon is different. \u00a0Instead of collecting a set amount of money toward one specific goal, Patreon is like a subscription service. \u00a0Through Patreon,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYou are becoming a real patron of the arts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Just like in the olden days!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeed more reasons to support us through Patreon? \u00a0Here are a few to consider:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eYou like me. You\u00a0like Tom. You really like us!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eNeedless to say, this goes a long way. \u00a0If you like what we do and want to support what we do, Patreon is \u00a0great way to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ve wanted to commission me and support me, but it\u0027s tough to afford me in your budget. \u003c/strong\u003eI get it. Everyone is stretched. But for a very minimal amount of money, you can get my art and start that Len Peralta wing in your house that you\u0027ve been dreaming about. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eYou want our comic TenState to continue. \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a great way to do that. \u00a0If we make enough per month, Tom and I can continue working on the comic and continue and developing the story. \u00a0Beyond that, we can also add a team to the project and hire a professional colorist and letterer if we make enough per month. I can also add real print issues to the mix! \u00a0But most importantly, \u003cem\u003ethe story can go on!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind that this is a fluid interaction. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can increase, decrease or cancel your pledge at any time. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering becoming a \"\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\". \u00a0We look forward to continuing the series and making an awesome comic for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou rock.\u003cbr\u003eLen and Tom"
