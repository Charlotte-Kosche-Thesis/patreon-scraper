    "summary": "Hello world! I am Ash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been drawing for almost 20 years, and I started with the mindset that I wanted to be a manga/comic artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years and years of indecision, I decided to quit my day job and take the plunge into comic book illustration and self-publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I, and what is my goal on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have been back and forth a lot over the years attempting to do various freelance projects. My goal on Patreon is to be able to switch from having a day job to doing comics, art and art commissions from my studio full-time, and make a living doing what I love. For that I need people who want to support my artwork, and help get my comic book to progress from the (almost 30 current) written chapters I currently have, to full-fledged graphic novels with 10-12 chapters per volume.\u003cbr\u003e______\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy art:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a mixed media and multi-style artist working predominantly digitally. I have been known to do artwork in the anime and manga style, as well as a western comic style, pop art and art deco, as well as a fairly realistic style. Off the computer I am a fan of charcoal drawing, and also work with inks and other media to create unique pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy comic is a mix of anime style and webcomic art, and focuses around what it is like to be a clown while also having an active adult twist and lifestyle as a fire performer.\u003cbr\u003eMy art and comic may have NSFW, sexual content and adult themes. Also clowns.\u003cbr\u003e_______\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a crowd-funding platform similar to Indiegogo and Kickstarter. However, it is a platform where instead of building up large sums of money for a single project, your backers can tip you for each item of relevance that you put out.\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to put out 3-5 pages per week at the moment, thus completing a full chapter every month, and would like the support of my followers to get that done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I trying to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis one is easy, and more or less answered above.\u003cbr\u003eI am working to become a self-sufficient, self-published, full-time artist who does not need to work a day job, by releasing 1-4 pages of my current pet-project comic, per month as well as doing commission work and other art to be released on my redbubble storefront as prints and clothing.\u003cbr\u003eI am the sole artist and writer, and currently have no financial backing; That is what Patreon is for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, money makes the world go round, as it were.\u003cbr\u003eI need funds so as to support myself, to pay for supplies (I am going to do this with a mix of traditional art and digital), as well as to pay for marketing and advertising, and eventually the hard copy prints of art work and comic books, for distribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t offer money or back me, then clicking any of the links up top to share this page on your Twitter, Facebook, or other media platform/blog, \u00a0would be much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I need:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-If I had a base income of:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e$300-500 per month\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e- I would be able to cover my basic life necessities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e$500-1000 per month\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- I can switch my focus almost entirely back to working on the comic and push production up to 3-5 pages per week instead of 1-4 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003e$1,000-2,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0- I can put further effort into this project, stop searching off of Patreon for commission work, and work on building a proper website and storefront.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my plan of operation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYear one\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Get into a routine of drawing 5-8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, updating at least one completed piece of art per week, with at least one comic page being completed per month.\u003cbr\u003e2) Prepare a website (complete with domain name) to release the comic on a chapter-by-chapter basis, a ts well as present my artwork in a gallery format.\u003cbr\u003e4) After the comic chapters are completed, I will self publish using CreateSpace, and distribute the hard copies of the book through Amazon, the comic\u0027s official website, and wherever else I am able. For the rest of the art, I have created a redbubble storefront to sell and distribute prints, clothing, and other merchandise with my artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFurther:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) Build a client/fanbase who loves my work and supports me, so that I can eventually break away from having to do this and a day-job\u003cbr\u003e6) Build the website to be able to host a number of various comics other than my own, such as what HiveWorks does, and potentially expand to include more artists and eventually acquire a studio in which myself and any of the other artists and writers who have coupled with me by that point can call our home base.\u003cbr\u003e7) Find a print or distribution company that I can work with wholesale to move away from sites like Redbubble for art prints and clothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"I don\u0027t know you or your work, why should I support you?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is something I ask myself every day when I think about crowd-sourcing funds like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy would you support someone else? Why do I support other people?\u003cbr\u003eI know it\u0027s hard for me to support people I don\u0027t know, sometimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome worthwhile causes that I feel you would be working towards in supporting me however, are the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eYou will be helping an entrepreneurship/small business develop\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003e -\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0With all of the fuss about big business out there, one thing that many people can get behind is the expansion of small businesses and family owned businesses. For me, this is very similar to the \"Hollywood Performer Vs. The Kid Who Dreamed\" scenario. What I want to do is something many people take for granted, and since this is my first full comic book, until at least volume 1 is done, I won\u0027t be able to get signed with a publisher (not that I want to); so the only way to go about it currently is as a one-man startup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eYou will be supporting the emergence of a brand new publishing company\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003e -\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eMaybe this doesn\u0027t appeal to you, because you hate it when small endeavors become main-stream. Maybe it doesn\u0027t appeal to you because there are already so many types of art out there that it feels like a media overload. But then, maybe that\u0027s right there with what you want. Promoting all forms of art, obscure or mainstream, and seeing the new ones stand on their own. If my comic goes well, I want to be able to start pulling in new artists and writers, and publishing their comics alongside my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eYou will be helping a lifelong dream become reality\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003e -\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI first started wanting to do comics when I was about 10 years old, and I am currently 27. I met some of the people behind some of the major comic companies and they tore myself and my art apart when I was a 13 year old kid, telling me that I had no future in this industry and that my style just wasn\u0027t what they were looking for.\u003cbr\u003eNow I realize that the world in general IS looking for my style, otherwise Manga and Anime, and all those weird webcomics out there wouldn\u0027t be as massive in the country as they are now. And reading and watching the different Manga that is becoming famous, these days, artists and writers who are similar to what I do are the most prevalent; This is my time to prove them wrong and do what I have always wanted to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, the one I hope you\u0027re doing it because of:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eYou have seen my art and like what I do\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003e -\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0This is what I am aiming for. I want to put the word out about what I do, and want to attract the people who are interested in seeing it. Nothing could make me happier at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat content can you expect from us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am going to initially start by releasing one to four pages of my comic per month, as an online-release, then transition to a hard-copy release so that fans can purchase my work as a graphic novel. This patreon will also be dedicated to much of my non-comic art, and I will be publishing my personal art projects here in all of the carious styles I work in. As an added bonus, my $3+ patrons will get to see the same Work-In-Progress images that I send my clients when they commission work from me, as well as similar versions of all of the art that I do, and higher tiers get access to high resolution printable versions of the art to be used as desktop backgrounds, to print out, or to do with as they will (for non-commercial purposes).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I have become a bite more thoroughly established here, some later perks will include Patron Shows where you can watch my process and chat with me about where I may go with my comic, etc. via private livestream channels, exclusive digital content, and once my funds are high enough, discounts on my Redbubble storefront!\u003cbr\u003e"
