    "summary": "Welcome to my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Lela and I am from a small Black Sea country called Georgia. First\nof all, let me explain what this site is all about: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon \u003c/strong\u003eis a crowd\nfunding site for creators all around the world who create different things:\nmusic, videos, art, photography, creative writing etc etc. Then people who like\ntheir work and have a wish can become their sponsors (patrons) by giving a few\ndollars each month. Creators set their goals, saying, for example: if I reach\n100 USD per month I will make more videos, if I reach 300 USD per month I will\nbe able to buy a new camera so I can take better photos and so on. Briefly, they\nset goals and decide on what they want to spend the money they get. Take a look\nat their profiles by clicking \u003cstrong\u003eDiscover \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eFeatured\u003c/strong\u003e. You will see how many people are\nregistered, what they do, how many sponsors they have and how much they make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne of the main reasons I opened this page is that I and my mom take\ncare of stray animals. I love animals. I used to bring stray kittens and puppies home since my\nchildhood and raise them. I don\u0027t remember how many pets I\u0027ve had since then\nbut no less than a hundred for sure :) Currently there are 19 cats and kittens and 3 dogs that we feed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided to use my writing skills and share my works with you. I always liked\nwriting and wrote a lot. I post my original work here and the donations which I\nwill receive will be spent on supporting the stray animals that we feed. So yes,\ninstead of a new computer or a camera or whatever, we want to feed these\nanimals. Basically, you support my creative writing so we can buy food (and\nother needs) for these animals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI and my mom are not an organization or related to any shelters. We\nare just people who love and pity these animals. Kittens are domesticated and\nlive in our house, but most of the cats are feral and they come and go as they\nwish. Just scroll down my page (click load more posts) and\u00a0you will be able to see my writing and the\nphotos of these animals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to become my patron:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to become our patrons, all you have\nto do is sign up, write the amount you wish to donate on a monthly basis in the\nlittle box and click become a patron. It\u2019s very easy. You will be charged on the 1st of every month and I will receive your donations on the 5th. \u00a0For example, if you become a patron on January 5th, you will not be charged until February 1st.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatrons get rewards too. I have set rewards, depending on how much you\nwish to donate and you can see them right below this post. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe believe in your kindness and hope that there are many animal lovers\nout there who would love to help us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you in advance \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith love, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLela\u003cbr\u003e"
