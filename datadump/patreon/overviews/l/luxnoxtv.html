For the last year and a half, Lux and I have been creating edutaining Let\u0027s Plays and livestreams on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/LuxNoxTV\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/luxnoxtv\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e. The journey began when Lux pointed out my commentating during our gaming sessions, so we took to YouTube to let the world enjoy my bad jokes and Lux\u0027s sass.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWe began our content creation journey shortly after I moved to Silicon Valley to find a job. At the time, I had been having a rough time with job searching, my mental health was deteriorating, and Lux wasn\u0027t yet a full-time employee, so we had time on our hands to do something we both enjoyed. Unfortunately (or fortunately for Lux), Lux was soon hired full-time, so content quickly became 95% Nox because I still couldn\u0027t find a job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to April 2017. I had failed to obtain gainful employment, Lux\u0027s income couldn\u0027t sustain both of us, and my mental health had reached a dangerous point. This combination of events forced me to move back home to Massachusetts and away from Lux, effectively cutting her off from contributing to our channels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been undergoing and continue to undergo treatment for severe panic disorder, insomnia, and depression since my return to my hometown. Unfortunately, my condition remains severe enough that I\u0027m unable to work. I continue to turn to YouTube and Twitch as places of healing and solace, and so far, the little community we\u0027ve built has been kind and supportive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSimply put, I love what I do, and I would love nothing more than to continue doing it. However, bills have been piling up for about a year now, and I\u0027ve been unable to find the financial means to help me pay them off. I\u0027ve considered earning money by spending most of my time as an online survey taker or something similar. However such income is highly unpredictable, and I remain optimistic about pursuing my interests and entertaining YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRemain consistent with content on YouTube (1-2 video(s) per day)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLivestream on a more regular schedule\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImprove videos (end screens, better editing) and livestreams (facecam, polished Twitch screens)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelop new series for the channel besides Let\u0027s Play\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupport the artists who have so far contributed to LuxNoxTV\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue sharing with the community my enthusiasm over simulation and strategy games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, on February 20, 2018, YouTube pulled our channel from the Partner Program because we have yet to reach the milestone of 1,000 subscribers. Although I didn\u0027t receive much ad revenue, what I did earn helped me to feel more independent and allowed me to give something back to the community via giveaways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far, THANK YOU for reading! I\u0027d give you a cookie just for that if I could. Lux and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you so much for the support you\u0027ve given to us via our YouTube and Twitch channels. You\u0027ve helped propel LuxNoxTV much further than expected, and we\u0027re eternally grateful for that. Personally, I feel a mix of privilege and astonishment that you\u0027ve allowed me the honor of entertaining you every now and again, so thank you for giving me purpose. Battling severe anxiety, depression, and insomnia was once a challenge I endured alone, but with you by my side, I no longer feel alone on this journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very bottom of my heart, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eNox\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
