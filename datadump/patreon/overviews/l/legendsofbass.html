    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the Legends of Bass Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS LEGENDS OF BASS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLOB is an episodic adventure into the use of the electric bass in contemporary and popular music. Each video series profiles a different iconic and renowned bass player with a focus on their innovative techniques, tones, arrangements, and styles. In chronological order, we move through each bassist\u0027s career highlighting their standout performances and showcasing their evolution. In addition to my lecture style analysis, I also play excerpts of all of these basslines, usually set against the original recordings for context. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHAT\u0027S THE POINT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the electric bass didn\u0027t enter the recording scene until around 1950, it has been featured on countless famous recordings from all genres. From John Entwistle\u0027s speedy solos on The Who\u0027s My Generation or Paul McCartney\u0027s sliding groove on The Beatles\u0027 Come Together to John Deacon\u0027s thumping line on Queen\u0027s Another One Bites The Dust or the dance pop prowess of Louis Johnson on Michael Jackson\u0027s Billy Jean. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the bass is a pivotal component of any live or recorded performance it is often overlooked by the average listener or out shined by other instruments or the vocals. My goal is to shine a light on the sometimes unnoticed brilliance hiding in the lower register of so many songs. By doing so I hope to deepen the average listener\u0027s appreciation of the bass and clue them in to some of the greatest players to ever pick up the instrument. If you\u0027re a musician yourself, I hope this series will allow you to see some of your favorite arrangements from a different perspective. I also hope we can spark a continuing dialogue on anything and everything bass!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO ARE YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jon Nicosia, and I\u0027m a 27-year-old living in Jersey City, New Jersey. Since I was a little boy I\u0027ve been an avid music fan. I grew up in a musical household and while my parents didn\u0027t play any instruments, they were constantly blasting music of all genres and eras. I guess that\u0027s how my brother and I caught the bug. My brother bought me my first bass in junior high school and I got really into it a few years later. I taught myself to read tabs and became deeply fascinated with the bass in all music, but primarily Rock. I played in a few different bands throughout high school and college and have recorded several releases as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll these years later I\u0027m still just as passionate about the bass. With a day job and my current band sucking up most of my time, I wanted a way to keep bass an important priority for myself. I flirted with the idea of creating a YouTube channel for bass covers for years but just figured I\u0027d be lost in the mix. Last year the idea for Legends of Bass came to me and after a little bit of planning I released my first video. Six months later I am absolutely floored at the response! Thousands of views and more comments and subscribers than I could\u0027ve dreamed of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLegends of Bass does not fit today\u2019s media market in any way. First of all it is very long form compared to the majority of videos on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc., where videos usually top out at just a few minutes. Most of my episodes are 20 minutes or longer. On top of that, it\u0027s a niche topic that the average YouTube user may not be interested in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the surprising amount of views my videos have received, I also cannot monetize them because of the copyrighted music used during the performance pieces. While ads do appear, all of that money goes to the copyright owners as per their agreements with YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNonetheless, I\u0027m very passionate about this subject and will continue to put out episodes despite these obstacles. With support from Patreon I\u0027m looking to expand the the series and improve the quality of the the episodes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW OFTEN DO YOU RELEASE EPISODES?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery episode of LOB is a long process and it\u0027s a one man team--just me. For each episode I start with the research. I listen through each bass player\u2019s career carefully identifying standout basslines. I also brush up on the history of their bands and anything else that can be helpful in shaping the complete picture. After selecting a full list of basslines, I need to learn each one. This can be challenging because of the lack of accurate tabs or sheet music available. I frequently need to learn songs by ear---tabbing them out on my own. After everything is memorized I need to select the appropriate basses and accompanying amp rigs that will appropriately capture the player\u2019s tone to the best of my ability. Now I can set up the shoot. I film myself playing each line over the original recordings and then spend some time mixing the audio for the best clarity. Finally I combine all of the finished audio with the video clips in a very lengthy editing process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween balancing a day job, my band, and life in general, I try to spend nights doing my research and other pre-production. The shooting and mixing usually takes about a week and the post production another week or so. My ultimate goal is to put out an episode at least once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW CAN WE HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLOB is completely driven by viewer support. I\u0027m so happy that so many folks have watched, commented, and subscribed. It has motivated me to take this much more seriously. I do my best to reply to every comment and thank every suggestion that comes my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like Legends of Bass please consider donating a few dollars per video. Know that by doing so, you\u0027re helping me to create higher quality episodes at a faster pace. My ultimate goal would be to invest even more time to expand the channel further and cover other aspects of bass playing and equipment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return you\u0027ll get access to great rewards only available to my Patrons. Check out the reward info in the side bar for more information on each reward tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cem\u003eJon Nicosia \u003c/em\u003e"
