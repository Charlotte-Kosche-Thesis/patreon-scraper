I\u0027m apart of the EuroCosplay Photography crew and help film the event. I\u0027ve also helped film larger CMV videos, skit videos \u0026amp; edited videos for other Youtubers. Mainly though I love to film cosplayers.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s such a joy to find an amazing cosplayer at an event and capturing \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e perfect shot. I\u0027m very lucky to meet some very talented and sweet people during my travels to events. I always try my best to try my hardest to create bigger \u0026amp; better videos each time! I\u0027ll always try new equipment, try new techniques, new ways to edit or learn new ways to colour.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iGXConD.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWell thats certainly a good question...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I work full time but it\u0027s a tricky balance to both have the time to do more creative things and to have enough money. I work alot of overtime to help pay for my videos (which involves \u003cem\u003ealot\u003c/em\u003e of expensive equipment) but that sadly means less time to do what I love. This is were Patreon comes in. Just a small donation a month means I can work less overtime in order to focus on creating more content. It means I\u0027ll be able to create more of the content I love and hopefully you\u0027ll love too, without having to worry about the bills.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gYhwyyH.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo matter what amount you pledge...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be helping me create more video content. My dream is to revisit my \"Cosplay Showcase\" days. Whats a cosplay showcase you say? Well many moons ago I tried filming cosplay showcases, a video of just 1 or 2 cosplayers which highlighted their costumes. It\u0027d involve close up shots of their costumes, highlighting all the detail and hard work. It\u0027d also consist of beautiful shots of the cosplayers portraying the characters. Sadly I could only do these while at cons and the locations were less than ideal. Here\u0027s some examples of what I mean:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ief4bKvm7DY?list=PL9IePIFsAt7iEWt93kj3n8lv3BmP6WguV\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWith your pledge I\u0027d love to film some amazing cosplayers but on set! Have them in beautiful scenery! Whether it be forests, lakes, castles, cities! I\u0027d love to do this outside of cons too as it\u0027d mean I\u0027d be able to have more time to create the best video that I could! With more donations this could expand into CMVs, skits and help me with collaborations with other channels. The possibilities are endless!\u003c/div\u003e"
