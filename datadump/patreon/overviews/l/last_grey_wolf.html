    "summary": "Living costs money. A lot of money. More money than I think all of us wish it did. At this point in time, subscriber and donation revenue is not enough for me to live off of, comfortably or uncomfortably. With Patreon, I hope to bridge the current gap between the money I\u0027m making and the money I\u0027m spending. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy accept donations and Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDonations are a great source of revenue currently, and I greatly appreciate each and every one, no matter how big or small. Unfortunately donations are extremely hard to gauge as a monthly income. They are sporadic and often can jump from a high grossing month to a low one without reason. Patreon allows me to follow and manage my income much better than donations do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping donations is important for those that just want to support the channel in single increments as opposed to a monthly one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s all this money going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to be honest with you guys when it comes to my expenses. I don\u0027t want you guys to think I\u0027m trying to eke out every single dollar I can from you so I can go blowing it all on things I don\u0027t need. Right now the two largest expenses in my life are my rent and my car payment. If I can afford those monthly payments, the rest of my expenses are rather small in comparison. I plan to be completely up front with you guys when it comes to these things, and will let you know once I do start to make enough money to live off of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery amount helps.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you only donate a dollar a month, that small amount will add up very, very quickly. What\u0027s small to you can be very large to me with enough supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e100% Optional\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePlease, please don\u0027t feel obliged to pledge if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to. My content will always remain free to view for all, no matter what. Just having people watch the stream makes me happier than I can put into words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
