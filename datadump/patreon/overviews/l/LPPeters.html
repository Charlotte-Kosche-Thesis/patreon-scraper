Where it\u0027s not really going to mean much, people are going to start taking it for granted, it\u0027ll lose its value, and that scares me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, it\u0027s where I want to go with my life, in showing people how to live their truest life, and while I want to be able to eat, live, and build my dream to help others (which, I\u0027ll explain in a minute) I don\u0027t want it to become such a big business that I sell out, do the things that currently make me shake my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand this is a technological world and social media is the biggest driving force with all the different platforms out there, but my goal is to help as many people as I can, through word of mouth and people sharing what I\u0027m doing because they believe in it, they believe in me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to do things on my terms and in turn, help others and also, help others to do the same as I. I\u0027m multi-talented, forever fascinated and sometimes over stimulated, I spend most of my time reading, studying, learning, writing, training, helping others, meditating, volunteering, making music, memes, all different types of expression and content! Through becoming a patron of mine, you will help me to continue to do that, along with getting some invaluable insights and some straight down the line advice and information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Tom Cruise aka Jerry Maguire once asked, \u201cHELP ME, HELP YOU!\u201d\u003cbr\u003eHaha! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat Will I Be Doing?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I already am, but hopefully with less stress and drama from influences of the outside world. I was a professional DJ for 12 years, Radio Host for 8 years, MC for 6 years and have spent the last 4 years as a Personal Trainer/Coach/Mentor in Fitness, Life Advice and Philosophy, and also 33 years as a student of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know, that last bit sounded tacky, but I can assure you that it will all become un-tacky (un-tacky? yeah, that\u0027ll do?!) as I reveal myself to you, more and more. As I share my writing, my experiences, my music and my philosophies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t hidden anything on my Facebook or Instagram, there\u0027s some very insightful stuff and if you go back a few years or more, some very dumb stuff, probably. I am who I am, and I won\u0027t apologise for it or what I have done in the past, but I honour my mistakes and my wins by having learnt from them and now, want to share with others and help others break out and continually become the best version of themselves, which, is ever changing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write, make music, make memes, will start doing videos soon and will be sharing all of this, all of me, with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat Will I Be Giving Away?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe, plain and simple. Sometimes I might share articles I\u0027ve written, other times I might share a track I\u0027ve written and recorded, and now and then, it\u0027ll just be my thoughts on things which many have come to love and inbox, call or message me for, almost every other day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon and What\u0027s The End Game?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!! Why the hell am I doing what I\u0027m doing and how do I plan to pull it all off?! Wellllllllll................\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write articles but am not hellbound on getting published because I want to do things my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make music but am not hellbound on getting signed because I want to do things my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do lots of things but am not hellbound on getting mass recognition or millions of dollars because I want to do things my way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be as authentic as I can and those that vibe with me can ride with me. Those that don\u0027t are still cool, and there\u0027s someone else out there they should be riding with, so peace and love be with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy end game is a Training Warehouse and Spiritual Retreat. If you\u2019re looking to become the best version of you, then you need a full MBS (Mind, Body and Soul) Solution. To care for yourself as a whole, so there are no weak links in the chain, we need to look at all three stages of our being. Our mind, with the easiest way of doing that, being simply to talk about a thing and talk things through and perhaps, looking at things a little differently. To take care of our body, well that\u2019s pretty straight forward, fitness training, albeit weight loss, strength training, or muscle building, coupled with a friendly chat about personal wellbeing, encompassing nutrition, sleep and simply how to break bad habits and create new, easily sustainable, healthy ones. For the soul, meditation is key, unlocking depths we never new possible through self-reflection, self-care and self-help, we take ourselves to new heights, better understandings and deeper connections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe warehouse will be for training and a mezzanine level for coaching seminars, advice, life coaching and the likes. The retreat is going to be a property where we can house people that are struggling to find themselves, where they can (hopefully) stay for free or a donation (like a temple) and are looked after and given the tools to heal and become whole. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aforementioned is a brief view of my endgame in what I hope to accomplish as I didn\u0027t want my info section to be too long, but more will be revealed as we go! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027d also like to become a \u003cem\u003eSpiritual Gangster\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0027d love for you to support me; however you can, when you can, and let\u0027s find the best way to live, together.\u003cbr\u003e"
