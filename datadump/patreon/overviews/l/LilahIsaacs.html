I am \u003cstrong\u003eLilah Isaacs\u003c/strong\u003e, writer and artist of \u003cstrong\u003eFujibayashi\u0027s Manual of Merging Rivers\u003c/strong\u003e on the DMs Guild, creator of \u003cstrong\u003eRuty Rutenberg\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dressed2tpk.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDressed 2 TPK\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and more. \u003cbr\u003eI pretty much live and breathe story-writing, story-telling and the arts. Much of my work, from art and writing, to DMs Guild D\u0026amp;D content, encompasses cultures and languages very close to my heart such as East Asian and Middle Eastern mythology!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the work I\u0027ve released so far, here you can become one of my patrons and help me continue to produce stories, art and stay up to date with the latest content. With your help, I can make this a full-time occupation and all of those sleepless nights churning out the next product or piece of art will be worth it.\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, with your continuing support, I\u0027ll be able to upgrade my equipment to produce more and better quality content! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u2665.:*\u00a8\u00a8*:.\u2665.:*\u00a8\u2728\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rabbitoverthemoon.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u2728\u00a8*:.\u2665.:*\u00a8\u00a8*:.\u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHere\u0027s the reality; I was never able to afford a conventional Art Education. Everything I\u0027ve learned, has been auto didactic. When I was accepted into an art school as a teenager, I was immediately withdrawn from it simply because we couldn\u0027t afford it and my mother\u0027s cancer had returned from remission with a vengeance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDuring my high school years I was unable to afford a quality set of colouring pencils. Because of this, it infuriated me to witness students break, disrespect and waste the professional quality pencils that my local public school provided them for art class.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy mother died before I graduated high school and even graduation was a battle with the School Board for me. Because to them, I was a \"\u003cem\u003etroubled youth\u003c/em\u003e\" that didn\u0027t deserve a diploma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt helped me through a lot of those difficult times and although I do produce a lot of art, story-writing has been my primary focus. I use my art to supplement my writing and story-telling. Which leads me to my next topic...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u2665.:*\u00a8\u00a8*:.\u2665.:*\u00a8\u2728\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://silkrosetales.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u2728\u00a8*:.\u2665.:*\u00a8\u00a8*:.\u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs I mentioned, I had an extremely rough childhood, so I spent it retreating into my own world and by the end of it, I would have stacks of drawings and writings of these stories and characters I created in my head. \u003cbr\u003eThe first time I attempted to talk about anything I dealt with, I shared with a group of friends that my mother had cancer. I was instantly accused of making the story up for attention and resolved from there on not to bother talking about anything that I was dealing with anymore. If I was asked about unusual cuts, bruises or anything else, I simply made up an excuse and shrugged it off. I wrote about it instead.\u003cbr\u003eThis was the inception of my current novel-in-progress\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://silkrosetales.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Silk Rose\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\ud83c\udf39. From those humble beginnings, it has blossomed into a living, breathing world of its own, complete with theology, laws of nature, language, and culture. Although I\u0027ve developed the world and its characters for nearly 10 years, it was only a few years ago I finally decided I would try to publish it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo when I am not writing D\u0026amp;D adventures and supplements, I am continuing to compile, write and rewrite, scrap that writing, write it again, stare at the writing in disgust, write some more... I forgot where I was going with this. Oh! Right. This story is truly my passion project and I hope I can make it into a something worth reading! Speaking of story telling...\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u2665.:*\u00a8\u00a8*:.\u2665.:*\u00a8\u2728\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Lilah%20Isaacs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDungeons and Dragons\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u2728\u00a8*:.\u2665.:*\u00a8\u00a8*:.\u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI was a child when I sat in and listened to my older brothers and cousin play basic rule set Dungeons and Dragons, when  the label \"\u003cem\u003eages 10 and up\u003c/em\u003e\" was displayed at the bottom of the red box. \u003cbr\u003e...I wasn\u0027t 10 at the time, but I didn\u0027t care.\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, brothers can sometimes be terribly harsh with their little sister. Though that was my initial experience, I did not let that deter me. With the core concept of D\u0026amp;D fresh in my mind, I took it to the lunch tables at school and began DMing games there.\u003cbr\u003eNeedless to say, once we \"came of age\", most of my friends were more interested in boys than D\u0026amp;D and that was the end of my DMing career for a little while. I kept my love for D\u0026amp;D alive through the variety of video games Wizards of the Coast would release through various gaming companies like Neverwinter Nights and the Baldur\u0027s Gate series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then the fire nation attacked and everything changed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Ahem*\u003c/em\u003e I mean, the internet happened, and everything changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had this sudden amazing development happen where D\u0026amp;D players from all over the world could get together and share the experience online! On top of that, we had the release of the DMs Guild! For the first time, I could connect with more people than ever before that loved D\u0026amp;D as much as I do. Then I connected with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mazearcana.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaze Arcana\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.satinephoenix.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSatine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and so many amazing people! How awesome is that!? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait, there\u0027s more!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so many amazing thoughts, ideas, stories and things for D\u0026amp;D. I keep a little journal FULL of ideas! But I don\u0027t want to just sit on them for my personal group of friends, I plan to write it all and publish it to the DMs Guild and hopefully give back to D\u0026amp;D and its community at least a fraction of what it has given me. \u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in. I hope I\u0027ll be able to make writing stories for myself and for D\u0026amp;D into my full-time job! While I try to make that a reality, my mortal form still requires sustenance! \u003cbr\u003eIf anything that I am working on interests you, please consider donating so that I may continue to live while I attempt to ascend to my final form as a FULL TIME WRITER! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinally...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore Patreon tiers and rewards will become available as I complete more work and reach Patreon goals.\u00a0\ud83d\udc95\u003cbr\u003e"
