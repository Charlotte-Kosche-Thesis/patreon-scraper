     "about": "Hello world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are an Australian couple who met in Europe over 3 years ago now. Riley had bought a yacht, having no clue of how to sail and met myself in the Greek Islands while I was playing music for the summer. He asked me to set sail with him on his 43.4ft Beneteau Cyclades \u0027La Vagabonde\u0027. I didn\u0027t tell mum at first, but I said yes. It has been quite the adventure learning the ropes and the wild but beautiful ways of the ocean... we are forever learning new things. We have sailed over 30,000 nautical miles together now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning, I started making \u0027home made\u0027 style vlogs for friends and family back home to see what we we\u0027re up to. Suddenly we had quickly gained views and followers from all over the world who wanted to watch and come along for the ride. Recently this media hype we have had, has all lead us to striking a great deal for a new catamaran in France to continue our adventure around the globe. This new home will allow us to be able to work more comfortably out at sea and to continue to sail around the world much more safely (now you can relax a little more mumma bear). We have big exciting plans for the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep our production OURS and by becoming a Patron and supporting each episode we make, this allows us to do so. Because of Patreon we have been able to say no to many large companies and sponsorship deals we didn\u0027t feel suited us nor did we want to support. Sailing is also a very expensive hobby and there\u0027s no way we could continue the adventure without help from you guys. Our patrons are like our family. They are apart of something very special and we can\u0027t wait to see where it takes us all! We feel very blessed to be surrounded by such a lovely bunch of people. THANK YOU.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove Elayna \u0026amp; Riley.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSailing La Vagabonde\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
