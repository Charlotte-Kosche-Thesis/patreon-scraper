The game is set in The Six Realms, the westernmost continent in the world of Solanse. Seven years have passed since the last Demon War, and the defeat of Lord Karnas at the hands of the forces of Light ushered in a new era of peace and prosperity for all the races of the six kingdoms. Evil never lies dormant for long, however, and in the shadows new threats to the tenuous peace begin to stir.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first scenario, you play as Rowan, a veteran of the last Demon War. He and his fellow heroes, aided by the Goddess of Light, pursued Karnas to the heart of his stronghold, Castle Bloodmeen, and defeated him once and for all. Having hung up his sword upon returning to his peaceful home village and marrying his childhood sweetheart, Alexia, he finds his idyllic life shattered by the arrival of a beautiful, mysterious woman. Before he knows it, he is forced to serve the very darkness he fought to destroy seven years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCore Features\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou are the bad guy - Unlike most games with alignment systems that allow you to be good, evil, or morally neutral, in Seeds of Chaos you play the villain.

Think of it as being similar to a collection of linked decks, and each turn, the player chooses which deck they would like to draw the top card from, experiencing the event that is revealed. As the game progresses, player choices, event effects, and other factors will determine which cards are added or even subtracted from the decks, shaping the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are two main spheres of event; Ruler, and Adventure.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are four main types of event within these spheres; Benediction, Malediction, Challenge, and Judgement. Benediction events are events that have a beneficial effect, while Malediction events are detrimental. Challenge events evaluate game factors in order to determine the outcome, and can be either beneficial or detrimental. Finally, Judgement events require the player to make decisions and resolve by applying the consequences of the player\u2019s choices.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere is also a special category of event that exists outside these spheres; The Nemesis Event.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://seeds-of-chaos.com/Nemesis%20Banner.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNemesis System\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world of Solanse has many players, both individuals and factions, vying for whatever power they can get their hands on. The Nemesis System is an attempt to recreate the feeling, over a number of playthroughs, that the protagonist has many different enemies waiting in the shadows to strike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Nemesis is an adversary drawn from a pool of potential enemies that the player has to face repeatedly as the game progresses. Very little is known about these Nemeses; where they come from, what they represent, or why they have chosen you as a target. They all have different backgrounds, methods, motives, and masters, but are united by their relentless pursuit of the player character. The Nemesis appears to the protagonist in special Nemesis events, which represent their encounters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Nemesis Event is a special type of event that exists outside the bounds of the main event spheres, and it has its own special set of rules.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNemesis events represent the plots and actions of the Nemeses, and as a result can occur at any time. Nemesis events have a random chance of being encountered regardless of the event pool chosen.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNemeses are unflinching in their desire to destroy you, and this is reflected in their events, which consist of hard choices, and difficult challenges with punishing consequences. Failure to do well against Nemeses will result in steep penalties, and perhaps even more devastating events being added to their pool. Succeeding, however, will force the Nemeses to suffer setbacks of their own.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere will also be additional ways to weaken, delay, and even defeat the Nemeses, but these will all require an investment of player turns, and have little overall outcome on the endgame. The player will have to choose whether to spend turns planning for the Nemeses and lose time that could be spent elsewhere, or risk the chance of encountering powerful Nemesis events unprepared.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdding additional Nemeses allows new events, lore, locations, and new challenges to be added to the game without having to make large adjustments to the core game. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://seeds-of-chaos.com/Sex%20Banner.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdult Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Seeds of Chaos is an eroge, it will include a large amount of sexual content.

The vast majority of money raised will be used to pay the team and others to create high quality art (sprites, backgrounds, CGs, and equipment cards), sound (original music and professional grade sound effects), and do some of the more complex object oriented programming. If the Patreon is ever successful enough, I will pay myself a wage, if only to recover the thousands I spent producing the initial release, but first and foremost the funding priority is assets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amount of money raised will determine the scale of the game. I want to make a game with a great deal of content, and more money means more assets. One of the most requested features has been the option to choose your sex, and I would like to create an alternate scenario with a different female main character that interacts with Rowan\u0027s story, more money will allow me to do that. It will also mean that the world can be fleshed out with more events, characters, sex scenes, nemeses, dungeons, and items. All of these things will greatly improve both the player\u0027s experience and the replay value of the game. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s always an element of risk with these things, but I am a professional in my thirties who went to graduate school, and have extensive experience in project management. In addition, at the time of writing, I\u0027ve invested almost a year of my life and thousands of my own dollars in the game, and I am in it for the long haul (which in this case is three to five years). I\u0027m committed to making my vision a reality, and I hope you\u0027ll all join me on this journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
