    "summary": "The short story - Hi guys! My name is Alicia and I am disabled. I am unable to have a normal job, so I have a lot of time on my hands and an active imagination. I like to draw and paint, I have done both traditional art and digital art. With the worsening of my disability, I have moved into primarily digital art and I really enjoy it. As I paint, I will fall into a very peaceful, zen-like state and it helps the pain to float to the back of my mind rather than the forefront like it usually is. As such, I put out a lot of art. I try to post something new every other day (unless there are extenuating circumstances).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fan works are the most popular, but I can\u0027t sell those images as they are of copywritten characters, and my original work doesn\u0027t sell well. (Also, I like painting fan work better, it\u0027s just more fun for me.) Bottom line: I want to create more fan works and you guys seem to like those the most. A lot of you have also expressed a wish to buy my work. Patreon is a way for you to support me and my art and ensure I keep creating without me getting sued. And you get a little something in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve heard enough, feel free to move on to the rewards portion of this page or exit out as you see fit. But if you would like more information, because I know \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e wouldn\u0027t want to invest in something I didn\u0027t have all the info to - please read on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe longer version - Here is the low-down on my disability. I suffer from insomnia, depression, and fibromyalgia. I keep my depression under control (most of the time) with medication, so it tends not to bother me unless something bigger than usual happens. It\u0027s the other two problems that are the serious ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInsomnia is a sleep disorder and it makes me only get genuinely sleepy after 30 hours or so. In order to sleep at night, I have to take heavy duty medication, but it generally makes me sleep for about 12 hours, dead to the world. And if I try to wake up before the meds have worn off, I\u0027m very hungover. All this would be enough to prevent me from working, but I have the fibro, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFibromyalgia relates to the pain receptors in my skin cells. Around every skin cell, I have more pain receptors than a normal person, so I feel everything more intensely wherever anything is touching me. For example, if someone pinches your arm, it might feel like a 2/10 pain. To me, it could feel like a 6/10. Lying in bed starts to hurt after a while in one position, so it\u0027s hard to get comfortable, which affects the sleeping disorder. Sitting, standing, walking, if I am feeling pressure anywhere on my body, I am in pain. I\u0027m never without it. Some days are worse than others, depending on how much I choose to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is why I can\u0027t work anymore. It sucks, but I\u0027m trying to make the best of things. I\u0027m currently living in my parents\u0027 basement and living off of Social Security Supplemental Income which amounts to around $740 a month. I give $200 of that to my parents. I am living so far below the poverty line, it\u0027s almost funny if it weren\u0027t so sad. But again, I\u0027m making the best of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far, you are awesome. If you do choose to subscribe and ever want more information on my disability, I would be happy to provide it. I know this info dump is a bit intimidating. \u003cbr\u003e"
