    "summary": "Hey Everybody,\u003cbr\u003eI am working on a few games that hopefully with your help can see the light of day in some sort of release. This patreon will be your way to help me get the game company I always wanted up and running and, Maybe become a part of this crazy idea I have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have wanted to create video games since I was around 5 years old,\u00a0 Up until I was 9 I had only played video games. I would of never dreamed I could make one..Until the faithful bought a\u00a0commodore 64. I started I suppose like most I started programming with the text loop and moved on to the square ball bounding demo in the manual. I\u0027m pretty sure most of the things I made got lost in time. I ran a pretty successful BBS board and I modded 2 different BBS software before I made my own BBS software that I kept as a download on said BBS. the first games I made on there was with 2 game maker style software suites. I don\u0027t remember what either were called? I think one had a remake of gunsmoke on it the other was like uridium, I\u0027m not sure? I made a few demos and a few games but mostly aided people in making code for the community. Unfortunately I didn\u0027t own another PC till the mid 2000\u0027s In which I didn\u0027t really do much minus look into coding games for consoles and handhelds of the day. I turned my focus to testing and support to emulation. I worked as a Quality Assurance tester\u00a0 Along with other jobs didn\u0027t leave much in the way of time for programming. Thus here we are, I could use your help so I can un-painfully take days off my \"Day Job\" whatever that may be at the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDuring that time that I mentioned above, I made about 5 full fledged games. Another 5 demos and Designed another 6 on paper alone when I didn\u0027t have a computer. I am starting with the first game in all this and remaking it, Then so on so forth. If, Goals are met those could change in scope and, everything really as I have more time to dedicate to it. I plan on doing this no matter what happens. I\u0027m also not fool enough to think this a get rich scheme. I will be offering a number of ways to help and get these games for a deep discount.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will still be doing streaming bt, It will no longer be the focus of this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will probably edit this a good 40 times more but, This is close to what I wanna say here.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
