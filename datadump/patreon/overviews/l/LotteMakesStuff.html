I\u0027ve been working as a game dev since 2009(!!!) and I\u0027ve been working with Unity pretty much every day since version 3.0 graced our screens actual ages back in 2010. Over that time I\u0027ve worked on a whole bunch of amazing indie games (some of which were even released!): if you\u0027ve ever battled against a virus in an online \u003cstrong\u003ePlague Inc.\u003c/strong\u003e multiplayer match or browsed through abilities in \u003cstrong\u003eThe Swindle\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019s in-game perk system you\u0027ve been playing with code that I touched \ud83d\udc96 (oh gosh the procedural map system in \u003cstrong\u003eGun Monkeys\u003c/strong\u003e is something I\u2019ll forever be proud of!).
