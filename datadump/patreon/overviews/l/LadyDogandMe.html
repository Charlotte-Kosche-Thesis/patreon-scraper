    "summary": "First of all... Thank You for taking the time to look at our page. There is so much going on right now for \u003cstrong\u003eLady Dog and Me\u003c/strong\u003e. Our transition to RV dwelling, adventure seeking, picture taking YouTubers is near complete. I wasn\u0027t planning on an early retirement but it was in the cards. I have always been an active person and have never been able to just sit and take it. I like to go my own way and this experience looks like the way to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLady is my best friend and she is a beautiful Terrier/Retriever mix. We\u0027ve been pals for the last six years and I don\u0027t know where I would be with out her. I\u0027m told she is a rescue dog. She was seized by Animal Control in the Carolina\u0027s during some type of intervention. At any rate, Lady made her way north to New Hampshire via a great network of dog loving people. Well Lady is a rescue dog for sure... but see it\u0027s that dog that rescued me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a two year battle, I now receive a fixed income through Social Security. It was a long and humbling process to get where I am today. Where Lady and I are at the moment is at a crossroads of sorts. We are going to attempt to bucket list America in a 1997 Winnebago Adventurer. We have minimized our existence to be on the road in ten minutes with everything we have. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my transformation towards retired life I have found a new love in flying my radio controlled quad-copter. It happened slowly when I purchased a DJI Phantom to help video our adventures. Well, while searching YouTube for some training videos, I discovered a whole new world. I had no idea that this market segment had so many facets. I have absolutely found a great new hobby. I love flying my drone and seeing stuff from the air. This has given my legs a new freedom in that I can now see what\u0027s over that next hill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a lot to learn in my new RV and drone pilot life, not to mention this world of videography. I have never edited a thing until just a few months ago. I know beauty when I see it... now I want to convey what I see into enjoyable videos that I can share with family and friends as well as my growing social community. I don\u0027t expect much idle time. This hobby is much work and it makes me feel useful again. It warms me to think that what I am creating will remain long after I am gone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am open to thoughtful criticism and any helpful tips you can pass my way. Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t retire as independently wealthy so Patreon looks promising. My biggest fear is breaking down on the road in our 20 year old RV. It has passed rigorous inspection as well as a couple of shake down cruises to NH and back to the Cape. I promise to put the work in and I never expect a free ride. I will respond to your inputs and hope to grow this endeavor along with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for taking time to read this... Wish me luck!!!"
