We\u0027re a community of artists, authors, and thinkers who want to make a truly unique narrative. Donate to aid us in publishing our work, expanding our resources, and fueling our creativity. Thank you---anything helps!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur new website is now operational, and you can visit it at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://library-comics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elibrary-comics.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story itself takes place in a vast multiverse, where virtually anything is possible: god-like beings flit from one reality to another, setting the stage for the rise of intelligent species. Whole universes rise and fall at the hands of interdimensional architects. Time flows like a river, coursing from universe to universe, carrying with it the very essence of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Library is a big place, and as such, there\u0027s a lot to be told. Our stories, currently numbering at about sixteen, range in genre from high-concept space operas and supernatural horror to magic-filled fantasy and everything in between. All of these stories are connected, some more obviously than others, yet intertwine to tell something much greater. There is a conflict coming, one that will shake the very foundations of all that exists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for your time, and we hope you enjoy all that is to come as much as we will!"
