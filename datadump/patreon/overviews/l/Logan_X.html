    "summary": "Hello to anyone looking at this page. I am self-taught 3D artist, working mainly with Daz3D, Photoshop, Zbrush and Hexagon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that this page can help me to reducing the cost of 3D tools and materials, Something that eats a fair amount of my paycheck every month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, all contains are available at my Pixiv page and unless stuff happens, it will stay there and\u00a0 be free. This page is just in case anyone wish to sponsor future projects. Any donations to the cause is always appreciated, and for those who have a lot of money to waste, a few higher tiers are there just to squeeze your wallet a bit. There are no rewards to the first tier, besides my eternal gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in commissioning images, talk to me before pledging. It is not everything I can or will make. So usually I prefer to have a talk about the commission before taking it.\u003cbr\u003eI do not do toddlers, guro, snuff or scat. There is also the issue of what I can create with the skills I have. If I feel the request is above my level, I will say so. But I also likes a challenge and love to learn new stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have some idea that you think might be cool to see, feel free to talk with me. I might find it more interesting then whatever I have planned as the next project. But even if it is the best idea ever hatched, any commission work has priority.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
