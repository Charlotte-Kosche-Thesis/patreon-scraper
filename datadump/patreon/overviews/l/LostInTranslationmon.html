This labour has involved watching and analysing both the English and Japanese episodes of Digimon alongside each other, recording weekly and dragging Jay, kicking and screaming, through the series. We\u0027d really like to do more with the podcast, including expanding to producing product videos, starting a gaming channel and other mediums of entertainment. We\u0027d love what we do and we want your help to make our podcast bigger and better!"
