    "summary": "I write romantic and transcendental poetry, dark faerie tales, fantasy and science fiction, and informative and political editorials. Basically, whatever comes to mind when I sit down to put words on the page. My background in writing is extensive - although I graduated from Pitzer College with a degree in physics, I completed enough Creative Writing classes at San Francisco State University to have obtained an MFA in Creative Writing, if only I\u0027d done all the bloody general education classes I also needed. Instead, I took the kid in the candy store approach to college while at SFSU, which was certainly fun and educational, but didn\u0027t help me finish my degree there. I\u0027ve been writing since I was four - my first poem was about the Easter Bunny, dubbing him the Iridescent Hare. Most of my poetry is now on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.deepeningwoods.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e my website\u003c/a\u003e, as are most my stories and articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am rather eclectic, and am just as likely to be working on a new piece of art as a new story or article, when I have the time. I love the art I create every bit as much as every piece of literature I write. I find them fulfilling in different ways. Writing scratches some fantasies, and broadens the mind in some ways, while my art produces things of beauty that are most pleasing to look upon. I\u0027m also working on two different novels as well as a few other projects, and would love to be able to devote all my time to them. And if that weren\u0027t enough, I also write a series of education mathematics and physics articles, attempting to explain topics in both disciplines to the general public. I release a new mathematics problem of the day every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December, I started a series of articles presenting a challenging math problem every day. In the articles, I devise the problem and present one or two solutions to the problem, along with tips on how to make one\u0027s math easier. I try to cover pitfalls one can fall into and how to avoid them. The articles are totally free to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as my artwork goes, I am completely self-taught. I work primarily in Gimp, though sometimes I will use Publisher to assist me if I\u0027m placing a significant number of objects. Space is the main theme in all my digital art - it\u0027s been a love of mine my entire life. I got my first telescope when I was 5 (I think, maybe a little older), and an even better one later when I was 12. I bought tons of my own astronomy books as a kid - I just couldn\u0027t get enough of learning about space. So, it pervades my art. It\u0027s beautiful, and we live in it, so why not bring it that much closer to the earthly beauty around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my writing can be found at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.deepeningwoods.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e www.deepeningwoods.net \u003c/a\u003e and my Art can be found here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.deepeningwoods.net/Art.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e www.deepeningwoods.net/Art.html \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI sell prints of my artwork here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheDeepeningWoods\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/TheDeepeningWoods\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSwag (tshirts, hoodies, mugs, shot glasses, puzzle, blankets, pillows, etc) with my artwork on it can be found here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/thedeepeningwoods\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.cafepress.com/thedeepeningwoods\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, I have 3 ebooks available in multiple formats, on Amazon, Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, and Smashwords, with a convenient central page for them here:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.deepeningwoods.net/Books.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.deepeningwoods.net/Books.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My stories are dark, disturbing, and hail back to the original tradition of fairy tales before they were cleaned up, Christianized, and Disney-fied. And my editorials seek both to educate people about scientific concepts (I hold a degree in physics) in a way that anyone can understand, and to address socially relevant issues. My art - it\u0027s whimsical, fun, beautiful, and hopefully just lightens up peoples days and warms their hearts. So a visit to my site can run one through the gamut of human emotions, and hopefully everyone walks away from it improved not only for their day, but life.",
