Life is a lot more hectic, so I don\u0027t have time to be everywhere, and do everything. I have a job now, and am on my last few steps to my first Associate\u0027s Degree before heading off into the world of University. But I still try and find time to draw, as I doubt i\u0027d ever stop drawing, to be honest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut because of that, i haven\u0027t been able to do a damn thing here on Patreon for like, over a year, i think. And for the people here who pledged anything to me, I feel I\u0027ve been just dead, for the most part. Because all the comics and art I\u0027ve done has been sporadic at best, trying to find time to do this, or being unable to do that because I have a whole month of frequent math exams coming up. Over time, I completely forget Patreon existed, for literally months at a time. So if you haven\u0027t seen me around. Now you know why.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s different? I decided to forgo the common Patreon setup and tiers, and make this a bit of a digital tip Jar. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll post just about everything I have TO post, here, before I post it anywhere else, so my patrons can enjoy it first. \u003c/strong\u003eAnd this time, i\u0027m not going to decide \"This Patreon is only for certain pics, or comics, or animations.\" Instead, \u003cstrong\u003ei\u0027ll guarantee that it stays alive, by posting every damn thing I can, big or small.\u003c/strong\u003e So get ready people. You\u0027re in for a wild roller-coaster of content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat aside, here\u0027s a link to the Discord I\u0027m in, if you want to talk to the artist, and his fellows, other artists, writers and fans galore!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://discord.gg/gKKXJm2\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "What would 400 dollars get me? A brand new graphics tablet. I\u0027ve always been taking the absolute cheapest option I can, and had trouble with the fact it\u0027s mostly obsolete and if I disconnect it wrong, I have to spend the whole day resetting registries, and using system restore and hoping to god it works aftewards. A proper tablet is a godsend. And would definitely help me create more stuff, if I wasn\u0027t always worried about doing things wrong on this one. Even without reaching the full 400, as long as I have enough to add onto my savings from my regular job, I think we can make it!",
