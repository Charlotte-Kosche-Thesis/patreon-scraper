Building a website to display all of these movies. \u00a0Get my fans locked in with updates automatically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoal 3- COMPETE with others. \u00a0There are many competitions to enter but it takes money to enter most of them. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help Lucky reach her goals by supporting her work. \u00a0Donate per released work (minimum of 2 monthly \u0026amp; maximum of 3 monthly). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
