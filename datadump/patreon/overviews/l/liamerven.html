    "summary": "HI Peeps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to welcome you to my Patreon page. Why is this thing here, and what the heck am I doing anyways? Let me first tell you a little about myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a blind dude from Chicago who makes Let\u0027s Plays of console and now audio-based games. Youtube has tons of Let\u0027s Players of console games, but very few of Audio games made for the blind. I want to fix this by regularly uploading entertaining videos for people to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003eMy Youtube channel found at \u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/user/liamerven\"\u003ehttp://youtube.com/user/liamerven\u003c/a\u003e is proof of what I have already accomplished and what I can continue to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help though. I don\u0027t expect to do this kind of thing full time, but I\u0027d love to find a way to somewhat monetize my hobby. I will be completely transparent in pointing out that yes I am a Youtube partner, but the partner program is only useful for those with millions of views. This is not me. This is why I\u0027ve come to Patreon to ask for all of you who enjoy my videos to help out if you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can help me in any way, we can get things done here. I can record more games, and upgrade my equipment to capture not only audio games, but console games as well. there are tons of fighting games I\u0027d love to record and stream, but can\u0027t due to the lack of a good capture device. Who knows. Maybe I can make enough money to hang out all day and make fun videos for you guys. Wouldn\u0027t that be epic?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA question I get is where does the money go? It allows me to purchase games along with better recording and computer equipment. For example, patreon funds allowed me to purchase the web cam which is now used in all future videos. Patreon funds also helped me travel to Gamer Grace where I was able to host a panel on game accessibility from a blindness perspective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider helping me if you can to make this channel the bes tit can be, and help me spread the message of the importance of accessibility for all.\u003cbr\u003e"
