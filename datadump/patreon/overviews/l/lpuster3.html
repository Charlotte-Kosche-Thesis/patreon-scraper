    "summary": "Hello there, Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I doing on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write stories. Mostly, the stories that I write have a swirl of darkness that corrupts their creamy pages. I am a self-published author and \u00a0my books are currently available on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Louis-Puster-III/e/B004OB5GDW/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a huge fan of the fantasy genre. From books to TV shows to the wonderfully bad fantasy movies from the 80s, I eat it all up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I am out at book signings or conventions, I often get asked, \"What inspired you to write?\" For as far back as my memory goes I have always been telling stories. Not just the white lies that kids tell their parents, but actively engaging others in countless tales about made up worlds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTelling stories for me is something that I simply cannot exist without. Sometimes I think that if my imagination were ever to dry up, I would become nothing but a withered husk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I am focused on a Dark Fantasy series called \u003cem\u003eThe Saga of Ukumog\u003c/em\u003e. The series takes place in a corrupted world where life is hard, magic is rare and dangerous, and the evils that rule the land hate everything, even each other.\u00a0The \u00a0protagonist is an undead man who doesn\u0027t remember much about himself but very quickly he finds himself at odds with the ancient evils that are keep his world stuck in a cage of stagnant corruption.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why am I here on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) I thought about trying to a different platform to support my books, but the idea of having to manage multiple campaigns just to get the work done detracts from the time and energy that I would like to devote to writing. Let\u0027s not dance around this: Creating stories isn\u0027t free. There are a lot of things that need doing in order to bring a story to life, and having a little of extra support in getting that done can make a world of difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) I want a better place to connect with my readers. Any author will tell you that it is an awesome feeling when you know that your words have sparked the imagination of others. Having a place where I can connect with people who are dedicated fans is awesome, and I hope that I create that kind of experience here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven after writing and publishing my stuff for more than 5 years, I am really just getting started on my written journey. The one thing I have discovered is that writing is a very solitary road. Having Patrons who care enough to support my work \u00a0will go a long way to make me feel like I am not in this alone. Thank you ever so much for your support."
