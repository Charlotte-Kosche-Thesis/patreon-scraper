I know you do not know me but that does not stop me from wanting to share these stories with you. There is nothing that would make me happier than to transform the words and images in my head into ink and pigment and breath life into them on paper.\u003cbr\u003eThe stories I am currently telling take place at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://themementocurator.weebly.com\"\u003eMemento Vivere Museum\u003c/a\u003e which\u00a0has many stories to tell through the objects displayed there. I know that for a fact because my journals are full of sketches of those objects alongside questions like: \"what do the Anagram Alchemists do with the letters that are left over?\" and \" What does the Ocean Phoenix like to eat?\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e Aside from spending time at the museum I like to paint other stuff too and sometimes that other stuff turns into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/251993179/hope-postcard-set?ref=shop_home_active_14\"\u003e\u00a0postcards\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/530414813/postcards-to-myself?ref=shop_home_feat_4\"\u003ejournals\u003c/a\u003e and other\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/246267085/the-winter-whisperer-badge-set?ref=shop_home_active_1\"\u003ebits and pieces\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage I can continue on this path of storytelling and painting and possibly see my work published as a whole in a book which would mean the world to me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhoever and wherever you are if at this minute you are reading this, thank you, thank you for spending your time and considering supporting my work.\u003cbr\u003eLove\u003cbr\u003eLily\u003cbr\u003e"
