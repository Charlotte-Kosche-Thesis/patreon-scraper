    "summary": "Native San Franciscan, author, and humorist, SK Morton runs the lousiest walking tour in the City. Now he\u0027s turned his attention to annoying people on a scale befitting the world wide web. Take a listen to \u003cstrong\u003eSK Morton\u0027s Lousy San Francisco Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e and try to guess when SK is lying, telling the truth or just disinterested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those faithful and adoring Throng that have been supporting the podcast through emails, shares on social media, and word of mouth to your more susceptible friends and enemies, we want to give a great big \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!!!\u003c/strong\u003e (Three exclamation points shows we mean business)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who listen and do nothing to support the show, you\u0027re dead to us. But, not unlike the church\u0027s arrangement with purgatory, we\u0027ve got a scheme to save your souls by way of indulgence as well. Enter Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be sure, we are happy to continue to provide our brand of entertainment-like content free of charge. But in an effort to bring even more sub-standard product to the fractional masses we\u0027ve decided to offer some special considerations to those who\u0027d like to support the show monetarily.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve got a lot of plans to improve the show. Unfortunately SK only works 3 hours a day...and not consecutively so we are looking to be able to pay for the kind of help that can facilitate all of the ideas SK hands down from his hobby horse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the attempts we make at a show and are moved to help out, check out the different levels of membership and their rewards. Also, feel free to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.skmorton.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003econtact\u003c/a\u003e us and tell us what you would want to see in order to make a donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all seriousness, SK would like to make sure that co-host Pete Feliciano is taken care of as well as the increasing overhead that goes into the show. \u00a0You can see from the GOALS section that much of what comes from this Patreon campaign will go back into the podcast to grow and make the show more and more enjoyable for both the listening Throng, but also those in the live studio audience. By the way, if you\u0027re in the San Francisco area, be sure to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.skmorton.com/podcast-tickets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eget free tickets\u003c/a\u003e to the podcast and see for yourself how we use our resources. (This feels icky - back to the jokey jokes!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA brief list of ways your donations will be spent:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRent and utilities\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA better spread for the studio audience (Real Oreos and Sushi instead of Duplex Creme Sandwiches and crab food product).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA little something for the crew (Besides the usual inappropriate touching)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelopment and production of high quality souvenirs, knik-knacks, novelties, and limited edition plates from the Bradford exchange\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEquipment upgrades to match our genius ideas like zero gravity interviews and stop motion audio\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvents\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSurgical procedures to remove SK\u0027s skin tabs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSingle engine plane trips to Bogota\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite upgrade and maintenance (To stay one step ahead of the Feds)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSK owes quite a bit to Joel Osteen. (That dude can putt.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to sum up: \u00a0We\u0027re totally indebted to you all for your support and want to thank you. But then we\u0027re like, \"Hey, this costs money\". And you guys are like, \"Yeah?\" \u00a0and we\u0027re all, \"Yeah, could you help us out if we say your name on a podcast that no one listens to?\" and you\u0027re like, \"We\u0027ll see\", and then we go, \"Either way, that\u0027s cool.\" and you\u0027re like \"OK, here\u0027s a dollar now leave me alone\" and we\u0027re all, \"Thank you so much, you\u0027re amaaaaaaaaazing.\" and you guys go, \"Dance monkey\" and we dance and the peasants rejoice."
