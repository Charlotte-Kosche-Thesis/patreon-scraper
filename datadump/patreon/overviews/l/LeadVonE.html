Of the many countless people who set out on the same quest, barely a handful find what they seek. The odds seem insurmountable, but the hero powers on regardless, never uncertain about their eventual victory, paying no heed to the hundreds of distractions that clammer for them to veer off their chosen path. They struggle, they overcome, they emerge victorious. And then they get \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e the girls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese are the kind of stories I like to write. \u003cstrong\u003eMy name is J.M. Coombs. You might also know me as LeadVonE. \u003c/strong\u003eAnd the story above is not only the type of story I like to write, but also the story of my journey so far\u2026 well, the first half anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI started writing fantasy because almost no one was writing the type of story I wanted to read. It seemed that everywhere I looked, fantasy worlds were drab and dreary \u2014 filled with more hopeless suffering than a poverty stricken war zone. The few that weren\u2019t often swung the pendulum far too far in the opposite direction, full of wise-cracking fools who only win in the end because the plot painfully twists the whole fantastical world around them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI enjoy stories that are both fun \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e thoughtful.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is my epic quest \u2014 to write exactly those stories, and for them to be awesome \u2014 not just kinda nice, but really, \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e good \u2014 the kind of books that fix an amused smile on the reader\u0027s face from start to finish, and after several years of sharpening my blade while living off of rice and beans, I believe I\u0027m finally closing in on that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy readers made this happen.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been considering a Patreon program for quite a while now, but I\u2019ve always put it off. \u2018\u003cem\u003eNow\u2019s not the time\u003c/em\u003e\u2019, I told myself. \u2018\u003cem\u003eMy following isn\u2019t big enough\u003c/em\u003e,\u2019 I thought. Or, perhaps the most damning, \u2018\u003cem\u003eMy work isn\u2019t good enough, yet\u003c/em\u003e\u2019 (Yes, I am a recovering perfectionist.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThen, one day, a bunch of readers from one of my hobby projects lit a fire under my arse. They got together and demanded \u2014 yes, \u003cem\u003edemanded\u003c/em\u003e \u2014 that I give them a way to support me. They told me that now \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e the time, that they didn\u2019t care how big my following was, because \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e followed me, and that yes, my work wasn\u2019t just \u2018good enough\u2019 for them, but \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e good that they would gather together and argue with each other over the finest details of plot and character long, long into the night. I finally knew I couldn\u2019t put this off any longer when one of them actually threatened to buy copy after copy of the same book on Amazon if I didn\u2019t find \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e way for him to hand over more money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo\u2026 yeah. Guess it\u2019s time to stop putting this off.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe first goal will be to get me out of the red so I can write full-time without having to worry about basic things like food, water, shelter, internet \u2014 you know, the essentials. \u003cstrong\u003eFrom there, we\u2019ll move upwards to glory\u003c/strong\u003e. All of the goals are focused on one of three things\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e1. Improving the quality of the end product (for example, by hiring a professional artist to do my book covers).\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Finding me more time to write more books, quicker.\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Strengthening the clan by occasionally getting me off this island and out to the places where my readers are more likely to actually hang out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach and every pledge helps towards these goals. The road will be long and hard, but we will get there. Thank you so much for your patronage.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
