    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Lucia Kay. For years, I worked as an editor in the publishing industry in New York, putting off my own writing. Now, I am finally creating my own work. I am so happy that you\u0027ve stumbled on my page, and are considering joining me on my creative journey. Allow me to tell you about my current project, which is a time-traveling romance novel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever wondered how you\u0027ll fare in another time? Celeste woke up and found herself in Tudor England, and the first person she met was Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk and recent widower. Despite her disbelief, his grief, and of course, hundreds of years worth of distance between the two of them, their meeting and subsequent love story just might be the saving grace of both of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have made the first few chapters of the novel open to the public, so feel free to take a look and see if it\u0027s your cup of tea, just like you would when you browse through a real bookstore. If you like it, I hope you will consider supporting me, and my creation of Celeste and Charles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

My hope is to finish the novel by the end of 2017. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me!\u003c/div\u003e",
