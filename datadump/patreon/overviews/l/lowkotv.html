    "summary": "Hello everyone! My name is Simon Heijnen, but on this magical place called the internet I am mostly known as Lowko. I am using Patreon as a way to make my passion for video games into a living and with your help I can support myself while doing what I love to do most and that is to make video content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs you will likely know when you\u0027re reading this, I make YouTube videos on a daily basis and I livestream almost every day as well on Twitch. Pretty much all of them are focused on helping you improve in video games, or at least to have you spend less time doing what you want to do than you would have. Some are focused on purely entertainment, some are focused on helping you improve, but all are done with a passion for creating content. I\u0027ve been doing this for years and recently this has grown into something I want to make my career out of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow you can help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for you to support what I do.\u00a0Once you\u0027ve made a Patreon account, you can pledge me a monthly amount of money and I\u0027ll give you some extras in return. It can be as little as a dollar or as big as you want. You can also set a monthly cap to make sure you don\u0027t go over your budget. If you later decide that it\u0027s not worth it anymore, you can cancel at any time. No hard feelings at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eSimon\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
