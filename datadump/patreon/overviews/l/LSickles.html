    "summary": "I am working to elevate understanding of Basic Income and promote its inclusion in the discourse of issues related to rising economic inequality. My focus is regionally, in the Pacific Northwest; I am a proponent of \"act local\" to create the grassroots infrastructure needed to generate the changes we seek. \u00a0As economic paradigm shifts continue to take place I will draw from research, past and present, to demonstrate the efficacy of Basic Income in my corner of the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition I am a practitioner of methods for Civil Discourse. Everything I work on is done with the purpose of creating more effective dialogue between the stakeholders in our communities. With your support I will be able to partner with other individuals and organizations to promote the ideas behind Basic Income into discussions addressing economic issues that are affecting all our communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy efforts to date have been focused on continuous reading in the areas of Basic Income and Civil Discourse.

It infuriates me to see the barriers that my generation has erected, making it significantly more difficult for those coming after to gain access to the things that many of us took for granted 30-40 years ago. I want them to be able to follow their dreams just like we tell ourselves we can if we try hard enough. I want them to have the freedom to try and fail without being inordinately penalized. I want them to have the freedom to pursue a dream that the status quo says \"you can\u0027t.\" I want them to have the freedom to learn. In my estimation the only vehicle that will afford them, and us, this freedom is a \u003cstrong\u003eBasic Income Guarantee\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
