Creating content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube has decided it doesn\u0027t like what I post anymore because it isn\u0027t \"pretty\" enough and advertiser friendly. But I am not willing to change what you guys love to watch simply to make money on that platform and please them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately that means that I have basically given up my right to earn money and with the amount of time and effort I put into videos I need to be able to find another way to financially survive..so this is my best bet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds raised here will enable me to produce content faster for you and relieve some of the financial stress I am currently facing while I\u0027m still trying to make content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to understand that this isn\u0027t a handout and I don\u0027t want it to ever feel like that for you. What you give I will give back through better, consistent and frequent uploads aswell as the few rewards that I am able to offer you right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to become a patron considering it is for content I have always provided for free, I completely understand and respect your decision to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you do, understand that it means so much to me..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI slaved away and sacrificed alot to be where I am and to bring this incredible community together..a community that enjoys the content I make and allows me to do what I love. And to have that community and lifestyle almost just ripped away from under me really, really, really sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut your help will allow me to keep doing this and it means the absolute fucking world. So from the bottom of my heart..thankyou."
