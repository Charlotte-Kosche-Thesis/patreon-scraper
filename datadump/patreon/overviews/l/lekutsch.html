We set ourselves a challenge: to launch our own company,\nwith the hope of becoming a benchmark in model making and small everyday object design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe story of this project is similar to that of\na screen play writer trying to sell his latest script to a producer. However,\nwhat we are doing is real and not fiction so we decided to opt for Patreons. We\nhope this alternative way of funding will help us to start this new adventure\nand one day enable us to live by what we love doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a daily basis, our job is to design, produce\nand promote unique objects that we have conceptualized. These objects range\nfrom architectural models to\u00a0household objects (lamp, vase, trinket bowl...).\nAll of our work is carefully handcrafted using high quality materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur expertise evolves around two areas of\nactivity:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst, we will fulfill specific mandates,\nmostly architectural models. These models can take the form of either the architectural\nobject in itself or an image used for a specific purpose, such as an exhibition\nor an architectural design competition. Our role involves providing individualized customer support throughout each project,\nas well as ensuring consistency between the original idea and the final result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSecondly,\nwe will launch a research and experimentation workshop. This will include the\nopportunity of training sessions for both individuals and professionals, in the\ncreation and design of a range of unique daily objects. The workshops will\nallow participants to fully catalyse and materialize our experience to date in\nobject design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nwould like to thank you in advance for helping us to reach our goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nValerio\nSartori and Benjamin Bousquet\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
