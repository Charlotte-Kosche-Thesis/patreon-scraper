    "summary": "Hello there dear visitors. I\u0027m very glad you\u0027ve donated some of your time to view my patreon page. I\u0027ve been creating art ever since I can remember, and some decade ago I decided to showcase it to the world using art sites, like DeviantART. I\u0027ve long since learned that creating artwork just for private purposes isn\u0027t any way to do it any justice, as it is supposed to spread to other viewers and make them happy and able to see the beautify of the world around them. Art happens when the artwork makes contact with the viewer.\u003cbr\u003eThis page allows you to become a part of my artistic journey and help me grow as an artist and designer. It acts an impuls for me to improve and shows me people are really interested and support what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do the patron rewards include none of your commissioned pieces sketches, wips and finished pieces, or sketches, wips and finished commercial architectural designs [done for your employer or private client] ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs much as I\u0027d love to show you all the artwork and design I create, the wellfare and privacy of my client is my priority and I cannot post those things without their leave. Because they are my clients, they have the privellege to be the first to see and discuss the artwork/design they are paying for. I shall post these sketches, wips and commissions here after showing them to the commissioner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on numerous sites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://milewska-commissions.weebly.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://milewska-commissions.weebly.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://milewska.weebly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://milewska.weebly.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ladyfromeast.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.ladyfromeast.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/ladyfromeast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/ladyfromeast/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://beta.furrynetwork.com/ladyfromeast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://beta.furrynetwork.com/ladyfromeast/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ladyfromeast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/ladyfromeast/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/imilewska\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://picarto.tv/imilewska\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imilewska.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://imilewska.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAnd many others, check out my weebly site for more."
