I am a London-based \u003cstrong\u003esinger-songwriter, composer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sing, play the keys and the bass guitar, I create musical arrangements and record my tracks in my little home studio, \u003cstrong\u003edoing all these things mostly alone.\u003c/strong\u003e My main genre is \u003cstrong\u003eBR Rock \u003c/strong\u003e(Bedroom Rock) because my studio is situated in my bedroom and I produce my compositions there, but as an open-minded indie composer, I like to make an excursion in various musical styles (e.g. pop, jazz-rock, hip-hop, classical music, etc.) building them into my music. Maybe, I\u0027m a bit eclectic but this makes my songs special. My motto is, \u003cstrong\u003edare to be different, dare to be creative!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen finally a song is ready to publish, then I submit it to Horus Music Ltd and this record label starts distributing my song worldwide ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_9Lu70amlg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbsq1XdgWi4 ) in the best stores and platforms like Spotify, iTunes, Deezer, VEVO and so on. \u003cbr\u003eIn a nutshell, that\u0027s me and what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd now, let me tell you something about the reasons why I\u0027m here on Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I\u0027d like to reveal and share with you that \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ve\nbeen writing music and lyrics for over 30 years and I don\u2019t fancy\ndoing anything else in the next 30 years.\u003c/strong\u003e I am absolutely committed and passionate about creating music for the world but \u003cstrong\u003eI have arrived at a point where I have to ask for financial help. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUntil now, I have paid my costs from my own pocket\u003c/strong\u003e working 40-50 hours per\u003cbr\u003eweek at a company \u003cstrong\u003ebut since last year everything has changed,\u003c/strong\u003e my songs are constantly\u003cbr\u003epublished worldwide and I am not able to work as much as before. \u003cstrong\u003eI need to spend more time\u003cbr\u003ewith music production but my royalties from the releases are almost zero at the moment.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeside my monthly living costs, \u003cstrong\u003eI must persistently develop my studio installations and music instruments, have to spend loads of money for photo shoots, art works and music videos. And I still did not mention the costs of promotion which make a song release very expensive but without paid adverts and radio plays, there is no significant selling.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, I really need your help right now to keep my music career going. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\nso excited that you have found my Patreon page and are interested in\u003cbr\u003e\njoining\nmy community of music-loving patrons. \u003cstrong\u003eAs my patron, you will get access\u003cbr\u003eto my songs, art works and music videos, as well as some customized ones I\u2019ve\nmade\u003cbr\u003e\nespecially\nfor you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, if you are able to invest in my music, please, be my patron and support me with a small amount per month.
