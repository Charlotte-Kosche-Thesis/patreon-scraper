I was born on October 1st, 1997, and I love love LOVE ice cream! Living in NC made me realize that I don\u0027t have to continue the rest of my life in one spot. I wanted to explore my boundaries, focus more on my career, and go meet people somewhere open and new! Also it\u0027s not really a good working area for me with a house full of people. Moving to Texas for college is I huge opportunity to improve on my artwork, get to know my kouahi\u0027s better by going to conventions, and try out new things! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe list of possibilities are endless with my rewards! However, the rewards will only get better with your support. Let\u0027s be honest, I would love to give out some wicked rewards, and ship them directly to you! However, my resources are a bit over my budget, and I have to take on some responsibility with bills, adulting, stuff like that. That doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t put in some effort with my gifts! For now, I will be giving away prints, stickers, and buttons! The more this parteon grows, the more stuff I can give away with some amazing qualities!~\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could ramble on in the future, but there\u0027s work to do! By work, I mean my next personal project. Thank you so much for the support! This will be a personal journey on how I will face challenges, test my skills, and most importantly, treat everyone with respect!~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more about me, please follow me on these sites!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube Art Channel:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGnifR9i1bAbco_3Xwh3tnw?view_as=subscriber\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGnifR9i1bAbco_3X...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Loli_Senpai9?lang=en\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Loli_Senpai9?lang=en\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Lolisenpai9/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/Lolisenpai9/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lolisenpai9/?hl=en\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/lolisenpai9/?hl=en\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
