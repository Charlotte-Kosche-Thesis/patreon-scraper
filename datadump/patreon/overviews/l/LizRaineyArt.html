You may follow me for my wrestling writing and podcasts, including Wrestling Rumors. You may also know me from my photography I used to do (and hopefully with the help of this get back into.) A few of you may know me from my art. This is what led me to make this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I drop out of school. I used to do a little blogging here, but I was a fine arts major. By the end of my last semester, I decided to do a double major in Fine Arts and Graphic Design. A lot of teachers were telling to explore the digital side and it didn\u0027t work. So currently, I am freelancing and teaching myself. While as long as that, I\u0027m doing designs with my friends\u0027 companies. As well as that, I\u0027m a colorist for a few of my comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eMy Art\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike I said, I\u0027ve been doing art for a long time. I started doing fan art and that hasn\u0027t really end. I do a lot of portraits and tattoo designs. Like any artists, I like to expand different media and designs. So I go through a mixture of stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s all the supplies I used. My main is pencils, watercolor, watercolor pencils, colored pencil, pens, and acrylic paint. I also used occasionally watercolor pastels, pastels, and charcoal. I want to also experiment into some more ink related art and digital art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI begin to digital art to explore graphic design and colorist. I do most of it on iPad Pro and on an app called Procreate. Any of my graphic design stuff is mainly done on Adobe Illustrator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhat my Patreon will benefit to you\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eExclusive art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eOne of the things I want to give back to you is exclusive art. For supporting me, you will get designs only showed here. You will be able to have access to request designs. You will even have to be input of designs. Some of these levels are all based around you. You will see my own work but this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBehind the scenes/teaching\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ve wanted to do this for a while. I\u0027m going to show you how a simple outline becomes a beauty piece. You will also see some of the process I learned in college and high school. I learned a ton throughout my years. You get to experience that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJourney\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m still working as an artist.

I\u0027ve spent more than about $200 for this semester. Last semester, I estimate about $400 for how much I spent on supplies. This doesn\u0027t also include personal stuff I buy. I try to use the top notch supplies to bring our quality in my art. it\u0027s killer to keep up. Now not doing so much college, I picked up doing so much extra work to keep up on my supply budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eProjects\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThere is a ton A TON of ideas I have. I have a couple ideas with ink portraits, digital art, a lot of comic design ideas. I\u0027m always doing art. I go through periods of not. But I\u0027m always posting here updates. No matter what level you are, you will get what I am doing. Even maybe to get to be apart of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSupport\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSupport is key in this.
