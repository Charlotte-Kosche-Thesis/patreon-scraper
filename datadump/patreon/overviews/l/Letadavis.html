If you\u2019ve ever wanted to directly support an artist whose work you love... then Welcome. Kip and all my cartoons are yours to enjoy free on IG and FB. Now they are here, on Patreon, also. As of 2/1/18... to see the hundreds I have already done go to IG.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKip sprung from the ethers in March 2017. My husband David died suddenly in January and in my grief this amazing creature was hatched. Kip was soon joined by Pottie Mouth and the adventures began. I have made daily comics since and have several hundred now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere at Patreon you can join my team: The Makers and Growers of Kip and Pottie Comics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, I am the maker and you are the grower. You fertilize the crops of comics that spring forth onto the digital stage by making the list below happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order of priority your support means:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) I\u00a0can teach fewer hours. (By day I teach violin... plus I perform)\u003cbr\u003e2)\u00a0I have more time to work on my cartoons for IG, books, magazines and animation. \u003cbr\u003e3) I hire an assistant (temporary at first) for book and website development as well as Shopify and Printful merch developer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4) I travel so Kip has cultural inspiration from more people, places and things.\u003cbr\u003e.....\u00a0also squeezed in there are groceries, health insurance, art supplies and studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI value your participation in my journey and deeply thank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeta"
