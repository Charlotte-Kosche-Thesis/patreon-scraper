I\u0027m creating erotic comics, sex-positive with a progressive bent and strong female leads. My current comic is called Queen of Autumn; it\u0027s a sort of fantasy/comedy/character drama with a lot of girl-on-girl sex in it. Sound interesting? Check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lordburlap.deviantart.com/gallery/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy DeviatArt profile\u003c/a\u003e if you want to see it; you\u0027ll find more of my work there, too. WARNING! NSFW!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this Patreon is to fund the continued creation of this comic for the foreseeable future. Art assets for the digital suite I use cost money, as does better computer equipment so I can render images more quickly. Putting this comic together takes a pretty significant amount of time, too, and while I really enjoy making it, I\u0027d love for it to find an audience and to find a way to pay for itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSexy comics! Regardless of the level you pledge, you get sexy comics; the level of your pledge mostly affects the cadence at which you get them, and any bonus extra goodies. Let\u0027s look at the pledge levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $1 per month, you get the patrons-only feed, which will include some members-only polls that\u0027ll allow you some influence over the story, the sex scenes, and the assets I buy for the comic (polls will go live when I hit my first goal, mostly because I want a decent number of people in here so I can get good poll results). You\u0027ll also get each volume in PDF as I finish it, and each individual chapter, too. For context, a chapter is somewhere between 10 and 20+ pages long. A volume contains multiple chapters, and is an entire story arc. I\u0027m going to shoot for one chapter a month, but I\u0027m honestly not sure if I\u0027ll hit that consistently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $5, you get each individual page, in high-rez jpeg, as I finish them. You also get everything in the $1 level. Given that I can reasonably reliably produce 1-2 pages per week, that means you get 1-2 content drops per week for $5 per month. You\u0027ll also get some of my\u00a0behind-the-scenes thoughts on the process of making this thing, musings on technique, and so forth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $7, you get some bonus content. When I create pages, I\u0027m often using cropped versions of larger images, and there are images I render that I don\u0027t wind up using. The bonus content is basically that stuff plus, if I make a cool render for fun that doesn\u0027t go in the comic, I\u0027ll drop that in the feed too. It\u0027s more sexy stuff that exists outside the comic itself, basically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill there be any free content?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome. There is, for example,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/wfbarhukx8eps2h/Queen%20of%20Autumn%20Teaser.pdf?dl=0\"\u003ea free teaser PDF for Queen of Autumn\u003c/a\u003e available right now, which includes the cover and the first 11 pages of Volume 1. My\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lordburlap.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantArt account\u00a0\u003c/a\u003ealso has a bunch of free, sexy pictures, and I\u0027ll post Queen of Autumn teaser images there periodically, too. These\u0027ll be teasers, though: images specifically designed to make you want more. So there\u0027s that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long is this comic going to run?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNot sure yet, but probably a while. I\u0027m dividing it up into volumes, and each volume is divided up into chapters; right now I\u0027ve got arcs for about five volumes planned. \u00a0That\u0027s a fair bit of sexy, sexy content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you update?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs often as I can. Practically speaking, I can reliably create two to three pages per week if I\u0027m on top of my game, more if I\u0027m really humming. I\u0027m not going to hold myself to that kind of schedule at first, though I will commit to releasing at least one page per week unless some life event comes up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill there be more comics?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMaybe! I really like making this stuff, and Queen of Autumn has run away with my imagination lately. Once it\u0027s run its course, it\u0027s entirely possible I\u0027ll transition into a new story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \"progressive erotica\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, my comics will be sexy, and feature lots of sex, but they have a social conscience. My characters have agency within their lives; many of them are powerful, independent women, and much of the sex will focus squarely on female pleasure. I consider myself a feminist, so I\u0027m going to do everything I can to keep these comics from getting to exploitative. Sexy = good! Sexist = bad!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy progressive erotica?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI need to start by explaining a little about myself. I\u0027m a bisexual man who happens to be really into female pleasure. I also find a lot of emotional satisfaction in queer relationships. Exploitative porn, porn that focuses overmuch on the male gaze, doesn\u0027t really appeal to me, nor does porn that focuses primarily on the guy getting his jollies off. I need the emotional component, and I also tend to like the component of female pleasure. So, basically, I\u0027m making erotica I\u0027d want to read. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u0027s important for erotica to approach sex in a progressive, accepting way, because otherwise it risks becoming exploitative. So my comic is sex-positive, inclusive, queer, and operates on the fundamental assumption that we\u0027re all equals and shouldn\u0027t be judged for our sexual proclivities, as long as everything\u0027s consensual and nobody brings anyone else harm. So that\u0027s why.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the pitch for Queen of Autumn?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQueen of Autumn is about Erika, a young woman who makes her way into the Twilight Realm during a dream. In this dream, she pledges herself to Isolde, the Queen of Autumn, as a knight and vassal, for reasons she doesn\u0027t fully understand. They consummate the pact with physical intimacy (the oldest magic there is), at which point Erika wakes up in her own world, confused, shaken, and thoroughly exhausted. Hijinx ensue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re posting it all to DeviantArt, why should I pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo make sure the comic continues to be made! Also, I\u0027m not posting it \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to DeviantArt. I\u0027ll continue posting stuff to DeviantArt, but the Queen of Autumn pages over there are a teaser; I\u0027m releasing the rest to patrons here. I may publish collected volumes in some other way down the road, but for right now, Patreon is where you go if you want to find out what happens to Erika and Isolde.\u003cbr\u003e"
