    "summary": "Hello Patreon, my name is Leha Med and we are shooting the series together with the geezers; but first of all, I\u0027ll tell you about myself, I live in Russia, here I do my art. \u003cbr\u003eI got fame by participating in performances on the off-line rap battle platform \"VERSUS battle\". \u003cbr\u003eOnce I got in a creative environment, I tried myself in different formats: Musical - rap tracks, from shocking to satirical and social, at the moment I am writing the album, Blogging - vlogs, analytical reviews of conflicts and battles, interviews. \u003cbr\u003eThere are 65 thousand subscribers on my youtube channel. \u003cbr\u003eMy stream\u0027s online reached up to 3500 people. \u003cbr\u003eWhy did I come to Patreon? Because I want to create my own art. \u003cbr\u003eI consider it to be my profession and to devote it most of my time. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, unfortunately, the mentality of the YouTube community in Russia is strikingly different from the European and Western ones. \u003cbr\u003ePeople in Russia, for the major part, do not want to help financially to the creative people and believe that paying for content is not right. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you will sit and talk with one of them, explain about the needs and necessities, about ambitions and goals, about why a creative person, like any other, needs money. \u003cbr\u003eThen almost always they will change their point view. There is not enough life to talk to everyone. But I can\u0027t imagine myself without art. \u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I appeal to you, via the Patreon website, my foreign friends. \u003cbr\u003eWhy do I need money? The series that I began to shoot haven\u0027t found their audience yet. \u003cbr\u003eSince the most awaited content on my channel is about rap and rappers. \u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m not going to give up, I want to create a series, create a purely creative content, \u003cbr\u003eImprove it, buy equipment, pay my friends who help me and spend their time for it. I want to buy pizza for them on shooting, shoot them on a good camera in interesting rented and not only places. \u003cbr\u003eTo devote it more time, to self-develop and train, so we will visualize our common ideas in high-quality video content. \u003cbr\u003eTo devote yourself to art is my dream and I adamantly go to it for many years. It\u0027s hard - but I love it. \u003cbr\u003eOn the path of any creative person, especially in Russia, there are many difficulties, one of them is the lack of money. \u003cbr\u003eI address you, Friends, and ask to help me on the way to my dream. Thank you and enjoy every new day!"
