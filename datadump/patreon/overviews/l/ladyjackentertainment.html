    "summary": "Oh gosh. These things. This is the Patreon page for Lady Jack Entertainment, which is essentially synonymous with me (Creative Director Lindsey Marks) but is a net which I hope will catch funds for my collaborations with many other creatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off about me...I\u0027m the person who wants to manifest visually stunning darkly beautiful imagery and then also be the person who parodies that. The work that I create runs the range between whatever I feel like making happen and whatever I feel like making happen. I\u0027m an actor/dancer/choreographer/burlesquer/writer/flowercrown maker and I slap all of that together to create work that blends performance genres.\u00a068% of my work infuses comedy. The rest of it is straight erte all day. I have a thing for vintage and for cirque styles, but I also tend to wear flannel shirts most days and boy oh boy do I love to explore stories about AI. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I openly collaborate with many performers and other content creators as I see fit (and I mean...I\u0027m an actor so I\u0027ll act in your thing too) I do have a few go-tos...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you like Greg Inda? This page will help fund my photographic collaborations with him BOTH as an subject but also a creative director for shoots that may or may not have my face in them. Like I want to do this weird still life project with odd scenes that make you wonder \"Who The Fuck Is This Person That Would Have These Objects\", but I also have big plans for a photo series with emotions stemming from Betrayal Trauma represented as human abstractions that will be darkly visceral. We also make these weird comedic short films and we\u0027ll make more of that. He used to be an improviser type you know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you like the work I\u0027ve created with Stephanie Schultz and Andy Ramsey? Well. We want to make much much more together, and with the work I need to fund that with the big bucks. Those projects tend to need investors, a kickstarter, etc, but if I can make my way on patreon towards those goals, or if patreon can help make those things a reality I would be overjoyed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you like Fringe Factor Dance (my group with Eva la Feva, Tila von Twirl, Po\u0027 Chop and the occasional Jeez Loueez?) As we create new content I will be making videos of our choreography and this page will help support the costuming and any space rental that goes into that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you like the work I do in Burlesque and Variety entertainment land? I will continue to be creating work in that realm, and much of that will cross over into photo and video content creation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a big believer in crowd-support. I worked for the Arts and Business Council for years and it gave me a lot of insight into the business of making art and I\u0027ve launched a few kickstarters over the years. The non-profit organization model is not right for all people, and it certainly doesn\u0027t fit the open-ended project to project work, especially if you are more of an individual making that happen. Some fans can only support with likes and loves, and some can support financially at various levels. I think it\u0027s amazing to allow that flow into the way we do business. I thank you in advance for being part of this, even if you are just reading this and can\u0027t contribute. Any support is valued.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s the breakdown on creating content and whatchu get? I\u0027ll start by saying I have no idea how many of you are going to jump in on this! I will be making content regardless and you backers will get extra love in special ways you can see in the reward section.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ideal situation? Well. like 5k a month, I wrangle my collaborators into some serious ongoing content creation. For now, I have some baby goals that will still help me enormously!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
