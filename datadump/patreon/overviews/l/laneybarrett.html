I am a homeschooling mama, a planner girl, and a blogger. I have an academic soul, and I love to learn new things. With this, I\u0027ve acquired a wealth of knowledge and skills that I\u0027d like to share and teach to you as well. A while back, I listened to a podcast that referred to the Parable of the Talents - and how they were invested and multiplied. I believe God has given me a lot of \"talents\", and I just want to use them to make something to give back to Him. I want to be used by Him for his own glory. I believe God has given me a vision for the future, and I have to be intentional and do my part to get there and take my steps of obedience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically this is me creating a job for myself, doing what I love to do. Planning. While I realize that not everyone will be a planner to the extent that I am, I believe that I can help, encourage, and hopefully inspire others to be intentional with their lives and plan it purposfully, instead of just letting life happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBy becoming a patron, you will receive exlusive content, information, \u0026amp; resources - all related to purposeful planning and being more intentional with your life. You will be supporting me, my blog, my family, and the vision that God has given us to help others reach their full potential.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDepending on the level you choose, Here\u0027s what I have in store for you as a patron!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eFollower \u0026amp; Subscriber Freebies as they are Released\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nMonthly Challenges for Intentional \u0026amp; Purposeful Planning in your Life\u003cbr\u003e\nAccess to an Exclusive Purposeful Planning Facebook Group with Me\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nWeekly Discussions on the Topic We are Working Through for the Month in our Private Group\u003cbr\u003e\nQ\u0026amp;A with me on all things Planning \u0026amp; Intentionality-Related\u003cbr\u003e\nPlanner Consulting - Finding the Perfect Planner for your Lifestyle \u0026amp; Personality Type\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
