    "summary": "What started as a way to practice reading for voiceover work has taken on a life of it\u0027s own.\u00a0Since 2009, I have been going places you didn\u0027t want to know about, wouldn\u0027t want in your browsing history or wouldn\u0027t want to admit you had a curiosity about and reading them for you. The subjects range from the mundane to the profane and, quite honestly, insane. Once or twice a month I venture out into the internet and return with a new world of weirdness for you. Be it the world of adult babies, religious nuts, political kooks, sexual deviants of all shapes \u0026amp; kinks, gang members, people who are sad about what they got for Christmas one time or people who share stories of their best \u0026amp; worst drug experiences. The internet is an amazing world of oversharing with total strangers and honestly, without that oversharing I wouldn\u0027t be doing this! \u00a0I will be using the funds supplied by listeners to help me continue to upgrade my recording set up and most potentially hire someone to do the editing of my show. The audio editing for my show is typically 2-3x the length of the original recording session and is huge time drain for me. Ideally if enough people donate I will be able to pay someone to take over this task for me. My hope is that this would allow me more time to devote to seeking more wonderfully crazy content for you to endure. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, if you want a free Lou Reads magnet just send me an email!"
