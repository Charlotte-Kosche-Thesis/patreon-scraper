So far I have four books out in the world: Hold Me Closer, Necromancer; Necromancing the Stone; Firebug; and Pyromantic (March 2017). I have also published several short stories in collections, journals, and online at Tor.com. Speaking of Tor.com, I write a book recommendation post on their called Necessary Whimsy! Hold Me Closer, Necromancer was nominated for the YALSA William C. Morris Award, and won the Scandiuzzi Children\u0027s Book Award. My books have been on the American Library Association\u0027s Best Book for Young Adults list and get put on reluctant readers lists all the time. There really is nothing better than knowing that my books get kids and teens interested in reading...and occasionally give adults nightmares.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSo if I\u0027m doing so well, why are we here? Publishing is a slow and lumbering beast. It takes a long time for things to come out once they are sold, and paychecks for me follow no reliable schedule. This is basically the dialogue I\u0027ve had since I sold my first book:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: Will I get paid this year?\u003cbr\u003ePublishing: I don\u0027t know! Let\u0027s find out!\u003cbr\u003eMe: Weeee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no qualms with my publisher and I don\u0027t plan to stop working with them, but right now I have to have a day job to survive, and it slows down my writing. I also work as an indie bookseller so...well, we\u0027re not exactly talking fancy livin\u0027, you know? I publish, I work freelance, I have a day job, but there are some weeks where I wonder if we will be able to make rent. And I don\u0027t even want to get into the soul-crushing fun that is student loans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO...WHY PATREON AGAIN?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere\u0027s another reason why I want to give this a go. The fun reason is that this seems like a great way to get short fiction pieces that I\u0027ve wanted to work on FOR-EV-VOR into the hands of readers quickly. Patreon means that in exchange for small monthly support from readers, I get to toss fun tidbits and new stories your way. It\u0027s sort of like the barter system, but digital and with less chickens*.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLish McBride\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*For some reason I connect chickens with the barter system, even though it could really be any kind of livestock. Or waffles. Which would be less convenient than money, but far more delicious.\u003cbr\u003e"
