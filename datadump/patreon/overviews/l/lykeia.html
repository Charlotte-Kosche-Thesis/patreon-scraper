    "summary": "It is with affirmation of my devotion and adoration to gods, especially Apulu, Artumes and Turan\u00a0that I have been devoted to creating tools for facilitating worship of Etruscan, Hellenic and Roman worship. Largely, I create for the necessity to create. I am driven towards it unendingly. This means that not only do I have to work an outside job to support my family but also to support this unceasing push fueled by my devotion and service. I spend hours outside of the eight hour work day absorbed in my various devotional crafts and writings. I also maintain a shrine room that is accessible to the public on festival days and by appointment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work, outside of my own free publicly accessible areas has been found as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA painting of Hekate in an issue of the magazine Sage Woman around 2008 or 2009\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArticles in various devotional anthologies published Neos Alexandria\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA book of my early devotional poems published by Asphodel as Hymns from the Temple\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSelf-publication of Crowned with Nine Rays (a volume dedicated to the worship of Apollon but which is now defunct and being revised into a series of booklets)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArticle A Regional Conflict in Religiosity in the second issue of Walking the Worlds\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSeveral donated paintings (still ongoing with many more to come) for the prayer cards put out by Galina Krasskova: to date includes Iuno Sospites, Apollon Karneios, and Serapis.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSelf-publication of The Name of Apollon and Before The Doors: A Household Worship of Apollon at Createspace, the first two of a series of booklets regarding the philosophy, history and worship of the god.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As I would be like to be able to devote more of my time towards these ends, and have not only the time but also the funds available to make special product blends and services related to the aiding worshipers of Etruscan, Hellenic and Roman \u00a0gods \u00a0I am happy to reward an exchange of service to patrons. Each level of patronage will have its own rewards which will include but not be limited to closed audience posts and poems early released weeks ahead of time for patrons only, special products and offers, access to non-watermarked original art that can be printed by patrons, as well as other perks as they come to me.\u003cbr\u003eI will put up at least one post per month  on my account. It goes unsaid, the more patrons I have the more it frees up for more posts of writings, poems and creating new blends which I will offer as samples from my Botanica.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI thank patrons for any small measure of support that you can give whether it is a dollar a month or more! A most sincerest thank you!"
