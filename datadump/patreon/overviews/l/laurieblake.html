But creating the stories are only part of it! I love being able to have an audience, to see how people react to my tales, see what they enjoy, what speaks to them. That\u0027s why I give away the books I\u0027m working on for free, releasing five thousand words a week of each book and letting anyone enjoy them. Every week I think of those reading and it inspires me to keep going, to keep writing and creating new and exciting stories for them to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you appreciate my work and want me to keep going too, then this Patreon can let you give me a small amount to give me that freedom. By being my audience, you let me share my work. By giving me a couple of dollars a month, you afford me time enough to create work to share. On top of that, my goals are there to improve the experience of everyone, and my rewards give you what I can to show my appreciation back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, not everyone can donate. My core services won\u0027t change, and you can still support me by leaving nice comments on the various places I share my work, and by showing it to other people! If you know anyone who might enjoy my stories, then by sharing it with them you support me just as much as paying me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and most of all, please enjoy! \u003cbr\u003e"
