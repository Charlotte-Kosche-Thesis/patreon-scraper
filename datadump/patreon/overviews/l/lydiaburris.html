    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eINTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, and REASONS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am an imaginer, a collector, a\ndreamer... just like you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a creator, I easily become obsessed\nwith the nonsense, the experimental and the other worldly.\u003cbr\u003e\nI love to connect with people on a\ncreative physical level, and find utmost joy in spontaneous delights.\nI am always and forever trying new things in the studio. Being a\nteacher as well, I often experiment with new ways to open creative\nminds and expose my students to unexpected methods, materials and\nsubjects. Because of this I SAVE EVERYTHING. Materials as well as\ncreative experiments. Bits and pieces that become magic when\nseparated and taken out of context. Ephemera, combined with cut text,\nmixed with painted color and imagery suddenly become a talisman of\nimagination and dreaming. I want to share this passion with you, as\nwell as create a fluid environment where my collection can flow out\nof my space and into yours, allowing me to bring new different things\nin my studio. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lydiaburris.com/extras/studiopicjune2016.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEarlier in 2016, I sent out crazy mail\nenvelopes to about 70 people, filled with a newsletter, miscellaneous\nthings from my studio, bits of my art palette, stickers, swag, mini\nprints, and etcetera. Some of them had hand written notes inside.\nSome of them were so thick they required an extra stamp!\u003cbr\u003e\nI got tremendous feedback and found it\nso exciting to fill envelopes and send them off. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was perhaps a trial run for what I\nwant to do here, with this patreon. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI did not want to begin this patreon\nunless I felt I had something different or interesting to offer in\nreturn. After the feedback I got from the initial crazymail\nsend-outs, I realized this would be it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lydiaburris.com/extras/crazymailsm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support and interest in\nrandom artistic postage and my art, Not only will I be able to\nhappily fulfill my love of spontaneous creative correspondence, but\nit will help to fund my artistic pursuits. I am currently in the\nprocess of creating a new strange little art book in color, and I so\ndesperately wish to travel out west for inspiration and new\nexperiences to feed my bean. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for coming on this\njourney with me. I hope you will enjoy your crazy mail\ncorrespondence, and watching my progress and process. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e--- A NOTE ON CHARGES and OFFERS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese offers are subject to change in\nthe future as I become able to offer new things. If you have a\nrequest, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask!\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon support will be a monthly\ncharge, at the beginning of a month. Sign up or cancel anytime with\nno obligations. Mail will be sent out *after the first of the month,\nonce charges have been applied. If you cancel before the beginning of\na month, you will not be charged and you will not receive anything.\nIf you want crazymail but can only afford a stamp, send ME some\ncrazymail and chances are you will get crazymail in return! \u003cbr\u003eMy public studio address is 212 W. 10th St. Suite A-250, Indianapolis, IN. 46202. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** I will\nsend out crazymail once per month.**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e--- A NOTE ON CONTENT: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the art I do is of a surreal and dark nature. Crazy mail content will most likely be a mix of light and dark themes, sometimes heavy psychological ponderings and/or the occasional *artistic* nude (but I won\u0027t post any of those on the patreon blog due to the rules of visibility).\u003cbr\u003eSEE MY WEBSITE TO BROWSE MY WORK: \u003ca href=\"http://lydiaburris.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://lydiaburris.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** If you are wanting to get snail mail of a more light hearted and G rated nature, this is possible. Just make sure to send a message and I will make note by your address. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** You *will* be allowed to choose between a selection of artworks before I\n send them, unless you want to be surprised! I want to make sure \neveryone is pleased with their pieces.
