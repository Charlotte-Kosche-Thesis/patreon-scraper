    "summary": "Hi guys!\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd welcome to my\nlittle piece of heaven, my place for peace of mind and creativity,\n\u003cstrong\u003eour glitter revolution\u003c/strong\u003e. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a place\nwhere I pour my heart into songs and videos and words and share them\nwith you. And then I listen to what you have to say and together we\nwill make this world a little bit better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA while ago I\nstumbled across the TED talk with Amanda Palmer, where she talks\nabout the \u003cstrong\u003eart of asking\u003c/strong\u003e and that led me here. That talk really cut\nthrough the screen and into my heart because it was like she was\ntalking about me. I\u0027ve toured and played with so many people around\nthe world. I\u0027ve borrowed you gear, eaten your food and met your\nfamilies and slept on your floors and, even more crazy, I\u0027ve slept in\nyour actual beds whilst you\u00b4ve been on the floor, which is insanely\nkind and generous. You\u0027ve put on shows with my bands because you love\nthe music and \u003cstrong\u003eI truly love you for that. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI live in Sweden now\nand I haven\u0027t toured or actually done much at all for a while because\nof my mental health problems. For all my life I have been unable to\nkeep a normal full time job because of  my depressions and anxiety\nand other stuff. The only time I\u0027ve been able to do anything full\ntime has been when I\u0027ve been doing music. Those short days or weeks\nwhen I\u0027ve been recording or touring and just focusing on creating has\nbeen little pieces of heaven for my mind. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI just thought,\nwhy not try and \u003cstrong\u003ecreate that little piece of heaven\u003c/strong\u003e? Why try and fit\ninto someone elses idea of how a person should be and live? I\u0027m on\nsick/unemployment benefits right now so I\u0027ve got absolutely nothing\nto let go off, nothing holding me back, nothing to sacrifice. I guess\nthat doesnt make me very brave but I do feel really scared and\nexcited about doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m asking for\nyour help\u003c/strong\u003e. Even if you don\u0027t know me, or if I\u0027ve slept on your floor\nor met your cat. Help me believe that \u003cstrong\u003ethere is still so much good and\nlove left in the world\u003c/strong\u003e. Right now I feel like there is jut hate and\ndistrust and \"whats in it for me\" and profits, but we can change that. You and me.\nThere is still space in the world for love and art and creativity and\nkindness. So I\u0027m asking you to join me in this glitter revolution.\nHelp me create that little piece of heaven, and I will do my very\nbest to inspire and allow differencies and collaborate with you and\njust spread as much love as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what is this?\nHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s not very\ncomplicated. I will make things \u2013 mostly \u003cstrong\u003esongs \u003c/strong\u003ebut I might do other\nthings because I want this to be a place where my creativity can run\nwild! I will make them to the best of my ability and they will all be\noriginal work. You contribute per song and not by month, which allows\nme to look after my depressions and my anxiety disorder without being\ntotally stressed out. I will try and make one song per month, but\nsome months there might be two songs and some months there might be\nnone. You can still cap your monthly contribution if you want, to\nmake sure you don\u0027t have to pay millions if I go on a massive song\nwriting spree (not likely, but hey, you never know!). Some of the\nsongs I write might be rerecorded and/or released on other media (like Bandcamp or Spotify), but they will always be free or on a pay what you want basis. And you will always find them here on Patreon first!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me\nyou will \u2013 in addition to the songs \u2013 have access to the Patreon\nOnly Feed. This is where I will show you how it all happen. There\nwill be \u003cstrong\u003ewords, videos\u003c/strong\u003e where I will let you guys into my world and\nmind, maybe \u003cstrong\u003eadditional songs and covers and goofing around\u003c/strong\u003e. Like a\nmultimedia diary. \u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t actually know what I\u0027m doing\u003c/strong\u003e and that is\namazing. I can do anything! The important thing is that\nyou can be a part of it. Let\u0027s talk. Let\u0027s come up with new ideas and\nchange the world together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYou get to choose\nhow much you want to contribute with, which I think is wonderful.\nThat\u0027s how you should pay for everything in the world; if you\u0027re poor\nyou should pay less and if you\u0027re rich you should pay more. Here, I\nwill trust you guys to \u003cstrong\u003epay what you think it\u0027s worth\u003c/strong\u003e. It doesn\u0027t\nmatter if it\u0027s $2 or $200000, I am so grateful for every little\nbit!!! However, if you do decide to contribute with a bit more, I\nwill make more stuff for you. Or, if you don\u0027t have any money at all, some of the posts here will be public and I\u0027m just excited that you\nare here reading. This is not a demand, this is a way for you to support me IF YOU WANT TO.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI always want \u003cstrong\u003emore\ngigs\u003c/strong\u003e! Hit me! In addition to my \u201dnormal\u201d gigs I do a show called\nRainbow Rebels for young persons who are not men to make them believe\nin themselves and start making music. I also do \u003cstrong\u003eworkshops \u003c/strong\u003ein songwriting.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to \u003cstrong\u003ebook\nshows and/or have other questions\u003c/strong\u003e or just want to write something\nthat you don\u0027t want public on this page, please send me an email\n\u003cstrong\u003elisalidehall (a) gmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\nFollow me on\ninstagram @lisabouviermusic and/or like my facebook page /lisabouviermusic\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to \u003cstrong\u003eget to know\nme a bit better\u003c/strong\u003e before you join my glitter revolution?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eListen to some of my\nprevious songs and other bands on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/lisabouvier/playlist/4Y1EYjgATf7SoErnWjKTgf\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOr watch a few videos to see what I\u0027m all about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLisa Bouvier\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mp4A6E1FkIE\" width=\"854\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuards!
