    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Luka! You might know me from Instagram or Facebook or as \"that one with the antlers.\" If you don\u0027t, well... There\u0027s absolutely nothing interesting for you here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuka Ghost is my art, my alter-ego, my life mission and my ultimate labor of love. Luka Ghost is also purely a side project and a general money sink. I\u0027m fortunate to have a day job that I enjoy, and it pays for all of my basic needs. I\u0027ve generally been able to fund my drag with what I earn from working overtime hours, but that\u0027s becoming more and more unsustainable for a variety of reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccessibility has always been, and always will be, one of the base principals for my art. My booking fee is \"whatever they can afford to pay me,\" and most of my work is designed to be as enjoyable from a computer screen halfway across the world as it would be at the club. But the downside to this is that I\u0027m a piper who works very hard and rarely gets paid, and it\u0027s taking a pretty heavy toll on my general well-being. I\u0027m juggling long days at the office with creating looks, doing performances, supporting other artists and taking the time to keep myself rested enough not to let everything crash. Now that trying to bring Luka to various places around the country on whatever United flight is cheap that month has become a factor, it\u0027s become next to impossible to keep things going this way. Add in a surprise $4k vet bill at the end of 2017 and I\u0027m just about ready to collapse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve held off on getting a Patreon because I\u0027ve always thought that I should be able to provide quality monthly rewards. But since several people have expressed support for the idea, I\u0027m going to treat this like a virtual tip jar. If you enjoy what I do, if you want to support it, your donations will help keep it going. I doubt I\u0027ll bring in any significant amount, but I definitely know how to stretch a dollar into a pretty great look!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut because I DO want people who support me to receive some kind of reward, patrons who donate $15 or more over the course of 2018 (whether all in one month or $5 three times a year) will be sent a special thank-you print at the beginning of next year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, I will find a way to keep this Luka Ghost adventure going. But I would really appreciate a bit of help along the way."
