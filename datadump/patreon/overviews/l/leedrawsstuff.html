So I want to build on that community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with the recent events of Patreon I wanted to change my approach to how I use this channel.  I\u2019ve done away with the different tiers and now anyone who pledges any amount gets full access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell at least once everyday I will post a journal entry, now that might be my thoughts on what I\u2019m doing that day, a sneak peek at some pencils or even a completed piece.  I\u2019m opening up my process, my thoughts and generally letting you all behind the curtain.  I\u2019ll ask you guys questions, I\u2019ll answer yours.  Think of it as joining the team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou pledge whatever you can afford or you feel is reasonable $1 a month gets you in the door, any extra gets you my sincere gratitude!  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s plenty of free stuff as well so even if you don\u2019t quite have the cash to commit to anything (and I\u2019ve been there - ha I\u2019m still there some months!) then follow along anyway, I\u2019ll post stuff all the time on all of my channels and you can support in other ways such as sharing and commenting (which is awesome).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u2019ll consider subscribing and I\u2019ll do my best to build a fan space around my scribbles."
