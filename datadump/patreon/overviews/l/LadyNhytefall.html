    "summary": "Hi all!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarlier this year, I launched a project called \"TransNational - Reclaiming the Roadtrip\". Due to the time constraints of seminary, I had to suspend work on the roadtrip project. While unfortunate, there is a silver lining: ya\u0027ll\u0027s support allowed me to generate enough material to begin work on the book. The first six chapters have been outlined, and I will continue to work on it as I can around school. The book is currently targeted for a May 2018 publication, and with a bit of luck, the date will hold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*deep breath*\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings us to the evolution of this work, and this project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing I learned on the road trip project was how important reflection and process are to me, and to us as a larger fellowship of humanity. Seminary is only furthering that need, especially as I move into more public witness and social justice actions/education.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share that reflective experience with you. Together, I firmly believe that we can do learn from each other, and form partnerships that will move us ever forward towards the Beloved Community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I have rebuilt this project to serve as an accountability mechanism. If you want to help me with the everyday expenses of my journey, thank you. If you do not, same thing - thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create, and distribute freely, #DailyReflections on Facebook and Twitter. I also write longer form reflection pieces, which are typically posted on my blog. Those longer form pieces will move here, and my accountability mechanism is one per month. Each piece will, in some way, reflect on my seminary experience as it relates to the world at large.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll notice that I have removed the tiers of rewards from this project. I did so because I honestly do not know what to do with them in this project - but I\u0027m happy to take special requests. Want me to reflect and write on a particular topic? Let me know. Want something different? Let me know. Otherwise, I\u0027ll just be over here muddling through this thing called life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to me, be it financial, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, or what-have-you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for coming along, folks - I greatly appreciate it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSic itur ad astra, excelsior!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
