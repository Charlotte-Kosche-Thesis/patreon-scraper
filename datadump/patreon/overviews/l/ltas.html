I believe the accessibility of YouTube is the future of media theory. What creators like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA\"\u003eRedLetterMedia\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/loosecanon\"\u003eLindsay Ellis\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Hbomb\"\u003eHbomberguy\u003c/a\u003e have proven is that there is a hunger for good, entertaining criticism on the internet, that dives deep into the weeds but still keeps the audience engaged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I am also a filmmaker, and I am constantly experimenting with ways to blend criticism with creation. I have a lot of ambitious, pretentious ideas that you could have the honor (?) of enabling with your hard-earned money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What about the podcast?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou know, that\u0027s a good question. I\u0027m transgender, and I\u0027m also a compulsive detail-oriented researcher. When I realized I might be trans in August 2017, I spent about a week looking up every little thing about being trans that I could find in the hopes of getting to some kind of rubric that would tell me \"yes, you\u0027re transgender,\" or \"no, you\u0027re just weird.\" No such rubric does or can exist, due to what I have come to call \"the infuriating subjectivity of gender.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I realized through this process is that part of why it took me until the age of 28 to come out to myself and the world was a lack of nuanced representation. A lot of the best writing about the experience of being transgender comes from people who are reflecting on their lives \u003cem\u003elong after\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0they\u0027ve come out the other side. This creates an impression that, upon having that realization, one then immediately jumps into hormone replacement therapy and vocal training and cross dressing. The reality is, there\u0027s a long process of self-reflection and doubt that virtually every trans person goes through before their new/modified identities see the light of day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a glorified attention-seeking millennial, I decided I\u0027d document my own journey through this process (what some might refer to as \"a transition\" wink wink) in the form of a podcast. It is called, rather fittingly,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://transquestioning.podbean.com\"\u003ethe Trans Questioning Podcast\u003c/a\u003e. In it, I talk about my life, my relationship with my body, my misgivings about \"passing,\" Twitter trolls, trans healthcare, fascism, and dozens of other light-hearted topics. So light-hearted, in fact, that I have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://transquestioning.podbean.com/e/emotional-breakdown-asmr-11012017/\"\u003ea complete emotional breakdown in one episode\u003c/a\u003e! I also interview other trans people to get their perspective, including the amazing artist\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cartamonir.com\"\u003eCarta Monir\u003c/a\u003e, whose comic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/16/16657222/hitman-comic-carta-monir\"\u003eStealth Mechanic\u003c/a\u003e is one of the best explorations of mechanics-as-metaphor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"When does your podcast update, and where can I find it?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt updates every Wednesday, and you can find it on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/trans-questioning-podcast/id1313551623\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/zachary-gilpin/trans-questioning?refid=stpr\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Ilfkyt2ofe4rnodbruxi7vmxfoi\"\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, or anywhere else that has podcasts.

What topics will you focus on?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look at movies and video games mostly, but the whole point of the \"Stuff\" in the show\u0027s title is to keep me free to explore whatever subject interests me. I like drawing attention to classic and international cinema that a lot of YouTube audiences might not be aware of- like \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/jP6O7nQzarg\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, I use the principle of \"bricolage\" in Hollywood musicals to analyze the fight scenes in Marvel\u0027s \u003cem\u003eIron Fist\u003c/em\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/F2ZeZY4AJCM\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, I talk about how hard it can be to get into international cinema as an American moviegoer. One of my biggest projects in development is a series on metamodernism, which will look at games, movies, music, theater, video essays, and even mail packaging. The first episode, exploring the themes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is embedded below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuAvwS9VGKI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What do I get for backing you?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things I wish more YouTubers did was document their process. Here, every Patron gets access to my frequent updates, where I talk about ideas and roadblocks and all the other challenges that come with being a self-taught video editor.\u00a0\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll also occasionally post movie reviews and other stuff that only you get to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt five dollars a month, you get access to Patron-only videos that include outtakes and unused material, as well as copies of my notes and scripts. These are things I would have found valuable some years ago, as I leave in every stray thought from every stage of scripting, often amounting to pages of garbage before reaching a solid script.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt ten dollars a month, I\u0027ll read your name aloud in the credits! This is a fun way to make some part of yourself completely immortal. Plus, you get access to everything in the five dollar tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"How often do you release videos?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI aim for once every two weeks, but sometimes the realities of life get in the way. I\u0027m a full-time student on top of doing all of this, which you can imagine is a challenging balancing act.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Well, I guess that\u0027s just about everything.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I guess it is.\u003cbr\u003e"
