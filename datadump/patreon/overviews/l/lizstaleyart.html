I create a lot of different things but I mainly focus on drawing anime (and horse!) inspired illustrations, as well as writing and drawing a comic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my life has been spent drawing and writing, and it\u0027s been my dream to make creating in to a living for a long time. When I was a kid I wrote small illustrated books using PostIt Note pads. My fascination with drawing and writing has been a driving force in most of my life! Currently, on top of creating illustrations and comic pages, I also work with horses at two different local horse barns. These two barn jobs are how I pay most of my bills, but I still hope to one day be able to pay all of my bills with my creativity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my illustrations:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to create not only illustrations of original characters and concepts, but I also do the occasional fan-art as well. I am mainly a digital artist but I do also like to create ink and marker art cards and illustrations sometimes as well. But I don\u0027t just create anime and cartoons- I also love to draw horses! A fun series of horse drawings that I have been working on is called \"Horses of the World\" and it involves drawing different breeds of horses on vintage map pages showing where the breed originates from in the world. \u003cbr\u003eYou can see more of my art in my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lizstaley.deviantart.com/gallery/\"\u003eDeviant Art Gallery\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my comic:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working on writing and drawing \u003cstrong\u003eAdrastus\u003c/strong\u003e since 2010, and the comic began to post to the web in April of that year.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.adrastuscomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAdrastus\u003c/a\u003e is a modern love letter to 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s Giant Robot anime. Sarah Bryant discovers that she is really Andromeda Cross, one of the last of the race of Ankali. In the 1970\u0027s, Sarah\u0027s father used Adrastus to fend off an invasion of the fierce Varugo from taking over Earth. The Varugo couldn\u0027t take over Earth, so they decided to wait until Sarah\u0027s father was older and try again. Now Sarah must learn to pilot Adrastus and defend the Earth herself! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Adrastus (and Sarah Bryant) because I was tired of the run-of-the-mill characters in every mecha anime. All the giant robot cartoons I watched always had the same types of female characters, and most of the time none of them got to even pilot a robot! (Unless there was a token pink robot!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to create a female-driven mecha comic with a character that was more realistic. I strive to give Sarah real emotions, motivations, and interests. She likes to fix cars and work on machinery, but she also likes to dress in lace and ruffles and skirts (paired with combat boots!).\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v230/lizstaley/Adrastus/Chapter0120020_zpscc4bbc48.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of your dollars will help me achieve my dream of making a steady living from my creative skills. I look forward to making something amazing with all of you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
