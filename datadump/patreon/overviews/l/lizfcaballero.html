As an artist, I dream of being able to work on my art full time and make a living off my illustrations and comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelieving in yourself is important, but sometimes you need someone to believe in you. \u003cbr\u003eSome people have believed in me and given me their support in the past, and that\u0027s what keeps me going and trying. If it wasn\u0027t for them, maybe I wouldn\u0027t be able to believe in myself. That\u0027s why, if you like my art, I would love to have your support. Every little comment, every word of encouragemente helps. \u003cbr\u003eI will continue drawing and sharing my art anyway, but having some financial support and being able to work full time on my art would be a dream come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCURRENT PROJECTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.minstrelbook.com/patreonbanand.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND\u00daRIL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heroic fantasy fanzine (in Spanish) that I\u0027ve been self-publishing since I was 18.
