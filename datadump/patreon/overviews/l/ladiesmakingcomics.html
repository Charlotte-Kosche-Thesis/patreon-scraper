    "summary": "I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ladiesmakingcomics.com/\"\u003eLadies Making Comics\u003c/a\u003e while in law school in November of 2010. From a simple tumblr made on an impulse, it grew into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://womenincomics.wikia.com/wiki/Women_In_Comics_Wiki\"\u003ea wiki\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.librarything.com/catalog/WomensSeqArtLibrary\"\u003ea physical library\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ladiesmakingcomics.com/\"\u003emulti-platform\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.scoop.it/t/ladies-making-comics\"\u003eup-to-the-minute\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/ladiesmakncomix/\"\u003eresource\u003c/a\u003e of what remarkable things amazing women were doing in comics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen, just as I was hitting my stride, I had to slow it down.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI had graduated from law school, started a whole other job, and found myself moving every summer for three years straight. Blogging had to take a backseat, then be put on ice. And then, once I had finally settled down geographically, I decided to throw my career into upheaval: I was ready to take the bar exam and actually become a lawyer. After a lot of studying (and even more paperwork, it feels like) that finally became a reality in July 2017.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I\u0027ve never stopped loving comics, the people who make them, or their wild and crazy history. There\u0027s so much about comics I want to keep discovering and sharing. At the same time, I\u0027m still job hunting for my first real lawyer job while working full-time at my current job. While I\u0027ve frequently imagined my \n\u003cem\u003etriumphant return to comics blogging!\u003c/em\u003e with a great splash and much fanfare, I\u0027ve concluded that, nah, I\u0027ll just start doing things again.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat things, you may ask? Well, getting back in the habit of researching for the wiki and acquiring and cataloging\u00a0materials for the library, for one thing. Finally debuting\u00a0a brand-new project, restoring the comics of public domain action heroine \n\u003cem\u003eBetty Bates: Lady-at-Law\u003c/em\u003e that I\u0027ve been working on sporadically for the past year and a half, for another. (see the first page and find out more at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lady-at-law.tumblr.com/post/164237237488/who-is-betty-bates-you-ask-why-only-the\"\u003elady-at-law\u003c/a\u003e tumblr!) As for actual blogging? I\u0027m still trying to hammer out what that\u0027s going to look like-- reviews and creator profiles most likely, maybe some kind of column format. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve set up this Patreon to be pay-per-post both to motivate me to keep posting regularly\u00a0and to be fair to my readers if I don\u0027t. I\u0027m keeping the reward thresholds low, so\u00a0even keeping up with my current posting plans doesn\u0027t break your bank. So, to help you figure out how much (if any) you want to pledge, here\u0027s the rough schedule I\u0027m planning on:\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA new restored Betty Bates page every Friday\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA review/creator profile/column on LMC proper the other Fridays\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA weekly links highlight\u00a0round-up posted every Monday\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlus a bonus (unpaid) round-up of all the links not included in the main one for $3-tier patrons\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd a monthly behind-the-scenes vlog for $4-tier patrons.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it. To translate that into monthly terms:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$1 pledge = $8 a month\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$2 pledge = $16 a month\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$3 pledge = $24 a month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$4 pledge = $32 a month\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e$5 pledge = $40 a month\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\u00a0of course,\u00a0if I don\u0027t stick to the schedule, you won\u0027t pay as much. I\u0027m committed to doing this, but life happens. It\u0027s better for everyone if you don\u0027t feel like your pledge is wasted just because I get sick one week, or have to put in extra hours at the office another week. Also, if the tiers or schedule ever change, you\u0027ll get plenty of notice to adjust your pledge.\u003cbr\u003e"
