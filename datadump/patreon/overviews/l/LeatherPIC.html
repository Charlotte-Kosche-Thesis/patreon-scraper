    "summary": "Statement of Intent: Policy Inclusion Coalition (PIC) seeks to expand meaningful accessibility of community oriented Leather to marginalized populations. Central to our work is the self-evident truth that when our most marginalized communities thrive, we all thrive. Our efforts at community building and community cohesion hinge on measurable parity for marginalized voices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePIC\u0027s first and foremost effort is to focus on Leather events who state a policy of inclusion. The concept or feeling of inclusion is subject to determination of the attendee and our focus is to help guide those hosting these events to meet their goal. Events of all kinds hold a special place in Leather, as we gather to bond, collaborate, and celebrate. They are central, in many ways, as spaces where the entire range of community come together. PIC\u0027s work seeks to highlight the underappreciated fact that when events work to be accessible to more of our marginalized community members, those events also gain financial stability and profitability and long term sustainability. By better serving our communities, our communities better serve us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy producing model policy and guidance documents, PIC will encourage evaluation of a variety of event structures and accountability of owners, producers, and organizers by the community they seek investment from. These documents are \"living\" documents. They will change as we change and grow as a community. They will be made available and hosted on a no-charge, public platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe encourage invested community members to offer us feedback as we move through production of these documents. Additionally, we will be offering personalized services in the future to event producers, owners, organizers, and staff. These services will be negotiated at charge as those making up the team of PIC also recognize equity in labor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommunity members are welcome to support PIC\u0027s work. We encourage you to communicate with us and tell us what is important to you with regard to policy development. Write to us at: policy.inclusion.coalition@gmail.com. \u003cbr\u003e"
