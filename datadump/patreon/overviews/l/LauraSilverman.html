I\u0027ve been editing manuscripts and query letters for five years and over that time I\u0027ve found many writers don\u0027t have money in the budget for individualized edits. Plus, some writers aren\u0027t at that stage of the writing process yet. Or they have craft questions but also questions about the publishing business!
