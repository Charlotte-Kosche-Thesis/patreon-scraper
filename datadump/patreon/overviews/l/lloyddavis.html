I\u0027m trying to keep that spirit alive by creating a record of all the things I do with other people and because of other people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll get a multimedia mash-up of all sorts of ideas, projects and bits of work and get to meet some of the people I get to work and play alongside. \u00a0I hope that you\u0027ll also be inspired to make new works with me. \u00a0Check out the rewards to see what else is on offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t already know me, it might help to know that as well as helping people work well together, I play ukulele and sing, I write songs, I write stories and make little movies and photographs of odd things I find in the street while walking around in London.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to hear a bit more of me talking about Creative Collaboration, here\u0027s a talk I gave at TEDxBow in 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLlW7UWDcb0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
