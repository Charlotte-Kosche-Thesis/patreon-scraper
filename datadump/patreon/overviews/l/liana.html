However, you control how much support you can afford. Let\u0027s say that you want to pledge $1 per post: that would be $4 or $5 a month, right? But what if I do something special, like posting Halloween costumes twice a week in October? You don\u0027t have to worry about going over your budget! Just limit your pledge to $5 a month, and no matter how often I post you\u0027ll never pay more than that. And, of course, if I ever post and don\u0027t have a dress or doll to go with it, those posts won\u0027t count.
