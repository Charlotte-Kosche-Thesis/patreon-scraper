We believe that women have a unique and universal voice in fiction and we aim to get it heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only do we publish a fine collection of stories every quarter (free to read online), but we also provide support to our authors by spreading the word about their other publishing successes. Additionally, we honor the past and future of creative women storytellers throughout social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Are We At? Where Are We Going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have an all-volunteer editorial staff and pay our authors a token amount (currently $5) for their stories. Our only additional costs are our submission engine and web hosting. So far, our costs have been kept low and mostly paid with a few generous donations from friends and followers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we want to see Luna Station Quarterly grow beyond its current situation. To do so, we need a steady stream of income. Here\u0027s what we\u0027d like to see happen in the near future as LSQ expands:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncrease pay rate to authors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart paying editorial staff a stipend\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase advertising space to spread the word\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay columnists a stipend\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow Does Patreon Work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is not like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo. Those sites work with one-time donations. This is different. Patreon works more like public radio. You \npledge to provide a certain amount of money each month (you can cap \nthe amount) and we get to continue putting out great content for \neveryone to enjoy. In return, you get some special rewards and our \nsincere gratitude.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Does Patronage Get You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the satisfaction of knowing that you\u0027ll be helping support diversity in speculative fiction, depending on the level of patronage you choose, you\u0027ll also receive an print/digital edition of each issue, access to ebooks of past years, and new publications as they are added to the roster. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also be adding new rewards as we grow! We have some really exciting things in the works for 2018!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
