It\u0027s sort of like a Kickstarter, but think smaller amounts over a longer period of time. You pick an amount you\u0027d like to send me each month, and in return you gain access to \u003cstrong\u003esweet Patreon-exclusive content\u003c/strong\u003e (check the full list of perks below for details) and enjoy the benefit of my \u003cstrong\u003eundying gratitude and affection\u003c/strong\u003e.
