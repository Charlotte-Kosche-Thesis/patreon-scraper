One of those reasons simply being - I want to create and share my art with people around the world in the hope to continue doing what I love all the time while being self-sustaining. Secondly, to share my ideas and visions with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to work at Pixar (hey, I can dream big!) or to work with a game/app company for character design. There is nothing more that I like doing than thinking up relatable and lovable characters in my spare time, and I hope that through this endeavor I am able to establish a comic of my very own. Ah but baby steps first, I do tend to get carried away with all the big plans I have. First I will need funding, and I very well couldn\u0027t do that without support. Here\u0027s to you all, I truly appreciate your time for reading this in its entirety!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in a bundle?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m very glad you asked! Each month, a bundle will consist of these items:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e2-3 sketch pages\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 WIP or \"work in progress\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 finished, fully colored piece ($10 tier or above!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eA $120 value for much less!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pre00.deviantart.net/7e68/th/pre/i/2015/326/7/8/tales_of_zestiria___edna_by_fynalie-d9hpc3a.png\" style=\"width: 509px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img03.deviantart.net/0272/i/2015/042/9/0/mekoko_meko_by_fynalie-d8hnuth.png\" style=\"width: 531px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatrons in the $10 tier and above will also receive:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigh resolution pictures of the bundle above\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eStep-by-step still shots of the finished piece\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor $15 Patrons - PSD of the finished piece so you can see how my work is layered!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I be billed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon automatically bills each patron on the 1st of every month. Your rewards will be sent out once I have received payment! This is to ensure that people do not back out on rewards just before the date and get goods for free. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause!\u003cbr\u003eThe first cycle along with rewards will go out \u003cstrong\u003e7/1/2016\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m in a tier that I no longer want to be in! Am I stuck there?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely not! You are able to change your tribute amount at any time - so if you are in the $100 tier and have paid for your commission, I don\u0027t expect you to stay there from month to month. $100 is a lot! The same goes for $1 patrons - if you feel you would like to receive more benefits in the future, you can change your tribute amount to a higher one and receive the goodies the following month after being billed! Pretty cool, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI nabbed your $100 spot! Now what?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirstly, thank you SO MUCH for the generous contribution! As mentioned above, I will have to wait for payment before I start on your commission - unfortunately I have been taken advantage of before, so please understand! Once you have signed up though, please be sure to send me an email with what it is you would like! References aren\u0027t a must, but they help me better visualize the characters you may want in your piece, so please provide them if you can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBelow is what I will \u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0draw in a commission:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnything not suitable for an audience of 13 years old or younger\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMechas\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there are any questions you may have that aren\u0027t covered here, please don\u0027t hesitate to shoot me a message!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
