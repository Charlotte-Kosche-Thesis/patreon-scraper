    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a content creator at YouTube for more than 8 years, using the medium to explore and create in all sorts of ways. I\u0027ve avoided income streams for the duration, despite being a YouTube partner, because I haven\u0027t wanted to force my subscribers to watch adverts I don\u0027t want to see myself, nor have I been happy to have me or my subscribers forced to make videos purely for popularity or increased revenue for Google.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This is different. It\u0027s a new start, an opportunity to be responsive to what \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e want me to produce. Within reasonable parameters I\u0027m happy to make videos exploring topics you\u0027d find interesting, to write poems on whatever you would like, and to make broadly creative videos driven by your suggestions. I will make these videos either \u0027open\u0027 so visible to all at YouTube, or private videos for my patrons here, depending on the wishes of those patrons. Videos can be supported by one person or a number of them. Because I want to be responsive to the wishes of my patrons wherever I can (without compromising my own integrity or nature) if several people sponsor me I will draw an idea out of a hat (or other suitable receptacle) from the suggestions I\u0027ve been given by you. If you decide to become my patron please send me whatever ideas or interests you might have for video topics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also happy to make private videos for individuals who would like to explore therapeutic issues. Please private message me at YouTube if you\u0027re interested in this option.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will still be making videos at YouTube as always. This is a separate matter. I haven\u0027t suddenly turned into someone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in the process of setting up an online and phone counselling service. Please contact me via pm if you want to know more."
