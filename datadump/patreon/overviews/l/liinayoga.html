    "summary": "I make yoga videos! Yeah ... it\u0027s a bit different I guess, from other creative stuff I have found here on Patreon, so much so (in my mind) in fact, that I felt inclined to write to the Patreon team to ask if I \"fit in\" with the rest of the content. They of course assured me they\u0027d be thrilled to have me (yoga) as part of the community, as Patreon is a platform to support people who\u0027ve got passion to create awesome content for their fans. I tick that box!!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been posting yoga videos for my worldwide yogi-friends for few years now. I call myself a yoga gypsy - my vagabond nature keeps leading me to new destinations. My videos have become a way to stay connected to the communities I\u0027ve lived in, but also to form new ones. It\u0027s like empowering people, to give them this easy access to practices that can be helpful and healing on so many levels. I\u0027m still a beginner and constantly learning when it comes to the actual process of filming and editing the videos - which means hours on end in front of a computer screen (and using those very same yogic tools to keep my calm, when technology will not behave). So I apologize in advance - the \"making movie\" side of things is pure amateurism, no art there! But I do know my yoga!! And creating that part of the content \u00a0IS art and in that flow I totally feel as a creator!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos are still free and for everyone! \u00a0Yoga (teaching classes/retreats) is how I make my living, I do not have a \"day job\" to fall back on. I\u0027ve committed to following my passion and am trusting that I\u0027ll be provided for. (Told you I\u0027m a yogi). Your pledge in a way is a manifestation of that trust. It is saying that I\u0027m on the right track and I am of service. It will help me take the time to make more videos and down the line get better equipment to improve the quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos are of different length - so you can choose how much time you have each day for your practice. There will be videos both in English and in Estonian (as that is where my native tribe is).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, you can always set a limit to the amount you pledge per month, so you won\u0027t bust your budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
