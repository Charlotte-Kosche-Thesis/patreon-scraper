I create original art through \nxylography\u2014the practice of carving and printing blocks of wood\u2014and have \nbeen working full-time as a woodcut artist since graduating from the \nOregon College of Art and Craft in 2008. I\u0027ve combined influences from \nmedieval European woodcuts and Japanese printmaking techniques to \ndevelop my own personal technique and style. Because each piece of wood \nis unique, my creative process leaves room for the personality of the \nwood to have its say in how the final image develops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PH217fSL9KU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to creating and selling my work solo, I\u0027ve been fortunate to work with publishers who allow me the time and creative freedom to work exclusively in woodcut. Over the last few years I have collaborated to create over fifty new woodcuts for Robert Fitzgerald\u0027s \u003cem\u003eArcanum Bestiarum\u003c/em\u003e published by Three Hands Press; six woodcuts mimicking numerous historic styles for P.S. Publishing\u0027s \u003cem\u003eStarry Wisdom Library\u003c/em\u003e; and three special backer-only editions for sponsors of the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival in Portland, Oregon. As much as I love it, woodcut is a labor-intensive means of producing art, and I must often turn down publishing projects due to time constraints. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/01Wt5HHObG4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContrary to popular misconception, woodcut isn\u0027t a dead art form that needs to be resuscitated\u2014it just needs to get out more! Because I want to help make xylography accessible, I\u0027ve chosen not to restrict my creations to fine art venues. So in addition to gallery exhibits my original prints, T-shirts, and other items bearing my art can be found in stores including Gargoyles Statuary in Seattle, Washington; The Lovecraft Arts \u0026amp; Sciences Council Store in Providence, Rhode Island; and Wells \u0026amp; Verne in Portland, Oregon. However, the bulk of my sales are made in person at conventions and conferences including \u003ca href=\"http://www.norwescon.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNorwescon\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://bizarrocon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBizarroCon\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://necronomicon-providence.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNecronomiCon\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.hplfilmfestival.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eH.P. Lovecraft Film Festival/CthulhuCon\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"http://esotericbookconference.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEsoteric Book Conference\u003c/a\u003e. Here I take part in panel discussions, offer live woodcut demonstrations, and occasionally compete in ninety-minute live art competitions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://xylographilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Todd-Chicoine-inking-San-Pedro-2015.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhoto taken at H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival San Pedro 2015 courtesy Todd Chicoine Toddcphoto.wix.com/toddchicoinephoto\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love getting out and sharing my art face-to-face, events outside of Portland, Oregon are both costly and time-consuming to attend. In addition to refusing some commissions due to time constraints, I must also pass on a number of events every year due to the expense and uncertainty of sales. Profits I make are invested back into materials, tools, learning new techniques, applying for shows, traveling to shows, and developing new ways of offering my art to a growing audience. In 2015 I \nbegan offering laser printed wood veneer cards featuring a few of my \nmore popular works. This year I\u0027m transitioning to screenprinting \ninstead of laser printing, and expanding the number of artworks and \nsizes offered. I am also, of course, continuing to carve and print new woodcuts which I look forward to sharing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly pledge will help me to continue growing my body of work and developing the selection of art available to you. Your contribution helps to maintain woodcut as a thriving art form. In exchange for your pledge you can bring the love of xylography into your life with as many or as few rewards as you wish. \u003cbr\u003e"
