Every time I hear how my writing and courses have inspired you in ways both big and small, my heart overflows with gratitude. I am honored that you are a part of my world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*****\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\"\u003cbr\u003e~ Charles Dickens\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA TALE OF ONE WRITER\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce upon a time not too long ago -- 2.5 years ago to be exact -- I had a \u003cdel\u003emidlife crisis\u003c/del\u003e midlife awakening and escaped from cubicle jungle to follow my dream of being a writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me let you in on a not-so-little secret:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking a living as a writer is HARD. Sometimes it feels downright impossible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly, selling is a challenge for me. I loathe being \"sold to.\" I prefer to merrily roll along in my life and spend my money on things and experiences (mostly experiences) that resonate with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, my dear friend Tess often reminds me that I don\u0027t try to sell my work as often as I should.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it boils down to is this: I have a hard time asking people for money. It makes me feel VERY uncomfortable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I give away 99.9% of what I create for free. :-) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I refuse to run ads on the website. Ever. Because they\u0027re tacky and obnoxious. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wholeheartedly believed 2.5 years ago that I could make a living through offering my creative gifts to the world through The Late Bloomer Revolution. All I had to do was give it my all and hustle like there\u0027s no tomorrow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy wide-eyed optimism is both a blessing and a curse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve learned:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeart and hustle (read: working 24/7) get you only so far, people! And the journey is \u003cem\u003eexpensive\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe costs of building and maintaining a website alone....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I will stop right there. My heart just might palpitate out of my chest if I continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past 2.5 years, I\u0027ve supported myself and built The Late Bloomer Revolution on savings that I squirreled away during my 16-year career as a teacher (aka public servant) and my 5-year career in educational publishing. I am officially an expert at frugal living and making sacrifices. You. Have. No. Idea. (cue \"What I Did for Love\" from \u003cem\u003eA Chorus Line\u003c/em\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI simply cannot afford to keep this up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry about me. It is what it is. That\u0027s life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as my mother always says, \"Where there\u0027s life, there\u0027s hope.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATREON TO THE RESCUE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember the tales of the artists of yore (Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Mozart et al.) who had patrons to fund their art? You know, so artists could continue to make the world a better and more beautiful place through their art? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the modern-day version of that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemember when I mentioned earlier that I have a hard time asking people for money, and that it makes me feel VERY uncomfortable? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, cry me a river! The most impactful life lessons are uncomfortable! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m 46 years old, and it\u0027s about time I break through this self-imposed barrier. In order to sustain The Late Bloomer Revolution, I am asking you for your financial support, starting at only $1 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever received value from\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Late Bloomer Revolution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0-- if my writing and/or courses have ever inspired you, moved you, made you laugh -- please consider becoming a patron through a recurring monthly pledge of your choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW PATREON WORKS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou decide which monthly pledge and reward resonate with you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou click the \"Get Reward\" button.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou receive spiffy rewards each month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThat was easy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are officially one of my favorite human beings that has ever walked the earth. I am eternally grateful for your generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf each member of The Late Bloomer Revolution pledged only $3 a month, The Late Bloomer Revolution would be fully sustainable.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow. Talk about living your dreams! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, whether you choose to pledge or not, I am grateful for our time together over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe End? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Beginning?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be continued....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*****\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Shut the front door! Are you telling me that we now have to pay to read your formerly free blog posts and e-books?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Oh, gosh no! I would never pull a tacky stunt like that. Breathe. I\u0027ve got your back, sister. (Or bro.) You don\u0027t have to pay a cent to read the blog posts and other freebies. However, if you\u0027re a patron through Patreon, you\u0027ll have access to extra-cool rewards galore! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Are we expected to pledge monthly for the rest of our natural-born lives? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: I would love it if we were in each other\u0027s lives for forever and ever amen! However, you may exercise free will and cancel the automatic renewal of your monthly pledge at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I\u0027m kinda old-school. I would prefer to make a one-time donation. Can I do that? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Out of the mouths of the good people at Patreon: \"For now, the best way to support a creator with a one-time donation is to become a patron and simply delete your pledge after you\u0027ve seen your first charge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne-off pledges are always on our radar. In general we love the idea. At the same time we need to ensure that we stay true to what Patreon is all about, which is ongoing sustainable support for artists.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Is Patreon just like Kickstarter? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Nope. Kickstarter campaigns have a deadline. Patreon is ongoing. Yay!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
