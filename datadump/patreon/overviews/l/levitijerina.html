In order to learn, you have to be intentional about listening and about seeking out people to coach, guide, and mentor you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter hosting workshops for years around the country, I\u0027ve decided that it is a more approachable and efficient to reach an ongoing community through online access to videos and guides that can be constantly referenced. I want to create a community and space that is rooted in community-based education and I want to encourage others to become leaders through dedicated, consistent hard work. My intention is to help you get to the next levels of your business, wherever they may be, by attentively listening to your needs and helping you problem solve to find the answers you need."
