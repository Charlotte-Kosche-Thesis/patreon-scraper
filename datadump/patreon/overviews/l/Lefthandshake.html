So that in and of itself is quite a feat for me. It\u0027s still in it\u0027s infancy, but it\u0027s become something I\u0027m quite fond of doing and so I would like to continue doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hadn\u0027t actually considered Patreon (especially this early in my channel\u0027s life) until it was suggested to me by a collaborator, and to be honest, I felt a little weird about the idea initially. Maybe it\u0027s a British thing. But eventually I thought, what the hey - it might be worth a try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve discovered how much time and effort running a channel takes and whilst I love doing it, I still have overheads to cover. YouTube ad revenue doesn\u0027t bring in much money, especially on a small channel like mine, so I still need to spend a considerable amount of time at the ol\u0027 day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially, the more self-sustaining the channel becomes the more time I have to spend producing content for my viewers. It would be fantastic to get to a point where I can produce content full-time. Now it\u0027s entirely likely that the channel won\u0027t ever reach that stage, epecially given the over-abundance of gaming channels on YouTube. I\u0027ll still be doing something I enjoy and getting to practise shouting into a microphone, so it\u0027s all fine and dandy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also pursuing an acting career, with a particular interest in voice acting. I graduated drama school fairly recently and I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t need to tell you what a hustle getting acting work is!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the channel, or indeed any of my voiceover work, your support is much appreciated!"
