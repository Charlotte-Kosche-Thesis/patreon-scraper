I go by Leviticus, but most people just call me Levi. I am a writer and an artist, and I work very hard in trying to improve on both fields. I love telling a good story whether it be by writing, by art or by composition. I write quite a lot of fanfiction - the most known of which is Overgrowth from Undertale\u0027s Flowerfell AU (and well, as of late, A Lullaby for Gods, which is a crack fic that has turned into not-quite-crack fic) - and have written a lot of original work as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing and making art, and I love sharing my work with my readers. So if you like my works, any help you can give me as a token of appreciation for me is welcome. This isn\u0027t an announcement that if you don\u0027t fund my works, you\u0027ll never see anything from me again. That\u0027s just cruel. And that\u0027s just the opposite of what I\u0027m trying to do. I\u0027m trying to share a part of me - my imagination, the worlds inside my head, the stories, the lessons I want to impart - and I should not withhold that from you because you are not paying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all of patrons who have been supporting me for years, \u003cem\u003ethank you so much \u003c/em\u003efor doing so! It\u0027s really been helping. And thank you to all of my readers too who have been loving and supporting my stories. It\u0027s been a wild ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWRITING\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(12, 12, 12);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eA lot of people probably remember me from writing Overgrowth for Flowerfell and are here for this reason, and that\u0027s totally okay! I mostly post works here at a week in advance before it goes up on AO3 (and some works are exclusive here, like the rest of my Undertale stuff). I also post original work here sometimes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to go hard on the symbolism and using things from personal experiences for my writing, and I spill inspiration and things some people might have missed here too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eConcerning Overgrowth:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eDue to the numerous repostings, Overgrowth has been taken down, and I have also requested that translations of it be taken down. It can be accessible by Catielou\u0027s reading. HOWEVER, due to the fact that people still want to read the actual fic considering that, understandably, the experience of reading it and hearing it are very different, we have allowed it to be accessible via Patreon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eART\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eIn recent time, I\u0027ve been getting more confident in my art and have even set up an\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://cyanidekyanite.tumblr.com\"\u003eartblog\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eand I though that maybe if people want to support me on that, they can too! At the time of writing this, I\u0027m currently working on a custom tarot deck for my friends (I say custom tarot deck, but it\u0027s really only just the Major Arcana), so you\u0027ll see some of that too, and I hope people who are here for my writing don\u0027t mind sharing space with those who want to support my art\u003c/span\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e________________________________________________\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ePlease do not repost any of the works here.
