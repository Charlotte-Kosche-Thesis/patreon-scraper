These \"dental issues\" are not covered by standard\nhealth care, so that means we pay for them out of pocket.  In case\nyou were wondering, teeth aren\u0027t cheap.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eCovering\nSharon\u0027s monthly health insurance bill is also part of this grand\nplan.  We thought we\u0027d be able to finagle the budget by dropping down\nto a so-called Bronze Plan from Silver (the plan she had been on\nincreased by nearly $300 per month in January), accepting a\nhigher-out-of-pocket for a lower (but still higher than last year\u0027s\nSilver) monthly payment, and gambling that there would be no reason\nto go calling on doctors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYou\nknow what they say about gambling\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo,\nthis is our clever plan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatrons\nwill have special early access to one (or both) of us reading a\nchapter, a short story, a poem several times a month (right now,\ngiven doctor\u0027s appointments, Random Is, but we\u0027ll shoot for every\nother week).

He ended up striking a telephone pole, absorbing quite a bit\nof that energy head on, resulting in emergency surgery on his mouth\nand latent jaw issues which led eventually to major dental problems.\nAbout twelve years ago he \u2013 and we \u2013 embarked on a rather\nextensive (and expensive) remediation during the course of which\nportions of his mouth was reconstructed through surgery and the\naddition of permanent dental implants anchored in three places over\nthe course of several years. That rebuild was finished about ten\nyears ago, and was said to be a lifetime fix. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSeveral\nyears ago the more minor of those three implants failed.  The\nsituation was deemed stable after his prosthetic was reconfigured but\nwe were warned at the time that a certain number of implants do fail\nand not all the reasons are known. Last November, during a trip out\nof state, one of the remaining major implants failed in a fashion\nthat endangered the remaining one and after several visits with\nexperts it was determined that the implant specialist who\u0027d performed\nthe initial implants would arrange to replace both of the implants\nwith the most up-to-date available implants, the cost to include a\nsignificant discount allowance for the inconvenience. Even with the\ndiscount the cost will be in the thousands for what should, again, be\na lifetime investment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e******************************************************************************************************************\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eDecember 3, 2015\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s in!\u00a0 It\u0027s up!\u00a0 It\u0027s ready to rumble!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. . .and I do\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003emean\u003c/em\u003e rumble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to thank all of you so much for helping us go forward with this big step.\u00a0 Not only did you give us encouragement, you gave us the confidence\u00a0 we needed to commit to such a large, expensive project.\u00a0 Knowing that we will be able to pay this off by the end of next year is almost as comforting as knowing that the heat and the lights will stay on here at the Cat Farm and Confusion Factory, even if the lines go down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are pictures of our new, fully operational generator.\u00a0 We\u0027re thinking of calling it \"Patreon.\"\u00a0 \"Pat,\" for short.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe view from the side:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sharonleewriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Generator-side-shot-Nov-19-2015-SMALL.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe view from the front:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sharonleewriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Generator-front-shot-Nov-19-2015-SMALL.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* * *\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWinter is coming.\u00a0 You heard it here first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in April, after urging from some of you, our readers, Steve and I started this Patreon account -- as an experiment, mostly.\u00a0 We didn\u0027t know where it would go, and we were, yes, hesitant.\u00a0 We had\ntalked about the idea, walked around it, and put it aside a couple times until, during one of the cash-flow\npauses that tend to hit freelancers, we went for it \u2013 and you\nresponded, with verve. Many thanks! You -- \u003cem\u003eall of you\u003c/em\u003e -- helped us tremendously in\nthe intervening months, and we greatly appreciate the steady support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the interim we\u0027d been looking to sell our house in the country, and buy another, closer to -- or even in! -- civilization,\nbut a series of unexpected medical costs kind of scotched the cash-flow, and seriously depleted the money we\u0027d saved to move.\u00a0 Family necessities also arose this year, and -- long story short -- we\u0027ve\ntaken our house off the market, just in time for fall to be peering\nover our shoulders looking to become a hard, wet, and cold winter\npowered by a potential record-setting El Nino, with us living no\ncloser to the city than we were last year when the house went on the\nmarket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u0027ll be able to stock up on cat food, water, wine, and people\nfood for a long, strong winter, what we won\u0027t be able to stock up on is\nanother necessity for our net-connected household: electricity. Back\nin the mid-90s, the last time a mega El Nino visited, we were in the\nepicenter of the ice-storm that blacked out large portions of New\nEngland and Canada for days \u2013 in fact, we here at the Cat Farm and Confusion Factory were without power for well\nover a week, the electric and cable lines down for more than 7 miles\nin all directions.\u00a0 We were melting ice (harvested with hammers from the windshields of our cars!)\non the woodstove for hot water, and eating such things as could be heated out of cans on the top of the (propane) stove, having lost all the food in the fridge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was, yes, a Grand Adventure, and gave us a real sense of how simple life can be, when all you have to worry about along the day is staying warm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, considering that Winter \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e on the way, we\u0027re hoping to add a\ngenerator here, one able to automatically power the house if (when) the lines\ngo down. Our well and baseboard heat depend on electricity as well as the refrigerator, and our computers.\u00a0 It\u0027s been almost 20 years since that really long outage, and we\u0027re\nno longer the young folk we were then \u2013 tramping a quarter mile in a\nblizzard to get extra firewood from a kind neighbor is no longer as. . .adventuresome as it was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are, therefore, announcing A Goal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to see the\nmonthly support level rise to $2000*, so that we can install a moderate-sized permanent home generator, and pay it off within 24 months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support and your company down the long, strange road we\u0027ve decided to walk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSharon and Steve\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e________________\u003cbr\u003e*Multiply by .12 for fees, subtract from total, multiply the result by  \n0.6 for taxes,\u00a0 to get an idea of what we get to use \nafter taxes and fees.\u00a0 For instance:\u00a0 $1869 x 0.12 = $224; $1869--$224 = $1645; $1645 x 0.6 = $987 comes into the authors\u0027 checkbook.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
