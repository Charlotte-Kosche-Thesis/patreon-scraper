My name is Clint Basinger and I\u0027m the person behind the YouTube show \u003cem\u003eLazy Game Reviews\u003c/em\u003e. But why am I here on Patreon? Well, because I rather enjoy making LGR episodes and this campaign does a lot to help me continue to do so and improve it along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making videos on YouTube, which is why I\u0027ve released one (or more) per week since June of 2009. Video games, and especially \nclassic computer games, are my big fat passion. I love the stories \nbehind their creation, the waves of nostalgia they bring on, the headspace \nthey invoke, the hardware that runs them, and the community of people that \nhas formed around them. And since starting LGR my appreciation and \nenjoyment of this has only increased, and I\u0027ve found a fantastic \naudience on YouTube that digs this stuff, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4WnVMhg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work and what do I get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nFirst:\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eI am\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0charging to see my videos\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e This is simply an option for those that enjoy what I already do to help if they feel like it! You can pledge $1 (or any amount) each month for however long you desire, as a kind of \"tip\" for me producing the content I create. This also helps LGR improve in quality and quantity, provides you the option to get autographed disks, and other stuff as I come up with it! Your subscription can be edited or cancelled at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGet a personalized and signed 5.25\" floppy disk:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/t4KheEt.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nThings are always iffy in YouTube-land. Ad revenue is always coming and going. I do this as my full-time job and my main source of cash comes from ad revenue generated by monetized YouTube views. My only other viable option is to resort to corporate sponsorships for each video and that leaves a bad taste in my mouth so I\u0027m trying to avoid that. So Patreon is nice to have as a fail-safe. But an even bigger reason I have this Patreon campaign is that I just really get a kick out of doing this show and want to continue to improve it! So the more that is pledged here, the more goes into LGR, and in turn, my life and your viewing pleasure in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJust one example of the content I love making:\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrn-QYdT4F8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat happens now?\u003c/h3\u003eSince starting Patreon I\u0027ve increased the show from one to two videos per week, purchased new camera equipment and lighting, rented out a new studio/storage place to film, bought the latest Adobe CC suite to edit videos, got a laptop to let me make content away from home, and started two new shows: LGR Thrifts and LGR Tech Tales. If things keep going this well, I plan to cover more obscure hardware and software, travel to cons when possible, buy better equipment if I ever need it, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your continued support, whether or not you decide to pledge anything each month. I appreciate you watching and checking out the campaign!\u003cbr\u003e"
