But since I was very\nyoung i have always been fascinated with impersonating other characters and\ncrafting what i thought were master pieces....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JUVOha0.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making and wearing cosplays in 2015, and since then its been a complete obsession. Cosplay became a strong passion for me as it really helped balance my emotions through some of the toughest times in my life, I was able to give my mind a rest as I solely concentrated on crafting. On top of this I\u0027ve always naturally been extremely shy and judgemental of myself however, cosplay has meant that I am able to lessen my social anxiety and connect with some of the most interesting and kind people; my followers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6CRbG1o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of my patreon subscribers I can bring better quality photos, videos, tutorials, costumes and even travel to your country! Having patreon will create a mutual benefit between me and my subscribers in as many ways possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to dedicate more time in learning and educating ways to craft as well as spending more time with you guys on streams! I will not stop posting free content on my social media accounts, but by having patreon it means I can produce even more content\u00a0for everyone who enjoys what I do and wants to be more involved! Every costume I make I learn at least one new thing, which means I can constantly show and learn with you, and grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XM7qoz2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to try all different types of cosplay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDetailed Armour:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hdJttRL.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCasual versions of characters:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/h8EKU0e.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCombination of styles:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Km3zbRP.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many new and unexplored styles that im eager to try as well as expanding my skills with past techniques!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8FPg2Op.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows me to live my dream whilst giving back my\nhappiness to you, so to everyone whether you decide to pledge or not, thank you\nso much for reading this and supporting me in each way.
