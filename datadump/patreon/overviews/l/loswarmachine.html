This support helps us with running our site, maintaining a domain name, picking up equipment or software for recording video, audio, or anything else we need, and also to get on the road and travel to Warmachine events, where we can meet all of you in person and get great, high quality games to get in more content for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, whether you subscribe as a patron or not, we do all this because we love being a part of this community and getting to know all the people in it! We\u0027ve both had tremendous love and support for our content in the past, and hope to keep making great stuff in the future!"
