I make poems, videos, plays, installations, exhibitions, essays, strange lounge room experiences and any other thing that tells the story I\u0027m trying to tell or asks the questions I\u0027m trying to ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use art and art making as a tool for social change, community development and personal empowerment. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to win a bunch of awards for my work using the arts to interrogate and explore community concerns and \naspirations including most recently the 2015 Australia Council Kirk \nRobson Award, 2014 Channel 9 Young Achiever Arts Award and was named by \nSA Life as one of SA\u2019s fastest rising stars under 30.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do it because someone once did it for me. Because once upon a time I \nbelieved myself to be worthless and voiceless. I was wrong. And now I\u2019m \ndriven and inspired to keep asking questions. To keep challenging what \nIS, with what could BE. To keep discovering, learning and opening up the\n conversations we have together through artistic experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can read the details of my journey from voiceless to vocal in the\n Griffith Review edition Cultural Solutions, which you can find \u003ca href=\"https://griffithreview.com/articles/not-for-me/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m one of the privileged few that has a paid job to put food on the table and a roof over my head, but it doesn\u0027t leave enough to keep covering the costs of making all the things - especially the experimental risky things with and for people who don\u0027t have the capacity to pay for the experience themselves (as participants or audience). The reality is that I\u0027ve gotten myself into debt in the past self-funding projects which isn\u0027t sustainable in the longer term (especially with two children), so if I\u0027m going to keep making the things I need to ask my audiences and supporters to be part of resourcing the things. Dollars for materials, insurance, exhibition fees, venues, equipment, marketing collateral and paying the other ace artists I want to collaborate with (who do need the dollars to eat and sleep somewhere safe) etc. etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you want to be part of the story of the things I\u0027m making, welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be figuring out and making adjustments to this patreon thing as we go and if you have suggestions about how you\u0027d like to be involved and updated, please let me know. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
