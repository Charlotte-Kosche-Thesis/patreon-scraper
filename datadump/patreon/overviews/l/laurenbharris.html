While there, she studied Japanese, taught English, and fell in love with the hot drink section in the vending machines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, Lauren balances a day-job of Cardiac Ultrasound with her passion for writing and other creative persuits. She is the author of The Millroad Academy Exorcists novella series and an Assistant Editor at Orson Scott Card\u0027s Intergalactic Medicine Show.
