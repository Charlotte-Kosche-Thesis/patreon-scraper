    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Rebekah-David Laughing Crow Gamble, though most people call me David or Laughing Crow. I\u0027m an intersex clergy person, activist and holistic practitioner working towards a healthier and more connected world. I\u0027m doing that through environmental and social activism, community leadership especially as concerns health and spirituality, education, and working in the health field. I believe the world is a better place with every person who connects better to themself, the planet, and their direct experience of divinity. It\u0027s important to me that the things I do are as accessible as possible so I often undercharge for my work. I\u0027ve opened a Patreon for two reasons. First, you helping me enables me to keep access costs for my work low which is important to me because I don\u0027t believe people should be shut out of care they need because they don\u0027t have the income to afford it. Second, it gives me a chance to share inside things in my world so you and I can get to know each other better and I can test run ideas I have before investing crazy time into them. If you decide to follow my work here on Patreon, please do take time to comment and converse with me so I can get to know you too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to know more about my story and how I got here, please check out my website where I talk about that here: \u003ca href=\"http://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com/about\"\u003ehttp://rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.com/abou...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting my efforts to make a better world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and Cheers your way~\u003cbr\u003eLaughing Crow\u003cbr\u003e"

Since most people buy their copy of a book on Amazon or through Barnes and Nobel, I often only make a few dollars a book. This leads to it taking years for a book to pay for itself. In the meantime, I pay the costs of the book out of pocket. When I add up the cost of publishing three books per year, add it to the cost of keeping my office open and running, and divide it by 12, I get $2400. If we could fund this much per month, my costs of working at the office and publishing more books would be covered.
