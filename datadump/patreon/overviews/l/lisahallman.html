    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate (Aug/15/2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have changed my focus to writing about Mental Health. \u00a0I am creating a blog that deals with all aspects of mental health and chronic illness. \u00a0Whether this is about making money, managing pain, loving yourself more or making good habits they will be focused on working with our limitations and finding the strength and courage to continue to grow and even fostering new paths of enjoyment or purpose in your life. \u00a0I feel this is an area that is highly underserviced because we want to remain hidden from the judgment of the outside world. \u00a0My focus is to build you up, understand you, help you grow and help you feel maybe even the tiniest bit better. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease stay tuned for the website launch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal: Is to create a blog focused on helping those with chronic pain \u0026amp; mental illness live a more purpose driven life. (Patreon doesn\u0027t allow that many characters).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon after discovering \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/scottsantens/\"\u003eScott Santens\u003c/a\u003e and deciding to contribute to his Universal (unconditional) Basic Income Initiative. His message was clear, an Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) is needed for people to flourish properly in life, to not live in fear and for this income to come \"no strings attached\", i.e. no red tape. Scott has succeeded by having active patrons contributing to (UBI) and now achieves the minimum $1000 through the Patreon platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I decided that it could be a starting point for me to no longer have to be on disability in Ontario. Unlike, UBI disability has strings attached and quite frankly it can send me into a terrible downward spiral emotionally. I suffer from Depression, Anxiety, Osteoarthritis to name a few. The last of them really seems to cause me the most stress, because I can\u0027t even really hold down a part time job because of terrible pain. I really wish I could have a part-time job because I would feel somewhat self-sufficient and feel like I\u0027m contributing to this world. My favorite type of jobs were labor jobs too, I preferred to work with my hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing in fear does not allow me to focus on my health as a first priority. I live in anxiety always waiting for the government to come and tell me somehow I no longer qualify, or I messed up the rules that I\u0027m supposed to abide by and they cut me off. I have rent to pay and bills like everyone else. It has left me with the mentality of trying to find something to make money quickly because it\u0027s the mindset it has left me with; I don\u0027t feel any breathing room to find time to take care of me. I really need to take care of me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisability currently gives me $1244 a month which is basic needs, shelter, and a special diet allowance. Now, here is something a lot of people don\u0027t realize; being disabled has a higher basic income need than an able bodied person. Transit, is a 7-minute walk from where I am which does not make it easy to do grocery shopping. Therefore a taxi is required to take me home. A bus pass is good, but it\u0027s not enough. Sometimes I have the ability to go further and other times I don\u0027t. Having extra money to be able to take a cab back when needed would alleviate stress and allow me to explore where I live more since I really love nature. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHere I am, asking you to consider giving me $1 a month (or more) to help me live free of fear. So that I can flourish creatively. Writing is one of many things I really enjoy doing and when I\u0027m done writing something, it feels like a weight has been lifted off me. In exchange for the money you supply me with, I will provide you with well-written articles, poetry, photography and who knows what else. I am full of ideas, so maybe I can actually bring to fruition a few awesome ideas I\u0027ve been touting in my head as unreachable. You can make this happen. More than anything, I am asking for money to simply feel free of fear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Benefits\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLevel 1\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 - You are contributing to my basic income.

You will have access to everything level 1 through 3 has access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also wholeheartedly thank you, because giving $10 a month means you can financially afford to do so, but more than that, you believe in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverall\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe more people here, the more exclusive this club will be and I will be able to further refine perks. \u00a0But I realize that some of you may just want to contribute to me because you would like to help me not have to rely on the government. \u00a0I sincerely thank you for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron of mine, \u003cstrong\u003eplease just let me know if you are interested in the \"behind-the-scenes\" of my blog and what I do, or if you are just interested in supporting me financially\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0It will help me understand whether people are more interested in supporting me financially or are interested in my process of writing and coming up with content for my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhoto credit:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/plant-nature-live-1335575/\"\u003ePixabay\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
