Thank you for visiting my page, it means a lot to me. My name is Lolo Blaq, I am a model, actor, writer, director, and painter. I have a passion for the arts as a whole and my goal in life is to make and spread as much Art as possible before I leave this planet. It is my hope that those of you who find my work beautiful, inspiring or creative would like to help me make dreams come true- for more people than just myself. Currently I am working on a revolutionary Horror Movie that is nothing like any movie you have seen before- I am hoping to inspire and revive the Horror industry and help assuage the tide of endless reboots. I regularly organize and direct/ participate in creative/ conceptual photoshoots- you will find no nudity on my page and very little boudoir/ pin up work; I believe in self respect and strong moral fiber in Women. That being said, my horror movie is fully female driven with the supporting characters being male. I am no \"feminist\" but I do believe there is an under-abundance of strong/ interesting/ useful female characters. I believe in working hard and creating the best possible product for my fans. Please, reach out to me and say hello! Feel free to send me a message with ideas, suggestions, questions, requests- anything that you like. I appreciate you and value the time you took to read this message! Thank you, Lo.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

I was born to an athlete and an artist, who already had four daughters- of which I became the fifth and youngest. I was home schooled until I started public school for eighth grade, which incidentally was as bad of an idea as it sounds- public schooling that is. During my time as a home school student I attended a weekly art school, which was where I discovered my wide array of talents and I began to shine like a bright little star- despite all the weirdo super christian home school moms/ school teachers hating me because I wasn\u0027t drowning in culottes and uncut blonde hair. I began starring in every end of the year production, getting awards for my drawing and creative writing and generally thriving.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 That all quickly changed when I entered into the public school system. There was no individualized attention, the teachers didn\u0027t really take the time to answer questions or concerns in a clear or concise manner, I was very distracted by my peers going about their own lives. I finally wound up leaving high school in a haze of misery and depression, which continued well into my twenties (I\u0027ve decided its just part of my personality at this point in the game), and began to peruse what it was I wanted to do in life- which as it turns out is everything except conventional work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO here we are today, I\u0027m making art, you might be interested in it. I assume thats why you have stopped by today. Take a look around, reach out and say hi- and thank you so much for coming by my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
