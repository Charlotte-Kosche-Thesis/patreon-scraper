If\nyou\u2019re already a fan, I love you and I want us to do great things together\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been designing and making quilts\nfull-time since 2009 and designing fabrics since 2015. My ongoing project has been to explore how\ntechnology intersects with traditional craft by designing my quilts using\nProcessing code. In a nutshell, I like to push design boundaries and challenge\npeoples\u2019 perspectives of quilting as an art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a great opportunity for me to\nshare more of my knowledge and process with you. I often travel to lecture, teach\nworkshops and meet other quilters in person, but there are plenty of you out\nthere who just don\u2019t have access to these visits. (Or maybe you\u2019re not a\nquilter\u2026yet.) By being part of this community, you\u2019ll get access to tutorials,\nlearn new skills, find design inspiration and get the \u2018real\u2019 scoop on craft as\na business. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether or not you\u2019re a quilter, I\u2019m going\nto push you out of your creative comfort zone and encourage you to break the\nrules\u2026because that\u2019s where the magic happens.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEvery year I like to set goals for myself\nand for my \u2018brand\u2019. The challenge here is that sometimes these goals require financing.\nI\u2019d love to have at least one exhibit in 2018, which means spending time\non work I\u2019m passionate about, but might not get paid for. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is where you come in. Your support not\nonly means more time for me to work on my projects, it also means I can make\nmore content and rad rewards for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon\nallows you to pledge money to my quilt projects in exchange for rewards.\nDifferent pledge amounts correspond to different rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you\nclick the \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button, you can select how much you want to pledge\nper month. You\u0027ll be charged automatically, and can adjust or cancel your pledge\nat anytime. No matter what you pledge, I\u2019m deeply grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking a moment to check out my Patreon page.
