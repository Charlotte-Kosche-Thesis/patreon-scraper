    "summary": "Hello and thank you for stopping by my page! I go by my alias LukkiStarr online, or just Lukki for short. I like wings and gems among other things, but those two the most. I live in Finland and that affects the times I\u0027ll be online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy experience with drawing goes all the way back to around second or third grade when I first started making comics with stick figures. A little over 10 years ago I finally joined Deviantart, truly putting my art out there for the first time. I like to think my improvement has been steady since those times! I continued drawing individual pictures as well as comics, finding them to be the easiest way to convey all the stories flooding my head. Hopefully I\u0027ve reached a level where a plenty of people are willing to support my continued practice of drawing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther places to find me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lukkistarr.deviantart.com/\"\u003eLukkiStarr on DeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lukkistarr.tumblr.com/\"\u003eLukkiStarr (Personal blog) on Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/lukkiarts\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLukkiArts (Art blog) on Tumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the things on this page:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Drawings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis is what it\u0027s all about! At the most basic level, my goal is to post something new for my patrons every week. Work on poll winners and commissions starts the following month once payments have been processed. There are several different categories of drawings and will be tagged appropriately:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWIP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork-In-Progress pictures in their early stages are exclusively shown to supporters. My intentions for these is always a full picture with complete line art, shading, effects and any possible backgrounds. The end results get posted on my public channels but my patrons get sneak peeks long before that time comes!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComplete\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA drawing becomes this when it stops being a WIP. These feature complete line art, colours, shading, any special effects and usually a background. These are posted publicly on Patreon, DeviantArt and Tumblr.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoodle\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrawings tagged as this are exclusive to my supporters. They are often pictures that I don\u0027t feel are suitable for my public channels for any number of reasons, such as missing specific context or being drawn quickly to get an idea across and thus lacking in detail. They can still reach the same level of quality as the more public sketches!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSketch\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThese drawings get posted publicly and the Minor Pictures folder in my DeviantArt gallery gives a good idea of the level of these drawings! I generally have no intentions of working on these further, though supporters may vote otherwise!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGratitude\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvery month I\u0027ll make little pictures to show my gratitude to my supporters! Those at $2 tier get to see the first one, a small drawing relating to the month\u0027s theme. Those who are at the $10 tier get to see a second, different picture to show my gratitude, this one having colours! Both of these are posted near the end of the month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will occasionally make comics!

Once a certain stretch goal is reached, some of these start coming in sets; completing a set gives a special extra picture as a set bonus!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThese are the drawings requested by supporters who have reached the donation tiers that allow them to do so! They will be posted publicly on Patreon, DeviantArt and Tumblr as usual once they reach the requested stage and will feature the name of whoever requested it (unless asked otherwise).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe requests may contain one or two characters and a simple background. Having more characters comes at a cost of complexity as I need to divide resources. The subjects should generally not be nswf and no naughty bits will be shown. All commissions are subject to approval. As such, I\u0027d like to receive your request as soon as you can provide one. My DeviantArt gallery provides a good look at what I\u0027m happy to draw!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Polls\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePeople who have reached the $10 tier or higher get the chance to add items of their choice to the next month\u0027s polls. However, they can forego that and instead give +2 additional votes (This is in addition to their normal votes) on all of CURRENT month\u0027s polls to truly show what they want! This option exists since Patreon\u0027s polls have a maximum limit of 20 items.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly Theme Poll\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis poll runs through the entire month and all patrons get to vote on it! The winning result determines the overall theme of the pictures I\u0027ll be drawing in the following month. The options I pick are mostly random between what I feel like or related to the month in question, although those who support $10 or more get to add an option of their choice on the next month\u0027s poll! This is so that every option gets to stay up as long as possible!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly Picture Poll\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnother poll that runs through the entire month. Patrons who support $3 or more get to vote on this one and those supporting $10 get to add items to this poll as well! The suggested items share similar restrictions as commissions do, although the items on this poll can be more complex (Up to 3 characters and more details at its most basic level). The options on this poll generally come from my to-do list as well as aforementioned supporters.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe item needs not be a new picture but rather upgrading an existing drawing, such as redrawing a doodle into a better sketch or making an existing sketch into line art and so on. How much a picture gets updated correlates with the stretch goal level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis is an evolving poll! Depending on the stretch goals achieved, there may be several winners, the winning picture may be more complete and other things! Please refer to the stretch goals to see what to expect!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Polls\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is possible that other polls happen as well, for example to function as tiebreakers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
