     "about": "Hi, I am Meeghan.  A few years ago I wanted to teach my daughter to read.  Actually, I really just wanted to prepare my daughter for kindergarten.   I asked my mom, a reading specialist for over 25 years, for advice on how to do this.  She went into her basement and pulled out an entire curriculum she had written after she retired!  She had written books upon books and pages upon pages to help teach reading to children \u2013 and she put it away in her basement!  I picked up the material and easily taught my daughter to read.  I was so impressed and amazed at how easy it was to teach reading that I was determined to share her materials with anyone who wanted to know how to help their child.  I now have taught 4 of my children to read using the materials.  Each child has different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, but each child learned to read very easily.  Teaching reading is easier than you think\u2026.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mom, Madreen Karle, is a retired school teacher who wrote a reading program after retiring from teaching for 30 years.  She earned her Bachelors in Elementary Education from Bowling Green State University.  Mrs. Karle taught first grade, developmental first grade and preschool in Highland Park, IL, Shaker Heights, OH, and Wilton, Connecticut.  She had much success teaching children to read and was inspired to try and teach many more children through the internet.  Madreen has been married 52 years and has four children and ten grandchildren.  With the help, love and support of her family, her program now comes to life!  We hope it empowers you and your child to reading success!",
