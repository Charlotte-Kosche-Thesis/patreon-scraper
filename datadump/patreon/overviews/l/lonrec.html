    "summary": "The world of transport is both fascinating and complex. We think this means it deserves to be written about in detail - and have been doing that for over nine years now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe you know us from our look at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.londonreconnections.com/2017/understanding-uber-not-app/\"\u003ehow Uber works in London\u003c/a\u003e, maybe it\u0027s from our piece on the Victoria line\u0027s quest to be the fastest railway on the world. Maybe\u003ca href=\"https://www.londonreconnections.com/2012/angels-and-errors-how-the-harrow-wealdstone-disaster-helped-shape-modern-britain/\"\u003e you\u0027ve just read what we\u0027ve written about world-changing train crashes\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.londonreconnections.com/2016/empire-of-the-air-the-imperial-airship-service/\"\u003ethe history of Zeppelins in British service\u003c/a\u003e. Whatever it is that you read, we hoped you liked it as much as we enjoyed writing it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut here\u0027s a sneaky truth:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.londonreconnections.com/\"\u003eLondon Reconnections\u003c/a\u003e doesn\u0027t make money. We all have proper jobs as well. Which is fine - because \u00a0making money is not our goal - \u003cstrong\u003ewriting good, longform journalism is\u003c/strong\u003e. With the help of subscriptions\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://shop.londonreconnections.com/\"\u003eto our semi-regular magazine\u003c/a\u003e, and the occasional understanding sponsor, we come close to breaking even and that\u0027s great! We\u0027re generally happy with that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s always more we\u0027d like to do though and more stories we\u0027d like to tell - many of which would require research trips or the purchase of books, photos and other media that we can\u0027t really afford from our own pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been told a few times now that we should provide a way for people to consciously support \"Special Projects\" as well as regular running costs - \u00a0that is, a way to help us create specific articles that they would like, or that we would like but know we\u0027d need money to do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that\u0027s what this page is for. Whether it\u0027s because you don\u0027t want to pick up a subscription but still want to show your support for our weekly writing, or because you like the idea of being involved in helping to create new, interesting pieces, we\u0027re grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd who knows, maybe one day Mike, Nicole, Pedantic and I will get to do that trans-Siberian railway trip we\u0027ve always wanted to do...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove and best wishes,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe gang at LR Towers"
