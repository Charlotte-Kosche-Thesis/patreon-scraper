    "summary": "Deadwood, South Dakota\u2019s writer/storytellers Scotte and Toni Burns are fascinated by love. Loves between couples, of course, but also loves of cultures and families - the places people thrive and the things they do that bring purpose and laughter to life in America. So, we travel the country by motorcycle, seeking and sharing those tales through video, podcast, compelling writing, and often just hanging around in odd places and telling people about one another!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u2019s important, because America isn\u2019t our big media, it\u2019s our people - and our people, while diverse, aren\u2019t as divided and at odds with one another as the news would have us believe. And that\u2019s not some Pollyanna fairy tale or wishful thinking; it\u2019s what we see every mile, and what you can share with us! it\u2019s the ongoing story of how, from coast to coast and border to border, a middle-aged biker couple from Deadwood, South Dakota (and you!) share the same humanity, laughter, love and hope with Native Americans in New Mexico, Vietnamese boat builders in Louisiana, street artists in Detroit, Jewish liberals in Jersey, conservative cowpokes from Montana, wealthy golfers in Martha\u0027s Vineyard, Amish families in Indiana and the hippies of Haight-Ashbury. As Americans, we\u2019ve lost track of one another a bit because we\u0027ve forgotten how to simply delight in one another\u0027s stories, the way humans have always gotten to know one another, coloring and preserving our cultures and histories. We tell those tales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome along for the ride! You\u2019ll be glad you did."

     "about": "SCOTTE:\u003cbr\u003eScotte Burns is twenty-four year veteran English teacher and writer. With a B.A in English and an M.F.A. in Creative Nonfiction, his work has been published in OnStage Magazine, Nth Degree SciFi/Fantasy Magazine, The GNU Literary Magazine, The Lahian, the Rocky Mountain News, Westword, and other publications. He has also produced manuscripts for two nonfiction books including Stealing Home, a book on at-home parenting for men, and The Forever Ending Story: A History of the End of Time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to his teaching and writing, Scotte is a well-known Colorado performing and studio musician/vocalist and has also worked as a Renaissance Festival swordsman and entertainer, a floral supply wholesaler, a traffic signal repairman, truck driver and landscape foreman. He loves dogs and some other people\u0027s cats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTONI:\u003cbr\u003eToni Burns is a natural born speaker. She is bewildered by the oft cited belief that Americans are more afraid of public speaking than death. With a B.A. in Organizational Development, and minor in Communications, she revels in the chance to turn her near-obsessive need for research into engaging, entertaining, and informative presentations. She has a creative writing side as well, having co-authored two fantasy novels, Fated, Book 1 of the Lorn Prophecy and Fable, Book 1 from the Djenrye Chronicles. Her love of gardening and all things growing translated to the pen (or computer, if you will) with her work published in Rodale\u2019s Organic Gardening Magazine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA biker and bicyclist, a mortgage lender and author, a Renaissance Festival full-plate-metal-comedic-fighter and cookie-baking mom, an environmentalist and a carnivore, dog lover, cat appreciator, born in Greece and raised in America, Toni is a bit paradoxical. A uniqueness that creates a need in her to understand how other people\u2019s heads and hearts work.",
