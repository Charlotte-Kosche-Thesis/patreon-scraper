    "summary": "Hi friends! What\u0027s a \"Lo-Fi Let\u0027s Play\"? Come gently explore vintage games and mysterious old design forms with me! It\u0027s part historical study and analysis, part sharing our pure and primordial memories of obsolete, vanishing games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePopular video game Let\u0027s Plays usually involve loud humor and cutting-edge reviews -- I speak softly over games hardly anyone cares at all about anymore. I think these works are still so beautiful and interesting, and anyone who loves graphics, design, video games or vintage computing may find something to love about them. \u00a0Most episodes run 20 minutes, fun but not too demanding of your time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzg7o-TF7gA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Lo-Fi Let\u0027s Plays reportedly have broad appeal among fans of ASMR content, too. \"Lo-fi\" doesn\u0027t just refer to the crudeness of the vintage games, but of my setup itself -- I\u0027ve been told the combination of a soft voice, the inbuilt microphone and the tapping of keys create weird and soothing sensory experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to check it out for yourself, the first, experimental \"season\" of Lo-Fi Let\u0027s Play\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/leighalexander1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003estill lives at my YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. There are classic adventures, weird surgery games, international dramas, and even an episode of Carmen Sandiego I recorded while hiding in an airport. What started as a fun outlet for me to recapture some of the sense of mystery and wonder I once felt about games became much more popular than I expected, and now people ask me all the time when I\u0027ll make more episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m50JcE8JbUk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the magic of emulation and the tireless work of archivists, the videos cost me nothing but time and love to make, and they are and will always be ad-free and available to all on YouTube. But sadly, life as a freelancer means that the things I get paid for need to come first, leaving passion projects to languish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have loved Lo-Fi Let\u0027s Play, your backing simply means I can make more episodes, more consistently. Backing is \u003cem\u003eper video\u003c/em\u003e, so you\u0027ll only be charged for the content I actually release.\u00a0Your funding also enables those who can\u0027t afford to contribute to continue enjoying the series, as I\u0027ll never put anything behind a paywall. With more substantial backing, I can eventually expand the mandate, listen to what you would like to see and hear more of, and spend time expanding my emulation skills and featuring even more games -- maybe even modern indie games that fit the \"lo-fi\" criteria!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for supporting this weird journey!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
