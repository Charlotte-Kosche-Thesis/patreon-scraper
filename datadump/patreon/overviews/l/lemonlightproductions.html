If you don\u0027t, we\u0027re LemonLight Productions, and currently we\u0027re creating a musical based off of Toby Fox\u0027s video game, Undertale! Specifically, the genocide route of that game. We also do comic dubs and song covers, based off of that same game, occasionally.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve decided to create this Patreon page to be able to give people that opportunity to show a little extra support - and hopefully produce better quality content as a result! We absolutely love creating what we do, and the fact that people have taken such a liking to it - to the extent of even having a slight interest in pledging to us here - sends us over the moon with joy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our patron, you will get access to Work-In-Progress parts of our musical, an exclusive Patron role on our Discord server (provided you\u0027re a member of it), access to patron-only Patreon posts and livestreams,\u00a0and exclusive song teasers! Higher tiers will get things such as early access to our videos, their name in the credits of our videos, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach our chosen goals, we will hopefully be able to provide better quality content for you guys, and maybe even some EXTRA content, for everyone, not just patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting this page, regardless of if you decide to pledge to us or not - we appreciate your support all the same! :D\u003cbr\u003e"
