    "summary": "This is where it all starts, welcome to the LIFE BINDER PROJECT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is about much more than a binder, or journaling, or even the daily routines, this is the journey to becoming a NO LIMIT person, someone who takes your dreams and engages in a daily ritual where you make turn that dream into reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve created 3 tiers - the FIRST TIER gives you access to the group and binder materials so you can be a practitioner of the LIFE BINDER system, the SECOND and THIRD TIER give you access into the BETA group, where over 12 weeks we\u0027ll be working together to CREATE the actual finished product of the LIFE BINDER and we\u0027ll be eventually turning this into a BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY for you so you can actualize your life dreams of freedom, travel, and living a lifestyle by your design!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe start officially on Tuesday, December 19th, 2017!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the night we\u0027ll have our first group teleconference via Zoom, at 6:30pm PST.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re going to be in the BETA group (SECOND OR THIRD TIER) you must register before Sunday, December 17th, 2017, which is the cutoff date.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can still register as a participant after the cutoff date, but you won\u0027t be able to be part of the BETA group, which is a once in a lifetime opportunity of being a part of the creation. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s the exact e-mail I sent out on the day this was conceptualized:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there, Forrest here,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast night, after packing up the car preparing for the fire evacuation, I had a whirlwind of emotion trigger a realization in me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(By the way, just so you know, everyone here is safe, and everyone I know is safe so far, thanks for all the Facebook messages of concern, I really appreciate it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was just 1 casualty in the Lilac fires, but it doesn\u0027t make it any less tragic...the person died from a falling tree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and the trippy thing to think about was that \"someone\" could have been anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt could have been me, or you, or someone close to me or you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all know life is short. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we don\u0027t really act on how short and how uncertain our life really is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mom is having some major health challenges with her MS right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have friends and family battling cancer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fires, although I know everything will be ok, can make it feel like armageddon is upon us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve lost a lot of the musicians and hollywood stars we\u0027ve grown up with that we thought were indestructible, people like Prince, Robbin Williams, Patrick Swayze, George Michael, and Carrie Fisher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and so a combination of these things stirred a feeling in me of something that just keeps telling me to seize the day. To really live each day like it\u0027s our last.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most of us just continue to stay stuck in mediocrity, or stuck in depression, or stuck in overwhelm, or stuck in procrastination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and most of us, not all of us, but most of us are saying \"Someday I will...\", but not really taking advantage of THIS TIME, and all the signs around us keep pointing to the same message:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWE ARE NOT PROMISED TOMORROW, SO LIVE FOR TODAY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this doesn\u0027t mean to quit your job and just start dancing in the streets...well, I guess there might be a time and place for that, but that\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what I am talking about is that we can certainly start living like each day was our last, starting right NOW!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and I\u0027ve been living more and more that way and now I\u0027ve been feeling so much more \"in flow\" with life that I\u0027ve been feeling free and good and happy and joyful DESPITE all the chaos, uncertainty, and suffering around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the suffering around me makes me even more AWARE that I MUST live life to the fullest NOW, and show others what I\u0027m doing along the way so that they, too, can live in this state of freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFreedom from worry, overwhelm, death, loss, uncertainty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take people away from that, and give them back the joy of being alive despite circumstances that feel overwhelmingly tragic and scary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I look at what my main focus has been in the fitness industry, although weight loss is a benefit to working in our programs, it\u0027s living a life of empowered freedom that is really my goal in working with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRECENTLY, I\u0027ve created a new LIFE BINDER for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been using my LIFE BINDER (or past variations of it) to accomplish major things in my life such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Staying in shape\u003cbr\u003e- Being more productive\u003cbr\u003e- Writing my first book\u003cbr\u003e- Starting a Yoga practice\u003cbr\u003e- Transitioning into becoming a 40-year old with a 27-year old body and mind\u003cbr\u003e- Running a fitness business and doing consulting for Fortune 500 companies\u003cbr\u003e- Staying positive despite negative circumstances\u003cbr\u003e- Creating new opportunities in life and business\u003cbr\u003e- Magnetically attracting some amazing, fun people into my life who have become dear friends\u003cbr\u003e- Deepening my relationships with my wife and kids\u003cbr\u003e- Creating new and exciting travel plans\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my LIFE BINDER, I\u0027ve been spending some time each day, writing out my goals, what I\u0027m grateful for in my life, doing a meditation to deepen my ability to connect to my subconscious mind, and then using visualization techniques I\u0027ve learned from mentors like Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Lisa Nichols to create powerful changes in my life.\u003cbr\u003eMy LIFE BINDER has become the CORNERSTONE for my mindset practice, and I strongly believe that mindset is just like exercise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e|| If you engage in an exercise routine daily, your body gets stronger. ||\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e|| If you practice a mindset daily, your life gets clearer, easier, and more joyful. ||\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach time I\u0027m write in my LIFE BINDER, check off my \"3 Wins\" each evening, see improvements in my relationships with my wife and kids, see that I\u0027m accomplishing my fitness goals, and my financial opportunities keep opening up, I know more and more that I can\u0027t keep this LIFE BINDER for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share the LIFE BINDER with you, and with the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only thing is it\u0027s still in it\u0027s BETA version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still making some improvements on it, finding ways to make it better, and creating a more fluid use-ability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and this is why I want YOU to be involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***I\u0027m inviting 12 people to help me finish creating the LIFE BINDER, and to share in the journey with me.***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need people to help me test it, get results in their life, and then share a testimonial so I can start to gift this to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a LIFE BINDER CO-CREATOR, you\u0027ll be working with me for the next 3 months, outlining your goals, creating the LIFE BINDER that will be customized to you, and then getting to work on taking action so that you see real world results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have goals for weight loss, career, finance, travel, or to repair, find, or deepen relationships, then this is what we\u0027ll be using the LIFE BINDER for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve used and even talked about my LIFE BINDER before, but I recently went and re-vamped it, improved it, and the result has me super excited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m using it right now to completely accelerate my progress on my life goals, and my business goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve used it in the past, and then I\u0027ve stopped using it, and I\u0027ve started up again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and the difference in me when I\u0027m using my LIFE BINDER and when I\u0027m not has been night and day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not using my LIFE BINDER, I\u0027m doubtful in myself, I\u0027m fearful, I\u0027m confused on which actions to take in my life, I procrastinate, I get frustrated and snap easily at my kids, and I make excuses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, when I am using my LIFE BINDER, I\u0027m clear, focused, I eat more nutritious foods, I take my vitamins, I make my workouts a priority, I spend quality time with my wife and kids, I feel so much better about myself, and as a result of that I feel on top of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it might sound goofy, it might sound crazy, it may sound like I\u0027m exaggerating but I can\u0027t help but share this with you because it\u0027s SIMPLE and it WORKS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I use a binder and not an iPad is NOT because I\u0027m \"old school\" and I\u0027m trying to avoid high-tech apps or iPads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s actually because research shows that when you WRITE things down your subconscious mind retains it far better...and personally, I do admit, I just like the feel of the binder in my hands.\u003cbr\u003eI like turning the pages, feeling the paper, and writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and if that\u0027s what creates better results, then even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m inviting you today to join me as a co-creator and an ambassador with the LIFE BINDER.\u003cbr\u003eHere are the details if you want to be involved:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 1) We get on the phone so I can find out specifically how the LIFE BINDER will be able to help you. I\u0027ll ask a couple questions like \"What is it you want in your life? Who do you want to become? What do you want specifically in the different areas of your life?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 2) If after the questions we both feel this is right for you, I\u0027ll go ahead e-mail you all the documents so you can print them out on your computer and put together your own LIFE BINDER right away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Be prepared, this isn\u0027t just a blank journal, there\u0027s major content here - areas for clarity and self-exploration, calendars, action list pages, a section with \"The 4 Pillars of Mindset\", and \"mental movie\" journal, an avatar creation section, affirmations pages, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 3) We set up a weekly call (time and day to be determined) where we can all meet as a group over a video chat to discuss our progress each week for the next 12 weeks, you\u0027ll be using the LIFE BINDER daily (5 days a week minimum).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 4) We continue to see improvements in our selected areas of our life each week and at the end we have a celebration party event and an award night to recognize our wins!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep 5) You help me launch this to the public, and we figure out some way to get you involved so that if you want to be a seller or distributor ambassador you can actually make a decent income with this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be one of the 12 people I\u0027m selecting for the LIFE BINDER team, just text \"LIFE BINDER\" to 650-771-5149 and we\u0027ll set up a time to get on the phone.\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I can only take 12 people is that I need to spend a considerable amount of time with each person and any more than 12 will be overwhelming to me with the other projects I have going on right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce selected as a LIFE BINDER CO-CREATOR, know that you will have entered on the ground floor of something my intuition tells me is going to change a lot of lives on this planet, and I can\u0027t wait to work on this exciting project with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce the final 12 LIFE BINDER CO-CREATORS are selected, I\u0027ll be assigning each person a specific task, or job, that you\u0027ll be responsible for and for some of these it will help if you already have certain skills, but if not, no worries you can develop skills as you go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s never really skills that impresses me, it\u0027s attitude. With the wrong attitude no matter what you do, it\u0027s hard to make it work. With the right attitude you can learn the skill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big part of the reason I\u0027m assigning these jobs, is because in the past I\u0027ve tried to do similar things myself and I can get distracted or overwhelmed by taking on too much, so I will need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the jobs I need volunteers for...(NOTE - not all of the LIFE BINDER CO-CREATORS need to volunteer, just the ones who want to):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Someone who will send out the video conference link and reminders for the weekly call to the group (I need someone reliable for this)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Someone who can manage a closed Facebook group for the LIFE BINDER CO-CREATORS and keep the conversation going (if you\u0027re a people person and you like FB, you\u0027ll be perfect at this!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- 2 or 3 volunteers who can help plan the celebration event we\u0027ll have after the 12 weeks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Someone with business and marketing skills I can bounce ideas off of\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Others? Can you think of other things the group might need? Let me know!\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited to put this group together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s something that I\u0027ve been wanting to do for a long time, and it\u0027s taken a landslide of events and circumstances to finally bring this BETA for the LIFE BINDER out into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like you want to be a part of this co-creator team, if you want to work on YOUR MINDSET and see improvements in all areas of your life, then this is for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be one of the 12 people I\u0027m selecting for the LIFE BINDER team, just text \"LIFE BINDER\" to 650-771-5149 and we\u0027ll set up a time to get on the phone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love, and remember to SEIZE THE DAY!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Forrest Folen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you may have some questions here, so I\u0027ll go ahead and answer some that I think you may have:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Does being on the LIFE BINDER BETA team give me access to mindset training?\u003cbr\u003eA. YES, it does...this all is about MINDSET, and I\u0027m excited to teach you all I know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. How much time do I need to put into working with the LIFE BINDER each day?\u003cbr\u003eA. 30-minutes to 1 hour each day (part of this will be exercising, meditating, visualizing, writing, ect. so you\u0027ll be able to maximize your time here in a powerful 30-minutes. If you refuse to make yourself a priority there\u0027s obviously nothing I can do, so you have to be willing to make the time to do this for at least 30 minutes at least 4-5 days per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. What happens if I miss the weekly call?\u003cbr\u003eA. We\u0027ll record it so you can have the replay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Is this a workout or diet program?\u003cbr\u003eA. No, but it will be a tool you use to actually stick to the workouts or diet that you already are doing or plan to do! In my experience, it\u0027s not knowledge that holds people back, it\u0027s lack of consistency and self-sabotage and this will be the tool for you to finally overcome that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. What about the holidays, is this a bad time to start?\u003cbr\u003eA. This is actually the best time to start...RIGHT NOW. It\u0027s best to put this in motion now, before the New Years resolutions fallacy tries to take a hold of you. Studies show only 8% of people reach their New Years goals, and I don\u0027t want you to be another statistic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Does this cost anything? What\u0027s the fee?\u003cbr\u003eA. I will be asking for an investment to be on the LIFE BINDER CO-CREATOR team, yes, but it\u0027s an easy investment that you\u0027ll be able to afford, and it\u0027s just enough to make sure you are committed to taking this project seriously. I don\u0027t want any flaky people involved, I need people who really want to see their life elevate to a higher level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. What\u0027s the price exactly?\u003cbr\u003eA. I\u0027ll share that on our phone conversation, because there\u0027s more to this than I\u0027m able to describe here, and I need to make sure you know the full details first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Do I have to be local to Oceanside, CA?\u003cbr\u003eA. No, we\u0027ll meet weekly over video chat, other than the celebration party at the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Why are you doing all this?\u003cbr\u003eA. Truthfully you may think it\u0027s a bit selfish, and it probably is, but my life operates sooooo much better when I use the LIFE BINDER regularly and I want to stay motivated in a group of like-minded people and I want to share with others how cool it feels to be on top of your life instead of drowning in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, To be one of the 12 people I\u0027m selecting for the LIFE BINDER team, just text \"LIFE BINDER\" to 650-771-5149 and we\u0027ll set up a time to get on the phone. Looking forward to this year of 2018 being your BEST YEAR EVER!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalk to you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Forrest\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. - If you\u0027ve been wondering how 2018 will be different than last year or other years, this is it. The 12 that join me, get ready to strap on your seatbelt, this is going to be quite a ride. If you feel nervousness in your stomach at the thought of actually doing this, then that means it\u0027s out of your comfort zone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comfort zone will never make you feel happy or fulfilled in life. The magic is outside of the comfort zone. ; )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
