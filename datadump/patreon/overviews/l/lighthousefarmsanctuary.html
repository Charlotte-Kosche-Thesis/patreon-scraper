Freedom from pain, freedom from fear, and freedom from oppression. We provide those with the most heartbreaking stories hope and the promise of the freedom to be themselves. A promise of companionship, of love, and of care. Our sanctuary is home to 250 non-human animals who have seen the very worst of humanity and every day they amaze us with their profound abilities to love and to be loved, even after the tragedies they have endured. Our goal is to share their stories with the community and bring about positive change in the way they are viewed by society. By fostering beautiful, meaningful bonds between people and the animals they may see as \"food\" or as \"things\" we are changing the future for the individuals who mean so much to us. People who visit and volunteer at the sanctuary often comment on the unique sense of peace they feel when being here. All of our residents cohabitate peacefully and have strong friendships with one another. They know they are safe and loved. We like to call it a kind of magic created by love, trust, and understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe desperately need your help! Every monthly donation allows us to feel confident in our care of our rescued residents while opening our doors to more animals in need. As Oregon\u0027s largest and oldest farmed animal sanctuary, we truly couldn\u0027t do the work that we do without your support.
