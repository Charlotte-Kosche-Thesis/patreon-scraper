    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eMake smut. Not art.\u003c/h2\u003e\nIt\u2019s a good word, right? Smut. We like its history of confounding the close-minded and being an affront to the enlightened. Art accomplished this for a long time. Historically, art has often been smut\u2019s synonym. But today we think art\u2019s accessibility, for creator and consumer, is inhibiting.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo do we create art? Sure we do, but why do we have to call it that? We wanted a different descriptor. Something inclusive. Something expansive. Smut.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMedium is dead.\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe don\u2019t relate to the classification of artist. So we call ourselves creators.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe term artist is too limiting. We just want to create cool shit. We want to write, record, and perform.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating is how we reconcile the beauty and the bullshit. And we want to share it with others.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOUR PAYMENT PHILOSOPHY\u003c/h2\u003e\nYou\u2019ll never have to pay up front for lo-class content that\u2019s released digitally. We don\u2019t think content should have a pay barrier. Barriers are exclusive. And we believe creation should be an inclusive process. If you like what you get here, though, we\u2019re always accepting contributions. Pay what you can. When you can. And you\u2019ll help keep lo-class up and running.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut we think you can contribute in other ways as well. Share our content on your own social media channels or join The Swarm by subscribing to our\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://lo-class.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eE-mail list\u003c/a\u003e.
