In April I\u0027ll change it back and it\u0027ll be back to normal. Thanks everyone!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to tell you cool stories about awkward bedroom eyes elementals, magical girls all-grown-up, and . . . trash magic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll new \u003cem\u003eTrash Romance\u003c/em\u003e stories will be released for free online at \u003ca href=\"http://trashmance.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etrashmance.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. But to do that, I need your support. Your contribution makes it possible for me to ensure only the highest potency trashmancer cuteness available without a prescription reaches you, the reader. It will also entitle you to a monthly digest in the DRM-free eReader format of your choice (.mobi, .epub, .pdf, .html) that collects all of that month\u0027s stories in one place. Contributors will also be able to ask questions to be answered by future stories, request themes or scenarios for characters to find themselves in (romantically or otherwise), contribute ideas to the world\u0027s lore, or suggest wrenches to throw into the characters\u0027 plans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is to make each new story interesting on its own, featuring a recurring cast of queers in love. While some plot threads will connect multiple stories, this is not intended to be a \"serialized novel\". I\u0027m running this on a monthly basis rather than a per-story basis because that way I can write each story the length it needs to be, rather than trying to hit a specific artificial benchmark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTrash Romance\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe coolest thing about magic? Duh, \u003cem\u003eit\u0027s magic\u003c/em\u003e. The worst thing about magic? It\u0027s magic. No one understands how the fuck it works. Yet for Mackenzie Chen, whose magic power is limited to manipulating the broken, cast-off junk of society, it\u0027s hard to not feel the world owes her an explanation. Or an apology. But when she meets magical girl-turned-barista Natalie, she learns just how valuable broken things can be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEqual Parts \"Aww...\", \"D\u0027aww!\" and \"Unf~\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want a good sense of my writing style, I point you toward the Delmyria short stories already available \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/72224\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMercy Killing the Dragon\u003c/a\u003e\" and \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/72236\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Last Warband\u003c/a\u003e\", \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/82344\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eParts: Part 1\u003c/a\u003e\" (available \u003ca href=\"http://mechanomorphosis.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efree on tumblr\u003c/a\u003e), or for those who crave more cuteness, \u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/NeonGreenSoul\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy stories on AO3\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can also check out my text-based games, \u003cem\u003ePlayer 2\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eReset\u003c/em\u003e, on \u003ca href=\"http://www.lifeinneon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrashmancers, Mechanomorphs, and Thanaturges!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, the core of this is \u003cem\u003eTrash Romance\u003c/em\u003e. That will be available no matter what. But if enough folks contribute to make it financially viable, I will also claw back my steampunk body transformation love story \"Parts\" from the spambots that clogged up the original site. And better still, \u003cu\u003eanyone\u003c/u\u003e who contributes will have free access to any of my self-published \u003cem\u003eTales of Delmyria\u003c/em\u003e via DRM-free digital download (.mobi, .epub, .pdf, or .html). Set in my original fantasy setting of Delmyria, the \u003cem\u003eTales \u003c/em\u003estories focus on the people and places that are mentioned but not featured in my \u003cem\u003eChronicles of Delmyria\u003c/em\u003e novels. You\u0027ll also receive a copy of any new Tales that I publish while you are a supporter.\u003cbr\u003e"
