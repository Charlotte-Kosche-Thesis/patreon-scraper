    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, I am Licorice Lain, but you may know me better as Slutty Haruka (on\u00a0tumblr) or Syrrea (on\u00a0Hentai Foundry). I am a writer who currently specializes in smut, particularly of the fanfic variety, although I am ready, willing and able to write original works requested by commissioners and patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to make every word count and imbue each one with meaning so you guys can get the most out of each story. I make things harder on myself so I can make my output more enjoyable, more meaty. And when you write chiefly about a subject like sex, more meat is always a good thing. It also helps the way I do commissions, allowing me to give the commissioner what they want in more compact, affordable package.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I mostly started out writing accompaniments to works by Sabudenego, I have several ongoing series, each of which caters one or more very specific fetishes. There are few limitations on what I will write about, all of which I list in the above liked guidelines. In addition to regular commissions, I also do Quick Commissions which are done at a reduced rate with same day turn around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause, like most artists, keeping up with expenses and delivering a steady stream of content gets increasingly difficult as time goes on. I have more ideas than stars in the sky, but with life pressures bearing down on me, it becomes harder and harder to justify spending so much time on what amounts to a glorified hobby at this point that I do mostly for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you get extra content that you get long before frequenters of other sites, as well as reduced rates on both regular commissions and Quick Commissions, depending on the tier. All of my posts (as of 10/19/17) are patron locked, but as a member to the $1 tier, you gain access to all of it, with successive tiers affording you increasing control over the content itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that all?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will devote some time each month to stories I want to write for myself, but my primary focus will be fulfilling commissions and delivering patron content. I tend to be quite passionate about the content I choose to do for myself, so you may find it interests you even if the subject matter does not fall within your own interests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
