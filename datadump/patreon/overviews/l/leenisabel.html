I\u0027ve been self-publishing my webcomic online for the past 5 years and have two books under my belt. What makes my pin-up art different from the rest is that I believe in body positivity and promoting self-confidence through each illustration I produce. I\u0027m a big fan of circus \u0026amp; aerial arts so you\u0027ll find much of that in my work as well. \u003cstrong\u003eYour patronage helps support my dreams of producing art for you! \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://leenisabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patreon1.png\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT POLE DANCING ADVENTURES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the beginning of 2012, Leen Isabel created \u003ca href=\"http://www.poledancingadventures.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePole Dancing Adventures\u003c/a\u003e, a weekly webcomic that focuses on the recent advancements and popularity of pole dancing as a sport and fitness activity. Her aim to present pole dancing as a positive movement has garnered her much attention in the pole dancing world and beyond as a cartoonist and spokeswoman on the subject.\u00a0Are you sexy, flexi, strong or spinny? Come laugh, get inspired and take a peek at what the world of pole dancing is really like in the 21st century. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMY GOAL with POLE DANCING ADVENTURES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to get readers to either lighten or open up to the idea of pole dancing as a legitimate art, dance, sport and fitness routine and encourage those of us who are already obsessed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow often is Pole Dancing Adventures updated?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe webcomic is updated every Monday. There are typically 4 comics a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G9AfuluX_kU/Uc_hmHCy5yI/AAAAAAAAFTM/LJRHOvjBAjw/s1600/72-any-woman-or-man-can-pole-dance-web.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I NEED YOUR HELP\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eTo make ends meet, I am also a freelance artist so I often have to split my drawing time with other professional jobs.\u00a0While I love what I do, I love to draw and paint even more and wish I could dedicate 100% of my time to comics!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince it\u0027s inception, I\u0027ve learned that running Pole Dancing Adventures can be a tiring, full-time gig! Besides writing, penciling, inking and coloring, I also run a shop selling prints of the comic strips which is also time consuming to print, package and ship. I also have inquiries for commissions but I\u0027ve been too busy to accept them! The income from PDA is minimal in that it helps me to cover material costs and a bit of my drawing time. And here\u0027s where I need your help...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWith your patronage, here\u0027s what your pledge would support:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- Dedicate more time towards illustrating Pole Dancing Adventures \u0026amp; pin-up illustration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n- Give back to the pole community and become a supporter for more pole dance competitions and events! I have sponsored competitions including:\u00a0 Brazilian Pole Dance Championship,\u00a0Miss \u0026amp; Mister Pole Scotland 2013,\u00a0Aerial Performance Tournament 2012, Aerial Performance Tournament 2013 and the Felix Cane Pole Championships 2015! And \u003cstrong\u003eI would love to sponsor more!\u003cbr\u003e\n- Future volumes of Pole Dancing Adventures! (Volume One and Two is now available. Thank you!

Think of it like a subscription where you donate a small amount of money each time I post a new comic. Since I update once a week, an example pledge of $2 each comic means I would receive $8 a month from you! If you pledge more per comic, then the total monthly donation would be whatever that is x 4. It\u0027s that simple!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s up to you how much and how often you would like to give and you can even set a cap on how much to pledge each month. Meaning, that if I went bonkers and created 12 comics one month, you wouldn\u0027t have to pay me $24. Just the cap you set for yourself which could be $8 or whatever you choose. (Using the example above.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d like to give back a little each time you read my latest comic, I would definitely appreciate it! Help keep \u003ca href=\"http://www.poledancingadventures.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePole Dancing Adventures\u003c/a\u003e online!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-diOW97ZSNX8/UljwgTZmF5I/AAAAAAAAFmY/36ac6kj0LXk/s640/86-pole-dancer-teacher-help-web.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDue to Patreon\u0027s unclear refund policy, please note that by becoming my patron, I will not offer refunds on past charges. If you need to edit your pledges for financial reasons, please head to your Dashboard to edit your support as needed! Rest assured that 100% of my proceeds will go towards the expenses I stated above and I appreciate your help so much!!\u003cbr\u003e"
