An accountable and coaching session to help you acheive your goals.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 things I can help you with...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Building and growing a brand or blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the space of a year, I have grown Love Her Wild to 4,500+ members. Within 10 months of launching, my own blog (www.theOrdinaryAdventurer.com) was receiving 7,000 unique monthly visitors and combined I have a social media following of over 8,000. I now get paid work speaking or delivering events, organising expeditions and via affiliate programs. I came second place in Outdoor Blogger of the Year 2017 and have been shortlisted for TGO Personality of the Year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I really did start from nothing. No network or contacts. Which is why I know you can do it too :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love nothing more than working with like-minded individuals to inspire their growth. I will spend time getting to know you and your website and where you want to take it. Can provide advice on different areas including SEO, social media and getting sponsorship opportunities (either products or services - like free hotel stays or activities). Monetising your website and making money through affiliates and advertising. As well as some inside tips on what has worked for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Adventuring\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, being accountable is a fantastic way to ensure your adventure happens...so let that be me! I\u0027d love to help you come up with an idea (I\u0027ve got lots!) if you haven\u0027t already, put into action the planning and what needs to happen before leaving for your expedition. I can offer tips on logistics as well as saving, getting sponsorship or reducing costs in other ways (free accommodation or discounts) and also on charity fundraising (I\u0027ve raised over \u00a320,000 for charity from challenges I have done). Plus, often the more important things, like confidence and building skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any questions or want to run ideas past me before committing, feel free to drop me an email: bex@loveherwild.com\u003c/p\u003e",
