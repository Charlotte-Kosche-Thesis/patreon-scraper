    "summary": "Ey up, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLens Think Yorkshire working towards tackling social inequality in Photography. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLens Think Yorkshire is A bi-monthly social in Yorkshire to meet, share work, ideas, \u0026amp; develop photography in the North. BUT we are so much more than a social. We want to provide support for artists, create collaborations between photography networks, provide peer reviews, pop-up exhibitions and residencies. We are setting up a new website, that will have interviews with artists working in the North, and provide a place to connect. We are also starting a mentor scheme, and running a series of workshop programmes focusing on socially engaged arts in the North of England. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eW H A T \u00a0\u00a0 I S \u00a0\u00a0 I T ? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLens think\u003c/em\u003e is; A creative group, a \ncommunity of people that can offer advice, a place where people can chat\n about ideas and work, it helps ease that pressure. It\u2019s also really \nimportant to have peers out there, on the more business side to network \nand to grow an understanding of the industry you work in.There \nare so many rejections in this industry we are told we need to be tough,\n and develop a thick skin. The problem lies in that most creative are \nsensitive people, the pressures can take their toll. A physical meeting \nwon\u2019t solve any of the problems within the photographic industry BUT \nwhat it can do is be a great place, to encourage inclusivity, to allow \npeople to be curious, to meet people that they can form collaborative \nprojects with.  Also to put on some events that allows people to \nexperiment a little with the medium, with other people and with \nthemselves.  I wanted to create a group where it didn\u2019t matter how \nestablished people were, where it doesn\u2019t matter what awards they\u2019ve \nwon, what university you attended, what class you\u2019re from, it\u2019s a meet \nup where everyone is welcome. \u003cbr\u003eOur launch event was May 11th 2017 in York.\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/281527135607690/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLens think\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e has a Facebook group which is open to anyone to join, an \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lensthinkyorkshire/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e that features interviews with new and more well known work by photographers who have worked in the North. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eW H Y? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I, (Joanne Coates \u003ca href=\"http://www.joannecoates.co.uk),\"\u003ewww.joannecoates.co.uk),\u003c/a\u003e started Lens Think in 2017 after a twitter conversation about the industry needing support. Lens think is by a creative / photographer / poor graduate / disgruntled Northerner / call it what you like that believes in supporting other artists and photographers. I grew up in rural North Yorkshire not knowing that Photography, or even university was an option for me, then I ran away to London to study where I was an outsider, worked a bit, came back, worked a lot, and thought . . . Do you know what, There needs to be a supportive network out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I graduated and returned to the North of England, I found it a \nvery isolating landscape. Photography as we all known is not a very \ndiverse medium in terms of who does the photo taking. There seemed to be\n a void in terms of connecting people, a lot of graduates, freelancers \nand established artists feel isolated. I really wanted there to be a \nplace where creatives, artists, and photographers could meet, ask \nquestions, feel supported and connect. After a Twitter conversation with the \u003ca href=\"https://unitednationsofphotography.com/\"\u003eUnited Nations of Photography\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.robhudsonlandscape.net/\"\u003eRob Hudson\u003c/a\u003e I\n realised that no one else was going to set this up. There were two \npaths to take, the first was to moan about the problem and do nothing, \nor the second was to set up a network to develop photography across the \nNorth myself.\u003cbr\u003eI took the second option and that\u2019s how \u003cem\u003eLens Think\u003c/em\u003e\n was born. I think it needs someone who is a bit stubborn, won\u2019t back \ndown but genuinely believe in the medium as a place for diverse talents \nto have the chance to make work in a democratic manner and for better or\n worse that person happens to be me. \u003cbr\u003eI think of developing work as a learning process, a vital part of that process is to share work with others. \u003cem\u003eLens Think\u003c/em\u003e\n is a place where people can meet, share work, talk, connect, and feel \nsupported. Studying in London there are many talks, events, exhibitions,\n groups that support each other. Moving back home it was a sparse land \nto navigate and I really wasn\u2019t sure why. There are some incredibly \ntalented photographers, creators, galleries, spaces, writers, creative \nliving and working in Yorkshire.\u003cbr\u003eI work full time as a freelance photographer, but I\u0027m trying to get Lens Think off it\u0027s feet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eW H A T\u00a0\u00a0 D O\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0 W A N T? // H O W\u00a0\u00a0 C A N \u00a0\u00a0 Y\u00a0 O U\u00a0\u00a0 H E L P? \u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to pledge upwards of $1/month to someone u\n want to support (it\u0027s an american website - 1 dollar = 76p).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will be used to pay for travel to events, to pay speakers, and create a mini wage for the activities, pay helped, put funding into the socials we do so we can do bigger and better things and make Lens Think start getting out there as an organisation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be proper nice if you could \ndonate 76p or more, but I get it I still can barely live as an adult because making it work in the Arts is HARD. Not everyone can afford to donate BUT if you do like what I\u0027m doing, and would like to support me, or share this, then that would be eqaully as brilliant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJo x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
