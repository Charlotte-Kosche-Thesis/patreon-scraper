Up\nuntil that point I had been on a path of destruction with little to no regard\nfor anything or anyone. Someone had gone to the prison where my father was, and\npreached the Gospel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy father heard the Gospel, repented of his sins and got\nbaptized in a prison bath, this day would go down in history as the day that\nchanged my life, a day where one man\u2019s obedience would lead to the many being\nmade righteous (Rom 5:19), although this statement, at its core is referring to\nChrist being the first obedient man, this led to my father\u2019s obedience which in\nturn led to mine. In the year 2003 I had the privilege of going to do a year of\nmy life at a ministry School called Pneumatix where I learned something of the\nimpact of Christian ministry, especially on the practical side of touring the\ncountry and presenting the gospel message in the form of music, dance and\ndrama. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt was at Pneumatix in a horse stable where God revealed to\nme that I had a gift in song writing and rapping, but it would take a journey\nof being teachable to perfect it, and a knee bowing humility to witness it\nbeing used in the right way. Law was the name I took on as an aka, for a rap\nartist. The name came to me as I had it in my heart to be a standing message of\nthe law of love that Paul spoke about in (Rom 13:8 - Owe no one anything,\nexcept to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law).\nIn asking people to love each other they would realize that they are unable to\ndo so apart from the very source of love, namely Christ himself. With this\nunderstanding, the Law was our tutor which, by showing us our sins, was\nescorting us to Christ. The name Law also stood well with leading Gods people\nin such a way that they would understand the meaning of having His laws written\non their hearts considering the new covenant (Jer 31:33-34), and that we are\nnot saved by good work but rather unto good works (Eph 2:10) and in this way,\nthe message of Law, is that we, in Christ Jesus, continue to uphold the law of\nlove by the power of the Holy Spirit (a call to love each other as Christ loved\nus). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLawministry came about in the following year 2004 as an\nextension of the original ministry, as to have a wider influence, not limited\nto one set of gifts, as I knew in my heart God had also gifted me with the gift\nof leadership, teaching and preaching which could not come to fruition if I were\nto stay and build solely as a recording artist, being under the banner\n\u201cLawministry\u201d it allows me to build with the same heart in mind towards the\ngoal of planting and leading a church. The kind of church that God had placed\non my heart is a church known for holding to the truth of God\u2019s word, being led\nby the spirit through the most important thing in the life of a local church,\nwhich is expository preaching, with regards to the whole counsel of God, and\nletting that dictate what the culture and community looks like within the\nchurch.  This is how people came to know\nme as Law and how the idea of Lawministry came about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVision of Law and Lawministry in terms of (what)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1.To create quality theocentric Hip Hop/rap music\nof an excellent nature and make it available to all people.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e2.Preaching the Gospel and Teaching the whole\ncounsel of God\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVision of Law and Lawministry in terms of (Why)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n[1.

Sound theology is needed, to deal\nwith reality, therefore my music will be confined to a theocentric nature and\nthe medium will not be placed above the message, whenever a medium becomes more\nimportant than the message it\u2019s trying to convey, it loses its power.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eObedience to the scriptures, (Eph 5:19) while\nPaul is talking to the church of Ephesus and telling them to walk in love, he\nadmonishes them to address one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,\nsinging and making melody to the Lord with their hearts, considering this, and\nthat my gift should be well stewarded, my music at its heart seeks to edify the\nbody of believer and set a sanctified witnessing example for all those who\nwould be drawn by the message it speaks. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe music, in its entirety, is an influential\nplatform that will gather a following, and at the right time, Lord willing,\nwill make the transition into leading a church more graceful.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e[2.

This is the reason why, I have\na heart for the body of believers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n \u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVision of Law and Lawministry in terms of (how)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the understanding of setting\nrealistic goals, in terms of achieving the vision I see with regards to Law and\nLawministry, I must say that one of them must take preference to help the\ngrowth of the other, although they are being done at the same time, the music\n(Law) side of things does fall under the big picture (Lawministry) which, has\nleading a church, as the big picture goal. While the big picture is being\npatiently worked out as I continue in the faith, I must be taking forward steps\nin doing what I can with regards to being a witness and an influence within the\nmusic side, as a realistic forward moving goal at this time. The following is a\nbreakdown of some practical steps I had planned to take to continue with this\nvision and understanding of what is needed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n[1.

This producing stage will need tools\nsuch as a general studio room and general studio equipment, all of which I will\nsource and grow as I go along, as the Lord sees fit to release Lawministry into\nits intended purpose. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe next stage is mixing and mastering, and\nalthough I have the skill and experience to mix and master music, it is never a\nwise decision to mix and master the music if you are the producer of that\nmusic, this is the \u201cfresh ear\u201d rule. To have an Industry standard, quality\nmixed and mastered album it takes a generous amount of funding, but this stage\nis very important in the process of making music, and having been in the music\nindustry for a while, I have gained relationships with key people in the\nindustry who are reasonably priced, which takes me on to my next point on\nfunding.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNow the big question is, how is this ministry\ngoing to be funded? Well in the past all we had as musicians was a day job and\nCD sales which didn\u2019t go very well because of the illegal copying of music and\nbig middleman cuts from business men, it is always a financial strain to keep\nthe music ministry going under these conditions. Now also with apple music\nchanging the industry with streaming music, it\u2019s even harder to keep the vision\nalive financially. A friend of mine from the States introduced me to Patreon which\nis the sliced bread concept for ministries like mine. What it is? Patreon is\nthe best way for creators to earn ongoing revenue directly from their fans. This\nmeans that I will have a profile on Patreon whereby I connect with the very\npeople who benefit from Lawministry, some of them will be fans of my music and\nother\u2019s will be supporting the ministry in the heart of getting the Gospel\nmessage out there, but these two groups of people are really one group called\nPatreon\u2019s that believe in this vision. I have named them \u201cThe Few\u201d (below is a\nfull detailed description of the concept of \u201cThe Few\u201d). These people can become\na Patreon for as little as one hundred rand a month that works out to an\naverage of three rand twenty a day, obviously, this is the minimum amount, they\ncan give more if they so choose to do so, that is entirely up to them. For\ntheir support, they get the following rewards from Lawministry\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e-Early and free releases of all my music\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e-Regular mini teaching podcasts\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e-Fam Fan chats (live)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e-Free entry to all the event where I minister or\nperform\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e-Upon sign up there is a complete album of all\nthe best works of Law\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e[2.

But on the journey to this\nrealization there will be much exercising of these gifts as to be diligent in\nconfirming this calling (2Pe 1:10)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere will be a discipleship process happening\nthrough Patreon to all who are willing to walk this journey with me.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConcept of \u201cthe few\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eThe idea behind, what I call \u201cThe Few\u201d stems from a desire\nI\u2019ve had from many years past, even if I think back, this desire was strangely\npresent from the start of my Christian walk and even in my vague awareness of\nit, I have held onto it believing that maybe it would be true.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat would be true? That God would choose to use an\nundeserving sinner like me to engage with the weighty influence that comes from\nbeing submitted to the authority of the Holy Scriptures. Now it must be said\nthat while some men have faith for the majority, I do not. Now I do have faith\nfor the few. Having diligently considered the cost of ministering the Gospel\nI\u2019ve been encouraged to take the little that has been given to me, and be\nfaithful with it, in the same heart as Mat 25:21 where Jesus teaches the\nParable of the Talents. So, the \u003cstrong\u003efirst\nsense\u003c/strong\u003e of \u201cThe few\u201d are those That God would have me extend this weighty\ninfluence towards through the means of Preaching, Teaching, and making music in\nthe understanding of Eph 5:19. This includes all those who will be influenced\nby this ministry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe \u003cstrong\u003esecond sense\u003c/strong\u003e\nof \u2018The Few\u201d is a sobering distinction between two groups of people from Mat\n7:13-14 where \u201cThe Few\u201d are the true believers that follow Jesus on the way\nthat is hard but leads to life as opposed to \u201cThe Many\u201d who take the easy way\nto destruction. This distinction highlights the nature of my hope for \u2018The Few\u201d\nwho would become companions united in the cause of the Gospel which if done in\ntruth and love, will with much hardship separate us from the crowd. Be that as\nit may, the concept of \u201cThe Few\u201d shouldn\u2019t be seen as an amount of people,\nbecause the emphasis is not on the numbers, but rather the separation. Those of\nyou that I would begin to call \u201cThe Few\u201d in the \u003cstrong\u003esecond sense\u003c/strong\u003e are those who would support me in helping \u201cThe Few\u201d in\nthe \u003cstrong\u003efirst sense \u003c/strong\u003ethrough various\nministering means as I mentioned earlier. \u201cThe Few\u201d in \u003cstrong\u003eBoth senses\u003c/strong\u003e fall under one body because we all help each other get\nacross the finish line.

For the most\npart in the past my content has been aimed at the lost. There has been a season\nwhereby I put down the pen for a while to study the scriptures more intensely,\nthis came about after seeking wise counsel to which I heeded, the intention was\nto study the word before it is spoken, although that will be an ongoing\nendeavor, I\u2019ve picked up the pen again. I\u2019ve realized there is only so much to\nsay to the lost, namely \u201crepent and believe the Gospel\u201d and the fact that repentance\nis available to them is Good News as it was to me. But what I must say to the\nbody believers is vast, intricate, delicate, exhorting, encouraging, building,\nuplifting and God glorifying. Also, considering (2Pet 2) and (Jude1:3) I\ncouldn\u2019t be more intentional in bringing to light that fact that the enemy\nwalks around like a lion seeking whom he may devour.\u00a0Between the years two\nthousand and six and two thousand and eight, I released two full studio albums\n\u201cThe Law of Love\u201d and \u201cThe Good News\u201d of which I gave a way for free for the\npurpose of ministry, out of those two albums I had three number one hits on the\nChristian contemporary charts and my songs are still being played on radio to\nthis day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn sharing with you who Law is, and bringing an\nunderstanding of what Lawministry is, and in painting a picture of the vision I\nsee, what it is, why I have a passion for it and how I envision it to be a\nrealized, along with a vulnerable insight into how my lyrical content comes to\nbe.
