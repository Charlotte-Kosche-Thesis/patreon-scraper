    "summary": "I am Anna-Lynne (aka Lotte Kestner), welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a career musician who entered the music industry at the tail end of the major label-only era of music in Los Angeles, where all music was physical, managers and tour bookers were necessary, and home recording was rare. I\u0027ve embraced the shift to social media-fueled promotion in the last decade, started my own independent label along the way, and picked up the skills to engineer and produce my own solo albums, putting out 4 albums as Lotte Kestner (and 2 albums of cover songs). They are all bedroom recordings in the literal sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the release of my latest album, Off White, I took a small step back toward what used to be familiar, pressing CDs and vinyl with Saint Marie Records, shooting music videos, photo shoots, hiring Seattle\u0027s best string arranger. I was also in my old favorite studio recently recording harmonies on a friend\u0027s record and it reminded me of the excitement of the studio and what having a label budget used to afford musicians in terms of exploration and production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith some recent exposure from Spotify playlists, the inclusion of one of my songs on HBO\u0027s The Young Pope, and a re-release of a couple of my albums in Japan, it feels like the right time to take my music out of the bedroom at least for some of its elements, and sink a bit more money into the sound and presentation of my songs. (This is where you come in.) This includes making more music videos, performing in new cities, and incorporating permanent band members. My first band, Trespassers William, was a four-piece studio band, and my second project Ormonde was a duo that recorded in remote locations and set ourselves strict time limits to write and record our albums. Whatever is next for me, I hope to incorporate my experience from these projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned in my accompanying video, I feel a desire to scale back my sharing of poetry, demos, and behind the scenes moments from Facebook and other major platforms, and reserve those things for a more intimate audience, and hope to use Patreon for that. Each month, patrons will have exclusive access to my Journal ~ at least one photo, poem, and behind the scenes video of me recording a song, shooting a music video, session work, traveling on tour, etc. Plus a brief update from me. (My first post is already up! And please feel free to contribute to the community by commenting as a patron.) Upper tiers include bonus performance videos, opportunities to make requests, hand written notes, access to preview music videos before they are released, and actual merchandise rewards. The 2 top tiers will receive my new album when it is completed (and will also receive any b-sides I might release on Bandcamp in the meantime). \u00a0None of these rewards will detract me from my ultimate goal - to record a new album - but instead will actually help the process along. There are 5 tiers to pick from. If certain financial goals are hit, I will also share songs I\u0027m working on each month with all patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to keep making albums and books either way, but with a decent patronage I can add more to everything I am making. So thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnna-Lynne \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note, you are free to opt out at any time, although some Rewards depend on your continued contribution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
