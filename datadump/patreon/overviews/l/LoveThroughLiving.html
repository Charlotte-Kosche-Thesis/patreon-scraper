    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eOur Situation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am Sady Starlight a light worker from the depths of Shasta CA currently living in Las Vegas. I am the founder of Love Through Living and the Co-Founder of Happy Earth Market. My purpose on Earth-plane is to spread light, conscious awareness, positivity and peace with the humans who will listen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove Through Living is the heart of all my work. Sharing how to Love YourSelf, Earth \u0026amp; Others Through Living is what gets me out of bed in the morning. My initial thought when starting this platform was that sponsorship, ads and affiliate marketing would sustain all overhead. I was not wrong, however I was wrong in thinking that plan would maintain the sacredness of this brand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLTL has had a great start and we\u0027ve developed an enthusiastic readership. In the last year I have published over 50 mind, body, soul and environmentally geared posts and LTL has turned into a sometimes 50+ hour/week job for me! I love it, but now I know two things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) I want LTL to last forever. \u003c/strong\u003eThe trial run phase is over, it works. LTL has readers.. Yay! And moreover that there has been a slew of humans reach out and express gratitude for this source and outlet. It\u0027s the most fulfilling fun I\u0027ve ever had doing anything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) We need to make LTL self-sustaining for this to work. \u003c/strong\u003eMy savings is unimpressive to say the least. I am a minimalist with few things, fewer dollars to my name and no \"job\". I work full time at Happy Earth Market and am paid only by the smiles and hugs from the community. All funds I receive are through other entrepreneurship sources like web+graphic design, art, freelance writing etc. which goes directly toward bills, food and my two fur-babies. So, if LTL is going to last a long time, it must support itself.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about the long-term overhead plan I decided ads aren\u0027t the way to go. Not only are ads annoying and hurt the user experience, but they completely taint the sacredness of an otherwise wholesome source. That is why I am turning to Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a reader can donate whatever they want per month on a subscription basis and depending on your tier level of donation you receive pledge incentives! This is where it gets fun and where we really get to interact with each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHIS IS GONNA BE SO FUN, the moment I considered this platform my creative wheels began sinning out of control. I\u0027ve wanted to gain a more personal and intimate relationship with my dedicated readers and core support system; make a place to share my conscious thoughts and epiphanies, struggles and lessons on a day-to-day basis and other expressions of my human existence that goes above typical blog posts. This is that place \u0026lt;3 This will take you to the center of my mind, heart \u0026amp; soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur initial goal is $5,000/month. That goal will be enough to keep LTL as it stands going and GROW like crazy. Here\u0027s LTL\u0027s costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting\u003c/strong\u003e. We need an extensive enough hosting plan to support the highest spikes in traffic so we don\u0027t crash during those times and ruin everyone\u0027s joy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing Web Development\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s a blog and website, so there are always hair-pulling glitches coming out of the abyss and every now and again I like to add a new feature. More often than not I also need to collaborate with a programmer that has actual skillz, and that too costs money.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProgram Overhead\u003c/strong\u003e. The programs needed to keep LTL\u0027s aesthetic alive are monthly subscriptions and add up! (Photoshop, Picmonkey, Tailwind, Canva etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook Post \"Boosts\"\u003c/strong\u003e. This allows us to ensure LTL\u0027s new posts reach 1/2 to 1/3 of our Facebook and Instagram Followers\u0027 news feeds. Damn algorithms.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMailchimp\u003c/strong\u003e. Our email subscription service. The fee grows as our email list does.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Full Time Photographer\u003c/strong\u003e. This will get Nick out of his day job and on LTL\u0027s team full time. Our content will EXPLODE once this happens.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I need to continue to wear things, eat things and turn lights on as I work on content. Between programming, audience engagement, graphic creation, social media presence, translation and redistribution requests, spam comment deletion, content upkeep,  and writing posts my days are filled to the brim with LTL work - which as we\u0027ve discussed doesn\u0027t make me any money. By being supported financially from this brand I will spend less time hustling other entrepreneurships and can spend more time creating content for you. (it\u0027s kinda my dream guise.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there\u0027s the basics! With those aspects handled, LTL can fully support itself! \u003cbr\u003eBut as I mentioned before this will keep LTL as it stands right now, and I want to grow endlessly! Which brings me to our stretch goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStretch Goal - $6,000\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe stretch goal will allow us to take Love Through Living to the next level, allowing us to do things like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStart a podcast\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHire a second employee\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRedo the Website\u003c/strong\u003e. Love Through Living has had many face lifts in terms of aesthetics, but we want to go above that. LTL 2.0 would allow us to create a forum style portion which will give You the platform to interact with other readers by posting your own revelations, questions and answers\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur stretch goal would be undoubtedly amazing to hit, but to be simply sustained by reader support makes me eternally grateful, no matter what happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always thank you for reading and for any support you can offer if you should decide to. You are the reason Love Through Living exists. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Sady Starlight\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
