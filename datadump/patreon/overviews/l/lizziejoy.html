    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod didn\u0027t create us to be half brained people. My goal as an artist and seminary graduate is to teach people to use their much neglected creative right brain so we can become whole people. \u00a0Schools and churches are good at teaching logic and linear thinking. Sure, we need that, but with the cuts in arts programs in schools and the lack of acceptance in churches, our artistic side can just flounder. My vision is to foster creativity in children and adults so we can learn to draw connections, become innovative problem solvers, and express ourselves. I offer classes in creative problem solving, art appreciation for kids, and open creative time for kids to just play and explore, and more. I would like the arts to become available to everyone, regardless of income, so I am offering my classes on a freewill donation basis. Art gives kids an opportunity to learn how to express their dreams and emotions in healthy ways instead of engaging in undesirable behaviors. Students who possess creative thinking skills will be highly valued in the work place as they begin their careers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 My other goal is to create a place where Christian artists can strengthen their skills. God made artists the way they are because he values what art can accomplish. Yet an arts ministry is a foreign concept in many churches and artists so artists take their talents elsewhere. With Canton Creativate, artists can be affirmed that there is indeed a place for art, and a place for them, in the Christian faith.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0At this point Canton Creativate is just getting started, so I need to raise the money for our basic operating expenses through this site and sales of my art until we can be sustained solely on donations. We are currently in the process of registering as a non-profit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for your help to do the ministry I feel God has called me to do. My first goal is to obtain a steady source of income that I can depend on to support Canton Creativate. After that my second goal is to get the funds needed to officially register us as nonprofit, and there are many fees and I believe nonprofit status would give us opportunities to expand this ministry into new areas. \u00a0My last goal is to be able to expand the sales of my artwork so I can be financially in a better position to minister as I am called.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease pray about what God would lead you to give. Even $1 a month would give you the opportunity to follow my creator page and become my prayer warrior. You may discontinue at anytime, I hope you will be excited to become a part of Canton Creativate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
