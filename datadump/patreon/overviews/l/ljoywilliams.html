I\u0027ve worked to change laws, registered new voters, and trained and elected candidates to political office. My most rewarding experience has been teaching people how government and our political process works - or doesn\u0027t. I always enjoy teaching people how to take control of government, be it through workshops, speeches, over the phone or at brunch.  I will continue this work but I need your support to teach civic education to more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMost Americans lack basic cvic education. Schools only teach government and most believe civic engagement begins and ends on Election Day. We can make and mold this country into the \"democracy\" we aspire to be but we need better civic education to do that. I\u0027m going to do for civic education what Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson do for science. I plan to teach Americans of all ages, races and ethnicities how to engage in their own governance. The first step in that process is a little podcast show I call \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e#SundayCivics.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \u003cem\u003e#SundayCivics\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e#SundayCivics\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a podcast series for both the civically engaged and those who want to become more active. Each episode explores a current political issue and demonstrates how to take action. Guests include issue advocates, elected officials, academics and everyday citizens.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#SundayCivics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e the podcast is filmed, in part, before a live studio audience. We tape 3 episodes per recording session which are edited and released for free. Your financial support will help with the following;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpace \u0026amp; Equipment: \u003c/strong\u003eI\u00a0film multiple episodes at a time to keep costs low and maximize the budget. Your support helps me cover the cost of the rental and purchase of the video and audio equipment and renting a local community space to tape the show. Instead of filming in a studio, I rent local community space to financially support community institutions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePay Talented People:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I am blessed to have a talented group of predominantly women of color who believe in the mission and are talented at what they do. Your support allows me to pay everyone from the camera operators, editor, production assistant and even the interns.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarketing \u0026amp; Promotion: \u003c/strong\u003eAll of the episodes of the show are free but with so much free content out there it\u0027s hard to stand out. In addition to people like you spreading the word about this project, we have developed a small marketing budget to increase exposure and views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, your contribution supports me. While I am currently the primary funding source of the project I don\u0027t have Oprah money. You and I won\u0027t be the only ones funding this project. I have also sought support from organizations in addition to sponsors, affiliate programs and of course ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can make America the democracy our founding documents claim it to be. My goal is to educate and inspire everyday citizens to take the reins of control from who and what governs them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
