    "summary": "Greetings fellow Dungeon Delvers! I\u0027m Douglas Zielsdorf (aka \u003cstrong\u003eLastlaugh70\u003c/strong\u003e), and I\u0027ve been designing dungeons for more than 30 years. Love-at-first-sight with the \u0027magenta\u0027 Basic box set has led me down a long road and love affair with the \u0027world\u0027s most popular role-playing game\u0027 (you know the one!). I grew up (and still live) less than an hour away from the birthplace of D\u0026amp;D, played every edition of said game except the most recent, and dabbled in many other RPG endeavors. A true \"retro\" fan at heart, my newest fixations are\u00a0the retro-clone RPG,\u003cem\u003e Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry\u003c/em\u003e from Frog God Games, \u003cem\u003eCastles \u0026amp; Crusades \u003c/em\u003efrom Troll Lord Games, and \u003cem\u003eOSRIC\u003c/em\u003e (Usherwood Publishing).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been obsessed with \u003cstrong\u003eMega-Dungeons\u003c/strong\u003e -- the size, the grandeur, the complexity, and the daunting scope of theoretical exploration. \u003cem\u003eUndermountain\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eGreyhawk, Rappan Athuk, Blackmoor\u003c/em\u003e -- these (amongst many others) are classics that have fueled my imagination and dominated my RPG dreams since I learned there IS such a thing. I own, have run, or have played in almost every Mega I could get my hands on in the last 3 decades. I am\u00a0intent on producing some of my own -- this is where I could use YOUR help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe production of a Mega is a Herculean task to do well and thoroughly, alone,\u00a0if design is not your full-time job. I have a full time job, a wife, and what I\u0027d like to think of as a passable social life. I am here to ask for the support of the RPG community -- spiritually, cooperatively and yes, financially. I want to take my most recent\u00a0idea for an enormous Mega (about 30 dungeon levels!) --\u00a0present the concept, history, layout, and design suggestions for the edification of the RPG community. I want those interested to take this Dungeon and make it your own -- I want you, to help me, to make OUR very own Mega! This collaboration will start more as a design framework with which all can produce their own Mega-Dungeon, and with enough support may build into one of the biggest design projects ever! An achievable end goal could see full-blown publication of a completed super-dungeon! Initially, this project will be system-neutral. In the future it\u00a0will transition into one or more specific RPG systems -- true retro, retro-clone, and/or current editions. Looking optimistically forward, whatever the progression of this Mega entails -- this may only be the \u003cem\u003efirst\u003c/em\u003e of \u003cem\u003emany\u003c/em\u003e future Mega-Dungeons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have at my disposal, no less than 4 cartographers from which to draw materials for design. The maps of our Mega will be presented \u003cstrong\u003eFREE\u003c/strong\u003e of charge (I do not own them), as they are readily available online free for personal use. My personal/professional relationship with these talented individuals will allow for ongoing use of professionally-produced maps for our purposes. As the project progresses, additional material will become available (purchased or commissioned work) to help us fill in necessary gaps in the design. \u003cstrong\u003eTim Hartin\u003c/strong\u003e, of \u003cstrong\u003eParatime Design\u003c/strong\u003e will constitute the core of our map use -- and his brilliant talent will be invaluable for our project. The current cover photo is a portion of an example of his work -- in very cool \u0027old-school blue.\u0027 Additional maps and illustrations (in particular) will be provided by \u003cstrong\u003eThe Forge Studios\u003c/strong\u003e -- another set of outstanding artists. Some of their illustrations are featured in the photos for the reward tiers, beautiful stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the financing, any assistance will be appreciated more than you know. However, \u003cem\u003eplease \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edo not \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003espend any money you \u003cstrong\u003ecan not\u003c/strong\u003e afford -- for these purposes, only spend your most \u003cstrong\u003edisposable\u003c/strong\u003e of income. This is for fun after all, not to impose any hardship on anyone. Higher support tiers are for bonus materials and perks, and a portion of these funds will always be fed back into the Patreon (as I incur more costs) to provide an even grander, more useful tool for all involved. I intend to present 1 - 2 maps each month, and one associated post connected to it (with 2 tiered sections for the support tiers) -- as we hit higher goals, there may be additional tangential posts. If the cost of additional material is a financial strain, please feel free to limit your support\u00a0as you see fit\u00a0-- pay for what\u003cstrong\u003e you\u003c/strong\u003e wish to get out of this Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to look into this project, and considering support. If this introduction tells you nothing else, it should tell you that I am rarely short-winded when talking about anything -- and that goes DOUBLE for something that I am passionate about! Imagine what it may entail when I am discussing our Mega!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again\u003cbr\u003eDouglas (\u003cstrong\u003eLastlaugh70\u003c/strong\u003e)"
