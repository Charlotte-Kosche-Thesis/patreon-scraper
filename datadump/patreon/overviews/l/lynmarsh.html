One thing I love about Albert Einstein, is that he would never settle for what was considered to be the \u0027real\u0027 explanation. And he believed that imagination was profoundly more powerful than logic and reason ... or what was considered to be rational. He was continually exploring ... \u0027the Unknown\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing a blog for a couple of years,\u00a0Conversations With an Old One. My new series is called: Mythical Beginnings of a World Yet to Be.\u00a0I am the author of The Grand Tree, a children\u0027s magical book/eBook. And there is more you can discover about me from my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am beginning a new life, as though I am just entering this world. And this life is about enlivening imagination, discovering and revealing secrets of life, honoring and respecting nature as well as our own truer natures, and of course - writing wild imaginative, enchanting, and mysterious stories ... that hopefully inspire you to see life a little differently.",
