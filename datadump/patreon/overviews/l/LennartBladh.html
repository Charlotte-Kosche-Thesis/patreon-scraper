    "summary": "I have allways been curious and interested in learning new things in life. That have been the most important skills in my big project, so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my life on this planet in a suburb to Stockholm, and lived in a very liberal time concerning childcare and natural nakedness. Both very important in my case. Because where I lived children could play around, without our parents knew really what we did. This was in the 60:s and 70:s in Sweden. And the freedom we had was good for creativity and development. It was not many negative news about pedophiles and murders during that time either. So not much to be affraid of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the summertime many women were top-less, and even many \"nude bathing\" for both gender in a natural way, was common. I also lived a very nice \"Mogly - kind of life\" together with my fathers relatives every summer, with a dog as my best friend. That made my spirit also pretty free and opend-minded, I think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was the only child in my family, but I had a lot of friends to play with every day and two loving parents. The start in my life was very good but my parents divorsed when I was 15, so I got my share of misery also that I had to work with. And I am happy for that today, because otherwise I had not got the insight myself to develop this Holistic invention, I think. But it has been hard to work with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my childhood all kids walked or took the bicycle to school every day, and we played outside after school almost every day all year around. Also between the lessons in school were we out playing. I remebered that we did cross-country-running around a lake one of the three P.E - lessons we had, for several month, between the 4:th and the 6:th grade. The route we ran was 4,5 km long and all pupils made it together with shower in a 40 min lesson. I wonder how many regular classes in the Western World mannidge to do that today?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSerious sport was nothing most of us started with until after the age of 13 -14. I started with swimming wich was very good for my body-development and self confidence during my teenage-time. I had tried some socker, badminton and some table tennis also. But I liked swimming best. And had many good years as a swimmer and later a few years as a Modern Pentathlete. I learned that I was better doing many different activities then to focus on one. And I got many friends and made important experiences during that time. But had some problems with the seriosity in the elite-culture later on. But that is another story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday children have a total other physical start in life. Child-Play are mostly done sitting by a computer or phone today, and many parents are very affraid letting children play alone outside. Expecially in the cities, because of all the violence that people are affraid of. And sport is a very serious matter and start early today, wich leads to many kids finish their physical exercize very early too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is one important reason why we now need to compensate this \"lifestyle-change\" and work with this in a modern Holistic way. If not, this generation will be the first to develop without their bodies!!! That is why I want to do a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://webcoachab.se/?p=1688\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Holistic scientific resurch on Gotland\".\u003c/a\u003e To get the body into play again...Without competition, but in a systematic way for all children between 13 -18 years old. And because we are built to use it! P.E-lessons can never do all compensation for this alone. Even if I think P.E-class also need to be developed together with science and are very important too. Because everything counts! Here I prefere\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.sparkprogram.org/about\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSpark Programs\u003c/a\u003e before our Swedish curriculum. Because it is built on science based activities that will benefit different skills that our children needs today. Not built so much on how good the teacher is to use its skill in the teaching. But it cost money! The next system must be without. And I think we can do more locally by letting children develop their motorskills in the right inviroment. The body wants to move and will develop if we let iy. And that inviroment must be where children live. To use interesting things in the neigbourhood to inspire to play. The woods is the best place but we also can help by building interesting facilities that they play in even inside. To develop\u003cbr\u003emotorskills naturally instead \u00a0of do what we do today. Try to use knowledge about this area by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/signs-symptoms/age-by-age-learning-skills/coordination-and-motor-skills-what-to-expect-at-different-ages\"\u003efixing it or train it.\u003c/a\u003e Not so fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 25 years in the Swedish P.E-teaching corriculum and have had pupils in all ages, I think I know what I am talking about here. We only stress them here and dont develop them from their own possebilities and personalities. \u00a0I dont think we need any school system at all in the future though, if we live in Tribes where many adults are rawmodels and work on different things. \u00a0Children has got a \"innerdrive\" to learn. Only look when they are in the phase of learn how to walk. The problem is when adults make learning to a right or wrong-thing. Or a competition instead of play! But to get a lot of updated information about how to learn best will be neccesarry to spread on internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo know what motor coordination is will be a good start. But it must be in play children develop it. Not in competition.\u003cbr\u003e1. Spatial orientation (to control various directions of movement in the room)\u003cbr\u003e2. Balance of Ability (to stabilize the body in a posture or movement)\u003cbr\u003e3. Rhythm Sense (to see the rhythm of the picture and understand the rhythm of a movement)\u003cbr\u003e4. Responsiveness (quick start appropriate movements via the signal)\u003cbr\u003e5. An eye-hand and eye-foot coordination (to control parts of the body (hands/feet) in relation to the registering with the help of sight.\u003cbr\u003e6. Adapted power input (to adapt muscle optimal bet in relation to the movement in time and space)\u003cbr\u003eTo develop coordination skills you have to perform a breadth of activities that reinforce and make a conscious body and increases body control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can not hide knowledge as we do today and brand it. And try to use our sences and in a Holistic way as much as we can.\u003cbr\u003eIf we use statistic from the Holistic \"app-system\" in the schoolsystem we have now, both parents and other adults can do different positive things around the child, when they know about the reality. But the Holistic awareness about oneself is the most important part.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe natural nakedness today is not that common, I would say. It is more in anxiaty many go swimming today, because of the \u00a0overweight both among children and adults. Mostly the well-trained do it and like it. And that is unfortunately not many % of the population today. Many children are also affraid that someone take their naked picture and publish it on the internet, when they take a shower in school today. So many schools now must start building individual shower-rooms. Otherwise the children will not take a shower at all after P.E-class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is NOT a positiv trend at all, I think. Natural nakedness and body-self-confidence and sexuality is very much connected and to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://webcoachab.se/?p=1274\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ereach higher levels,\u003c/a\u003e we now need to develop this area a lot. And use progression pedagogy here as well. Then we must start with showing our bodies in a natural way at home. Then train \u00a0to show the bady halfnaked to others in school/swimming. But it is off course also important to keep as natural as possible. Force will never help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I even think we can develop cam-sex for teenagers together with science. Instead of this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/wSF82AwSDiU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eoverconsumtion of porn in very young age\u003c/a\u003e, that The New World Order have created today. And also try to be more open-minded about this area as a whole. I even think this is connected to a long and healthy life. Because resurch have been done on traditional people on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2627148/Inside-worlds-original-free-love-community-Trobriand-Islanders-change-spouses-want-dedicated-love-huts-settle-differences-game-cricket.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTrobriand Island\u003c/a\u003e a very long time by the Swedish archeolog G\u00f6ran Burenhult and others. Burenhult has also done very interesting local resurch on Gotland, that shows that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/ajpa.20234/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emen lived longer than women\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e5000 years ago here. Probably because of a more healthy lifestyle, and maybe they even lived in a more Matrairchal sociaty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I also know about another Swedish archeological studie from Burenhult, that people lived longer here on Gotland then on the mainland. That is also interesting, and at the same time in Scottland,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/skara-brae-prehistoric-village-p247671\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSkara Brae\u003c/a\u003e indicates a Matriarchal life in Prehistoric time without any war. And that culture stayed for 2500 years!!! Why not more information about this in our media, school-literature, science etc ? And traditional people in the Trobriand Island was in top of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://happyplanetindex.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHappy Planet Index\u00a0\u003c/a\u003estatistics almost every year a few years ago. But no news at all today? And they have a more sexual lifestyle and live in a more\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMatrairchal sociaty\u003c/a\u003e there. And have been doing it for thousands of years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a Human system, I think. But it is very hidden knowledge today, and the HPI-results can probably not even be found from theese islands. Because of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/H6vT8ER6zs4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esatanistic ELITE\u003c/a\u003e and their work with developing an Empire and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/SWLQ3b9vHOs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003econtroling everything.\u003c/a\u003e Their own sexuality is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/CvY7thwBVu4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003every screwed.\u003c/a\u003e Also a system when you get to much power, and that is another important reason to build a more matriarchal sociaty now. But for the ELITE it\u0027s very important to keep the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/CyFNsNZhSeg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePatriarchal sociaty.\u003c/a\u003e I will write about a few of their ways to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/7uXmRvEL6W4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u00a0\"The New World Order\"\u00a0\u003c/a\u003ewant men to be asexual and to bye porn from only a few very sexy women that work in this pornindustry. This is a market system. And to make us men feel ashame about this very important sexuality. Show a lot of news from rape and other sexual acts from men in the mainstream media. I think the goal must be to make SEX total free for us all. But maybe we need to pay some brave people to teach teenagers in a \"beginning stage\". Because\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/zJ-_m8KTvD4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esex is healthy!\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are given a picture from\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/5WBcG9eNBeo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e \"the System\"\u00a0\u003c/a\u003ethat you must be perfect in \"the competition of LIFE\", to dare to do things. If you do anything you must be very good at it. And that is in every field no matter what! That makes us affaid of trying to test new things. It is another system when testing and playing are the most important parts for humans to develop. And focus on accomplishment instead of finding who you are and the passion in life is real crazy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all starts in \"the grading schoolsystem\", where the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02680939.2014.892156?journalCode=tedp20\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePISA\u003c/a\u003e competition between the \"poppet politicians\" is very clear. And PISA is only logical parts in three subjects! How crazy is not that? When it is creativity we now need to develop to find the solutions for our future climate problems.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTo do this we need to find passion and use the whole body, mind and brain, I think. And we dont need any school-, economic- or political system in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is another reason for\u00a0systematically development individually for everyone by free will. Doing the investigation of my invention \"Holistic Student Profile\" where the physical, mental and spiritual perspective will be measured.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/L5KJOKkSKjQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHollywood\u003c/a\u003e is also a place where The New World Order controle our culture.

And that is off course because it\u0027s very important to keep us in marridge, to controle us. Expecially women. What will happen if they will start having\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/FpKdSvwYsrE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esex as the ruling male ELITE do?\u003c/a\u003e That can not happen! No, no...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it is also very important to scare young women in school and by mainstream media etc, about the risk getting pragnent. And also communicate that women dont think about sex as much as men. And keep on with that old paradigm year after year. But. Is it really true? I think this is individual and maybe different when in the menstrual cycle you ask. And women as a group\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/nrMMZRKok5o\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethink more of sex before menstruation.\u003c/a\u003e That is for sure! And some women can get multiple orgasms, but that is not so easy for us men.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we get big loans and are in a weak structure the bankers can also get controle of us easier.

The whole\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/1AgvgotuXiQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebanking system\u003c/a\u003e is really a mess that needs to change rapidly.

I also think this more \"real life together\" is needed to compensate for all digithal time that we have now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Have you ever seen a Hollywood movie with an idea like this or heard any politician talk about sustainable modern Tribe-living? Maybe we can develop our relationchips and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://webcoachab.se/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDirect Democracy\u003c/a\u003e, in this project on Gotland as well. It is a perfect place to do it with a strong local countryside-culture. But it will take time to develop, off course. And we are so used to a political system and think that it is the only way. But...It is NOT! And maybe we also can live without countries in the future and develop this as a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://webcoachab.se/?p=2000\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNew Modern Religion\u003c/a\u003e. But..that will be long after my lifetime...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is more thoughts about children perspective. Not a very big issue today. The Swedish political debate is more about the academic curriculum in preschool, then why we get children in the first place. Love must be no 1 in all relationchips. Because we all need that and feel it really strong when we dont have it. Maybe nr 2 can be equal sexuality (in the future). Because of all I have investigated in my insights here.\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003ca href=\"http://webcoachab.se/?p=994\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWe need to live in another way for the best interest of our children\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI hope you like my Holistic thoughts and understand that I am\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://webcoachab.se/?p=1625\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe Next One.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNo one else would do this Journey.

     "about": "I am a father, inventor and a social entrepreneur that likes to develop things in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am 53 years old and continues to evolve in life. We need to Zone On Science Overall now. And innovations need to be sustainable for the future, that is why we need as many people as possible to feel as good as possible, so that creation of sustainable solutions will increase. That\u0027s why I want to change the system we now have. It is only by increasing individuals\u0027 awareness that we can reach the top, not through increased control. To build a big \"application\", which combine physical, mental and spiritual perspectives, and will use free will and modern technology as a method. That is what I think will make a difference now. This app = \"Holistic Student Profile\" is a tool to raise awareness for The Whole Life for the individual, and also enables targeted initiatives for the organization. And conneced to digithal library with the best helpers this will be realy  great. We now need to evidence-base the whole System. \u003cbr\u003eGotland is a good place to do this scientific resurch together with Campus Gotland and Uppsala University. Of course, students and all adults that want to participate need to get the \" app\" for free, and after 3 - 5 years should  result be achieved. The app \"HOLISTIC  PROFILE for adults\", are more questions and alternative answers about work, management and economics, but the same standardized physical tests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e I also have developed plans to start a sustainable Tribe-Living on here on Gotland together with some friends. And at the same time also in Ghana Africa. Then film the process on both places how we develop and think in the process. Small scale farming and using natural energy eill ne very important. But even hunting, fishing health and tourism. \u00a0It will be a new modern sharing system where people dont go to school but go for their passion and help each other to develop. \u00a0I also have some ideas how to develop Direct democracy. If the tribe have concensus decissions where the best idea win can this also be done on the next level. No money and equal sexuality is also very important. \u00a0You can read and watch more here.\u003cbr\u003ehttp://webcoachab.se/?p=1688\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
