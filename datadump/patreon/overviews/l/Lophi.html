If I can make 1000$/month, I can make this my reality, my life, if not, i\u0027ll probably have to reduce drastically the amount of time I can put on content creation. I\u0027m a random dude shooting for his dreams, and I could use a little bit of help to get there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon was created to help me maintain myself, but it is to me nothing but a starting point. I have many big ideas for future projects, personal for some, but mostly on the content creation side of things, I want to bring you guys with me on an adventure, but I cannot accomplish this alone, this is why any money that I will make, out of my living costs, will go towards improving my content, or even creating entirely new segments to what I already create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me on this adventure, I will show eternal gratitude towards you, if you feel like passing, I appreciate that you took the time to read this and consider your options. \u003cbr\u003e"
