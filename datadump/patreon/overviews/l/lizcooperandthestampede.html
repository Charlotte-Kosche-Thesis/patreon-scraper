She spent the majority of her life developing her golf skills, only to drop her college scholarship to move to Nashville and pursue music. \u201cWriting songs and playing the guitar came as naturally to me as golf did. But music tickled my brain in a way nothing else ever could.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, Liz didn\u2019t know a soul in Nashville when she moved. So, she went and got a job at a familiar place: a country club. \u201cLiz may not have known anyone when she moved here,\u201d says the Stampede low-end provider Grant. \u201cBut now, I feel like she knows pretty much every person she walks past. She just doesn\u2019t stop smiling, and people don\u2019t stop smiling back.\u201d Coincidentally\u2014or not so coincidentally cuz, well, Nashville\u2014some fellow co-workers at the country club also had a band. They called themselves \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eFuture Thieves\u003c/em\u003e, and they offered to record Liz\u2019s first EP, \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eMonsters\u003c/em\u003e. After that, Liz began writing songs as frequently as she smiles. She formed a band with Ky Baker on drums and Grant Prettyman on the weird long guitar, and they recorded the \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eLive at the Silent Planet\u003c/em\u003e EP. And now, there\u2019s enough new songs to record a full-length album.\u201cThe record we\u2019re working on now is a combination of Liz\u2019s darkly-lit, reclusive songwriting habits, and Grant and I\u2019s Rolling Rock induced rock and roll\u201d chimes Ky. \u201cIt\u2019s about bringing our different styles together to create something that makes us all question what kind of music we even like anyways.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
