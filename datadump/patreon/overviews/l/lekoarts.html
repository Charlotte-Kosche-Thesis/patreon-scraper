For my freelance work I\u0027m primarily doing Webdesign, Illustration and Logodesign. In my spare time I\u0027m gratuitously\u00a0working for \u003ca href=\"https://www.elitepvpers.com/\"\u003eelitepvpers.com\u003c/a\u003e and creating Photo Manipulations \u0026amp; 3D Artworks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you create this Patreon page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince I\u0027m completely self-taught I create tutorials myself for multiple years now as it\u0027s just logical to give something back to the community. In addition to that I also shared projects of mine for free. But as the responsibilities of life finally reached me I struggle to find enough time to keep my output of tutorials and freebies. I felt that Patreon is the perfect place to share my projects. I appreciate all support and will use it to make better tutorials and images!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFirst and foremost: As of today all my tutorials are free for everyone. I\u0027d like to keep it this way but maybe I\u0027ll create patreon-exclusive tutorials someday ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you\u0027ll get the renders/images of my projects in High-Resolution (up to 4K). \u003cbr\u003eIn the next tier you\u0027ll get the assets of these projects. \u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly you\u0027ll get all assets of my tutorials to follow along the instructions even better! You can also contact me if you\u0027ve got questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease contact me if you want to use the images commercially!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about \"elitepvpers\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI already mentioned in the introduction that I\u0027m gratuitously working for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.elitepvpers.com/\"\u003eelitepvpers.com\u003c/a\u003e which is Germany\u0027s biggest online gaming forum (it also includes a big marketplace for people to trade virtually anything). When I started to visit elitepvpers I mainly talked with people in the Art section, participated in contests and released my first tutorials. Wow, that was \u003cstrong\u003e5\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyears\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0ago! Time flies by... Since then I joined the moderator team and finally joined the administrators in 2017. I enjoy working on this forum, chatting with its users and creating content for them. But sadly I can only use my spare time to improve elitepvpers - all staff members contribute to elitepvpers in their spare time. We\u0027re all fine with doing this for free but as the userbase grew, the marketplace became super popular and therefore the amount of needed Developers increased we realized that everyone doing this in their spare time won\u0027t be sufficient anymore in the future. It would be more than helpful for elitepvpers to have one or two developers who can be partially/fully available. Because we all want to make elitepvpers a better place!\u003cbr\u003e\n__________\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for the support and keep learning! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e__________\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFind more of my work:\n\u003cbr\u003e\nlekoarts.de\n\u003cbr\u003e\ninstagram.com/lekoarts.de\n\u003cbr\u003e\nyoutube.com/LekoArtsDE"
