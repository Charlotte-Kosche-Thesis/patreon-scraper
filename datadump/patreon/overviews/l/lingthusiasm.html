    "summary": "Lingthusiasm is a podcast that\u0027s enthusiastic about linguistics. Each month,\u00a0your boring commutes or chores get transformed into a lively linguistics conversation\u00a0between Gretchen McCulloch (allthingslinguistic.com) and Lauren Gawne (superlinguo.com). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we want to let you do more than just listen in \u2014 we want to bring you into the conversation. We\u0027ve been getting some fantastic listener questions and comments already, and we\u0027d love to have more time to answer them and give our listeners more time to connect with us and each other. The podcast is entirely independent, which means that we can go deep into the fun linguistics nerdery, but also that we rely entirely on the support of our listeners to create monthly podcasts and transcripts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal: For the small price of a monthly latte, you get bonus content every month! That\u0027s right, you get to enjoy twice as much time with Lingthusiasm! Plus, you get access to the archive of previous bonuses, which include swearing, teaching yourself linguistics, explaining linguistics to employers, the doggo meme, hypercorrection, conlangs, what makes something a sandwich, and language play \u2014\u00a0and you can listen right now as soon as you pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you buy our coffee too, you can ask us your linguistics questions or suggest topics you\u0027re interested in for the bonus episodes. For more, you can videochat with us!\u00a0Plus, all patrons get to vote on bonus topics, request custom colours for IPA scarves and other merch (just send us a message via Patreon or at contact@lingthusiasm.com), and be the first to find out about meetups, liveshows, and other exciting announcements! We deeply appreciate every level of contribution to keeping Lingthusiasm ad-free and sustainable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter sustainability, we have some pretty cool expansion plans \u2014 better mics, interviews with guest linguists, regular bonus episodes, snazzy art, and even a liveshow (!!!). We\u0027ve been blown away by the response so far \u2014 if each of our listeners gave just $1, we\u0027d already be way past our highest goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t afford to pledge? That\u0027s okay too. We\u0027re keeping the main episodes of the podcast free, and there are some rewards, like no ads, better mics, and guest linguists, that all listeners will benefit from. If you can\u0027t pledge, it\u0027s also super helpful to leave us a rating on iTunes, share this page, and recommend Lingthusiasm to anyone who needs a little more linguistics in their life.\u003cbr\u003e"
