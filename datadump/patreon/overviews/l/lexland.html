You will be helping me pay my rent, health insurance, food, utilities, and preventative health care for my sweet doggies! Who knows, maybe I could even upgrade my giant ancient van to a slightly newer, less-about-to-fall-apart beater. At least I could finally get the suspension fixed so I don\u0027t have to feel like I\u0027m on the Indiana Jones Disneyland ride every time the speedometer reaches 58. (This is also real and not a joke.) All of this means something really important... I COULD WORK ON MUSIC FULL-TIME!",
