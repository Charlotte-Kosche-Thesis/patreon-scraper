    "summary": "Hello Cadets!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s been a great ride so far, but we\u2019re just getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what\u0027s Patreon? if you\u0027re just showing up here for the first time....here\u0027s the lowdown:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re a fan of Launch Point and want to support me in the creation of new songs/videos/writing/tours and more random, unpredictable things, this is the place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Backstory:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost artist have been struggling to find the right platform for ongoing support, through which they can release constant material (and get paid).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve gotten to know myself. as a creator, as a songwriter, and as a recording artist, but also as a fan myself, and I thrive on instant gratification and a direct mainline to my audience without having to go through labels, distributors, the machine, and mass media. I love making things and instantly sharing. I know my fan base: you\u0027re smart, kind, supportive, positive music lovin\u2019 people. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe all started learning how to trust each other with kickstarter, pledgemusic, indiegogo. I think subscription sites like Patreon are the new revolution in music-release and art patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat i\u0027m doing diverts from most conventional approaches: I try to release pretty much ALL MY ARTISTIC CONTENT for free: the songs and videos live FREE on youtube, bandcamp, my site, wherever. (yes, music is also available on iTunes and other various online outlets, but i\u2019d rather people experience it free than to never have it at all).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTHAT IS HOW I LiKE IT. Not everybody wants to buy it. That\u0027s fine. It\u0027s yours, it\u0027s everybody\u0027s, you can take it, you can share it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut to DO this: I need support, true patronage. Those willing to be the driving engine to pay for the recording studios, the filmmakers, the office rent, the staff costs, the gas, the food, the lodging. I need a salary and a budget. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI really believe in the future of crowd-power and what these people and companies are doing. It isn\u0027t making world news, because it is what it is: a quiet, underground network of artists connecting directly with their fans, bypassing the entire commercial system. This is AWESOME. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are the days of negativity and tumblr outrage, the bright side of the net: it is how the web can really *save artists* in an art-economy that is floundering. AND it means YOU need to step up and support the artists you love, the political cartoonists you want to see bravely satirizing the system, the painters you want to see reflecting their realities, the musicians you want filling your hearts and your speakers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTHIS IS HAPPENING! AND HERE YOU ARE!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is more of a commitment than a kickstarter campaign: an ongoing commitment to me and my music. Though you do get to road test it if you\u0027re scared (you can pull out before you\u0027re charged at the end of any month, so it\u0027s risk-free).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKickstarter is like a serious date, this is like getting married. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore backstory? I\u0027ve been flailing (often happily, for sure) since I started this band in 2008. Self-releasing and distributing CDs isn\u0027t easy. Giving my music away for free online has been an adventure, but not as sustainable as I expected. You may be surprised to know that \u201cFrom Where To There\u201c - even with a Grammy ballot appearance and rave reviews in the press - sold relatively few copies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut while kickstarter is awesome for huge one-time projects, I don\u0027t want to be repetitive and exhaust the fanbase with \"HEY I\u0027M MAKiNG YET ANOTHER RECORD, PRE-ORDER HERE....AGAIN!.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI just want to be able to go into the studio, make music with friends, call a film director, make a video, take a few months off, write, record, and press PUBLiSH when I\u0027m done. INSTANT\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also don\u0027t want to have to think up \u201cclever\u201d merchandise (I know we all love fuzzy posters, and t-shirts, mugs and tea-cozies....but how much Stuff is too much Stuff before we don\u0027t need any more Stuff cluttering up landfills?)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDon\u0027t get me wrong: I\u2019m not going to give up on physical merchandise (I mean, manufacturing my own vinyl and t-shirts is great) and I\u0027m not going to give up on collecting my music into \"albums\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Au5w1KA87mI?showinfo=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nAbout money:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSOME THINGS COST A LOT OF MONEY! Some of the projects have had budgets of $15,000 or more. SOME THINGS COST ALMOST NOTHiNG! A song like \u201cStare Out\u201d cost me a few thousand dollars (to pay for studio, mixing, and mastering time).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe idea here is that you trust me to use the ongoing budgets as we see fit. Not every project will cost the same...but the more budget we have, the more fun \u0026amp; crazy stuff we can do, The more staff we can pay (and the better we can pay the staff we already have), and more we can spend on artistic collaborations. We like feeling like a pipeline through which money can flow. It gives me great pleasure to be able to pay other artists to Do Their Things as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s the key: THIS IS A HUGE EXPERIMENT. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you guys know me, you know I LISTEN. We\u0027re here to make this work together, and we will.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven if you\u0027re a one dollar backer, I want to know what you\u0027re digging about the platform and what\u0027s bugging you. The conversation (via comments here, and on twitter and facebook) will help us know where to take this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery patron who\u0027s supporting us is important to this community, YOU\u0027RE who we\u2019re creating for, and I\u0027m glad you found me here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you\u0027re backing us for a dollar or ten dollars...THANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Thanks\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2018Evs\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n............\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nF.A.Q. (frequently asked questions)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have questions, please submit them on twitter, on facebook, on the website (\u003ca href=\"http://launchpointmusic.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elaunchpointmusic.com\u003c/a\u003e), or here on the patron stream once you sign up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u201cI have a question about your patreon, who can I contact?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: reach out to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:info@launchpointmusic.com\"\u003einfo@launchpointmusic.com\u003c/a\u003e and they will get you sorted!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nQ: \u201cWhy are you charging Per Thing versus charging Per Month, like some other Patreon artists?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: I thought hard about charging Per Month instead of Per Thing, because Patreon lets you do either, and a lot of artists are successfully charging per month. However, that makes me nervous: what if i\u2019m traveling and touring and/or taking off time for three months in a row and don\u0027t have output to share? i\u2019d feel guilty. I do my best work consistently; but life happens. Per Thing seemed safer. Here\u0027s how I figure it: Patreon has a MONTHLY CAP, so if you want the security of only EVER paying $10 a month, because that\u0027s what your budget allows, you can CAP at $10. That way it\u0027s like paying $10 per month, WITH the added advantage that if I decide to post No Things in a given month, you\u0027ll be charged NOTHiNG. So it\u0027s technically better for you, and I won\u0027t feel guilty, ever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nQ: \u201cBut if I cap my backing at $10 a month, does that mean I won\u0027t get ALL THE THINGS? I want ALL THE THINGS!!!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Lucky for you, I\u2019m treating everybody equally. Don\u0027t forget...almost nothing here is paywalled. The CONTENT goes out to the public, you guys are the backstage. You don\u0027t lose access to ANYTHiNG when you hit your cap. You\u0027ll still get EVERYTHiNG emailed to you if you\u0027re backing at the email level, and access to all streams even if your cap is $1 a month. You don\u0027t get punished for capping. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nQ: \"Does patreon accept paypal?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes, paypal is accepted!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nQ: \" I want to join your Patreon, but I don\u0027t have any idea how much to donate. I want to do it for about $25-35/month. You say it\u0027s donating \"per thing\" - how often do you do those \"things\" - so I can get an idea how much to donate per thing. For example, if you do a \"thing\" every 3 months, I will donate $100 per thing. guidelines on \"thing\" timetables... at least roughly?\" \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(facebook post)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Well...that\u0027s really generous. Right now you have two options: you could just back me at $25/thing, which is the closest denomination (in general I put out about one thing a month and haven\u0027t put out 2 or 3 yet... but might!) and I\u0027d cap your donation at $30, or $60....so you never pay more than you\u0027re happy with. OR if you\u0027re feeling more generous, you can actually \"write in\" a higher amount per thing (i.e. you can write in $20/$30/$50 at the $10 level) and that extra dough per thing, until you hit your monthly cap, is just considered generous gravy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nQ: \"When are you going to put out an Actual Record I Can Touch? call me old school, but I just want to buy a simple record.\" \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: SOON! i\u0027m workin on it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nQ: \"um....what if I want to just donate money to you once? this is weird.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: That\u0027s great. you can make a one-time donation to my site\u0027s music page here...down to the right where it says \"support the music\". thanks.
