    "summary": "Making programming tutorials with LibGDX is very time consuming, but I think it\u0027s a great benefit to the community because there aren\u0027t many advanced tutorials online. \u00a0I can provide tutorials on subjects that no one else is talking about, and it can be a great benefit to your own game, or just to learn more about game programming and programming in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can provide in-depth, visual demonstrations with live, working code and explanations of tutorials that you may not be able to find anywhere else whether they are about LibGDX, design patterns, or whatever you would like to learn about. \u00a0My goal is to give you the skills you need not just to be a better indie game developer, but better programmer in general. \u00a0You can expect quality, in-depth tutorials on a wide variety of topics all with the aim of empowering you to become independent, flexible, and capable of achieving your goals as a computer programmer - whatever those goals may be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI take your patronage very seriously, and so I\u0027d like to lay out some expectations or rules you can hold me accountable to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, you will only be charged for tutorials.  If I post a video on my channel that\u0027s off-topic, like me playing a video game, I will not collect tips. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eGenerally, you can expect the fastest pace of collections to be once, maybe twice  a week. \u00a0I usually put out a new tutorial every 3-7 days, so I will not increase my pace of output just to charge you guys more.   I won\u0027t have the time to do that anyway, unless I can make a living off of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne tutorial, or topic, may be spread out over multiple videos.  Where appropriate I will only charge once (typically this will mean one charge per 20-60 minutes of video).  However, some topics are so large that they can be logically broken down into multiple sub-tutorials in which case each one may be a chargeable video and will usually be released at a pace of one to two per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will not charge for videos where I correct mistakes.  I will not charge for videos where I combine sub-tutorials into one giant tutorial.   And of course, I will only charge for posts, like this one, that are announcing a video release when it meets all of the above rules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would just like to note, so that expectations are properly met, that LibGDX may not be the only topic on which chargeable videos are made.  While I have no plans to branch out into other topics (except for those patrons who donate enough money for that reward) in the short term, there will come a time when I have exhausted LibGDX as a topic of tutorials and will need to expand into other areas of programming tutorials.  If this is unacceptable to you, as paying patrons, let me know and I can work with all of you to determine a better way ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, contact me via e-mail at letsmakeanindiegame@gmail.com, or you can leave a comment on my YouTube channel linked from this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again, and I look forward to working together with you on your journey in independent development.\u003cbr\u003e"
