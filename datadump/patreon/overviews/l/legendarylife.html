To Transform Their Health, Body \u0026amp; Life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past four years, I\u0027ve heard so many great stories from listeners who lost over 20lbs just by listening to the podcast and following my professional advice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve heard from people that thought they couldn\u0027t get fit again because of their age who went on to accomplish their health goals. And they did it by implementing my workout, nutrition and lifehacking strategies that I share every week on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also heard stories of people who thought they were too old to go after their dreams. But by listening\u00a0to my personal story and how I turned tragedy into success, they finally decided to take action.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListeners have shared with me how the show not only helped them get into better shape but how it helped them improve their confidence. Some listeners have even gone on to get promotions or to close more sales\u00a0just because of the ripple effect of being healthier, leaner, and more confident in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if my content, personal story, and variety of podcast episodes has become a part of your life, then I\u2019d like you to consider supporting the podcast by becoming a voluntary subscriber here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut before we go on, I would like to make it absolutely clear that support and faith are going to be rewarded.

It\u0027s helping people like you change your health and your life by giving you practical solutions to your\u00a0health \u0026amp; fitness struggles. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per podcast episode/blog/training that I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlso, when you\u0027re supporting the podcast, you help me create podcast episodes without ads, sponsors or compromise the quality of the content.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I tend to publish about 4 Podcast episodes to the Legendary Life Podcast. Each time I do so, I share that episode here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of episodes I\u00a0publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, \u003cstrong\u003eif you pledge $1 per podcast episode and that month I publish 4 podcast episodes, you\u0027ll contribute with $4 for that month. I won\u0027t be publishing more than 8 podcast episodes/ blog per month.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u00a0You may also cancel any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWHERE DOES MY MONEY GO?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing free podcast episodes and in-depth blogs for men and women who need\u00a0health, fitness, and personal development advice to optimize their health, change their bodies, and live a legendary life. And to do it without interrupting the episode with a lot of sponsorships and advertisements breaks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content--both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can, instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know many of you may think that I just hop on a call with someone to do an interview for an hour and that\u0027s the only work I do. Or I just show up for one of my solo episodes and start talking. But the reality is this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt takes about 18 hours of work to make ONE episode of the Legendary Life Podcast. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, your contribution will help me pay for the podcast costs--which is almost $800 a month. Also, produce higher-quality videos, do more research for the content, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like spending quality time with my wife, friends, and my dad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWHO IS TED RYCE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.legendarylifepodcast.com/about/\"\u003eTed Ryce\u003c/a\u003e, I\u2019m a celebrity trainer, wellness coach, motivational speaker, and host of the Legendary Life Podcast.
