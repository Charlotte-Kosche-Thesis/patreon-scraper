We believe that you shouldn\u2019t overpay for name-brand gear, and it\u2019s equally essential not to waste money on sub-standard kit either. By reading this web site we hope you may gain a better idea of what\u2019s good value and what\u2019s not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI (\u003ca href=\"http://selbydavid.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDavid Selby\u003c/a\u003e)\u00a0created this web site back in 2010 as a way of keeping track of developments in photographic lighting and studio equipment. Many photography web sites cover new camera and lens releases but relatively little time is devoted to lighting, which is a whole new world of different brands and terminology. Lack of knowledge about the available options might make you miss out on a useful feature or a great deal, so I try to cover everything I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Until recently, \u003cem\u003eLighting Rumours\u003c/em\u003e has been mainly supported by banner advertising, affiliate links and the occasional sponsored post. This has introduced a source of tension with which I have become uncomfortable. Banner adverts are disruptive to the reading experience, whilst affiliate deals are often irrelevant to readers outside the USA or Europe. Advertising also invites conflicts of interest in product reviews and deals coverage. I\u0027d rather not have to compromise between content that raises revenue and that which people actually want to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaintaining a web site like \u003cem\u003eLighting Rumours\u003c/em\u003e has certain costs and all of our contributors are volunteers with other, full-time jobs. By funding the site, you are helping keep the site running and making more things possible, such as paying for review samples, sending writers to press events and trade shows and acquiring product testing equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards.\u003c/strong\u003e There are no plans to put normal content behind a pay-wall. There will not be lots of exclusive reward tiers. Rather, you should feel free to contribute as much or as little as you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you.\u003c/em\u003e"
