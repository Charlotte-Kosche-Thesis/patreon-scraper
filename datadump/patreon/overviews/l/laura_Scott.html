In 2016, I took part in the Trans Am Bike Race, completing 2,200 miles with a dislocated shoulder and fractured collarbone after being hit by a car on day one. Since then I\u0027ve cycled 1000miles from Land\u2019s end to John O\u2019groats and competed in numerous 300km plus events. Basically, I\u0027m hooked...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was getting started I was always surprised by the lack of quality women\u0027s cycling content out there, and for years have wanted to do something to change this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me through Patreon, you will be helping me to build a content platform for women\u0027s cycling. This will include articles, videos and maybe the odd podcast. But our goal will be to showcase inspiring Women and non-binary people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to inspire others by delivering interesting quality content for free, but that\u0027s not alway\u0027s easy.\u00a0\u00a0By using Patreon, I hope to continue to fund my projects, take them to the next level, and in exchange for your help, be able to offer you more exclusive content in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, funding is monthly but you can change your pledge at any time. So if you wanted to do a one-off donation you would have access to that level award for a month. There is also the option to change your funding at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to use this platform to build a community, so please feel free to message me if you have any questions or if there are awards you would like to see that I haven\u0027t listed.\u003cbr\u003e"
