    "summary": "Hello, all.\u00a0 So glad you found me here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u0027t know me, I\u0027m Leenie Brown, a wife of one, a mother of two, an author to many, and a woman with an active imagination. As my page header says, I write sweet romances. Many of those stories are written in Jane Austen\u0027s world, using and adapting her characters and storylines while adding new plots and characters of my own to fill out the world I create in each book. Some are stories which have only been touched with inspiration\u00a0from Jane Austen\u0027s novels, and others, which are still waiting to be written, will be completely original.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a grey, rainy December day here in Nova Scotia as I am writing this. The rain is coming down in sheets and the wind is blowing on Brown Cottage in just the right way to cause that old fireplace clean out to leak.\u00a0 This means I have been tromping up and down the basement stairs every hour, stuffing dry towels in the opening, and sending the soiled ones to the laundry room to be made ready for their next tour of duty. :) But, at least, the basement is staying dry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe care of one\u0027s estate is an important thing -- even if that \"estate\" is only a small bungalow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I tell you this? Because it is part of my reason for beginning this Patreon\u00a0page. I need to move my\u00a0business forward so I can do things like\u00a0fix that leak in the basement for starters.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow would I like to see my business grow? Well, for one thing, I would like to do more advertising of my books on platforms like Facebook and Amazon to increase sales and maybe even keep them a bit more steady than they are.\u00a0 I would also like to be able to produce some audio books and redo some book covers all while still paying myself and my part-time assistant for working.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, all those business things take funds. Therefore, I am offering this new opportunity for you to read and interact with my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write every day, Monday to Friday, when life and a book needing publishing don\u0027t get in the way, and it is my goal to share my daily writing with all my patrons. Entry to this world of story creation begins at $1.\u00a0 At this first level, you will get to read and interact with my work as I am writing. Leveling up to a $2 sponsorship will not only allow you to read and comment on stories as I am writing them, but it will also provide you with a link to download a copy of the final, published story, which you can keep forever and ever in your virtual library.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor some time, I have posted stories on my blog and on Jane Austen Fan Fiction forums. In fact, I still post a weekly story on my blog, and currently, every Austen-inspired story gets posted on darcyandlizzy.com right around the time it publishes. I love the way doing this allows me to connect with readers, and I plan to continue doing these things. So, yes, you can find my stories elsewhere for free.\u00a0 However, those places will never get the story as early as you will here, nor do those posted stories come with an option to add the published book to your library without going to some digital store and purchasing it.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne final word about my blog story and a benefit for $1 patrons: My Thursday\u0027s Three Hundred story will be a free post here, just as it is on each Thursday on leeniebrown.com. However, here, on Patreon, I will be adding a link to download the final published version of this book. This download will not only be available to my $2 patrons but also my $1 patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I am hopefully excited that your sponsorships will eventually lead to a dry basement without the need for towels being stuffed in a hole, I am equally as excited to see the community of readers that will be created here on Patreon, and I am definitely looking forward to getting to know you.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and happy reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeenie Brown"
