Drawing and putting all your mind in art is fun, but it\u0027s also time consuming and hard at some point. That\u0027s why I\u0027m creating this patreon. For me it\u0027s a form of help that could help me get more time for drawing and further my studies in art so I could get better and as a result give better arts to those who follow me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA second goal would be to earn enough so I could only concentrate on art and start going to conventions outside of Canada. I would also like to make my own brand of clothing and accessories witch would feature my drawings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your help, \u003cbr\u003eLittleriyu\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
