We\u0027re having the conversations you\u0027re no longer allowed to have in polite society. We\u0027ll talk with pretty much anyone about pretty much anything. Everything interesting is interesting to us. Like Voltaire, we maintain that \u201call styles are good but the boring.\u201d Producing these podcasts is surprisingly expensive. The studio set-up costs alone ran into the thousands of dollars. So if you find value in what we\u0027re doing, and you\u0027re doing okay financially, please be sure to pledge some ongoing support for the podcast via Patreon. Every little bit helps.",
