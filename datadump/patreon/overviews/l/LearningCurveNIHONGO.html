Even $1 helps with reaching my goal to make my content for you guys. I am teaching Japanese because I love the language and of course I do watch anime quite a bit and my passion came out of that as I grew up. I started teaching myself at 18 and for a few years now I\u0027ve been on and off...I got rusty then back on and the cycle was furious. I wanted to make a community where we all can learn and actually use what we learn with each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInvest in yourself...there you will find the fruits of your labor. I will make efforts to be consistent and as for the time being I am the only one putting the lessons together and I will do my best to get 1 on 1 attention if that\u0027s what you so require to learn!! (It\u0027s perfectly fine by the way.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u9811\u5f35\u3063\u3066\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3042\u306a\u3068\u306e\u9244\u5efa\u3066\u304c\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01(I\u0027m sure that\u0027s correct haha!)\u003cbr\u003e"

I am a big fan of the Japanese culture and the language, so much so that I decided I will now teach Japanese. \u003cdel\u003eBorn in Newark NJ and now in good ol\u0027 Georgia,\u003c/del\u003e I\u0027m 24 (going on 25 soon O.O)\u00a0 and I have a passion for learning and teaching. I started teaching in hopes to help those who plan to go to Japan soon or just want to be able to understand more than one language AND make it very affordable!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started learning at a pretty young age actually, about 8 years old; back when Dragon Ball Z would come on every day after school and little did I know I was actually learning Japanese already. The anime was not in English yet until I was about 10 years old and then I could understand it better. I began to better my skills when I was 18 and I learned Japanese in less than a year, 8 to 11 months. This was a remarkable speed to learn a language especially self-taught.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I will take my skills and pass them on to those who are even just curious...you can take this knowledge far, anywhere you go. I am creating lessons based on the different ways people learn and of course, my 1 on 1 attention for all my students is present!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m passionate about learning and the more I learn the better I can relay the message to you and it continues so on and so forth! I hope to see a lot of you join and grow! That is the ultimate incentive to keep going, yes? YES!",
