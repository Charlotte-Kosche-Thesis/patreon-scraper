We also record poetry for radio, downloads and\ninstallations.\u00a0We perform the back \u2018canon\u2019, spanning thousands of years of poetry, as well as working with contemporary writers.\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most rewarding aspects of our work is collaborating with young people in schools and libraries, using poetry and performance to\nbuild confidence and a love of language. We have run \u2018poetry parties\u2019 for\nchildren at theatres throughout the country. We do as much of this work as we\ncan afford to do. \u003cbr\u003eWe are lucky to have collaborated with organizations including the V\u0026amp;A, Wilderness, Oxford Playhouse, Stephen Joseph Theatre, The British Academy, The Horniman Museum and many literary festivals, universities and publishers.\u00a0In the last few years we have also run the Live Canon Poetry\nPress, which supports and develops emerging poets and publishes their early\nwork.\u003cbr\u003eWe are continuously\nfundraising for the work that we do (and it\u2019s a tough financial climate to be\nfundraising in). We have raised money for individual projects in the past\nthrough crowdfunding, collaborating with other organizations, ticket sales,\ncharitable grants from trusts and foundations, and we have been the recipients\nof donations from a number of philanthropists and companies, for which we are\nhugely grateful.\u003cbr\u003eWe have joined\nPatreon because the greatest challenge (and barrier to creating more\nperformances, recordings and outreach events) is not funding for individual\nprojects (which ultimately we can always not do if we don\u2019t get the funding);\nthe problem is meeting our ongoing running costs. This is the stuff you can\u2019t\nrun a \u2018kickstarter\u2019 for. It\u2019s the dull stuff, like our webhosting, our public\nliability insurance, the phone bill, the stamps, the ink for the printer (see, told you it was dull stuff). We struggle to carve enough off the top of\nindividual projects to meet these regular costs.\u003cbr\u003eAnd it precludes\nus from expanding \u2013 ideally we\u2019d be able to pay someone to do a day of booking\nkeeping for us a month, for a day a week of administrative support, or\u2026\ndreaming big, even pay a fundraiser for a bit of their time. We are approached\ncontinuously at the moment, particularly by schools, but we just don\u2019t have the\nmanpower (or, more specifically the funds to pay for the manpower) to manage\nany more of this work. We want to operate professionally and flexibly, with low\noverheads, but at the end of the day, we need some funds to invest in our organizational\nstructure.\u003cbr\u003eSo we are hoping\nthat some of the many people who have told us, over the years, that they love\nwhat Live Canon do, might help us out by becoming our patrons, making a small\nbut regular contribution to our work. Knowing that a regular amount of funding\nis coming in will allow us to consolidate, plan for the future and expand.\u003cbr\u003eA lot of the\npoetry we perform was written by artists who were under the patronage of a\nphilanthropist, who facilitated their writing. It wasn\u2019t a bad system, and we\nreckon Patreon is the twenty-first century, third millennial equivalent.\u003cbr\u003eWe want our\npatrons to feel part of our organization and we\u2019ll keep in touch, pick your\nbrains and do our best to spread our passion for poetry far and wide for you.\nEach month we\u2019ll also create a piece of work that\u2019s just for our patrons \u2013 a\nrecording, a performance, an event, a short film\u2026 As a way to say thank you.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ve got\nany questions, just get in touch with us, via our website\u2026 \u003ca href=\"http://www.livecanon.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.livecanon.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
