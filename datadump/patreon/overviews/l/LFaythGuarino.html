    "summary": "Sometimes the creatures that go bump in the night want their story told too. L. Fayth has been telling and devouring these creature\u0027s stories since she was a young girl. She\u0027s been actively writing about the supernatural, the stranger and the monstrous for a solid, this number is slightly depressing, thirteen years. Since she was a junior in high school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward a few years to college. It was there, caused by a dyslexic moment mixed with a twisted tongue, that the World of the NightOthers was created. A world of supernaturals living beside humans but kept secret from the general human populous. Most of L\u0027s stories take place in this world with a few exceptions. Exceptions that sometimes surprise L since not even she knows where they came from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNightOthers or not these are their stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will help by allowing L to be able to get short stories, novellas and novels alike to be professionally edited, revised and generally critiqued. It would also go to finding and paying talented artists to make cover art. Also if any donations are left over they would go towards saving up for a new laptop which would allow her to take her writing wherever she goes. She loves her mechanical baby but is under no illusion about how much longer it\u0027s got. An added bonus would be a better processing system which would allow her to go back to editing videos for extra income and maybe even feeling in the mood to put a video or two up here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny extra funds past that will go to helping turn this into a full-time job. Every since I was in sixth grade all I wanted to be was a writer. I just wanted to tell all the stories I had rolling around in my head. The World of the Nightothers was first born in 2003 when I was a fresh sixteen-year-old junior in high school. Back then it was set in a high fantasy type world while living under a different name. In the fourteen years since I have actually forgotten that name... Probably for the best. Most of the characters from back then are still being used in my stories today. They\u0027ve just evolved over time. With my growing love of Urban Fantasy, I changed the setting of the world and expanded on it. Every day I expand on it and add to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to all my Patrons thank you for helping me achieve an almost* life long dream.\u003cbr\u003e*Almost because when I was younger I wanted to be an X-Men.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBanner Art Done By Scott Bennett.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sbennettartwork.deviantart.com/\"\u003eYou can find his art!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
