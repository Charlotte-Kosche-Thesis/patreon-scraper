    "summary": "Hey!\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for stopping by.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI tend to think of myself as an awkward, orphaned child that is wandering and hiding behind a block of wood with 6 wires. I\u2019m just hoping to convince someone that this meek wanderer is worth a small chunk of sidewalk on the dirtiest corner of their heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e WEST AFRICA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI drew my first breath in 1988 on the west coast of Africa in the country of Togo, learned to read and write in French, English, and Ewe (Togo\u2019s native language). These languages and their musical counterparts play a great influence over my songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up listening to French artists such as Garou and Francis Cabre as well as international English artists like Phil Collins and Michael Bolton, but it was Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201c\u2018Baby Can I Hold You\u201d that steered my heart down the musical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e UNITED STATES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007 I ventured to the United States and began teaching myself guitar. I began to dig through my library of old poetry that dated back to high school and gave rhythm to my rhymes. I soon began to pester everyone I could to play music with me as I developed as a songwriter and collaborator. These connections quickly led the wandering African to play for coffee houses, listening rooms, bars, churches and various groups over a decade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, in 2010 I began sharing my tunes with the world. Showing up with the Togo flag painted onto my acoustic guitar, I would play any spot or open mic that would have me. \u003cstrong\u003eI LOVE IT. \u003c/strong\u003eSo it was inevitable that people saw the rawness and joy on stage and I began to establish an irreversible connection with anyone that was listening. I try my very best to tells my story through music and prose and keep the listener hanging onto every last note and word. \u003cstrong\u003eNOT EASY, BUT I TRY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCANCER\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I was diagnosed with a rare form of incurable GI tract cancer. It challenged everything I believed in. My songs are about love, life, hope, faith, and the dream and promise of fullness of life beyond this broken one. It was a moment for me to test out what I sing and rediscover myself as a person, but also as an artist wanting to inspire my friends to live to the fullest. I know now that every song and performance could be my last. Hence, they have a bittersweetness about them but remain infused with a never-waving hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Christian, so all my songs have an element of the hope that this world will once again be restored and everything that we lost will be returned to us if we partake in the promise. Even the saddest of tunes are tinted with a hope that goes beyond understanding. And it is with that hope that I fight not to survive cancer but to not waste a second of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e If you would let me, I will sing for and to you :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/INH3R1GZ7rg\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATRON?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWhile I am currently in this season as a patient and my wife as a caregiver, we are also praying for a committed community to lock arms with us and labor together through sacrificial giving, prayer and practical need meeting to bless the cancer-stricken community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTogether with my wife, we want to share the hope and joy I still fight to have with young adult cancer patients and caregivers. We are hoping and planning to do this through: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e*creating, producing and sharing music and videos about the real experience of cancer and how we find our hope and joy in spite of it via downloads, CDs, and live performances \u003cbr\u003e*blogging/sharing our testimony as we walk through our own journey \u003cbr\u003e*meeting and developing relationships with families at the various centers we are already seeking treatment at, specially Moffit Cancer Center, and local young adults through cancer-related organizations \u003cbr\u003e*meeting practical, emotional and spiritual needs as we are led. (for example, sending care packages, massages for caregivers, cleaning, having meals delivered, developing a support group for patients/caregivers, respite care or getaways for caregivers, etc) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe would be so very grateful if you would join in this work with us as hands and feet and allow us to use this season to care well for those also facing the same trial. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI always to share about my real life with my listeners. Since this is my lot this season, it makes sense to invite them into it, especially since everyone knows someone fighting cancer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCHALLENGES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of the way cancer affects you is by diminishing your energy level. This impacts my touring and playing but it does not impact my desire to continue. With Patreon, you will help me continue to do this. I hope you will consider being a part of this with me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
