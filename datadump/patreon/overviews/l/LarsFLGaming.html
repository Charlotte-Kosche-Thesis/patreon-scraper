Your money will help this channel more forward by me getting better gear and games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I don\u0027t need the money for myself I have made one VERY important rule for myself: To make sure that 100% of the income from this page, that being you guys, goes back into the channel. I will keep NONE of it for myself, therefor I have made a separate PayPal account just for this purpose. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo remember that this is fully optional and that I do not expect anybody to pay me. And if you get into any kind of economical difficulties please do use the money for your self, I don\u0027t need it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, choose what rewards suit you on the right and let\u0027s make this channel AWESOME!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-LarsFLGaming\u003cbr\u003e"

The first couple (make that 50) video\u0027s were pretty crappy, the first video\u0027s I can\u0027t stand to watch back. Therefor I have made those hidden :D. In the year 2015 is where my channel really took off, reaching milestone after milestone, starting with my popular \"Trading from trash to knife\" series. Since then a lot has happened on my channel and in real life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I want to focus less on the trading and money making side of gaming and start focusing on the games and let\u0027s plays that I want to do. This will include all kinds of games that will also be suggested by you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I have cancelled my saturday-job, leaving me with no income to spend on the channel but also giving me more time to spend on YouTube, I have made a Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon I hope to achieve 2 main thing\u0027s:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1: Income for Youtube\u003cbr\u003eWith the money that you can donate to me on a monthly basis, I will improve the content on my channel in both hard- and software. To insure that this happens I have made a PayPal account to which all Patreon money will go. Everything that is on this account will ONLY be spend on the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2: Something to give back to you\u003cbr\u003eThrough the reward system integrated in Patreon I will be able to reward you for supporting me, going anywhere from a thank-you video too a private Skype chat and I video with you in it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo take some time to look at the newly updated reward\u0027s and maybe pick one that suits you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven the slightest donation helps out a ton!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Lars (LarsFLGaming)\u003cbr\u003e",
