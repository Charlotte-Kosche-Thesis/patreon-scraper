    "summary": "Hey there! I\u0027m Jesse, a 3rd year packaging design student at Rochester Institute of Technology. Like many my age, I\u0027m a long time video game nerd, I grew up spending hours questing in Azeroth, locking world Keyholes, and watching Krillin die.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kind of defined myself by the the things I watched and played. It was fun running around the playground with my friends pretending to be the Power Rangers, jumping over things like Batman and taking stances like we were about to shoot Kamehameha waves at each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning around and pretending to be our favorite characters was easy as a kid, but eventually we started to feel a bit silly. As I started to care more about what people thought I kind of stopped pretending. I kind of got this stigma that I needed to be cool. Stick fighting became basketball, cops and robbers was just tag, and swing sets were no longer for pretending to be Spiderman.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was much easier to exercise my imagination alone. Logging onto WoW and meeting all kinds of people that were also there to lose themselves in a magical land. There I met dozens of friends all there to quest! For an 11 year old boy, it truly felt like a magical adventure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe feeling of sitting down in front of a screen and melting away was really, quite beautiful. Game play is obviously important, but what really sucked me in was that incredible feeling of immersion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn early high school I started playing table top games. Mostly Magic the Gathering, but also the occasional role playing game. It was very different. I understood the concept but not really the spirit. I rolled up my Legolas clone and shot everything in sight.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI played completely objectively. Kill the monster, get the loot. I was replicating what I did in WoW but forgot that what made that game such a great experience was the lore and comradery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t really realize this until recently, well into college. Fortunately most of my friends remained local and in everybody\u0027s best interest we started playing at the table on the regular.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI might not have the brilliance and experience that RPG figures like Matt Mercer or Matt Corville have, but I\u0027m certainly doing my best to put out a holistic story driven game for my friends. I\u0027ve been watching endless videos of campaign diaries and DM thoughts on how to run games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve come up with a pretty bare bones home brew system and a lot of out of game content for my players and I think it\u0027d be fun for others to tag along, listening or reading in on our adventures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of this content I would be creating anyway for my friends, but getting any support from Patreon would help me devote more time and go further. I am balancing a lot of things as a student and have many projects I want to tackle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that my niche is a pretty tight circle, but I believe its a very active and constructive community. If you\u0027ve read all this and are not really a gamer, thanks anyway for your time! Everyone else, please join me on my quest :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the quest to finish and publish my RPG campaign, I\u0027ve been really getting back into my visual art roots! I\u0027ve started up an Etsy store for my paintings with my girlfriend and we\u0027re having tons of fun. Please check what works I have there. So in addition to getting me through life and school, you\u0027ll be supporting my other artistic works, helping me to buy paint and establish myself as an artist!\u003cbr\u003e"
