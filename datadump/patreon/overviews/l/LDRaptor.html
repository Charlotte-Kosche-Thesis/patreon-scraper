    "summary": "Not sure how to start with this other then if you are seeing this, you probably already know me from ether my Tumblr, Fur Affinity, or my many other places my art winds up on. I\u0027ve been drawing stuff of this nature since around 2007. So far I\u0027d say some find it enjoyable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I don\u0027t really have any intention on turning this into any kind of paywall assistant like so many other artists seem to these days.\u00a0I like my art being free for all to see and enjoy. Call me some kinda \"information should be free maaaaaaaaaaaaaan\" types all you want, but I just enjoy knowing I\u0027m not excluding people. If I every do \"exclusive\" art, which I have done in the past, It\u0027s always been a temporary thing, which is how I like it. I simply feel this could be a nice convenient way for people to tip me for my \"public service\" and maybe find some fun services when and if I can think of any. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that being said, the more money I can raise over time does mean the more I can put that money back into my art which means better and more frequent quality. For example, my tablet has been showing signs of age and aggression. Replacing it will take a LOT of saving up, in the meantime it will hinder my ability to do precise line-work without having to go over it over and over, trying to work around the damaged sections. Other things include, the more money on hand I have, the less hours I need to sign up for at my work and the more time I can spend home drawing etc etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO WHAT DO YOU GET?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m going to be doing comic projects where I will upload a minimum of two pages a month here a full two months before they will go public. I will also be bringing back the patreon pick pic sometime soon with a new format to better suit my tastes and thus allow them to go faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also post all my WIPs and completed works on here before I do on other sites so if you want to keep up with what\u0027s new before everyone else, this is the way to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art dumps bellow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/ldr/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/ldr/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ldraptor.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ldraptor.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003ehttps://inkbunny.net/ldr\u003cbr\u003ehttps://ldr.sofurry.com/\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.weasyl.com/~ldraptor\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYou can find my work on other places as well, which are usually on-official.
