    "summary": "I try to make art everyday in some capacity. Some days I can make lots but if \u00a0I\u0027m working, then its little to none. My goal is to be able to make art everyday and not have to rely on my day job. I also just recently came back from Italy for an artist residency in Tuscany. The time I spent in Italy during and after the residency made me realize I want to move to Italy. And I am going to. However in reality that means I\u0027d be leaving my life, makeup career, etc. out here and nearly starting over out there. Its a daunting adventure for sure. But that is what I want. It\u0027s going to be difficult with lots of obstacles but the thought of living in Florence stirs my insides in a pretty butterfly kind of way.  To be able to make live creatively in the most beautiful place on the planet would be a source of life-force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI paint friends of mine or people I meet throughout my life. Some include a real-life Mermaid, a Werewolf, a Harlequin, Kings and Queens, Goddesses, and the list goes on. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI make vlogs about life and how weird it all is. At times, I make these vlogs while I paint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make jewelry on wood that feature mini versions of my art. The pendants take about two weeks to make. My plan is to get these into boutiques in Los Angeles and in Europe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also just finished a limited line of scallop shell and crystal necklaces. The shells are from my recent trip to Lecce, Italy. It\u0027s a small edition of ten pieces and something I really loved making. \u003cbr\u003e\nHere is my site to view my paintings and jewelry. \u003ca href=\"http://www.laurenetheartist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.LaureneTheArtist.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nThank you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy links:\u003cbr\u003e\nYouTube.com/LaureneTheArtist\u003cbr\u003e\nInstagram @laurenealvarado\u003cbr\u003e\nSnapchat @laurenealvarado\u003cbr\u003e\nPeriscope @laurenealvarado\u003cbr\u003e\nTwitter @laurenealvarado\u003cbr\u003e\nFacebook @laurenealvaradoart\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m always working on something new and look forward to bringing my imagination to life. All of my muses in my paintings are people that I encounter in this world. They each hold their own magical spot in my latest collection of oil paintings called Castles. I also love writing and blogging. I\u0027m on a mission to get new equipment for myself so that I might create more professional videos and content. I\u0027m also always in need of supplies or props. It\u0027s the best neverending creative cycle. And your support will help carry me and my art into the universe. Thank you so very much! www.LaureneTheArtist.com",
