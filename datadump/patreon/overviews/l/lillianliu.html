    "summary": "Thank you for visiting!\u003cbr\u003eI am Lillian Liu, a young pianist/photographer/digital artist/occasional model, and I am currently a Master\u0027s student studying in the beautiful city of London- pursuing my dream of keeping arts and culture alive in our modern society through immersion in western art music and self-funding/management in visual arts. \u00a0I hope to marry the two worlds completely one day- in both music and art, to fulfill my vision of what I would like to leave behind in this world...which is inspiration, the seeds of a dream, and insight into self-being. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am at the Royal College of Music in Albertopolis living life as a conservatoire pupil under the tutelage of world-class musicians, and am also working as a photographer being successfully published every few months with each shoot I choose to submit. \u00a0I arrange, fund, and manage all of my shoots and education alone (with a little bit of help from the parents for the latter)- and long to create a universe that will utilize my skillset which is distinctive, personal, related, and recognizable in branding (in which I will expand on year by year). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith some guidance and generosity, I will be able to fully commit to the visuals that I dream of in my photographs (and would-be filmography) that is shipping/handling/crafting of resources, venue and studio rentals/creation, equipment upgrades (Lillian Liu Photography has managed to survive with 1 camera and 1 lens for many years, although it is time to evolve), and subscriptions to legal versions of my editing software. \u00a0I will also be able to fund recording sessions and pay sound engineers fairly for their time, and manage venue selection with these finances- and also fund travel for collaborative purposes in both worlds, which I have currently been doing to a very limited degree with the funds I currently have (but with promising results). \u00a0I hope to be globally connected and involved with my esteemed contemporaries, and to create publications and projects that will be larger in scope, and even material to hold as well. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your helping hand, I will be able to offer a piece of myself to the world with more ease and fluidity, while still retaining the available funds to study and further my pursuit of knowledge. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I hope to publish a visual and auditory anthology of my own creative universe, host performances, and create art to the fullest of my potential. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am located in London, UK, and Vancouver, Canada. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
