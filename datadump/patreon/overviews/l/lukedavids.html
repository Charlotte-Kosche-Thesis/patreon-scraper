Luke here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been at this singer-songwriter thing officially since 2012 and released a couple of full-length albums (with some interesting detours along the way). Right now, I have a third album in the works! Bonus: As part of the $1 reward, you can preview the first song \u201cSimple Life.\u201d (The chorus of this song took on a life of it\u2019s own in the studio and I think we may have maxed out the amount of tracks we can use just on vocals.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve started this Patreon page as a way to communicate with you directly and provide consistent content. Starting at just $1 per month you\u2019ll get access to my Patreon-exclusive feed where I\u2019ll be posting new music samples and behind-the-scenes content. Consider this our little E-living room where we can chat, joke and share stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also a way to help me sustain a creative career that is currently pieced together with many different musical odd-jobs. Your support gives me the ability to spend more time creating and releasing new original content and streaming more live shows! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a look at the reward levels and see what fits for you. Any and every dollar is appreciated beyond description!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you guys,\u003cbr\u003e-Luke"
