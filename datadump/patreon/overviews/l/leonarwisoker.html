I write, panic, then absorb more coffee and keep writing anyway. I\u0027ve been telling stories since I was a kid, but only seriously started making a career of it within the last fifteen years. So far, I\u0027ve had a five book series published (Children of the Desert), put out a couple self-published novellas, and placed a handful of short stories with magazines and anthologies. Even a couple of poems (thankfully lost in the shadows of the internet. I think. I hope.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Turning To Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been real quiet the last two \nyears. I\u0027ve had Reasons. Those Reasons are now out of the way, and I\u0027m itching to write again. Problem being, I\u0027m rebuilding from ... well, a series of unfortunate events, which have murdered my good habits and newbie enthusiasm and once-indefatigable motivation like you wouldn\u0027t \u003cem\u003ebelieve\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, first, I want to reconnect with my patiently waiting readers. I want to give folks who enjoy my writing something new to cheer about, something exciting to anticipate, something to show that I\u0027m still out here kicking words into shape. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \u003cstrong\u003ealso\u003c/strong\u003e, however, want an externally sourced push. Patreon is going to be that buttock prod. I will have to \u003cem\u003eproduce real writing. \u003c/em\u003eOn a \u003cem\u003edefined schedule. \u003c/em\u003eTo actual readers who will fuss if I miss a deadline. (You will, right? I mean, my husband is \u003cstrong\u003efabulous\u003c/strong\u003e, but he\u0027s way too forgiving.) You can drop a comment here anytime, asking what I\u0027m doing, nudging and nagging me a bit. I need that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already have several projects lined up, of course. There\u0027s the Feeding The Muse cookbook, which involves multiple writers talking about food from various unique angles. There are a \u003cstrong\u003ebunch \u003c/strong\u003eof short stories in the trunk that I\u0027ve been meaning to overhaul. Including one intended as a deliberate tribute to Peter Beagle. There\u0027s my science-fiction novel-in-progress-for-the-last-*mmmph*-years. And that partially sketched out mystery novel. So I don\u0027t lack for \u003cstrong\u003ematerial\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJust motivation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribers will see my first draft work, but that\u0027s okay! My first drafts are usually very lean and clean, or at least intriguingly messy. You might have to put up with my poetry on occasion. Now for the part \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003eprobably (rightfully!) care about:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI Get A Kick In The Butt. What Do YOU Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a limited duration campaign, since the goal is to get me back in writing trim. So, I\u0027ve kept everything limited, because I have to be able to deliver, and--look, I\u0027m lazy, okay? I can invent excuses to get out of \u003cem\u003eanything\u003c/em\u003e. So I\u0027m starting with a low bar. For the twelve months of 2018:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I get at least five subscribers, lower tiers ($10 a month and up) will be emailed \u003cstrong\u003eweekly \u003c/strong\u003e(gulp!) drafts of work in progress. These will be at least five hundred words. Once a month, all subscribers at $10+ will receive a \u003cstrong\u003ecompleted \u003c/strong\u003e(still draft, mind you!) short story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cstrong\u003eThis and all following rewards are contingent on the campaign maintaining at least five subscribers, even if four of those five are at a one dollar pledge level.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpper tiers ($25+) can suggest \"seeds\" for future short stories, the chance at physical copies hot off the press, and will be personally thanked in the acknowledgements. And more: ($50+) the chance to name characters; voting whether or not a specific character should survive a given short story arc; and *ahem* an X-rated version of a scene now and again. Mind you, I don\u0027t do those \u003cem\u003eoften\u003c/em\u003e. But if there\u0027s interest ... *shrug* ... sure, why not?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, folks who commit pledges for the entirety of 2018 will get a super special reward, regardless of your chosen support tier. I love writing. I really, really, love writing. And anyone who sticks with me is going to be \u003cstrong\u003erewarded\u003c/strong\u003e, you hear me? I\u0027ve always said I couldn\u0027t do this without my faithful readers and supporters. I mean it. You all \u003cstrong\u003erock\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember: there\u0027s a dual point to this campaign. I want to gather round with my existing readers, find out what y\u0027all have been up to, catch up on what you want to see by way of stories from me. Those of my readers who\u0027ve supported me via encouraging comments via Facebook and Twitter are deeply appreciated, and I urge everyone to continue doing so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney is a fabulous motivator, however. It helps with expenses, takes away stress and increases available energy. Putting money down, even at the one dollar tier, is a great big signal that you\u0027re not just being polite. And right now I really, really need that solid boost--and the explicit commitment I\u0027ve hooked into it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in short: \u003cstrong\u003eHelp Make Leona Write Again.\u003c/strong\u003e :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
