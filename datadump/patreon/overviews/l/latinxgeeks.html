We are about promoting positive Latinx representation in all media, as well as challenging stereotypes, and discussing topics that affect the Latinx community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlexis Sanchez is the creator, and co-founder of Latinx Geeks. She is a student by day and geek fangirl by night. There is nothing she loves more than snuggling up with her cat, Nox, and getting lost in the world of comics. You can catch her online advocating for Latinxs in space and anywhere else she sees the need for more representation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReign Reign is a nerd by trade, geek at heart. She is the editor and co-founder of Latinx Geeks, and has been a writer/reviewer for NiceGirlsTV, AfterEllen, and other online publications. When she is not advocating for more diverse representation in media, or lecturing someone on animal health care/rights, she spends her time watching obscure LGBTQ* films, reading, or playing video games (when her crew of furbabies allow it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi everyone! Thank you for supporting Latinx Geeks on Patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI created Latinx Geeks in 2015 because I saw a gap in the geek community. I didn\u0027t see Latinx people represented like I felt they should be and while sitting in the Geeks of Color NYCC panel I decided \"Hey I can do this!\" So I started Latinx Geeks and have done my best to run it and pay for the costs by myself. All of this while being a full time student and working multiple jobs. Now over two years Latinx Geeks has grown far beyond what I believed possible. We\u0027ve had panels at Women in Comics Con, New York Comic Con, Clexacon. We\u0027ve been panelists at all of these along with Awesome Con and Flame Con. All of that is paid for out of pocket by the Latinx Geeks team and if we want to continue growing LXG we\u0027re going to need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting Latinx Geeks you\u0027ll help with 3 basic things to start.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmail Hosting for 3 email accounts is a minimum of $10 a month.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDomain hosting: Having a custom domain name costs $20 a year to have, but that doesn\u0027t include privacy fees. Those are an additional $36.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComic con fees: This can be anywhere from $200-$1000 to cover the tickets, travel, and hotel fees, for two people. This cost is per con, but can change depending on where we are traveling.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eYou can also find us at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/latinxgeeks\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Latinxgeeks/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://Instagram.com/Latinxgeeks\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u003ca href=\"http://tumblr.com/latinxgeeks\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Tumbl\u003c/a\u003er, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://latinxgeeks.wordpress.com/\"\u003eLatinx Geeks\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eYou can find our Podcast on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-938498378/ep-1-a-new-hope\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e, Stitcher, and Tunein by searching Latinx Geeks.
