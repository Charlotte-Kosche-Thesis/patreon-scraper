Your funds will help support not only myself, but to pay our engineers, editors, producer, and to secure studio time for mixing and mastering. In exchange, we will open our lives and hearts to you, uploading videos, mp3 exclusives, photos and other goodies which will give you a glimpse into our record-making process. It\u0027s all access behind the scenes! As a fine artist, your funds will help provide me with canvas, paper, paints, and other materials to create unique works of art for specifically for my patrons, which you will have access to digitally, or if you choose, to have them mailed directly to you to enjoy."
