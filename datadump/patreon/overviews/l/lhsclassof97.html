    "summary": "In June of 1997, Liberty High School sent 432 young adults out into the world as graduates to accomplish their dreams. \u00a0It has be almost twenty years since we walked down the aisle at graduation, and in those two decades, our classmates have gone on to do amazing things. Our accomplishments are too numerous to list here: weddings, births, graduations, promotions, etc. Unfortunately, in these years, we\u2019ve suffered some setbacks and heartaches as well.  Since graduation, we have lost five classmates too soon: Benjamin Bibler, Angelo Gentis, Gregory Josar, Christopher Richardson, and Anthony Sebastionelli. They loved Liberty High School and represented the Red and Blue with pride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut from this sadness, there will be joy and opportunity.  I am happy to announce that beginning in 2018 we will be presenting the Spirit of \u201897 Legacy Scholarship at Liberty High School\u2019s graduations in memory of our gone but not forgotten classmates.  This scholarship will be presented to a second-, third-, or even fourth-generation graduate who will be attending a post-secondary school.  The reunion committee felt this was an appropriate tribute for our classmates and their families.This will be an opportunity for us to give back to a school from which we all benefited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also be creating a brand new class newsletter to be produce biannually in the fall and spring. \u00a0This will include all the exciting news about our classmates and retrospectives on all that has happened over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking to time to learn about our little project, and we hope you will consider giving to our cause."
