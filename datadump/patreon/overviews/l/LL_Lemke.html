I\u2019m LL Lemke, I\u2019ve been self-publishing my novels since 2012 and \nhope to continue that in the future - I have so many stories I want to tell.  Many \nwriters dream of being able to support themselves with their writing, \nI\u2019m in that camp as well. I write blog posts that center on writing and \nthe writing process and my experiences with writing.  I enjoy writing \nfanfiction, especially in the Tales, Gundam, MCU, Sengoku Basara, \nRevolutionary Girl Utena\u2026but I can write in most fandoms if I\u2019m given \ninformation about the universe and characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also really \nenjoy helping people with their writing. I hope to one day be a writing \nteacher and help others find enjoyment in writing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve written three books so far, here they are on \u003ca href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLL-Lemke%2Fe%2FB0082O0PEM\u0026amp;t=ZTA0YzBlNTBhYWNmMGYxZDhiOWI0NjIwNGQxNmNmNTM1OTQzMDM4MixVZ3psWDZwQQ%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e and here they are on \u003ca href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smashwords.com%2Fprofile%2Fview%2Flauralemke88\u0026amp;t=NmEzYWVlOWFiYWExNGM0Yjg3YjgzYTc0NDA4YjE0NzUxMTFjMGIyNyxVZ3psWDZwQQ%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSmashwords\u003c/a\u003e.

Not only will you get access to all of my normal blog \nposts and fanfiction, but there will be monthly, Patron suggested \nwriting tip posts as well. At two ranks, there are a Patron suggested \nfanfics.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging $10 a month, you get access to all four of my published books as well as access to all future publications.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\n have plans for various serials on Patreon once enough per month is \npledged - a serial featuring one shots from each of the Opera, a Patreon\n exclusive novel, more writing tip posts, and eventually more fanfiction\n as well.There\u2019s also the opportunity to see excerpts of novels that I\u2019m\n currently working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo upcoming projects for Patreon will be a longer fanfiction - posted on Patreon before it gets to my AO3. The other is a novel that will be published on Patreon in it\u0027s first run. Once it\u0027s complete, it would be self-published on Amazon. Both of these would have 1-3 chapters per month, depending on how busy I get. I have several ideas for both of them and will be proposing them to Patrons once they\u0027re all fully outlined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe novels I\u0027m currently working on are Heavensgaze, Karmic Convergence, and various others. I am also working on two visual novel projects and running a literary magazine!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks\u003cbr\u003e\n\t~LL\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

I have a soft spot for villains in fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love reading. Some favorites are Neil Gaiman, Chuck Palahniuk, George RR Martin, JK Rowling...it\u0027s hard to think of more. If I met any of them, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027d be reduced to fangirling and be completely unable to form coherent sentences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a martial artist. I hold a 3rd degree black belt in taekwondo and am currently training for my 4th degree. I love the martial arts almost as much as I love writing. I enjoy incorporating the martial arts into my writing as well!\u003cbr\u003e",
