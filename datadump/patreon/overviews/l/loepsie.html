    "summary": "When Loepsie was created, I was a mere 15-year-old, making hair tutorials in my bedroom. Now, almost 10 years later, YouTube has become so much more than what I ever could have imagined when I picked up this new hobby. It\u0027s become a wonderful place where you can go to hear or learn about any topic that comes to mind, and I\u0027m super proud to be able to contribute to that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://loepsie.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TAHA_20160217_0258-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen people started making a career out of producing online videos, I realised this was what I wanted to do with my life. I want to teach, encourage, share! Build relationships online, offer a break from busy day-to-day life... When I graduated from uni, I decided to focus on YouTube and my blog full-time and I can honestly say I\u0027ve never been happier. There\u0027s nothing I love spending my time on more than this! Being a smaller, international YouTuber though, the money isn\u0027t exactly rolling in. That\u0027s absolutely fine by me, I\u0027m happy to live a sober life if it means I get to create every day! It is traditionally part of being an artist, after all :) Sometimes I would however like to invest a bit more in better equipment or a certain prop for a video... And that\u0027s where you come in! Through your donations I\u0027ll be able to up my game when it comes to the quality of my content, as they\u0027ll allow me some financial means to invest in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support you guys give me already is overwhelming and fills me with joy and love every day. It\u0027s you who allows me to dedicate my life to my passion! If you\u0027d like to offer a little financial support as well, I\u0027d be incredibly grateful. Thank you for everything!"
