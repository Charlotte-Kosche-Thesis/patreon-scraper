It has been on the air for 2 years with over 100 episodes of free content. This project has moved me so much that I have been paying out of pocket to make the show happen each week, simply because the community we\u0027ve cultivated and women we\u0027ve been able to connect with, learn from, and share the stories of has\u00a0been truly invaluable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I had an experience of serious adrenal fatigue. Through it, I saw my own subtle layers of survival, trying to prove \"I can do it all\" and \"I don\u0027t need help\" coming forward to be healed. I realized that most of the women in my lineage (...and likely yours too) had lived lives of over-giving and being undernourished. Some did so for survival, some because that\u0027s just what you do as a woman or a single mother. Many of them died from illnesses of the feminine reproductive organs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realized that I was carrying around their weighted stones, their unacknowledged pain, their untold stories of exhaustion, and I decided then and there that these were not mine to carry anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am breaking the cycle and starting a new pattern for my lineage... one of receptivity, support, community and prosperity for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve known about Patreon since October 2017 when a guest, Candy Royalle, shared it on our show... six months later I\u0027m admitting not only that I need support to grow, but that we all deserve to be nourished by our community, including myself. Patreon provides a way to support the creators out there who are giving their heart and soul to that which they love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what I love. \u003cbr\u003eIf this is your story too, it\u0027s time to let ourselves receive the support we deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eLuna\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ladieswholeadpodcast.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
