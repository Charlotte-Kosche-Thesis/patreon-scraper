I am a cartoonist and illustrator who lives outside the sprawling metropolis of Cleveland, Ohio. \u00a0I draw comic books, graphic novels, card and board games and children\u0027s books. I\u0027ve drawn live during events like \u003cstrong\u003ew00tstock \u003c/strong\u003ein San Diego, and at DragonCon in Atlanta, tech conferences in Seattle.

I took a few years off and this past summer, I decided to start making new speed drawing videos of some of my larger projects. \u00a0I\u0027m at a point now where I feel confident that I will making my videos on a more regular basis and I\u0027ll have a steady steam of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Become \u00a0A Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming one of my patrons, you are allowing me to make a living from something I do everyday anyway - draw. I\u0027ve done successful projects on other crowdsource funding sites. But on Patreon.\u00a0Instead of collecting a set amount of money toward one specific goal, Patreon is like a subscription service.  Through Patreon, \u003cstrong\u003eYou are becoming a real patron of the arts.\u003c/strong\u003e Just like in the olden days! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind, that you can cap the amount you give every month. So on the rare occasion I make more than 4 videos per month, you won\u0027t get charged over what you feel you could spend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for considering becoming one of my patrons. \u00a0I look forward to drawing very quickly for you.\u003cbr\u003e"
