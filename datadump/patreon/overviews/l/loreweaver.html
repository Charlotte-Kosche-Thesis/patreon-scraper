I\u0027m running a private Minecraft server for those who pledge above a certain amount, plus I\u0027m planning a few other incentives\u2014but I need to reach a level of stability first before I can set those things in motion.  In the meantime, I want to be able to get on with making you all laugh, and I having your support will help me to do that more reliably.\u003cbr\u003e"
