What myths and stories are shaping our perspective? What reminds us to be awesome? How do we go about decreasing world suck? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the sorts of questions I\u0027m interested in asking. I want to talk about the narratives that give purpose to existence in an uninhibited way where I can chase rabbits not just through Ezekiel, and Amos, and Luke, and Paul, but also through Butler, and Rowling, and LeGuin, and Stan Lee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make videos which provoke conversations about the stuff that matters without respect for doctrinal boundaries or religious allegiance. Have you noticed that conversations about religion online often involve people living into the worst caricatures created by people they disagree with? Let\u0027s find ways to talk about life, and death, and pain, and joy together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to make these videos as high quality as possible and also be able to pay my bills, ideally without having to chase after advertising revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m asking you to pledge a little money to help me make things you like. In the process, you\u0027ll get to help shape the conversation into something better than it could have been without you.\u003cbr\u003e"
