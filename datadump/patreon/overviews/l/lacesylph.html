    "summary": "All art is communication\nand the better the art the more it communicates no matter what kind of artist\nyou are. Join me as I tell the stories that I try to bring to life through the\nfiber arts of spinning, knitting, crochet, lacework, embroidery and eventually\ncombinations thereof that are only in the planning stage at the moment. A story\ncan be told in the most surprising ways. Through a skein of yarn, the design of\na hat or a scarf; through lace and fabrics and braids and embroidery.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecome a patron and\nlearn the details of how I weave the fibers of stories into the fibers, threads\nand fabrics that I use to create unique examples of the fiber arts. People may\nbuy my products but only my Patrons will know the stories that are as much a\npart of them as the fibers they are made of. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd only my Patron will\nbe able to see the journey I take as an artist and a woman whose PTSD and\nagoraphobia have kept me from joining the workforce. Hopefully the end will be\nthat this artist becomes independent and perhaps is even able to establish a\nstorefront of her own. But we don\u2019t know yet, all I have right now is hope and\nthe determination to take what skills I have or can learn to create beautiful\nstories in the strangest of ways. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut the only ones who\nwill ever know the entire story, every episode of this journey, who can even\nbecome woven into the story themselves are my gracious Patrons. Come join the\nweaving of the story of how stories can be told without words!\u003cbr\u003e"
