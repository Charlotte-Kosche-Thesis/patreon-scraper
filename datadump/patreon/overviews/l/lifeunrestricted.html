So I started this podcast called \"Life. Unrestricted.\"\u003cbr\u003eOn this show, you\u0027ll hear me talking to people from all walks of life who have overcome struggles with body image, weight, self-worth, addictions and perfectionism. Truly inspiring people who will lift your spirits and tell you their best advice on how to become more resilient. We are covering topics including diet-culture, common fitness- and health-traps, eating disorders, yoyo-dieting and how to learn to love our bodies and lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo.\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like a weirdo in today\u0027s society, find yourself obsessing over calories, the number on your scale or your fitness regime, or if you simply feel alone with your body acceptance struggles, come on board. \u003cbr\u003eYou know, even a\u00a0small pledge for this podcast could be a GREAT help \u2013 because together, we can continue to speak openly about these issues and help others feel less alone. \u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to help as many people as possible to establish a relaxed relationship to food and exercise. (Yep, myself included.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn order to\u00a0keep expanding the podcast, so that I can reach more people who could benefit from listening, I need your support. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs a patreon, you are helping me to continue my mission. Your donation, no matter the amount, is very much appreciated and is a huge help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou are awesome, thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHope to catch up with you on my podcast!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e:-)\u003cbr\u003eMeret\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

My go-to was food, subsequently restriction, and finally exercise. When everything came together, it got really ugly and I was dieting and exercising obsessively.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been in recovery for a while now and nothing fills me with more joy than helping others, providing information for anyone who\u0027s interested, and - above all - to create connections. My goal is to lift people\u0027s spirits, share interesting stories and establish a sense of YES, WE CAN. We can recover, we can heal, we can become fully ourselves. The person that we were meant to be all along.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHappy you\u0027re here!\u003cbr\u003eMeret",
