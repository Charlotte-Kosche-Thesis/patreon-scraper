All of those pages are available on my website for free!

I\u0027m currently in between day jobs, but if I can get some significant support, I might be able to do without a day job for just a little bit longer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you\u0027ll get to see some content before it becomes publicly available (when possible). I\u0027ll also post extra bits and pieces for patrons only, such as past vote incentives, sketches (yes I do non-pixel drawing sometimes), or tabletop gaming material. At higher reward levels I\u0027ll also draw stuff for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce the month ends, I\u0027ll be waiting to hear $5+ patrons want me to draw. So long as I get some kind of instruction, I\u0027ll send out the reward at the end of the month AFTER the pledge is collected. If I don\u0027t get any instructions by the end of that month, the reward gets pushed back to the following month. So, if you donate in January you\u0027ll get your reward by the end of February, unless I have to come up with something on my own in which case it will arrive by end of March.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://willsaveworldforgold.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
