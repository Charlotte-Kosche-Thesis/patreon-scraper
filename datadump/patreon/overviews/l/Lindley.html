    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Lindley Rain, a daytime shift InfoSec student from Russia, and I translate things related to Aura Kingdom (also known as Fantasy Frontier and Innocent World in TW/JP). Thanks for checking this page out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might know me for translating and sharing info regarding the content and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/5gReS\"\u003ethe gear\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Bpw6k\"\u003ethat hasn\u0027t\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Txmrp\"\u003ebeen released\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/09C13\"\u003ein the western\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/7PKl2\"\u003eservers yet\u003c/a\u003e, as well as the actual changes themselves - patchnotes (for example, class balance patch changes from 2017 and awakening details) and info that\u0027s not mentioned in them, like compiling\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sket21W.png\"\u003ethis image\u003c/a\u003e detailing how stat overcaps work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAK is an ambitious project - after all, a sizable team in Taiwan is working on creating the story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s more ambitious is making sure it comes to us, english-speaking audience, in a speedy and complete way. With me doing this, content news don\u0027t have to get stalled in a year-long production line - even if final product might be slightly different since I\u0027m not affiliated with development teams. The goal of this page is bringing news about the most recent content\u00a0in a speedy and relevant fashion. I\u0027ve been doing this for over half a year now, and I\u0027m not planning to stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here? Well, doing that requires both time and effort - and sadly it\u0027s not something that helps with my living expenses, and this just adds to it: you can\u0027t make news without prior research and compilation, which can\u0027t be easily done on the go. The overall political state of my country doesn\u0027t help: if you\u0027re following the news, you probably know that the tension keeps growing, and that reflects on ordinary people here having even more issues to keep themselves alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you decide to support me - thank you. With some help I\u0027ll be able to get as least a few extra things that actually let me do my work easier - maybe a keyboard that isn\u0027t half-broken, maybe something that would make it possible to create more detailed submissions on the go - my laptop is in disarray right now.\u00a0If you don\u0027t - well, I just hope you\u0027re enjoying my work regardless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps after there\u0027s nothing else to do for AK, I\u0027ll move on to a different project - there\u0027s never a shortage of games coming from Asia that don\u0027t get proper love and care. Or maybe I\u0027ll be working on your commissions? Who knows.\u003cbr\u003e"
