In other words, books! My main series, \"Love, Lies, and\nHocus Pocus - the Lily Singer Adventures\" is about an\nintroverted librarian-wizard (Lily), her ne\u0027er-do-well witch friend\n(Sebastian), and her entirely irreverent talking cat (Sir Kipling).\nThey have lots of adventures, much to Lily\u0027s dismay, but they always\nmanage to save the world, usually in time for tea. I\u0027ve also penned Part 1 of an entirely too long epic\nfantasy novel, \"When the Gods Laughed,\" which I hope to\nfinish before my readers lynch me.

Since there\u0027s a lot of space between now, and $2000 a month, this goal is a reward along the way for helping me to take the first step.
