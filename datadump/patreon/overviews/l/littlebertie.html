    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eErmahgerd! You\u0027re here!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for coming. Whether you\u0027re here by accident or design, the universe has brought us together. There must be a reason. Right?\u003cbr\u003eI have all this stuff in my head and I\u0027m going to throw some of it at the screen. If it\u0027s cooked, it\u0027ll stick. Oh wait... maybe I\u0027m confusing my thoughts with spaghetti. Either way, if we sprinkle a little cheese and garlic on it, it\u0027ll probably be easy to swallow. Please have a seat and pour yourself a drink.\u003cbr\u003eLet me take you on a roller coaster ride of the peaks and troughs of life as I\u0027ve known it. Through richer and poorer, in sickness and in health, through death and disaster, great triumph and failure. Opportunities that slipped through my fingers and cartoon-esque super villains who intentionally set out to destroy me. \u003cbr\u003eI could have been a contender, I tell you. I really could have. If not for slippery stairs and sociopaths, I\u0027d be a Nobel laureate, performing emergency surgery in remote, war-torn villages, while simultaneously curing cancer, schizophrenia and the common cold. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d be a cross between Oprah Winfrey, Martha Stewart, Marie Curie and Xena Warrior Princess. But for the gracelessness of man, I could have ruled the world.\u00a0 In parallel universes across the space-time continuum, those other selves reach out to me and urge me to keep on going. There\u0027s an unspoken promise that we\u0027ll all get together for Celestial Sangria one day, as my reward for not giving up.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m more dead than alive, confined to bed and in chronic pain. I wake up each morning wondering if today is the day that this dystopian nightmare of a government will abolish disability support, leaving me laying in the street begging strangers for kindness.\u003cbr\u003eIn a burst of confidence and enthusiasm, I decided to seek out strangers now, and ask for morsels of patronage in return for my stories and musings. In this way, I might get ahead of the tide, and just manage to stop myself from drowning. Be a love. Help me find where I left my paddle.\u003cbr\u003eIn my last life, I was a scientist. I worked in diagnostic medicine, helping to keep other people alive. In my current incarnation, I\u0027m an artist, writer and cynic, just trying to keep myself alive.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s occasionally fun and I have my moments of outrageous hilarity. At other times, there\u0027s blinding sarcasm and the deft realisation that this weirdness, known as life, is actually a gigantic cosmic charade.\u003cbr\u003eWon\u0027t you join me and see where I\u0027m headed today?\u003cbr\u003eIn my next incarnation, I think I\u0027ll be a pampered cat, sitting on a velvet cushion, eating sardines and cream all day. But for now, I\u0027ll be a Little Bertie.\u00a0 Come, let me sing you the song of my sheeple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
