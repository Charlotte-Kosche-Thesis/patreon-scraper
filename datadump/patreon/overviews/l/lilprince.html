    "summary": "Hello!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, thanks for popping by and seeing what\u0027s going on, on my patreon.\u00a0My name is Holly and I am a writer. A writer is a person who, for some unknown reason, is driven to write. Why? I wish I knew, because if I did I would work if I could possibly make my brain be quiet at 2am and be full of ideas at midday instead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write, direct and generally faff around in the critically acclaimed and award nominated sci-fi, comedy podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://raygunnandstarburst.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRay Gunn and Starburst\u003c/a\u003e. My blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lilnonbinaryfashion/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLil Nonbinary Fashion\u003c/a\u003e, documents the troubles and tribulations of being NB, how fashion has helped me, and I am reliably told by strangers on the internet, giving advice to nonbinary and trans people. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI also write for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWomen Write About Comics\u003c/a\u003e and The Chap, a vintage life style and fashion magazine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI focus on writing about LGBTQ+ and women, that is, after all my life experience; adding my voice, in, what I very much hope is, a witty, sparklingly conversational and entertaining way. Podcasts and journalism, for me, are the perfect mediums for this, but most of all, it\u0027s what I love and what I want to do with the rest of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a cosplayer and very involved in promoting a positive community for cosplayers, something that I hope to do with my writing as well as my own costumes. I have just started writing a column for Down the Tubes introducing cosplay and the cosplay community to people in the wider nerdom that may only see cosplayers at cons and don\u0027t know the ins and outs this weird world of costume. The first of these articles will be published in the New Year!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, because the arts have no money, I have had to start up a patreon. Honesty, I just want to sit and have a nice tea of tea in a cafe every so often and possibly prove to myself that I can do this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will update as often as possible, giving early access to my blog posts, all info on upcoming projects (and exciting behind the scenes stuff), my cosplay articles and my cosplay progress (for any who are interested in that) and any other exciting things that might happen in my life!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting me\u003cbr\u003e"
