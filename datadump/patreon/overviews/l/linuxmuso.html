Follow me on my journey. Become a Patron now on this page to find a great new way or software even musical ideas to play or produce sounds or sights from your dreams with. All styles of music can be produced on Linux. Styles ranging from but not exclusively as experimental to EDM\u00a0 to Jazz or a classical ensemble or orchestra, and; hey some new style you will invent because you are just that FREE minded. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMyself I belong in that category of free thinking people. Linux is usually my main OS although I have used many others in my time, and even use my licensed copies of Windows software, sometimes it can be frustrating when trying out new programs of they are not stable for production yet, but this is a choice you must make yourself, it is not a common. Listening to most people that have tried and decided they didn\u0027t like to use Linux as an alternative to Windows 7 or 10\u00a0 many times often than not where going at it alone in a maze of different tool sets or ways that counter act each other or diminish functionality because of conflicts in libraries.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Linux user since RedHat\u0027s Cartman version, at the beginning of the new millennium this epic OS was still in it\u0027s infancy. Installing it still required a certain knowledge of the dark technology arts. A few years later Ubuntu made it less painful for lay people to install its newest version. They paid attention to mostly user friendly graphical interfaces and great eyeing coloring schemes(Aubergine) :D left located windows attributes etc.. great entertaining reading stuff in old forums and such, while keeping track of the ever changing and fast advancement of the additions and drivers of our beloved Linux Kernel. \u00a0 oh holy Linux Torvalds, and my personal hero Greg Kroah Hartman this guy is literally an awesome giant helping newbies on the kernel dev list finding direction and supplying guidance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel connected with these greats of Linux development helping out the community and as such I would like to extend this gesture out to non technologically advanced PC or laptop users, who just want to make and record music without too many hassles. Pretty much I report these problems I come across so you don\u0027t have to lose too much time and hair on it(life of agony and pain). These days though so many software programs are available to do this in the repositories supplied by proven distributors of the different versions of Linux. This all is free and downloadable from safe storage on servers by using PGP or pretty good encryption using 2048 bit keys or sha256 sums, no kidding. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese great folks have had a great production in their fields thanks to the sponsoring by their employers in paid work hours etc... at the moment I have some time to spare and plenty ideas but no money to sustain paying my electricity bill and the very much needed developer\u0027s coffee doses(no starbuicks or dunkin blackholes please, giftcards welcome :D) to keep running and providing content about new developments in Audio Visual based flavors. One of my uhum ... hobbies includes making music on Linux when possible and promoting our great devs and their works in this field. Many applications exist these days and are freely available for downloading from official repositories like supplied by Debian, Ubuntu, and other high quality distributions of Linux. This can save budding or beginning artists producers a lot of not only money and experience producing their works. But also help them merge themselves in to a great community of like minded entrepreneurial spirits very much like the earlier days of Linux. Some applications require some tender documentation care or video guides to help them shine, Because, printed manuals, are boring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my content I hope and work to bring a bigger spotlight on our perhaps still niche, but not quite small Linux Musicians and Opensource Audio Video Application Developers Community. I would wholly appreciate your patronage to our cause, and check out the ever growing applications, artists and content available for your needs and happiness. So sign up for some rewards of your choice listed to the right by donating 5 dollars or 30 dollars for the Guitar Lessons or tech support for your setup at hand or even helping to install a double boot or such to try out along side of your Windows on the same or second drive or even USB keys. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
