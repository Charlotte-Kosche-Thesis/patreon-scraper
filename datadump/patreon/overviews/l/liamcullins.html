I don\u0027t really know how to write a good Patreon page, so I guess I\u0027ll make this a bit more casual.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMusic, in my mind, is a divine thing. It transcends understanding, really. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve been captivated by it since I was little. During the second semester of my sophomore year in high school, my heart finally settled on becoming a composer, learning music theory, piano, guitar, and eventually attending the University of Southern Maine. I\u0027ve since dropped out due to lack of interest (it ain\u0027t cheap, especially when you\u0027re no longer learning about making music and you\u0027re bored out of your mind), deciding to venture off and make an entrepreneur out of myself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s where you guys come in. I need your help. I\u0027ve had an ongoing project since November of 2016 titled \n\u003cem\u003eCloudland Connections\u003c/em\u003e, an album of ambient music, but recent financial stressors have forced me to push something out early in order to get the profit ball rolling (I hate doing so, but I need money to continue my passion), which I\u0027ve decided to make as sort of a sneak preview EP titled \u003cem\u003eCloudland Connections: A Prelude\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s out on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Spotify, and other platforms for you to enjoy, but in the meantime, I need to get to work on the rest of the album. If you like what I do, please consider donating a monthly amount to help ease the pressure. Just a little helps if many contribute. I\u0027m a one-man show when it comes to composing, mixing, producing, marketing, and social media, so you can imagine how easy it is to feel buried under all I have on my plate! Thanks so much!\u003c/div\u003e"
