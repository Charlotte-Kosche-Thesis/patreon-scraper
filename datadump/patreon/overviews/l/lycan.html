The Late Game (a weekly SC2 talk show) and the Lycan League ( a free-to-play SC2 tournament that offers a weekly and monthly cash prize event).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom day one, I have funded all of my projects through my day job. In order to expand LycanGTV and provide more content, I have created this Patreon page to alleviate the cost of current projects and help LycanGTV grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will the money be spent if you\u0027re already forking over cash for these goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first few goals are items that I already fund. As people pledge towards those goals, it will allow me to free up some cash for the other goals, the priority of which is the pay The Late Game guests. \u003cstrong\u003eTo be absolutely clear, money pledged towards a goal goes directly towards that goal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransparency: \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m still new to the eSports community and many of you may be apprehensive about trusting a new face to deliver. In SC2 in particular, crowd funding has a bad reputation. For the next 12 months, I will update this Patreon page monthly with proof that money pledged has been used towards the listed goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll continue to update this section with more information as people ask questions/new plans are made. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your continued support over the past two years. I\u0027m looking forward to making more content and memories in the years to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours,\u003cbr\u003eLycan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE (04/20/15): I just updated the rewards. Please feel free to give feedback on here/twitter if there\u0027s a reward you would like to see. The rewards are for you and I want to give back whatever I can to say thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
