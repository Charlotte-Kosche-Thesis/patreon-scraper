My name is sam, aka lastkeymusic (I\u0027m also known as sambrero, samwell, samilton, lastkey, and maaaany more things, but you may call me whatever you wish!); in case my moniker didn\u0027t give it away already, I\u0027m a musician! I compose, sing, arrange, perform, edit / mix, and do all sorts of various musical odds and ends (I also draw / color, voice act, direct; I wear many hats).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a great number of projects currently in development, the vast majority of which are music and music-based, and I\u0027m pretty much paying for them out of my own pocket and doing the best I can about it, while also trying to balance the costs of food, going to school, equipment, et cetera ad nauseum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only do I want to be financially stable while working on these projects of mine, I want to be in a position to compensate anybody that works with me on these projects, whether their support be commissioned or voluntary on their part! Your support would go a long, long way in helping cover all of these aforementioned, potential costs, and my sincerest gratitude to anybody that agrees to help me out (or at least anyone that spreads the good word or gives me support in any way they can)!
