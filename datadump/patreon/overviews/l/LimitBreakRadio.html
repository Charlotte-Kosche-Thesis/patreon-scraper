    "summary": "Welcome....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the Limit Break Radio Patreon funding effort! From all of us here at Limit Break Radio we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for stopping by and checking out our funding plan. Whether you decide to give or not we\u0027re so thankful for your listenership and support! If this happens to be your first time coming across Limit Break Radio we are a long running talk-show and podcast currently covering the online multiplayer game Final Fantasy XIV. What sets LBR apart from other FFXIV podcasts and even most other gaming podcasts is our attention to detail, entertainment and professional production techniques.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s the plan here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you want to know what exactly you\u0027re supporting, huh? Well, we have a few goals in mind. The first goal is to make Limit Break Radio the best Final Fantasy XIV podcast it can possibly be. That starts with Limit Break Radio becoming a weekly program. We keep getting feedback like \"I love the show, I would just like it more often\". Our current production schedule is to record one large show once a month and then break it up to be released as a podcast over a few weeks. We would like to make Limit Break Radio a program that you can count on having a regular production schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom there our plan for LBR is to grow it into a more comprehensive gaming show featuring the voices and personalities you\u0027ve come to know and trust. We think part of what makes Limit Break Radio great is the dynamic the crew has with each other. If we take something that we know most LBR listeners care about (video gaming) and start making a talk show about that, we think it\u0027s something our audience, and many other people who have never played Final Fantasy XIV and therefore would have no reason to check out LBR, might like to hear. This is the logical next step for Limit Break Radio\u0027s expansion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of our listeners remember the Limit Break Radio Network of shows that supported the community surrounding Final Fantasy XI. This was a great idea and helped launch shows like He Says, She Says, Elegantly Edwyth and Voices of Vana\u0027diel. We found creative individuals within the LBR community and gave them a platform to express themselves about a game they loved. We\u0027d like to give that same opportunity to the Final Fantasy XIV community and, moving forward, the video gaming community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year, Limit Break Radio has been funded out of pocket by the 5 collective hosts. Even with these meager means, we\u0027ve been able to pull off producing the most entertaining and engaging Final Fantasy XIV podcast on the internet. Things like the Limit Break Radio 2014 Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest After Party and the ability to take live callers on the show were able to be pulled together on shoestring budgets. If given a budget, Limit Break Radio would be able to push the envelope of what people think podcasts and live streams can deliver in terms of content. We want to make the show more interactive, be able to attend more live events and give more back to you, the listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s up with the rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe think it\u0027s important that if you give to Limit Break Radio you get something back. We like that our listeners just want to support what we do but as a way to say thanks for your support we have developed a few tiers of rewards. If you don\u0027t wish to support LBR on a monthly basis through Patreon, you can make a one-time donation through PayPal to receive some of the rewards offered through this program. Rates for one-time donation rewards differ from the monthly Patreon rate. Please refer to \u003ca href=\"http://limitbreakradio.com/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://limitbreakradio.com/about.html\u003c/a\u003e for full details and price differences between a one-time gift or monthly gift. Some items are limited or may become limited as time goes on. Please note: Some items are still under design and may take several weeks to receive. We\u0027ve also included two \"producer\" level giving tiers. These are obviously not for everybody, but we thought those who have the means and want to see LBR continue to grow into the future could consider giving at these levels and be brought in to the show-making process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s get a few things clear:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e-Limit Break Radio is dedicated to delivering high quality Final Fantasy XIV podcasting. Just because we\u0027re exploring the possibility for broadening our horizons with new content doesn\u0027t mean our commitment to making Limit Break Radio the top Final Fantasy XIV podcast will wain in the slightest. Limit Break Radio will continue to be a Final Fantasy XIV focused show. Nothing will change in that regard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-We are not offering to let you buy editorial control of Limit Break Radio. One of LBR\u0027s greatest strengths is that we are free of editorial influence and can freely discuss any and all subject we desire. Just because you\u0027re donating to the show at any level does not mean you get to assert any level of control over our content. We, of course, would like our highest tier donors to have a say in what we do and how we do it, but please, let\u0027s just be clear: you\u0027re not buying a voice on the show. You are supporting something you already like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-You are \u003cstrong\u003eONLY \u003c/strong\u003efunding Limit Break Radio. Additional products when/if they\u0027re launched under the Limit Break Radio Network banner will be responsible for seeking their own funding. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Yes, we are looking to make a living off of this. And that is reflected in our funding goals. The crew that makes Limit Break Radio is an incredibly unique and talented set of individuals. We think that they should be compensated for their talents. If you decide to support Limit Break Radio, please know that we do intend to use some of the money raised to compensate our talent for their work and performance on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-We deeply appreciate your support. We can\u0027t make Limit Break Radio without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that\u0027s about it...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so excited that you have even considered to support Limit Break Radio. We could have never dreamed when we started the show that it would get even half as popular as it is. The 8 years we\u0027ve done this show have been some of the most interesting, hilarious, fun, educational and surprising experiences in broadcasting and maybe even my life. This show is so special and we think those of you that spend time with the show recognize this. Special things are worth supporting and maintaining. We here at Limit Break Radio hope you\u0027ll consider doing just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Nathan Bender aka Aniero Grigori\u003cbr\u003eCo-creator of Limit Break Radio"
