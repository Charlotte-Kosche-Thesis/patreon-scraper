My name is \u003cstrong\u003eLeo\u003c/strong\u003e and I\u0027m a 21-year old media-design student from Cologne, Germany.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the basics: I play the piano since I was 7 years old. I also play guitar and drums, but not as often or good. Because sheet music was getting on my nerves due to the fact I was much faster learning by ear, I quit piano lessons after 5 years and started improvising. Haven\u0027t stopped since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to do mashups because people seem to enjoy it when they discover several different popular songs connected in one new song. Also, converting pop/rock/electro/metal-songs to piano is really exciting and shows a whole new perspective on a song and its potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause college is expensive and I don\u0027t have much time to combine a job, learning and making music in my freetime, I set up the Patreon to enable me to make new videos for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will try to create 1 video per month for a start.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting me! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
