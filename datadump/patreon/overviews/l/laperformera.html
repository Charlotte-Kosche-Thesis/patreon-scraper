This project started in 2012 as I ask myself the question: Do I want to be a mother? and my respond at the time was in order to become a mother I must first be a Mujer Maravilla(a marvelous woman). Since it was conceived at Patio Taller(Puerto Rico) it has developed into an action based practice\u00a0that challenges the societal expectations of being not only a woman but a MUJER MARAVILLA. These explorations have been developed and performed at inBAAD! (New York), Antioch College(Ohio), Universidad de Chile- Museo Contempor\u00e1neo de Valdivia-Puerto Montt(Chile) and Sala de arte Camilo Carrau(Dominican Republic). \u003cbr\u003eUpcoming performance opportunities are: Miami Performance International Festival(June 2015) and Casa Cruz de la Luna art residency at Loisaida Center(August 2015).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBailemos ____/365 #bailartodoslosdias2017\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpportunities that have emerge from the project:\u003cbr\u003eDesigning a structured improve inspired on the creative process of \u003cstrong\u003eBailemos\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for the METROPOLI a group that creates a summer program that is free for the community of Mexico D.F.\u003cbr\u003eCommissioned choreography inspired on February\u0027s videos for Sheppardess.
