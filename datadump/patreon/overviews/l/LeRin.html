Basically I want to be able to create art on all my favorite mediums and to be able to make a living this way. I would love to do freelance, or just doing this would be great! It would change my life tremendously as I\u0027ll be able to take care of some personal things, like getting a car and paying for college.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCreating a page allows me to display my work where patrons can be entertained and enjoy it and hopefully will relate to some of my characters. My patrons will allow me to acquire the materials and skills I need to continue creating great content and I hope to even launch a game for everyone to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t hesitate to contact me with any ideas. I\u0027d enjoy making them come to fruition!\u003cbr\u003e"
