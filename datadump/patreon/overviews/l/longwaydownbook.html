Here\u2019s a little something about us both!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSophie \u003c/strong\u003e- Also known as \u003cstrong\u003ePhi\u003c/strong\u003e.  I\u2019m Mexican-American with an academic background in anthropology and linguistics. I could talk your ear off about how much I love to write, but I\u2019ll spare you; just know I really, really love it. I also adore learning about the world\u2019s various cultures and languages, but am very cognizant of the fact that history is full of appropriation. As a result, I have a deep sense of responsibility to this story and to the research involved, so know that I am treating Naveena and Tylor\u2019s story with a lot of love and care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily write as Naveena Kulkarni and all of her past lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRose \u003c/strong\u003e- Also called \u003cstrong\u003eMoma\u003c/strong\u003e.  I\u2019m Canadian with an academic background in theatre and history.  Writing for me is all about the people and places, and so like Phi I am dedicated to accuracy and respect - especially when it comes to trying to look at the bigger picture.  Tackling a story that looks at the interconnectedness of human experience fascinates me, and I hope by talking about it we can open up some eyes to new things through Tylor and Naveena\u2019s journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I write primarily as Tylor Goadby, all his past lives, and Keita Kenshin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe met five-ish years ago through a mutual and dear friend, Sarah/Tech, who recruited us separately for a writing project. We started talking and writing together a lot, but just as we started making plans, school took over our respective lives and we didn\u2019t talk for nearly two years. We reconnected at the start of summer 2016 and immediately started writing together again, only just recently settling on this project as an actual, viable, publishable thing. As of November 2017, we\u0027ve written over 140,000 words and we really have faith in it, so we hope you have faith in us, too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://u.cubeupload.com/Phiso/thestoryheader.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDetective Tylor Goadby can talk to the dead. It\u2019s not a skill he\u2019s glad to have, but he uses it for good, speaking to the deceased to help solve the crimes that killed them in the first place. He\u2019s working on a murder-missing-persons case in Edinburgh in October 2015 when he comes across Naveena Kulkarni, one of the women reported missing three years before. He\u2019s surprised to see her alive, but he shouldn\u2019t be - she may have died, but she\u2019s returned from the dead, and as the Goddess of Death, to boot. Oh, and he\u2019s her husband, she says, only he doesn\u2019t remember. Reincarnation cycles can do that to a deity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an effort to catch the killer on the loose, Tylor agrees to spend Allhallowtide with Naveena, one of her busiest weekends of the year. Naveena, in an effort to keep her husband close, agrees to take him to her crime scene, a place she hasn\u2019t visited since the day she died. Before he realizes it, Tylor finds himself entangled in the lives of Naveena and Keita Kenshin, the head of the psychopomps, in ways he never expected, and Naveena is forced to confront not only the trauma of her death, but the question of how to be the person she\u2019s been waiting to be since she was last awake 40 years prior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd come to think of it, why hasn\u2019t she been awake in 40 years? Why has it been nearly a century since both the God and Goddess of Death remembered who they were at the same time? Are the Fates being cruel, or are there other forces at play? And what does that mean for Tylor and Naveena?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/16429485\"\u003ePrologue\u003c/a\u003e and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/chapter-1-teaser-13549415\"\u003eChapter 1 Teaser\u003c/a\u003e to get started!

We are looking at these similarities with an idea in mind: what if everyone\u2019s right, in a way? What if, for instance, the God of Death is the same deity everywhere he goes, only with many names and many faces, all suited to the culture he\u2019s facing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are not trying to make any broad claims on religious philosophy or the nature of death. We\u2019re not preaching to anyone, nor is it our intent to uphold or discredit any religion. These are systems of belief that dictate people\u2019s lives, and we want to treat them with respect. We only want to study and highlight the similarities and differences across cultures, and demonstrate that at heart, we\u2019re not so drastically different after all, and all our beliefs are beautiful. In an effort to do this, we are embarking on as much research as we can, reading books and journals, interviewing people, and communicating with scholars. We are also open and happy for help from you guys, as all of you know stuff neither of us know, and we want to speak to as many truths as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso we kind of have to finish this story; Tylor, Naveena, and Keita would never shut up if we didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://u.cubeupload.com/Phiso/whygiveusmoneyheader.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth of us work part time.  With a little extra income, we\u2019ll be able to do things like purchase the academic books we want.  Those books are expensive.  Luckily they aren\u2019t the only place we can research; we want to be able to interview people about their experiences. And we want to provide little thank yous for their time - buy them lunch, send them something small, etc.  Best of all would be to fund our research through personal experience.  We would love to be able to visit the places we are writing about, talk to the people there, and see these festivals in action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a dream where we can become full time writers.  This patreon might help us start that by paying for a day off here and there. Or data storage to keep this ever-growing story, as we live rather far away from each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://u.cubeupload.com/Phiso/tiersheader.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting! So much writing! We have written lots and with your help we can spend more time on this and write \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up, and you get chapters one and two. From there, we\u2019ll be releasing a new chapter every three months. This isn\u2019t because it takes us three months to write a chapter; this simply gives us time to give you draft two instead of draft one. We\u2019ll also be sharing all manner of background information, character development, world-building, and more! None of these will be the final drafts due to the concern over First Publication rights, so you\u2019ll get what we would feel comfortable sharing in a writer\u2019s circle. The final version won\u2019t be ready for months, but you\u2019ll still get to follow the story!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease also note that \"Long Way Down\" is our placeholder title. We\u0027ll get a proper title once more of the story is done!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve got a long journey ahead of us, but we\u0027re really excited about it. We hope you\u0027ll join us for the ride!"
