Selling t-shirts at conventions comprises a large portion of our income. However, it\u0027s physically and emotionally draining to be away from home for so long, and it\u0027s frustrating to be taken away from creative pursuits. As sad as we\u0027ll be to miss out on seeing our fans, we need and want to re-prioritize our time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u00a0It will allow us to begin paying editors to help us with the most tedious part of the process: stringing the videos together. \u00a0If editors are getting paid, they\u0027re able to prioritize deadlines, which means we can actually create and maintain consistent production schedules. \u00a0This means that Martin can write and film or voice act for videos, pass them to the editor to finish, and move on to the next project in the schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u00a0It will allow us to branch out and explore new projects without affecting the release of the current ones too drastically (Mark Remark, YuGiOh Abridged, and other ideas we\u0027ve been conceptualizing). This will also help us to keep things fresh, as one person working on 2-3 projects without ever mixing things up can lead to creative stagnation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce we get into certain budget brackets, we can start saving to rent studio space, or to purchase a home with space that can be converted into an area dedicated to video production--whichever ends up being cheaper on a monthly basis. \u00a0Currently, we only have a small room in an apartment with no room for proper equipment, as well as a \"recording studio\" (closet) that shares a wall with a noisy air conditioner for the building, making work difficult in the summertime. \u00a0Our quality would go up, and our production time would go down.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/82J8oVm.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn closing, we wanted to say\n\u003cstrong\u003e thank you\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0We\u0027ve only make it this far because of your support, and that means the world to us. \u00a0For everyone who\u0027s watched a video, attended our panels, or even emailed us just to say hello, you\u0027re the reason why we were able to continue and why we fight so hard to keep making content in the first place. \u00a0Not many people can say they have a fanbase as generous and as kind as you guys."
