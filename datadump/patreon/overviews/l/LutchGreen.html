And although Youtube is a great platform to connect with you, it is not very supporting to its creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery video I create is in danger of being deemed \u003cstrong\u003e\"not advertiser friendly\"\u003c/strong\u003e or being \u003cstrong\u003eage restricted\u003c/strong\u003e and in order to support myself, I have to water them down, censor them and have to leave interesting or even important parts out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to create videos \u003cstrong\u003ewithout censorship\u003c/strong\u003e for you. I want to educate people about the real world outside their door step; \u003cstrong\u003eunfiltered and unbiased by media\u003c/strong\u003e and opinion makers. I want to show you the \u003cstrong\u003eraw, gory, and disturbing reality\u003c/strong\u003e as it is and not like Youtube and its advertisers like it to be. But in order to do so, I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI set up this Patreon page to enable you to help me create the best content I can and to build a community of people like you and me, \u003cstrong\u003ewho are passionate about the truth\u003c/strong\u003e and want to see the world as it really is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime is money people say and this turns out to be very true for my content. Every dollar you support me with means less time wasted on content- and community guideline issues and more time put into the next video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo thank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e It is you and people like you who make my videos possible. And to show you my appreciation, \u003cstrong\u003eyou will receive exclusive access\u003c/strong\u003e to the raw and uncensored versions of all the new videos, I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I want to make all of those videos available to everyone but for now, I have to limit the access in order to improve their quality. The \"Youtube friendly\" versions of my videos will be available for \u003cstrong\u003efree to everyone\u003c/strong\u003e, of course. That is something which will never change.\u003cbr\u003e"
