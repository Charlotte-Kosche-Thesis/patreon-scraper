    "summary": "I just saw a friend\u0027s post (a video of her playing piano and singing) on here, and it made me think this might be a really good way to have a more interactive relationship with people who enjoy my photos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI go out and take pictures around here nearly every day. A few end up posted to my facebook page. Some, I print and frame, and post on Etsy. You can read about my ongoing framing project there, where I find and refurbish old frames, and price things accordingly, to make art more accessible to everyone. This is my Etsy shop: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/ReframeYourWorld\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReframe Your World\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Be sure to read the \"about\" page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027d like to do here is share photos frequently, and along with the photo, share some of what I was thinking. Why did I choose that subject? Was I experimenting with camera settings? Trying something new? I am constantly learning and getting better at this, and that process, to me, is often as interesting as the photos that result from it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not expecting people to pledge hundreds of dollars, but even a few small pledges would help greatly in allowing me to continue doing this. I\u0027d love for my photography to be self-supporting, to take some of the financial pressure off the rest of my life. Having a reliable source of funding for it, even a small one, will free me up to get out and take photos more often, and will also allow for creation of photo-related things like greeting cards, magnets, and the calendars I enjoy doing at the end of each year. And yes, knowing people enjoy my photos inspires me to create more of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll come up with some \"rewards\" for patrons. To start with, I\u0027ll post photos and commentary here that are not posted elsewhere, so you\u0027ll see more of my work, and gain a greater understanding of it. I can offer digital files of the images as rewards, and at higher levels, send you prints or, potentially, framed versions. I would love to take some of you along on this photographic adventure of mine!"

I don\u0027t know anyone who could afford this.\u003cbr\u003eBut if I did, or if you can... amazing things would be possible.\u003cbr\u003eThis could fund trips a little further away, for photos of places I don\u0027t normally get to see. There are a lot of possibilities here. I have a list as long as my arm of places I\u0027d like to go for photo shoots. They are still relatively close by, but finding the time to go, and a way to do it without having to drive there and back the same day- this level of support would make that possible.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027d share the results.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll the rewards of the lower levels, plus unique, given-only-to-you images from new places throughout the year. I\u0027d let you know what the possibilities are, and you could help decide which locations to go see.\u00a0",

     "description": "If anyone supported me at this level, I\u0027d probably have a heart attack, and no one would get anything.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll do my best to stay healthy enough to be able to continue after such a shock. Plus, all the hiking will help me stay in better shape!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI honestly don\u0027t expect anyone to support me at this level. Instead, I will indulge in some fantasies about what might be possible if anyone ever did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the rewards of the lower levels, obviously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this amount per month, it would significantly reduce the financial stress in my house, and make us all happier, more relaxed, people.\u003cbr\u003eHow does that affect you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, you could feel great about it. What an awesome gift!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would I do with the money?\u003cbr\u003eFor one thing, I\u0027d take that photography class I\u0027ve wanted to take but can\u0027t afford. The Community College near here has turned out some world-class photographers (literally!), so they must know a thing or two.\u003cbr\u003eI could upgrade my equipment, and get some professional lenses, capable of amazing things. Better focus, longer distances, lower light. There is some photography I don\u0027t do at this point because my equipment can\u0027t support it. But with pro equipment? It would open up a whole new world. Yes, most of photography is in the eye and skill of the photographer, but some is in the possibilities those lenses allow.\u003cbr\u003eI could definitely do some traveling to exciting new places. Still not so far away, but I don\u0027t NEED to go far away to find more beauty to photograph.\u003cbr\u003eIf you live nearby, you\u0027d be welcome to join me on some photo shoots. If you are a photographer, we can share ideas and settings, or, if you like, I can offer you tips and suggestions, information on how I capture the images I do. I\u0027ve learned a lot in the past few years, and would love to share it.",
