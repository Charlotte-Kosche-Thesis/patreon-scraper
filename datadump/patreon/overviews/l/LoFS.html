    "summary": "The Luminosity of Free Software (LoFS) is a half-hour show that\u00a0show focuses on the outstanding positive achievements in free (as-in-freedom) software. I cover technical aspects of free software products; the communities that are involved in creating and using free software; and the political and philosophical issues free software faces from time to time,\u00a0bringing my 15 years of experience as a free software developer and community organizer\u00a0to every episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEpisodes are divided into three segments: a technical review, an editorial and a Q\u0026amp;A session. \u00a0The technical review focuses on a single software product and tend to be in-depth but as accessible to a general tech audience as possible. The focus is less on the marketing bullet-points of the product and more on the design and capabilities of the software, often with live demos. The editorial segments take on the \"soft\" topics of free software and the communities around it; free software is a social, collaborative phenomenon and this segment exists due to that. The Q\u0026amp;A session takes on a mix of questions sent in by email and social media as well as live on the irc channel ( #luminosity on irc.freenode.net).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to keep it interesting \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e informative. Yes, at the same time. :) Hopefully everyone, including me, gets to learn something and not fall asleep while watching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people watch the show and provide encouraging feedback, but the LoFS episodes have remained a labor of love that takes time, energy and the occasional bit of money to keep going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBased on feedback from viewers, I\u0027ve purchased better audio and video equipment to improve the show and would like nothing more than to continue to invest in such improvements. Better lighting, a nice backdrop .. that sort of thing. Your support will help make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI organize the shows in my spare time. Researching, writing and other show prep takes several times as long as the actual show itself. I don\u0027t mind this, but when time gets short in the week due to family, work getting hectic or other fancy shiny things dancing around in my general field of vision, I sometimes find myself sacrificing these videos. Your demonstrated support will help keep me motivated and with the incentive to keep producing shows even when something new and shiny dances past. ;)"

I had been using free \nsoftware at work, but didn\u0027t realize what it was. A book on \"Slackware\" \nwhich caught my eye in a bookstore one day fixed all that and by 1998 I \nwas using Linux and other free software on all of my computers. It \nwasn\u0027t long from there until I was contributing back with patches and \nother improvements to the free software I used. Thus started my free \nsoftware career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have traveled the world \nspeaking about free software and sharing its promise and power with \npeople; I have worked to bring people and organizations together around \nfree software \nas a public persona in the free software community; I served as \npresident and director of one of the largest free software commuity\u0027s \nglobal non-profit \nfoundation (KDE e.V.); and have designed and developed significant free \nsoftware products such as Plasma, the world\u0027s first \u0027convergence\u0027 \ndesktop environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, free software is an ethical imperative ... but creating is my passion.\u003cbr\u003e",
