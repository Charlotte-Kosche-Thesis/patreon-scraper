I\u0027ve been writing for \u003cem\u003eyears \u003c/em\u003eand, honestly, it\u0027s been one of the most exhilarating adventures of my life going from being a casual, unpublished writer to writing fiction on a semi-regular basis for an actual fan base. It\u0027s been riveting, challenging, and - above all - absolutely enjoyable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, as I got older, writing became secondary to work and school. Life got hectic, and I lost sight of my passion. I\u0027m here today to rekindle that flame. Through Patreon, I\u0027m hoping to be able to finally get started in my passion for original work. I will continue working on fictions and publishing new chapters for the people that already follow those, while also adding new, original work on the side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy supporting me,\u003c/strong\u003e you will gain access to snippets of my journey - chapter previews, note previews, what I\u0027m reading, things that have inspired me, etc. You will gain early access to new fiction chapters and be the first to know when and if I\u0027m opening commissions. For the middle tiers, you will gain access to my original work and everything along with it - my thoughts, my notes, and eventually, entire chapters. The highest paying tiers will gain access to commission me for whatever they would like written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone that has supported me thus far, and those that support me along the way. \u003cstrong\u003eThere are no words to describe how thankful I am for each and every one of you.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m excited to see where this journey takes me and I\u0027m so happy that you\u0027ve decided to join me along the way. I don\u0027t expect this path to be easy, but with you here, I know that I can see this through.\u003cbr\u003e"
