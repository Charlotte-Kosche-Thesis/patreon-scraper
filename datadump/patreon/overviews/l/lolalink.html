I want to make the best content for you, the people I love to interact with every day! I have 6 years of undergraduate study in psychology, 2 years working as a clinical coordinator, and my name has been published on a handful of studies. Hey, I\u0027ve even received AP and IB credits for Psychology! I\u0027ve been doing this jazz for almost 10 years now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AGR1ngX.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy video games though? The short answer being, I love video games. They\u0027re a new medium to tell a story. They give me more dopamine than television, which is a good thing since I tend to be low in that. The other reason being, I was sick of trying to find videos that presented the content I wanted to see. One day I finally decided to dive in! That\u0027s enough! If I can\u0027t find the content, I will make it myself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y3cWraD.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why give? This is just a means to be able to give you the best content possible. Also, it helps buy me ramen. With ramen, I have just enough energy to make more videos for you. I get ramen, you get psychological insight, life is not a \"zero-sum game\" (;\u00a0"
