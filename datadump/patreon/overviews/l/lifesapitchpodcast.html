If it\u0027s shit, roll in it\"\u003cbr\u003eWe absolutely love making this podcast, it\u0027s central to our creative output as writers, podcasters and members of the online community and as such we\u0027ve enjoyed seeing it grow from complete obscurity to \u003cem\u003enear-complete\u003c/em\u003e obscurity, day by day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s always been a podcast fuelled by the passion and creativity of our amazing audience members. From those who send in fantastic movie titles for us to pitch and evangelise the show to you silent legends listening in darkened rooms so the public doesn\u0027t find out you have bad taste in comedy, we genuinely appreciate every single listen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we don\u0027t want to stop there, like we said before Life\u0027s a Pitch podcast is the centre of everything we do creatively, but we feel like we still have more to give. Patreon is the perfect place for our audience to keep fuelling our creative output and reap the benefits of enabling our crippling attention addiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the coolest things about Patreon is that it allows us to organise little ways for you to be rewarded for your help, extra content, input in the show and even the chance to hang out with us online are all up for grabs, so check out the \u0027Rewards\u0027 column on the right to see what you can get!"

Therefore we have to do real job type things, and that\u0027s just awful. $50 per month would allow us to take time out of our week to quite simply make MORE Life\u0027s a Pitch, and to really make the show grow into something you\u0027re going to enjoy for years to come.",

A reboot of the show would allow us to make something closer to an audio drama, A six episode season, part-written and part-improvised, with a serialised plot, sound effects and everything!",
