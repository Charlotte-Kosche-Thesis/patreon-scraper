    "summary": "Hello folks, I\u0027m Kev, aka lollujo, and you\u0027ve already changed my life. Seriously! Thanks to your views, subs, comments and likes every day, I\u0027m able to support my family doing what I love. And that\u0027s awesome. This Patreon page exists to help make sure I can continue supporting my family doing what I love once the constantly-dwindling pile of cash I have set aside runs out! I\u0027ve got until the summer to figure out a way to fully replace my old income or come September, I\u0027ll be going back to work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the short version anyway. Now for some story time:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI quit my job in February 2017 to allow me to help out more at home with Andy, our 13 year old son who has autism, who at the time been refusing to go to school for 18 months. The difference this has made to our daily lives can\u0027t be fully put in to words. After a lot of work with him over the summer he went back to school in September, and has been going every day since. This has allowed my partner, Anna, to go back to university (she\u0027d had to drop out when Andy first stopped going to school). All of which in turn has allowed me the time to step up my YouTube game, increasing both the quality and quantity of content I\u0027m able to release each day as part of a long-term effort to make the ad-revenue YouTube pay a realistic replacement for my previous income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to continue doing that long term, but realistically ad-revenue alone isn\u0027t going to replace my former income before our savings run out, so if we\u0027re facing a potential shortfall once September 2018 comes around.\u00a0I\u0027ve got so many awesome plans for how to grow this community we\u0027re creating over the next few years, and I really think there\u0027s the potential for us to end up with something awesome at the end of it, but the plans all become much more difficult to put in place if I have to return to work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re able to spare a little bit of cash each month and want to help me achieve my dream of being a full-time YouTuber who can support his family by making silly videos, then I\u0027d be incredibly grateful if you backed my Patreon. If you can\u0027t afford to, or don\u0027t want to, then please don\u0027t feel bad about it - I appreciate you reading this far down the page, and thank you for watching my videos every day - the fact that you enjoy what I do and find space in your day for my nonsense is already an incredible level of support that I\u0027m massively grateful for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll never hide any video content behind a pay wall :)\u003cbr\u003e"
