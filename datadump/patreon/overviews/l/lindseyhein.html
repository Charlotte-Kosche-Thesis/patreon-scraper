    "summary": "Hi friends! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI\u2019ll Have Another\u201d Podcast with Lindsey Hein is a place for conversations that leave you feeling inspired and refreshed. I\u0027m having a blast recording and putting out episodes for this amazing audience that tunes in every week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring each episode, I talk with different friends, athletes, entrepreneurs, non-profit and business leaders. These are people I find motivating and inspiring. I believe you will too.\u003cbr\u003eWe talk about current events in our lives as well as the good, the bad and the ugly of how we got to where we are right now. I\u2019m all about living with purpose and passion while not taking things too seriously. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a 14x marathoner and running coach, I like to talk about running a little bit too. You\u2019ll figure that out.The podcast is light and funny with a side of serious. We\u2019ll discuss the hard things in life \u2014 but also jump into super important topics like who wins The Bachelor or what Justin Beiber is up to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started this page as a way to help me cover the costs involved with putting out this podcast every week. It truly is a labor of love right now and in order for me to work on putting out the best possible content, this will help me prioritize where I can spend my time. Right now a huge bulk of my time is spent editing and that is certainly not my strong suit. With your help, I can outsource some of this work and focus my energy on the conversations with my guests. Not to mention if I outsource editing- the quality for you will be much better for you as the listener!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a regular listener to the show- I hope that you will be able to support the hours I put into getting these episodes out to your ears every week!"
