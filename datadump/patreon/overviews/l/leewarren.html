In year two, I released three more, including my first work of fiction (a Christmas novella). In year three, I\u0027ve released three more titles, including my second work of fiction (another Christmas novella). And I have a growing list of 11 more book ideas. I just need the financial freedom to attack them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancial freedom brings creative freedom for the full-time artist. This has been true as long as art, in its various forms, has existed, but never has there been such great opportunity to attain both types of freedom. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon -- a website that allows anyone who loves the arts to support the artist(s) of his or her choosing. If you are interested in supporting my writing endeavors, you can donate as little as $1 a month.\u00a0You will not only be helping to support me, but you\u0027ll also be helping to pay for editing and book cover designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thanks for your monthly support, you will receive a link to download my e-books for FREE as they are released. I plan to release several books per year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more, just ask. I\u0027d love to talk to you.
