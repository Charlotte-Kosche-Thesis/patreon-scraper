Just two weeks later, in December, the Thomas Fire surrounds my town and I evacuate with just a few possessions, waiting to see if my new tiny-space and everything I still own will be annihilated. In January, I return to an intact home more determined than ever to launch the work and voice on the album. Then, just six weeks after I returned from evacuation, my mother dies after a long illness, but unexpectedly. I receive only a two days notice. Four hours after she dies, the final album files arrive in my inbox. The diary chronicles these ups and downs of life and art, moment by moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDifferent from a topical blog, the long-format entries of The Open Diary are more like a book unfolding chapter by chapter, in real time. Each installment contains several days of entries for the month. So you\u0027ll want to read from the beginning. Make yourself a warm beverage and sit down for a while.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this to be an exchange. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/15650317\"\u003eThe sample excerpt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is the only free content. Everything else is available only to patrons/readers.\nYou can read for as little as $2 per installment, or whatever level you choose.\nI am passionate about artists valuing our work and our culture paying artists for what we offer. Patreon\nmakes this possible, so I practice what I preach here. There are no tiers or\nrewards. All readers get the same access, since I believe that $2 to one person\nmight be as significant as $50 is to another. Let\u0027s be the passionate intense people we are.
