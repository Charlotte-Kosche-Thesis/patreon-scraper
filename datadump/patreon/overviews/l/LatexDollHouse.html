    "summary": "Hello everyone, have been considering my own life and what I want to tackle as objectives, creatively, and I am more and more inclined toward creating fashion items than photos. Photos will follow, of course, as written contents and so on, but I came up with the idea of using Patreon to crowdfund a flow of new rubber items, I call it the \"Rubber Raffle\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is quite simple, each dollar of contribution wins you a ticket for the monthly Rubber Raffle. When we close a funding cycle ( when the pledges allow me to make and ship the item - value goal will be entered at each cycle ) I\u0027ll use a Random Number Generator to pick a winning ticket from a Pool of Tickets, where I can insert each ticket and then to draw the winner of a custom made, custom tailored rubber design. The more people in, the more complex and elaborate the design, and of course, always custom measured, so it fits you. The process is automated and even tho the higher tiers have a greater chance to win, it is all down to luck and nothing will stop a $1 patron from having the winning ticket :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting each cycle I will post the drawings and the needed goal for the item, and closing each cycle, some photos of the making process, my failures on the way, me cursing the Rubber Gods, me loving the Rubber Gods when things work, and the finished item ( maybe with a guest model, if allowed by the owner of the new item ) before shipping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you think? I hope this is something we can make work. For the higher tier contributors who stick over the year, there will be a special Xmas gift, where over the end of the year and start of next, they get a brand new rubber item, custom measured, regardless of the raffle, simply for funding my growth as a fetish photographer and designer over the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd please keep in mind, I am still a novice in making rubber items. Some items come out better finished, some items come out a bit corky. Some I can manage to fix, but some would mean destroying the item. So, some rewards will come out with flows or small mistakes that I try my best to avoid, but they do happen. Of course, I will not send something I consider poorly done. But while I strive to achive \"Pro Level\" quality in my making, keep in mind I am not there yet! With your help, I will! \u003cbr\u003e"
