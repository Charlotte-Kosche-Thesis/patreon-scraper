     "about": "Hi there, my Name is Lineke Lijn (also known as Lynn) and welcome to my Patreon page. I have an amazing drawing channel on Youtube on which I upload a new tutorial every friday in Dutch and English. I have studied at the Academie of Art in Rotterdam and my biggest passions have always been Ink drawing, Graphite drawing, Watercolour painting, Pastel drawing and many various other media. My main subjects of\u00a0 interests are: drawing Perspective, Animals, landscapes and.... I draw every day in hoping to become the best artist I can be ^.^\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have started this Patreon page hoping my viewers appreciate the time, effort and expense that I put into my high quality drawing lessons in which I share knowledge, tips, and especially inspiration! That is why I  would be very grateful if you could donate a small amount to help me continue to make these videos for your enjoyment and it will help me pay for art materials and will support me in making more video demonstrations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlready, several of my viewers have said they learned more from my free YouTube videos than expensive art DVD\u0027s, so for a small donation per month of less than the price of a cup of coffee you will now be able to expand these great\u00a0 Youtube drawing lessons and gain access to the uncut versions to scroll back and forth in as much as needed or want it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you with all my heart - Lineke\u00a0",
