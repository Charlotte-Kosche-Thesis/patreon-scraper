    "summary": "\u201cFarewell\nhas a sweet sound of reluctance. Good-bye is short and final, a word with teeth\nsharp to bite through the string that ties past to the future.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2015 John Steinbeck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is with\na bit heavy heart I write these lines, but I have to announce my retirement\nfrom modding for World of Tanks. I stood by the game since 6.6 came in August\n2011 and started modding shortly afterwards. Looking back, I can say I learned\na lot about coding and I had quite a good time doing so. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLately it\nhowever felt more like a 2nd job working hard and less than a fun hobby to get\nall the mods working again with the next patch. Having lately spent almost the\nentire month since release to get everything working again to my standards,\nseeing it all go to hell again with the next CT iteration is very frustrating.\n(I know WG is reworking the game to finally have a nice mod API, but the\ncurrent transition is slowly killing me. I hope future modders that fill the\nhole I leave behind will benefit from it.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will keep\nmy account, and likely play the game once in a while, but to be honest I also\ndo not like the way WoT is evolving more towards a FPS style game lately. Maps\nI quite liked for the difference they make in playstyle like Dragon Ridge (\"Oh\ngawd..heavies take a minute to climb the hill!!!!\" - So what? Use the time\nto think about tactics and look at the minimap for a change.) and others get\nremoved or remoddeled into closed off corridors with no proper means of\ncrossfire support. It also feels there are less and less tanks with some unique\nplaystyles or properties. Everything gets nerfed or buffed to achieve almoste\nthe same level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTL:DR: I\nneed to take a break from modding and WoT in general. I most likely will not\nreturn to modding this game, as the process devours too much of my spare time,\nthat I\u0027d like to put towards other fun or family related activities. \u003cbr\u003e"
