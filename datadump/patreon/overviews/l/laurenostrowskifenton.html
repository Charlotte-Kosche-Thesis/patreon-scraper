I am an Australian single mother of four amazing children. I have energetic twins and two beautiful spiritual, caring girls. In most ways, I feel blessed. But it was not always that way. In 2010 when my marriage ended my life changed in so many ways. At times I felt that I could not go on. I felt sad; I could not sleep and was anxious and lost. I knew that something about the way I saw my world had to change. I learned how to feel happy every day. I learned how to sleep, and I learned how to reduce my anxiety. I stopped allowing others to define my sense of self. I took back my power. I then devoted myself to helping others achieve peace, learn to sleep, and how to feel happy every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you ever feel lost? Do you ever feel stress, anxiety, or struggle to sleep? I know that I did. After years of feeling loss, experiencing stress, anxiety and struggling at times to sleep I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to help others feel relaxed happy and learn how to sleep. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer, life coach, meditation/yoga teacher, \u0026amp; ASMRtist. I make ASMR videos, guided meditations, and resources to help with sleep, reduce stress, aid study and promote well-being.  I hold an Honours degree in Anthropology and a Masters in Counselling from Monash University, Australia, and have worked as a personal trainer, life coach, speaker, and meditation teacher for many years. I present a podcast called \u2018Being Well with Lauren\u2019 and I have a virtual wellness centre where you can download meditations and resources for happiness, stress reduction, and well-being. In my book Daily Rituals for Happiness, I candidly share my personal experience of loss, childhood bullying, relationship challenges, and the many ups and downs of being a single mum.  I try to offer hope, support and practical advice to readers. I love what I do and feel like you as my viewer or listener are my friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReceive resources on sleep therapy, study aids, and learn how to alleviate stress here:\u003cbr\u003eMy virtual online wellness centre is here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJOIN MY VIRTUAL ONLINE RETREAT for wellness at\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.beingwellwithlauren.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.beingwellwithlauren.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUY MY BOOK Daily Rituals For Happiness at this link:  \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Rituals-Happiness-happy-single-ebook/dp/B01GA4KXWY?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;ref_=pe_2427780_160035660\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Daily-Rituals-Happiness-happy-single-ebook/dp/B01GA4KXWY?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;ref_=pe_2427780_160035660\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen to my podcast \u0027Being well with Lauren \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/being-well-with-lauren/id1030685050?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/being-well-with-lauren/id1030685050?mt=2\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/ch4lsn\"\u003eFREE MEDITATION DOWNLOAD\u003c/a\u003e - Hi, Gentle Souls- I am now giving away high-quality audios to those of you who feel like joining my mailing list- This is a private discrete mailing list through which I try( allowing for four kids)to stay in contact with you.
