    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHelp support Last Stock Legends as we continue to develop season two of our flagship series!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everyone! We are Last Stock Legends, and we make documentary pieces on the history of the Super Smash Bros. Melee competitive scene. We launched our initial through funding of our Kickstarter page. Over the past year and a half, we have spent countless hours evolving our series from a concept of two to three minute shorts on Smash history into what it is now. In its inaugural season, Last Stock Legends touched on some of the most prominent Melee matches and moments of all time, from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/V25aEBZnYzs?list=PL9BlKDIsw6YiFYuh-262RVyeEA8pgFGeB\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKen, the King of Smash, testing the water in Japan\u003c/a\u003e, to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Kju2AAx1xYI?list=PL9BlKDIsw6YiFYuh-262RVyeEA8pgFGeB\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWombo Combo\u003c/a\u003e, the first piece of smash content to go globally viral. Apart from this, we were able to dig up videos that many people believed to be lost content, such as the original recording of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvgfys99auI\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKen vs. Bombsoldier\u003c/a\u003e. There is no doubt in our minds that Season one was a success, and for season two...well, always forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you guys need support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePeople see us walking around Smash tournaments with our cameras, on the main stage in Mango\u0027s face, and sometimes in the hotel lobby scouring for interviews. So if the work is already being done, what more could we ask for? Well, while we had a fantastic time working at events in order to try and fund our passion project, it often times left us stretched thin. Some events, we were creating (shooting and editing) upwards of 10+ pieces on site, on top of shooting for multiple projects that would be released afterwards. In order to shoot some of our interviews for Last Stock Legends, we often times needed to squeeze people into short time slots without much pre-work, a method that any videographer will tell you is ineffective. Regardless, we made it work, and we are thankful that we have that opportunity to begin with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this season, we want to change things. We want to be able to show the community the difference between a 25 minute hotel interview, and an interview where we can explore locations, spend time with the talent, and develop a truly powerful interview with the subject. Does that mean that we\u0027ll never do a hotel lobby interview again? Not a chance. We\u0027ll be interviewing people at events as often as we can. But what it really means is that if we want to interview a particularly important European player, but we can\u0027t work for Dreamhack, we can make the trip ourselves supplemented through the company as well as through community support in order to tell the story the way that we believe it should be told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what happens if I can\u0027t support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, to be honest, not much will change. This isn\u0027t an ultimatum. We are by no means saying that we are only creating season two if we can receive the cash amount we\u0027re looking for. One way or another, we are going to make this project. We started this project because we believe that these stories need to be told. We\u0027re not a team putting out a piece on their player, we\u0027re folks from the community who love the scene, and love storytelling. That\u0027s what drives us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we don\u0027t receive the support we\u0027re looking for, we\u0027ll continue as we are. We will take up extra jobs to make ends meet. We\u0027ll rush around at events to grab a player for a couple minutes for an interview. But we truly believe that your support will make a tangible difference in our series, and we are excited to show all of you what we are capable of. We are much more than a DSLR in a window-lit room. We are a passionate group of learners who will stop at nothing to grow our skills as we revive history into the modern age. And maybe, just maybe, you\u0027ll want to come along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for taking the time to read this!
