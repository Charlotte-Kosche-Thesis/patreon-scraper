    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy desire here is to create a space to re-imagine the conversation around motherhood as a calling and a spiritual path. It is to make space to share wisdom and create other meaningful educational content that can spark meaningful conversation and growth in visionary mothers who desire to live a \u00a0dynamic \u201cnew story\u201d experience. It is a space to honor being \u0027just a mom\u0027 and to deepen in the gifts of the alchemy of tending the hearth of the home and the family. Motherhood is beautiful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u003cem\u003e\u00a0else am I? Heres my professional\u00a0background and what I think qualifies me to be a valuable voice for these messages.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent my twenties diving into the personal development and female empowerment industry, starting with being the first trained Art of Feminine Presence teacher (a now global body of work taught by Rachael Jayne Groover) in 2010 and growing a rather large community of women in Austin Texas teaching and sharing that work. This work was about presence, feminine energy, and womens leadership. During that time I spent many hours in business masterminds and working with Rachael Jaynes budding company to grow the AFP trainings all over the world. I blended my local classes with an online presence, 1:1 coaching and began making you tube videos weekly and speaking in my local community on the topic of feminine presence and female entrepreneurship, eventually working with healer and spiritual types in helping them to create their own businesses with their ideas and modalities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough teaching and integrating the concepts and practices I learned in the Art of Feminine Presence, through becoming a speaker and a workshop facilitator, and through listening to and supporting many women over the course of my coaching career, I developed very deep skills of listening to my own body and to other women\u0027s bodies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I entered the realm of female sexuality teachings and learned a lot about the dangers of cults, when gurus meet sexuality, and it basically blew my whole world apart. I had to spend the next three years healing from trauma, loss, soul fracture, the violation of and manipulation of my essence and mind control. I had to learn how to untangle myself from everywhere that I had given my power and mind away over my entire life. It was painful, but so rewarding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 I studied with Sarah Bryden inside a Sacred Sexuality Course based in the Mogadao Daoist Schools lineage. This training helped me heal much around sexuality and gave me deeper tools and understandings around the female body, energy healing, and embodiment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I created a course based on my own personal study of my menstrual cycle and learning how to sync my life and actions with each phase and it\u0027s unique cocktail of hormones and instructions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Son was born at home in September of 2016 and I\u0027ve since been being a mom and integrating the experience from pre-conception, pregnancy, birth and post partum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have BA in sports medicine. I spent 10 years training in classical modern dance and other styles as a teenager. And I spent 5 years as a personal fitness trainer, some of which were spent as a crossfit coach and paleo nutrition coach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a way for me to begin teaching and sharing again after 20 months of allowing motherhood to shape me. It will grow as we grow and you will see it change and shift with the seasons, as my family grows, and as we all grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo participate, choose an option that feels rite for you to contribute. I am grateful for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLauren\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
