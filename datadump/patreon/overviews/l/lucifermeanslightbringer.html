    "summary": "We believe that George R. R. Martin has put a lot of effort and thought into creating a deeper dimension of archetype and symbol in his writing.   He\u2019s created connections between past and future, between sky and ground.  He\u2019s built on classic figures from world mythology and twisted them around in new and incredible ways to fashion his own archetypal characters whose divine roles are played out by the characters in the story.\u00a0He\u2019s done all of this not only to be artistic and clever, but because he\u2019s actually participating in a grand tradition of esoteric, symbolic art.  Keeping this tradition alive is of critical importance and tremendous value to society, and that is why I believe this facet of A Song of Ice and Fire is so worthy of study. This podcast is intended to be our vehicle to explore these inner workings, and it is fueled by enthusiasm, yours and mine. We\u0027d like to not only keep this podcast going, but take it to new heights. \u00a0We want to to put out at least one episode per month, perhaps more if I begin chopping them up into smaller bits. We\u0027d like to start doing youtube videos, shorter versions of mythical astronomy ideas that can be easily shared. We\u0027d like to do anything we can to\u00a0get out the word about this expertly-crafted layer of symbolism and myth which, in my opinion, elevates \u003cem\u003eA Song of Ice and Fire\u003c/em\u003e to the level of \u2018true masterpiece.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMythical Astronomy first brought you the (theoretically) true cause of the Long Night - a celestial moon catastrophe and subsequent meteor shower. We revealed the likely nature of Azor Ahai to be one which is more villain than hero. We\u0027ve made a strong case for explaining the truth behind the Hammer of the Waters and the breaking of the Arm of Dorne. \u00a0But we have many more things to reveal and analyze from the mythical astronomy perspective - the secrets of the Others and the children of the forest and the Green men on the Isle of Faces; other myths to unravel like those of Durran Godsgrief, the Grey King, Garth the Green, and the Night\u0027s King and his icy corpse queen. \u00a0We have mythical astronomy character studies to do for all the main characters in the book. \u00a0We have many chapters to analyze which containing vivid running metaphors all the way through, such as we examined with the Mountain vs. the Viper trial-by-combat. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd best of all, we have a ton of cool swag. T-shirts. Poster prints. Cool nicknames. New ways to interact with the podcast and leave your stamp of input. \u00a0Your name written in the stars (in a manner of speaking). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast will remain free, and please feel free to keep listening for free.  But if you\u2019d like to help keep the podcast going and propel it onward and upward\u2026 I am officially inviting you to join starry host Lucifer means Lightbringer\u00a0\u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e the starry host.\u003cbr\u003e"
