Most of our comics will have pretty deep and emotional story lines, some of them will contain a good chuckle here and there. Either way, we hope that you\u0027ll enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Okay, but who ARE ya?*\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOkay, okay, fair enough.

I\u0027m the founder, and the head of Lunas Comics.\u00a0I created Lunas because I grew up loving comics, and sometimes coming up with ideas for my own - until I started to write them down. However, when I started that - I began having sleepless nights caused by further developed ideas. From there, Lunas was born!\u00a0Like I said, I am a nerd. If it\u0027s nerdy, i\u0027ll like it. I play the odd game now and then, but I always seen to play roughly the same ones (Rust, CSGO, Monster Hunter World and Shadow of the Colossus) to avoid working through over 600+ games on my steam account. I also watch too many TV shows to keep up with but the main ones are; Game of Thrones (obviously), The Flash (I have a flash tattoo, so yeah, I watch the show) and the rest of the Arrowverse, Rick and Morty, Suits and too many more to list... or remember.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lunascomics.com/img/avatars/DirectorLegit.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name\u0027s Christian or DirectorLegit (Director, Legit, and DL all work!) and I\u0027m the Illustrator/Graphics Artist for Lunas Comics. When Ryan asked me to join Lunas Comics as the Visual Artist, I jumped at the opportunity! I\u0027ve always loved to draw, and I\u0027m a sucker for cartoon-y art styles. Whenever I had any free time, I\u0027d doodle anything that came to mind. My best memories in high school were taking a break from the depressing atmosphere and just doodling over my notes. Even now, I sit through college lectures, doing the exact same thing. Seemed like a match made in heaven! I\u0027m a \u003cstrong\u003every\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0big fan of Disney movies, because of the different styles of art, I\u0027m especially a fan anything containing space aliens, Sci-Fi technology, and robots. I\u0027m big into adventure games with the same concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(But Kingdom Hearts is my favorite series, by FAR.)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://lunascomics.com/img/avatars/Window.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHey! I\u0027m Lukas/Window, A writer and a Social Media Manager for Lunas. When I joined Lunas, I was incredibly excited because my dream seems to be finally coming true. I\u0027ve always wrote since about 1st grade. We always had a book writing competition in school and always I would win 1st place and teachers and family pressing me to write more and submit to publishers. As a person with extreme anxiety, that was always a hard thing to even think about and constantly be around.But now fast forward years and years later, my friend Ryan created Lunas Comics and talked me into turning my stories into comics... It just felt right. \u003cbr\u003e\nI mostly spend my free time writing, playing video games, and tweeting... WAYYY too much tweeting. I\u0027m almost constantly on twitter. There\u0027s not a tweet I miss usually. I\u0027m just... a \n\t\u003cem\u003ebit\u003c/em\u003e obsessed with twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.lunascomics.com/img/avatars/projects.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.lunascomics.com/img/avatars/rylonThumbnail.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[On Hiatus] Rylon: The Bot That Could Have Been\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce upon a time, in the future, there was a robot named \"Rylon\". He used to live out his days on a ship, traveling the universe, with his creator. He has a name, but the bot would always call him, \"Creator\". They would travel the universe, helping others, seeing the sites, and making new friends. But, one day, a strange lightning bolt hit their ship and knocked out their systems. Rylon went to repair the damage, but He wasn\u0027t prepared what he would find. \"Rylon: The Bot That Could Have Been\", Is a sci-fi comic prequel to the comic series \"MisFit Heroes\", explaining the origins of Director X. In this comic, you\u0027ll learn who Director X used to be, How he got his powers, and what he\u0027s lost because of them. This comic will be released in parts, and once completed, it will be put together in a singular comic for your convieniance!\u003c/div\u003e"
