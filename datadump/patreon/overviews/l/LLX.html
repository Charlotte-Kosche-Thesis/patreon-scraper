    "summary": "Has there ever been a old toy no longer sold you want but its going for 500 or more on Ebay? Maybe your favorite toy broke and you wanted to know what makes it tick to fix it. Or maybe you have a original idea. That is what I am about, even at the lowest milestone great things are possible as my youtube channel is all about taking toys apart, seeing how they work and figuring out new way to use them or recreate them.\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you more into the TV side of things my Power Toku Weekend streams shows like Precure, Kamen Rider, Power Rangers, and Masked Rider and show streaming them every weekend. I\u0027d live to bring you Toku 7 days a week as well but with just the Saturday and Sunday streams taking up my entire weekend just to prep and set up but hitting the higher milestones means being able to buy and maintain equipment to bring you Toku more often, starting with 3 days and working up to the full 7 and the process is perfected but to get to that point requires new equipment, and that requires money. In the end as a Patreon you see more of the stuff you want more often, and as a side benefit once the toys or equipment is no longer needed due to shelf space limits or upgrade you can get it for your own as your donations then directly decrease the out of pocket price you would pay to get that same item once it\u0027s time to clear the shelves. A $50 item being sold to clean shelves after you have donated $25 would only cost you $25.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf this sounds like the kind of thing you would support become a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e"

IE If you donate 30 for for 3 months that\u0027s $90 total which is the total value of liquidated items you can claim (Shipping is separate however). In essence see something on my show you really like well at some point it will have to go on sale to make room for other things.

At $1000 I still have a budget for toys for Raw Reviews and Customizer Corner but now instead of splitting my time between trying to find a job (or working after i found one), working toward my Bachelors, AND bringing you Toku Weekends. I can take care of my rent for the month, or buy new dedicated equipment to set up for streaming. At this level I can afford to set up a Toku Friday and possibly one for Thursday. In other words at this level you get more Toku more often AND still get toy reviews and customs.",

At this level there is a $500 budgets for reviews, $800 for the streaming equipment and maintenance costs (which includes things like a non shared internet connection and a computer that doesn\u0027t over heat after 2 hours) and enough left over to actually afford to eat (egads!) This is roughly what I make over 4 months for my Financial Aid for school which has to cover all my living expenses, food, and still have something left over for review products. I would also be able to slow down on my course load as I wouldn\u0027t need to take 4 classes a semester just to have enough money to live off off. Meaning more dedicated time for Toku Days and Reviews. In short at this time Reviews and Streaming becomes my job.",
