    "summary": "Piedmont Laugh Riot creates kink-centric videos, videogames, works of art, and much much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you again?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePiedmont Laugh Riot, a fetish production outlet that concentrates on the tickle kink with a healthy dose of bondage and barefeet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd you make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMostly videos, but also artworks, videogames, and hopefully soon full comics featuring kinky content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a fetish, if it made sense to everybody it wouldn\u0027t be a fetish. It would be vanilla porn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s your business model?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePLR aims to keep content free and easily accessible, for a number of reasons. The usual pay-per-clip outlets feature any kind of sexual content you could think of! Great when you\u0027re in the market to buy that, but not what we do, and not what the people who are otherwise comfortable with tickle material and light foot content would want to be (directly or indirectly) associated with. A dedicated website keeps the kinky-but-clean material where the production team can have complete control over accessibility, and the individuals involved in the videos can feel comfortable knowing it\u0027s not being confused with less flattering content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s the money for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike any kind of content, the videos featured on PLR cost money to produce. Sometimes, someone can be talked into giving a shoot a go just to have a new experience under their belt! Other times, however, it\u0027s also a modeling opportunity. Monetary donations to the site will help continue production of videos with those individuals who are game for a new type of shoot, but also wish to be compensated for their time. There\u0027s also equipment updates, fun new materials to use on models, new structures to put those models in, and costumes for themed videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s not all! PLR also features free-to-play videogames and will soon expand to comics! These, however, are also created by artist who need to be compensated for their time and hard work. Pledging will help make sure this content keeps coming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what\u0027s in it for me?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVideos! Free videogames! Free art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I know in this day of instant gratification, the promise of more material that\u0027s already readily available isn\u0027t always a solid motivator. As such, high paying donators may receive custom videos (with the understanding they will also go up on the site...), a storyline in a game, or some other kind of perk to be determined later!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe sure to contact laughriotjames@gmail.com for each months updated password.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
