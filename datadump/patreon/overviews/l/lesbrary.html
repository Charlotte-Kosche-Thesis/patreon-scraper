    "summary": "My name is Danika and I love talking about queer women books on the internet. I\u2019ve been running \u003ca href=\"http://lesbrary.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe Lesbrary\u003c/a\u003e, a lesbian book blog with about a dozen contributors, since 2010. I also run the tumblr \u003ca href=\"http://biandlesbianliterature.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBi \u0026amp; Lesbian Literature\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Danneeness/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea booktube channel\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u2019m a contributor at \u003ca href=\"http://bookriot.com/author/danika-ellis/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBook Riot\u003c/a\u003e. I already talk about queer women books in basically all of my free time, but I\u2019d like to do even more of it, which is why I am launching a Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to be able to devote more of my time to promoting queer books, including more reviews, videos, and discussions posts. Ideally, I would love to be able to start a series called Lesbian Literature 101. This is a project I\u2019ve been wanting to do for years, but I haven\u2019t had the time to do the sort of research it would require. I want to outline the history of queer women books in an accessible way, because I have found that this history is often erased and hidden. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, I would like to be able to clean up the tag system of both the Lesbrary and its tumblr to make things easier to find. I would love to be able to start a podcast or a readalong series to reach even more people with queer book discussions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all sounds great for me, but what\u2019s the incentive for you to donate? Well, reading as many queer women books as I do, I end up with stacks of them that I no longer need. If you become a Patreon supporter at the $2 level or higher ($5 supporters get two entries), you would be entered to \u003cstrong\u003ewin a queer women book every month\u003c/strong\u003e! And yes, this is open internationally!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support of the Lesbrary and its offshoots!"
