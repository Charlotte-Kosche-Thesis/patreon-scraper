    "summary": "Hi folks! We\u0027re back from our hiatus and Season 5 is in full swing. This year we\u0027re focusing on the larger pantheons and we\u0027re starting with the Greeks. Three multi-part stories will occupy the first 15 weeks of Season 5 and will feature the heroes Perseus, the Argonauts, and Theseus. After that it\u0027s the Norse, then Japan, then... wait a minute, I\u0027m giving too much away! \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll have to listen to find out\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show format has changed. I\u0027ve moved to Maine so Eric is no longer co-hosting, though we\u0027re passively pondering how he might get re-involved at some point. The YouTube channel is in a state of limbo because we need to figure out how, given a lot of personal family-related challenges, we\u0027re going to find the time to utilize it meaningfully. Each episode is now a short intro, a story, a short whisky suggestion, and a goodbye. Nico is still producing beautiful music for us and we\u0027re in \u003cem\u003e\"hunker down and let\u0027s make this damn thing profitable this year\" \u003c/em\u003emode. Grace has also joined the team and handles regular postings on our social media accounts (she\u0027s literally the saving Grace of my sanity).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an effort to keep it simple, we have one giving tier now. You can give more if you like, but the only perks that exist now are the perks we give at the $3 level. You get access to our back catalog and access to our secret Facebook group. There are also some early releases, very occasional Facebook live hangout type thing, and extra episodes here and there. I think we\u0027re also giving 50% off our albums to patrons as well... *double checks*... yeah, we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo become a Patron. We love you \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e"
