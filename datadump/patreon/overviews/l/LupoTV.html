It\u0027s an exciting opportunity to connect with my viewers and have my viewers connect with me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform where channel subscribers like yourself can \u003cstrong\u003edirectly support and communicate\u003c/strong\u003e with your favorite creators. An artist or video creator can receive crowd-sourced funding to make a living and continue to \u003cstrong\u003ecreate ongoing content.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am using this platform to \u003cstrong\u003efree myself of dependency\u003c/strong\u003e on YouTube earnings that have declined so drastically. When enough of my viewers become Patreons it will allow me deliver \u003cstrong\u003eunrestricted content without fear of YouTube repercussions\u003c/strong\u003e. It will also allow me to finally have a more steady income so I can have a stable home life and make this into a real career. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tarrinlupo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tarrin P. Lupo, D.C.\u003c/strong\u003e I grew up in northern Virginia but have spent most of my life living in the countryside and the south. \u00a0A few years ago I moved north to New Hampshire as a member of the Free State Project and currently live in the scenic White Mountains. I am still a licensed chiropractor but don\u0027t really see patients anymore. I always wanted to be a storyteller and teacher so I decided to try to make a full-time living being an author and YouTube content creator. I find this reality continually fascinating and make a variety of stories on anything that piques my interests. My YouTube channel is 9 years old and reflects my changing interests with almost 600 videos on a slew of topics. I think I have finally found my passion; now I just have to figure out a way to make a living at it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I host a variety channel called LupoTV. \u00a0Some of the areas my videos cover are natural health, growing food, self-empowerment, humor, personal vlogs, gaming, and esoteric topics. I also host a live talk show once to twice a week covering these topics. If you have many interests like I do and enjoy variety, then help me grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat Do I Do with the Money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e1) The first stages will go directly to upgrading my equipment and internet speed.  Currently my 8 year old computer is barely hanging on and I need a new one. 2) After that goal is accomplished the next step will be to save funds so I can invest them on awesome projects and travel to make more on-location documentaries. 3) Lastly I would like to make enough to make a living so I can free up time for important things, like spending time with my cat and enjoying life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP.S.\u003c/strong\u003e It is surprisingly expensive to keep \"Cool Cat\" living the kitty high life and your donations will also go to keeping him healthy and happy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat If I Don\u0027t Have the Funds to Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eFirst off, 95% of my material will always be free and up on YouTube. I am just grateful you care enough to watch my stories. But to be fair, I\u0027ve made a couple affordable donation options ($1 or $5 per month) to try to give everyone a chance to support LupoTV. Either way, I appreciate your viewership! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
