     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there!\u003c/strong\u003e My name is Bryan and I create real life recipes for video game food. Currently I write a blog about my adventures in the kitchen on my website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.level1chef.com.\"\u003ewww.level1chef.com\u003c/a\u003e. There you can find recipes, photos, and other information dedicated to bringing food from pixels to your plate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough the dishes I create are inspired by food items found in video games, the blog isn\u0027t just for gaming fans, I have a strong dedication to culinary education as well. I have a degree in culinary arts and I\u0027ve worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years in pastry and soux chef capacities. In that time I\u0027ve trained many new cooks and in doing so realized my passion for teaching. Three years ago I decided to start a recipe blog to help bring my knowledge and practical experience to kitchen newcomers everywhere. My dream is to author cookbooks one day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo why video games then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been a huge video game fan ever since Kindergarten when my Dad brought home a Super Nintendo one day. Not only are the worlds they create colorful and imaginative, but there is a strong sense of nostalgia tied to them as well. As a kid I remember day dreaming about making the things I found in these games in real life, like a cool weapon, an outfit, or in many instances, a bizzare food item. One game in particular, EarthBound, had a food item called the \"peanut cheese bar\" that stuck with me throughout the years until one day I just had to sit down and figure out a way to make it for myself. Even though it didn\u0027t taste *great* I had a lot of fun coming up with the recipe and so began my journey into the world of \"fiction foods.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m asking for your support here on Patreon today so I can cover the costs of ingredients, equipment, and time spent creating great content instead of slaving away in a restaurant kitchen. I want to continue creating new and exciting recipes and expanding my website in fun new ways. In addition to helping me achieve this, there are rewards in it for you as well! Get exclusive behind the scenes Lvl.1 Chef information, answers to tricky cooking questions, or even become part of the process by working with me to bring some of YOUR favorite video game foods to life!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nIt\u0027s important to have goals. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goals are to expand my content creation into new avenues like Twitch and Youtube. I want to start live streaming cooking tutorials and recipes for you guys and doing some food-centric game playthroughs. I\u0027m also interested in trying my hand at writing game reviews (with a strong focus on the food of course.) \u00a0I will continue to work on bringing you high quality and informative recipes as I have been and hopefully with an increased frequency thanks to your support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo thanks, I really appreciate you checking out my Patreon page.
