I recognize that this type of work is a privilege. I live with Type 1 Diabetes and while it\u0027s a challenge in my life, I am still able to get access to the medication that enables me to get outside and make photographs and films.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://livingvertical.org/bantings-ghost/\"\u003eNow I am working on a documentary project called \"Banting\u0027s Ghost\"\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewhich will focus on people living with diabetes right here in the United States who DON\u0027T have that same access to insulin. Frederick Banting, one of the researchers behind the discovery of insulin sold his share of the initial patent for $1 and I believe he\u0027d have something to say about the current state of affairs.
