    "summary": "Well hello,\u00a0dear reader! Thanks for stopping by. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of people ask me to arrange or format their song choices for the ukulele and/or make\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/learntouke\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo tutorials on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve done this patchily in the past but I\u0027m happy to do more and more from here on. With you on board, I\u0027ll be able to devote more time to it and take your requests. With your support, we can share the love of ukulele and I can make more online resources, especially for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patreon, you can suggest what tutorials/songs I do next and support the making of new videos and the increase in their quality as I get better at facing a camera and get more help with editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy is it in dollars? Well, Patreon, this site, that encourages you to become a Patron of the Arts, is an American company. So, despite me being a Brit, it\u0027ll be\u00a0charged in dollars. At the time I just looked, a dollar is 71p so please be generous. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting me. I look forward to strumming with you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLorraine x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to know a bit more about me? Here it is in a nutshell...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started playing ukulele - my first instrument* in 2007, in a workshop with the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ukuleleorchestra.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUkulele Orchestra of Great Britain\u003c/a\u003e**. I had a lot of fun and wanted to keep the momentum going, so shortly afterwards, I set up \u003ca href=\"http://ukulelewednesdays.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUkulele Wednesdays\u003c/a\u003e (free London Ukulele Jam, started in one place and now spans three venues at the same time in London, plus one in Singapore and a number of others around the planet that I\u0027ve been told about), then \u003ca href=\"http://karauke.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKaraUke\u003c/a\u003e (the worlds only ukulele karaoke band) and a year later (due to popular demand) I retrained as a ukulele teacher and set up \u003ca href=\"http://www.learntouke.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn To Uke\u003c/a\u003e. I teach several ukulele classes each week in London, UK via \u003ca href=\"http://www.learntouke.co.uk/\"\u003eLearn To Uke\u003c/a\u003e. Between teaching, \u003ca href=\"http://ukulelewednesdays.com/\"\u003eUkulele Wednesdays\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://karauke.co.uk/\"\u003eKaraUke\u003c/a\u003e, and my friends and family, my spare time to format songs and make tutorials has been very limited. Let\u0027s put this thing right, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ukulele is my life companion, and it\u0027s brought me many of my best friends, and most fun experiences. I have such a great time playing with others, and I adore seeing people learn new stuff and getting as big a kick out of it as I do. My favourite students are those who enjoy it, practice, and come back hungry for more. That means you. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*unless you count tooting a painful rendition of \u0027London\u0027s Burning\u0027 on the recorder at school.\u003cbr\u003e**they are very VERY talented, and you should check them out if you haven\u0027t already."
