I always opt to give these things away as I just don\u0027t like the thought of someone needing to give me ( or anyone for that matter ) some silly money just to have access to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I have lived with my parents for the past 25/26 years and throughout this time I have learned.... or remembered ;) (whatever wording you prefer) many wonderful things as well as made a huge amount of amazing and incredible friends. The encouragement given to me by each of You, is just as important to me as all the sincere and constructive criticism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am dedicating my Life to co-creating a Better World. Peace, in the truest and most expansive/encompassing and beautiful sense of the word, will be realized and brought into Reality. Currency in all forms will be abandoned and left behind as we all realize that we Truly do not need it. I do not know what the timeframe for these changes will be, I only know that I will never give up on these dreams/wishes/goals/ambitions that are shared by so many.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not feel as if I am \"special\"... or to put it another way, I do not think that I am especially \"special\". As I definitely do feel that each and every one of us is very special, unique, and powerfully significant. I am definitely trying to set us all free... in a way... but my main course of action for doing this is to Set Myself Free. I Love to do as much as I can to help take care of others, but I know that at the end of the day it all truly comes down to the individual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written a petition which can be found here ( \u003ca href=\"http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/decriminalize-all-substances\"\u003ehttp://petitions.moveon.org/sign/decriminalize-al...\u003c/a\u003e ) titled - Decriminalize all substances, Declassify and release all secrets, and drop all charges against Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, and Jeffrey Sterling - I have been calling it the Petition Of Ambition =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live on a Planet of absolute Abundance. There is, and very likely always has been, more than enough to go around so that we all can Live exactly the Life we want to. We Are all in this together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be informing all of my supporters of how each and every penny is spent, without exception. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace, Love, and Balance\u003cbr\u003e"
