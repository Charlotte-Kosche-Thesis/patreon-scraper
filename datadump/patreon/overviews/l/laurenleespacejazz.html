    "summary": "Hey Guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thanks for taking the time to check out my project. I wanted to give you a little more of a breakdown about where you\u0027re money is going and give you the peace of mind to know that I\u0027m not spending it on booze and shoes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever cut a record, you know it\u0027s expensive. There is a seemingly endless amount of work that goes into the process, and every step along the way isn\u0027t cheap.\u00a0If you contribute, you\u0027re contributing to the project as a whole, not for an individual copy of the CD and your credit card will only be charged once, not every single time I decide to start a new project. Every dollar contributed goes toward all of the elements that go into creating a successful and high quality product.\u00a0Writing the music, getting it printed, finding spaces to rehearse it, getting to the gigs to play it, setting a time to record it, getting it mixed and mastered and ready for distribution, creating the discs, creating the materials to market it, pay for advertising, taking it on the road to get it to the people that want to hear it... it\u0027s a full time job that you\u0027re not really getting paid to do. We live in an era where it\u0027s easier than ever for independent, creative people to create and release their own content, which is awesome! But it comes at a price much higher than most artists, like myself, can afford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The Consciousness Test\" is a very personal project for me. I\u0027ve been creating this music almost as a \u0027dare\u0027 to myself. I\u0027ve been betting myself that I didn\u0027t have the guts to write a series of songs that are about a subject as touchy as mental health or as cerebral (pun intended) as neurology. I dared myself to not worry about genre or to be limited by the notion of trying to \u0027make it sound like jazz\u0027. Wayne Shorter said it best: \"Jazz is not supposed to be something that\u0027s required to sound like jazz. For me, the word jazz means \u0027I dare you\u0027 \". Challenge accepted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that in some way, this music can help put an end to the stigmatization of discussing mental health and encourage the listeners to realize there\u0027s nothing to be ashamed of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first leg of the journey is done! The tracks are recorded and have been edited and ready to go. Still need help with the distribution! Take a listen to the sample track to hear a glimpse of what\u0027s in store!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace,\u003cbr\u003eLauren\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "The Lauren Lee \u201cSpace Jazz\u201d Trio is a boundary-pushing trio of Lauren Lee (vocals/piano/compositions), Charley Sabatino (bass), and Andy O\u2019Neill (drums). Under the influence of musicians and composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Eric Dolphy, and Bjork, Lauren\u2019s compositions showcase the instrumental quality of her voice and impeccable ear for the balance between subtlety and gratuity. Compositions and arrangements are centered around contrast, pointillism, improvisation, vocal-instrumentalism, and non-traditional roles of the three instruments. The music is fresh, edgy, familiar, and difficult to place in the best way.",
