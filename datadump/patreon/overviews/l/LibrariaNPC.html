Among other things, I am a librarian, long-time game master (GM), sometimes playtester, and the Editor-in-Chief of the blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stickybunton.com/\"\u003eSticky Bunton\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are You Making?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFor those of you who are coming here without knowing of my writing: I have been writing weekly blog posts (Wednesdays, 12:00 PM EST) with a primary focus on tabletop roleplaying games (RPGs), the gaming community, and blacksmithing, since March 2015. I write, on average, four reviews/posts a month, with each review averaging around two-thousand words (usually more for bigger projects).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are other content types that I would love to explore as well, such as system-neutral one-shot adventures, interviews with RPG developers, and possibly continuing my blacksmithing posts (like I had done with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stickybunton.com/?s=Confection+Cleaver\"\u003eCakerist, the Confection Cleaver\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://stickybunton.com/tag/swordsmithing/\"\u003emy first foray into making a sword\u003c/a\u003e). These are all quite a bit away though due to financial limitations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are You On Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile I may be the Editor-In-Chief for Sticky Bunton, it is not a paying gig. I have been given a large number of comments and praises for my reviews, insights, and even the trials faced at the forge. While I love doing it, I am unable to continue producing content at the speed my readers are used to due to financial concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time, I have reduced my reviews to a bi-weekly basis due to financial restrictions, and have to consider the drastic approach of limiting new content to once per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of going to that extreme, my fellow writers and gamers suggested I try a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach RPG I review normally runs between $30-$60 to acquire the material, not factoring in any extra costs (like shipping), bonuses from a Kickstarter or any deals I find, nor does this include any board games or RPG peripherals (minis, dice bags, GM kits, etc) that I review from time to time.These costs also don\u0027t account for time spent on reading (with materials going up to 700 pages) and writing, nor does it factor in other costs I face (replacing aging tech, internet/data bills, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I prefer my reviews to be as candid and unbiased as possible, I strive to acquire materials without feeling as though I \"owe\" a positive review in exchange for the product. Funding acquired from this Patreon will allow me to acquire new materials for review in a timely fashion to maintain both a regular (ideally weekly) schedule, while also giving me autonomy to write these honest, unbiased, and candid reviews. Reducing financial stress is also a plus, giving me more time to focus on writing and less on side-gigs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Do You Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBesides the \"Warm, Fuzzy Feeling\" boost? A few things, actually!.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary reward to everyone here (and beyond) would be my continuation of reviewing of RPGs and related materials on a weekly basis. While I would \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to bring back my blacksmithing posts and write adventures, that is some time away due to the costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you backing me, regardless of tier, you\u0027ll have access to my backer-only posts, polls, and will have the ability to offer votes and suggestions for what I should be reviewing. All backers will also have early access to my reviews as I write them, and are free to ask questions and get answers before the review goes live! With higher tiers, you have more sway with regards to what I review next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can get enough backing, I hope to be able to add more content as well as new rewards. Every little bit helps at this point!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you, everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you all for your support and your interest in my writing!
