So far this year I have written four novels, each 55k words or greater, in the Paranormal Romance category. I write mostly shifter romance, and you\u0027re free to check me out on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lily-Lavender/e/B01BAC7KUE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027m hoping to branch out as an author full time, and make enough money to live on my own with my cat, Khoshekh. (He\u0027s also very grateful for your support, and shows it by sleeping on my keyboard when I\u0027m editing.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to turn out a novel every month, in the 55k length. Each of these novels is a full length story, retailing on Amazon. Each one will be featured here, first, before it is distributed on Amazon, as a thank you for Patron support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll join me on my journey for self-sufficiency. I can\u0027t wait to see what the future brings."
