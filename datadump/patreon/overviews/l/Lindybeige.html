    "summary": "The person it is most important to convince that you are nice is yourself. \u00a0Once you\u0027ve fooled yourself into thinking that you are nice, then it is much easier to convince others, and this is one of the tricks of life. \u00a0Why else do people tip waiters that they are never going to see again, and when no one is watching? \u00a0It is especially effective to be nice by habit, rather than by the occasional act of random altruism. \u00a0Patreon therefore lends itself to this useful and practical form of self-delusion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos are taking more and more of my time, but I am not earning more and more from them. \u00a0Indeed, only 22% of the views I get on YouTube earn me anything at all. \u00a0The rest are viewed using Ad Blocker software, or shared on Facebook or other non-paying \u0027platforms\u0027. \u00a0I would like to expand the Lindybeige channel, making more and better videos, using better equipment, and having more to show the camera in terms both of interesting locations and artefacts of note, such as swords.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to produce typically two videos a week. \u00a0In the long-term, I hope to get this up to three or more, but two seems to be the current norm, and when videos are long and complicated, it might be one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get plenty of support through Patreon, I will end up using better equipment, and travelling to more museums and festivals and such-like things on which I can report to my viewers. \u00a0The more I get to see and learn, the more you will get to see and learn. \u00a0Of course, if you don\u0027t like my videos, this will be of no interest to you, and so I will politely doff my hat to you and let you go on your way, but to those of you who enjoy my videos and would wish there to be more of them, you could know that your every little contribution makes that tiny incremental improvement in the channel, and therefore in your video-viewing hours. \u00a0Added to this will be that special inner glow that comes from the knowledge that since you are paying for something when you could be letting others bear the entire burden of payment, then you are stepping up to the task of doing what is right, gripping life itself that bit more firmly, and as a further bonus, adding depth to that sense that you are a fine and worthy person. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron, you will have left the casual rabble of those who stumble upon one of my videos in the darkness of a blurry YouTube browsing session. \u00a0So too will you have marked yourself out from those whose greatest effort in supporting my channel was to click the \u0027subscribe\u0027 button once, and then never apply fingertips to keyboard. \u00a0The next circle up the hierarchy will be those who bother to comment, but whose comments soon get lost amongst the thousands of others. \u00a0Above those are the followers on Facebook and similar \u0027social media\u0027, who get to feel part of a smaller coterie, which gets its own messages and dialogue with me. \u00a0You, though, will stand on the top level of the ziggurat of my viewers, with my other patrons - those excellent fellows who put their money down and proved the conviction of their belief that Lindybeige was something of worth, and something with a potential for at least comparative greatness. \u00a0To these I will owe the most responsibility and responsiveness. \u00a0To the wishes and suggestions of these I will listen the most closely, and to these I will give my most detailed of explanations, advance notices, and, if ever necessary, apologies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking money is not something for which I have a natural talent. \u00a0Fortunately, I have proven able to get by on very little. \u00a0Self-promotion is something at which I am remarkably inept. \u00a0A better promoter or marketer than I would by now have offered something that at least sounded a bit more concrete. \u00a0In truth, I do not yet know what tangible special privileges I could offer my patrons. \u00a0I do know, however, that they themselves, my inner elite, are likely to come up with ideas for things I could offer them that are so marvellous and practical, that I would be a brazen fool for ignoring them, and that therefore in time, my patrons can become a satisfied collection of supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
