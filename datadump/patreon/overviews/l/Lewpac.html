    "summary": "Hey guys, I have set up this Patreon page as a stepping stone on my road to Twitch Partnership. The stream is growing steadily but we are not quite at the partnership stage. As I work towards my goal of full time streaming any subscribers will be helping me in the transition to full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this subscriber page for any stream members who wanted to support our channel on a monthly basis. This helps me bring out more awesome content for the games we love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou DO NOT have to subscribe or donate to be considered a member of our community, just hanging out with us, and spreading the word is more than enough, this is simply for people who wish to go the extra mile in helping a guy with a dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am eternally grateful to everyone who has supported me along the way since I started streaming, whether you watch, chat, follow, donate or just spread the word, every single one of you contribute to the very existence of my stream \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE INFORMATION BELOW IS FROM MY REDDIT POST ABOUT MY LONG TERM CONTENT CREATION GOALS (Warning : Wall of text!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi guys, my name is Lewis, I am 32 years old, working in senior management for a medium sized Contracting company. I am also a DJ, gamer, father of one, and like most here\u2026 a Twitch streamer.\u003cbr\u003eI will pre warn you that this is going to be a massive wall of text\u2026 but I want to talk to you about a dream I\u2019m sure a lot of us share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou read many posts here on \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/twitch\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003er/twitch\u003c/a\u003e about how it is impossible for a new streamer to grow or to \u2018make it\u2019 on twitch. They blame it on the way Twitch works, CamGirl Streamers, or a variety of other factors. Whatever they are blaming I disagree, I think that with hard work, good content and solid networking/promotion anyone has a chance to get to their goals. And with that in mind, I present you my dream\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo one day achieve my goal of becoming a full time twitch streamer/content creator.\u003cbr\u003eWhile some people may view this as some sort of shameless self-promotion (and in a way it is) I also wanted to explain that simply by typing everything you are going to read here, it helped me focus my mind and visualise my goals, as well as the potential obstacles that I will face. To be honest I wasn\u2019t even sure I was going to post this but I have always found writing your thoughts out to be useful.\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a couple of points clear upfront before I get into the nitty gritty \u2013\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will not risk my family\u2019s future financial stability in pursuit of this goal. I have planned out the financials of this and set personal targets, but am fully prepared to pull the plug and go back into work if it doesn\u2019t work out.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have no expectations of success, nor do I feel I am entitled to it. I am fully prepared to not achieve my goal. However, I want to at least know I took a shot at it before I resign myself to another 20+ years working in the rat race.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have the full support of my Family in this project, if the people around you don\u2019t support you, the negativity rubs off in your content on some level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy History\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been interested in gaming since I was a child. The multiplayer side of things has always drawn me in due my naturally competitive nature. I actually played Counter Strike to a reasonable high level in my younger years, winning Lan competitions and such. I love all games from FPS to MMO to Strategy. If it\u2019s good I will play it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy twitch channel started just over 6 months ago. It actually started out as a way to show a couple friends a new indie strategy game that had been released (War for the Overworld). We were chatting away about the game and before I knew it six or so other people had turned up and started joining in the discussions\u2026 from that moment I was hooked on streaming. I focused my effort into improving the quality of the stream, building a community and creating a brand. I have played various games (often new releases) and ended up settling currently with a mix of Counter-Strike and BloodBowl 2.\u003cbr\u003eIn the 7 months my channel has been running, I have gained around 4000 Followers and generally pull in an average of between 40-60 viewers per stream (depending on the game and the day). I usually peak at over 100 during my weekend streams and I think my all-time record was around 500 viewers (With a host from a bigger streamer, but I did hold onto 400+ for a couple of hours).\u003cbr\u003eI would consider myself a small streamer currently but I feel I am at a viewership level where I can grow and gain exposure by putting the hours in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel also has its own Unique Selling Point (USP). As a working club DJ I always have the decks on in my stream, I do rewinds and special effects for various things during a stream, I also do live mixes and DJ tutorials for any viewers who are interested. My mixes are all available online for viewers to listen again and it has proven to be some of my most popular content at times.\u003cbr\u003eI have networked with a lot of bigger streamers and supported a lot of smaller streamers. I am a member of a stream team run by a large partnered streamer.\u003cbr\u003eI feel my growth has been very good especially considering I have not had much time to stream (especially lately). In fact I would go as far as to say the biggest limiter to my growth has been the lack of time actually streaming, hence why I want to give this a go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Current Situation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work full time (50 hours a week) and make decent money in a senior management position for a contracting firm. I also work weekends as a club DJ (I am paid for gigs and have an agent that handles all my bookings). My daughter is 13 weeks old and I love to spend time with her. As you can imagine this doesn\u0027t leave a lot for the stream and it has become a low priority.\u003cbr\u003eFinancially we get by fine and are able to save a good chunk of money after all the bills and expenses are paid. All this is not enough though, as the property market where we are is so over inflated we cannot afford to buy a nice family home to bring our daughter up in. This has lead us to look further afield, In Northern Ireland (where my Fianc\u00e9e is from) we can buy the house of our dreams for less than the price a two bed flat where we are now! Once we had figured out the differences and the finances, the plan to move was go.\u003cbr\u003eAs I will be leaving my job I will be without employment when we arrive, I figured this presents me with an opportunity to take a shot at achieving my dream of becoming a full time streamer. I am lucky that my wonderful wife to be supports me and wants me to give it a go. We plan to move countries at the beginning of March.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancial Breakdown\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no way I could consider this project without fully analysing the financials and how we are going to get by as a family. My Fianc\u00e9e and I have put together \u00a340,000 in savings, after buying the house and all associated costs including moving we are left with \u00a320,000. Half of that will cover my first year expenses while I work on building up the stream. The other half will be our emergency savings fund (good financial planning denotes you always keep 6months home expenses in reserve).\u003cbr\u003eIt is worth noting streaming will not be my only income. We own our own houses from before we met, both houses are rented out and generate a monthly income. I have some other investments which generate a small amount of monthly dividends. I also plan to take DJ gigs here and there and have already established some contacts in the area we are moving to.\u003cbr\u003eOur monthly outgoings will also be considerably less once we move due to the much cheaper location. I am well qualified in specialist areas of my industry so if I decide to pull the plug on this project then I am confident that I can find employment fairly quickly.\u003cbr\u003eI hope that if I can achieve partnership before the move I will have a small income from the stream before going full time. I currently get some donations through the stream but its unpredictable so can\u2019t be factored in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving the Dream\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I go full time I will be producing 40 hours of streaming content per week at a minimum (I won\u2019t overdo it as I know first-hand that it can cause a quality drop). I will also have dedicated time to social media and producing/editing youtube content. I intend to treat this as I would my full time job, set myself targets and stick to my working hours. I will have a purpose built streaming/music studio in my new house and will have minimal disturbances during streaming hours. I know It will be tough, and it will require a combination of hard work, good content, smart stream management and a pinch of luck for me to succeed. But wouldn\u2019t it be great to know one guy with a dream can still get somewhere on Twitch despite all the obstacles that we believe are in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePre-Move Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo continue to grow my viewer and follower base on twitch\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo expand my social media circles (Twitter, Youtube, Reddit) to help with promotion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo continue networking within Reddit and the streaming community (with a focus on the communities of the games I play)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo achieve Twitch Partnership status\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo save an additional \u00a34000 towards Living expenses\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLong Term Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo build the stream and the community as far as I can by streaming full time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo expand the brand properly into YouTube videos (I have several series ideas but no time currently)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo gain additional exposure as a DJ/Interviewer/Panellist at E-sports and gaming events\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo be able to spend more time with my daughter as she is growing up (8 Hours streaming per day instead of 11 hours of work then Streaming on top).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo achieve a sustainable income to supplement my other revenue streams (Rental Properties and Investments) and keep the bills paid each month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI won\u2019t link you to my various social media to check out as I know it\u2019s against the rules, however you can find it all easily enough by googling Lewpac or Lewpac22\u003cbr\u003eMaybe you think I\u2019m crazy, maybe you share this dream, or perhaps you think it can\u2019t be done. Either way I have laid it all down here and I am going to be giving it a go.
