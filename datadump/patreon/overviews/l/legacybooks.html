If you support the stories here on Patreon, Patreon will only take about 30% of every sale (including credit card fees). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s twice as much of your money going towards the books instead of to Amazon. And the more people who read these stories, the greater a percentage of their support will go directly to the author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example: If we sell 10,000 copies of these stories, here\u0027s how those sales break down on Amazon versus Patreon. \u003cstrong\u003eThe GREEN section is profits\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014we want that section \u003cem\u003eas large as possible\u003c/em\u003e in order to pay our authors as well as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://underrealm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10000-Sales.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, either of these scenarios is great for our authors\u2014but here on Patreon, their royalties will be more than twice as high as they would be on Amazon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eSUPPORT OUR AUTHORS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re building a world as varied and intricate as the real one, peopled by characters you\u0027ve never seen in this genre before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us NOW.
