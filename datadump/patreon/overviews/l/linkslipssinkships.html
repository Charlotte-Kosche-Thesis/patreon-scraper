But guess what? She was wrong. I let her dull my shine for 10 years when I could have been honing and improving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m in a place where I have the opportunity to take a hiatus from work and try to achieve my goal of getting published. I\u0027m currently in the process of re-writing my work Suit and Jacket into a piece of original fiction that I can hopefully shop to agents and publishers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m working on new fiction for you to enjoy\u003c/strong\u003e, including my works Boys and Washed Up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for considering supporting me on this journey. The fact that you\u0027re even here means that you enjoy my stories enough to want to see them continue, and that isn\u0027t lost on me. A decade ago, I never would have considered letting anyone read a word of fiction from me, and now you all remind me on a daily basis that you\u0027re interested in it. Thank you. Truly, thank you."
