    "summary": "In the end, I want to leave a body of work that lifts humanity up, that teaches us to be empathetic, that leads others into conversations that are difficult and uneasy and makes us better people. But that\u0027s the end--that\u0027s what I\u0027m aiming to develop here. I pledge to write--and write all the time--young adult literature, mainly--but also small flash fictions full of humanity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few novels and one short story project dear to my heart that keep whispering to me even as I finish \u003cem\u003eThrowaways\u003c/em\u003e, the project I\u0027ve worked on and rewritten for the past six years. As I say goodbye to that project and say hello to \u003cem\u003eFall on Me\u003c/em\u003e, a project about a 17-year-old high school reporter who suddenly loses her grandmother, I will continue to fuel my work with strong lady characters who listen to their hearts first and those around them last (which, of course, gets them into their own heap of trouble at times). My flash fiction series, \"These are the Days of the Week I Know,\" aims to have 365 full entries by completion, and currently I\u0027ve only really touched the surface of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where we are right now, dear reader. And if you help support me on this journey, my zany worlds and creatures will have space to blossom and glow, and I\u0027ll be able to share them with you as often as I am able to write. First, weirdo drafts? You got it. Notes about the writing process? Check. Polished pieces published here before anyone else gets a chance to read them? Absolutely. You are my hero, and I\u0027ll share my inner world with you thanks to your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, if you need to see something of what it is I do, here are a few of my pieces currently on the interwebs. None of these pieces are YA, but they all say something about what I might find interesting enough to write about:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.menacinghedge.com/fall2015/entry-dixon.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u201cIf You Can\u2019t Take the Heat, Don\u2019t Hire a Yeti\u003c/a\u003e,\u201d Menacing Hedge\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u201c\u003ca href=\"http://experimentallit.com/shut-up-and-show-me-the-pumpkin-spice-lauren-dixon/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShut up and Show Me the Pumpkin Spice\u003c/a\u003e,\u201d theEEEL\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.3lobedmag.com/issue25/3lbe25_story4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSheela of the Good Shepherd\u003c/a\u003e,\u201d Three-Lobed Burning Eye\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Writing, if it is to be any good, should be the writer\u0027s full-time job. But in so many cases, it is not. My life is fraught with one expense after the other, my time is taken up by working to pay the bills with little left to sink into my creative projects. Just this month alone I spent $1000 on medical bills, procedures, and medications for my cat, not to mention the other $1000 we spent to attend our friend\u0027s memorial service in Dallas. I have not the time nor the money to write wholeheartedly, without concern for all the myriad details of what it takes to survive, day-in, day-out. If I can reach this goal, I will essentially make a living wage from my writing, and it will all be thanks to you and your support.",
