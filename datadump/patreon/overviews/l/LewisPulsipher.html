    "summary": "You will be helping me to continue to offer my unique perspective on game design and design theory to aspiring (and experienced) game designers who are unable or unwilling to buy a class or book.  I\u2019ve done that in my blogs (including my \"Expert Blog\" on Gamasutra), and via my YouTube channel \"Game Design\". \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMore than two years ago I began to post free videos to my \u201cGame Design\u201d channel on YouTube (\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/LewGameDesign\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/LewGameDesign\u003c/a\u003e ).  I\u0027ve posted about 150, currently one per week.  But this has become a burden, taking away from my time designing games - a big reason why it\u2019s taking so long to complete the third editions of Britannia.  I\u0027ve had to consider slowing down my posts, or ending them altogether. With a modicum of support from Patreon patrons I can justify the time I spend on these videos and articles, and continue to produce them regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExamples of what you\u0027ll support: \u003cbr\u003e10 \u201cNeed to Knows\u201d about Game Design: \u003ca href=\"http://youtu.be/rxBUr9KdsIg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://youtu.be/rxBUr9KdsIg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsequences in Games: \u003ca href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LewisPulsipher/20160429/271615/Consequences_in_Games.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LewisPulsipher/201...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAre you designing a game, or throwing one together?: \u003cbr\u003ePart 1   \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/USZQipf4GLM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/USZQipf4GLM\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePart 2   \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/UOUItO3uCSk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/UOUItO3uCSk\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhy aren\u0027t computer RPGs (especially MMOs) as much FUN to play as old-time D\u0026amp;D?:  \u003ca href=\"http://pulsiphergamedesign.blogspot.com/2016/04/why-arent-computer-rpgs-especially-mmos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://pulsiphergamedesign.blogspot.com/2016/04/w...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing articles and designing games in the 70s, but left the industry for 20 years in the early 80s (though I still played D\u0026amp;D). I have designed half a dozen commercially published boardgames, have written a book about game design, run online audiovisual courses about game design, blog, and maintain a YouTube \"Game Design\" channel with a free video each week. My game Britannia is described in an Armchair General review \"as one of the great titles in the world of games.\"  Britannia was also one of the 100 games highlighted in the book \"Hobby Games: the 100 Best\".  I have over 17,000 classroom hours of teaching experience (now retired) including teaching video game design and production, and over 20 years of part-time graduate teaching experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have combined my game design and teaching experience in my \u201cGame Design\u201d channel videos, my blog articles, and my online audiovisual game design courses on Udemy.com and Skillshare.com. The latter are not free, but I continue to offer free videos through my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy book \"Game Design: How to Create Video and Tabletop Games, Start to Finish\" (McFarland, 2012) focuses on practical advice for beginning game designers, about how you actually create and complete game designs. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy latest published game is the broad-market Viking adventure game Sea Kings. Three new versions of Britannia, including a 90-120 minute version and a diceless version,  are forthcoming (sooner or later!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI speak frequently at GenCon, the East Coast Game Conference, PrezCon, and World Boardgaming Championships.  I was an \"Industry Insider Guest of Honor\" at GenCon \u002713.\u003cbr\u003eLong ago I was contributing editor for \"White Dwarf\" and \"Dragon\" magazines, and publisher of various game fanzines. I also contributed to the books \"Tabletop: Analog Game Design,\" \"Hobby Games: the 100 Best,\" and \"Family Games: the 100 Best.\"  \u003cbr\u003eMy motto: \"Always do right - this will gratify some and astonish the rest.\"  - Mark Twain\u003cbr\u003eMy game design motto:  \"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery\u003cbr\u003eMore information in: \u003cbr\u003e\u2022Wikipedia entries: \"Lewis Pulsipher\"; \"Britannia (board game)\"; \"Archomental\"\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Website: \u003ca href=\"http://pulsiphergames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://pulsiphergames.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u2022\"Expert blogger\", Gamasutra: \u003ca href=\"http://gamasutra.com/blogs/LewisPulsipher/774/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://gamasutra.com/blogs/LewisPulsipher/774/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Game design blog: \u003ca href=\"http://pulsiphergamedesign.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://pulsiphergamedesign.blogspot.com/\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/blog/435/pulsipher-game-design\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://pulsiphergamedesign.blogspot.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Teach game design blog: \u003ca href=\"http://teachgamedesign.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://teachgamedesign.blogspot.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022@lewpuls (twitter)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022google.com/+LewisPulsipher\u003cbr\u003e\u2022My Udemy profile and all my classes: \u003ca href=\"https://www.udemy.com/user/drlewispulsipher/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.udemy.com/user/drlewispulsipher/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u2022www.linkedin.com/in/lewispulsipher/ (\u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/lewispulsipher/)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.linkedin.com/in/lewispulsipher/)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022former contributing editor, White Dwarf, Dragon, Space Gamer, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022former publisher, Supernova, Blood and Iron, Sweep of History, etc.\u003cbr\u003eRecent Interviews with Lew:\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Designer Spotlight (with Jason Levine, video)): \u003ca href=\"http://www.dicetower.com/game-video/jason-levines-designer-spotlight-lewis-pulsipher\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.dicetower.com/game-video/jason-levines...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Boardgame University #27 (with Tom Vasel, audio): \u003ca href=\"http://boardgameuniversity.libsyn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://boardgameuniversity.libsyn.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022RPG Review (with Lev Lafayette, text): \u003ca href=\"http://rpgreview.net/node/176\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://rpgreview.net/node/176\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a Ph.D. in military and diplomatic history from Duke University, from ancient days when degrees in media, computer networking, or game design did not exist - nor did IBM PCs. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI have been called many things over several decades (not all of them good!), here are some examples.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIn \"The Space Gamer\" #35, I was referred to as \"that notorious raconteur of FRP gaming\" by Steve Jackson (of Steve Jackson Games). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"One thing I will say to everyone reading this thread - you can count on the fingers of one hand the books that will adequately explain something as nebulous and esoteric as game design and theory.
