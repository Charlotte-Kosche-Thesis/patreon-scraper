But enough of the mushy stuff - let\u0027s talk about podcasts and books!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an author of weird fiction for teens and adults. I\u0027ve written a novel, a book of short stories, several novellas, and a stage play. I produce the podcasts \"Bad Notes\" and \"The Be Mega Podcast.\" I\u0027m known to draw monsters, heroes, and outlandish super villains. Between writing projects, I create loud heavy metal music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout This Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will give you access to my ongoing fiction podcast, \"Bad Notes,\" as it is produced. You\u0027ll get real time access to the story as it\u0027s created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story is my love letter to heavy metal and hard rock, as well as a way to document some of my own family\u0027s more unusual experiences. As a metaphorical child of the 1990\u0027s and literally the child of a man who toured the Midwest playing classic rock for thirty years, I have gazed awkwardly at the back end of rock and roll for most of my life. \"Bad Notes\" is an opportunity to merge my love of the paranormal with my passion for loud, unruly rock music in a tale that is weird, funny, terrifying, and poignant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat happens when the slacker daughter of a regionally famous rock musician discovers that her father actually spent his weekends fighting vampires, ghouls, and demons? She gets wasted, of course. And then she takes action to learn the true nature of her father\u0027s profession, her family\u0027s dark secrets, and the magical power of a mix tape that could destroy humanity. The first fifteen episodes (Season 1) are available on iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, Soundcloud, and wherever else you like to grab podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon will allow me to continue working on this project; but that\u0027s only the beginning. A handful of additional podcasts are eager to escape my brain and see the light of day. Plus, my goal is to eventually expand the \"Bad Notes\" universe into other projects like books and graphic novels. The problem is that it isn\u0027t necessarily free to publish podcasts and books, so your pledges will help offset the inevitable expense of helping these creations get in front of new readers and fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
