    "summary": "What\u0027s up!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m Brandon Shaw, and I\u0027m a professional musician (**Hi Brandon**). In 2014 I started a blog called Startup Musician, focusing on helping musicians build careers. Later that year I launched the Startup Musician Podcast where I\u0027ve interviewed musicians such as Jack Stratton (Vulfpeck), Steve Watkins (Allen Stone), Peter Dyer (Mariah Carey, Aloe Blacc), John Whitt Jr. (Kendrick Lamar), Dan Bailey (Father John Misty), and Xander Singh (Passion Pit). I\u0027ve also released videos that range from product reviews to NAMM show recaps to dance lessons (still working on dancing \u003cem\u003ewhile\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0playing).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the best of Startup Musician is The Load In; a \u00a0digital magazine for musicians. It\u0027s the thing that ties it all together, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT \u003cem\u003eTHE LOAD IN\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0IS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe Load In is a free bi-monthly digital magazine for musicians. It\u0027s the best publication out there for musicians trying to make a living. I have a strict no douchebaggery policy (Tevin). Also, no fluff. Just directly helpful stuff for you and your career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S IN IT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery issue contains 2 big things:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u00a0The Latest Stuff From Startup Musician\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis could be a new article, a new podcast interview with a professional musician, a new product review, or a product giveaway. As a Load In subscriber, you get first access to it \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e it hits the blog. Every issue is different, and I know you\u0027ll get a lot of value out of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. The Best Stuff From The Internet\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLook, the internet is a crazy place. There\u0027s a billion articles, videos, podcasts, and bits of news floating around. And most of it is complete crap. I sort through all of that and give you \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0the best stuff. The stuff that\u0027s going to help you, push you, or inspire you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/h2\u003eI LOVE creating The Load In. I LOVE getting to share new interviews, articles, and news with you. And I want to continue to make it EVEN BETTER.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for The Load In to succeed and grow and get even better, it has to be self-sustaining. Creating a regular publication that\u0027s \u003cem\u003ereally great\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0takes time and money. The Load In and Startup Musician are essentially a part time job, on top of my other job (being a professional musician). \u00a0I want to devote \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e time and money to make The Load In even better, bring you more interviews, more articles, and more videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, I could slap some ads in the email, or on the podcast, or on the website. But I\u0027d rather keep it ad-free. I want to make the Load In and Startup Musician in general an encouraging place where you can hear from other musicians, learn, and grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a reader can donate whatever they want per issue and the donation is recurring each issue after that. So anything, from $1/issue up, is \u003cem\u003ehugely\u003c/em\u003e helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWHERE THE MONEY GOES\u003c/h2\u003eMy initial goal is $250 per issue. This will help keep The Load In going. Here\u0027s the costs associated with creating all of this stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb Hosting. \u003c/strong\u003eAll articles, videos, and interviews live at \u003ca href=\"http://www.startupmusician.co\"\u003ewww.startupmusician.co\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMailchimp. \u003c/strong\u003eThis is the service I use to send the email every week (and what makes it look so snazzy). The more subscribers there are, the more it costs.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcast Hosting. \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s right, it\u0027s a separate thing (I know!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResources. \u003c/strong\u003eShooting videos, interviewing podcast guests, writing articles, creating graphics, editing videos, editing podcasts, and building each issue takes a lot of time and resources. And it\u0027s just me doing it! I don\u0027t have a team, it\u0027s all on me.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShort Version: Patreon will take The Load In you love and make it even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTake a look at the reward options, and decide what\u0027s the best fit for you. I\u0027ve set two milestone goals to show you specific things that the money will go toward and how your support helps grow The Load In.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance!
