Honestly, every little bit does help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, the two biggest motivators in creating this podcast are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eEducating people about how these groups can operate; and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAllowing the stories of ex-members to be heard.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eBoth of these mean that you, the listeners, are what make it all worthwhile. You comprise the audience for these stories, and you help spread the word so that more people can be aware of any red flags. And in supporting independent research and audio production, you can feel good about yourself, but you can also get some nice perks. Win/win, eh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for listening and for your support, in whatever form it takes!\u003cbr\u003e"
