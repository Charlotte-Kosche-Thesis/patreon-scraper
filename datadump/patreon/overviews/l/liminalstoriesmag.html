    "summary": "Here at Liminal Stories, we\u0027re dedicated to publishing fiction that\u0027s just a little bit out of the ordinary.  Starting in May, we\u0027ll be bringing you tales of pizza dimensions, alien takeovers, fox magicians and winged radio operators.  But that\u0027s only a small fraction of what\u0027s out there -- we want to find more of these stories, the ones that are smart and strange and cut to the bone, and share them with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLiminal isn\u0027t going anywhere.  We started this magazine as a labor of love, and we\u0027re committed to searching out stories and paying our authors professional rates for years to come.  But your support will allow us to continue to thrive and grow, perhaps buying an extra story for an issue or compensating our amazing volunteer artists for their talent and time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen we launched Liminal late last year, the outpouring of support and excitement was greater than anything we ever expected.  The coming months will bring another open submission period, more fabulous fiction (and poetry, starting with Issue 2!), and more adorable antlered owls.  We hope you\u0027ll join us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBest,\u003cdiv\u003eShannon Peavey and Kelly Sandoval\u003cdiv\u003eSenior Editors\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
