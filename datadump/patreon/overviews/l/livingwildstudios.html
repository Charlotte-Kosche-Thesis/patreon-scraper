I believe in order for this to happen, I need to find my way back to slow writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSlow writing is a meditative practice, creating\u00a0time and space for understanding my relationship to my writing, for establishing my authentic subjects, for producing complex works as well as for studying my literary forebearers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write words that will make a difference. I have a writing project in mind which explores a black woman\u2019s life and death. It is a cry for social justice. It is a cry for freedom and love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write in solitude. But I also love to connect with other people. I don\u2019t want to complete this project in isolation. I want to have your eyes as witness as well as your voices cheering.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201dCreating fine work can only be achieved by a slow, consistent dedication to our craft,\u201d DeSalvo has written. \u00a0I heed this reminder and warning. \u00a0We live in a society where speed is valued over taking our time. Productivity, the end product, is deemed more valuable than the process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur expectations as writers is that we should work quickly. We measure our worth by the number of pages we complete rather than by the excellence of the work. I was caught up in this spiral before where I made mistakes trying to feed the attention/ who machine. The pressure to keep producing the next best thing in shorter and shorter time periods. It is dangerous.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn Steinbeck was told to work faster by his editor; to produce more than his\u00a0two pages a day. Steinbeck\u2019s response was, \u00a0\u201cl [now] find I am hurrying to get through my day\u2019s work .... It is a destructive suggestion ... A book, as you know, is a very delicate thing. If it is pressured, it will show that pressure. So - no more increase.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say, no more, too. I want to slow things right down. Slow down the writing process and really dig into the practice and craft of writing. I want to serve my apprenticeship, learn and hone my writing, readying myself for the deeper work that will come through with my own unique voice attached. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes many drafts to create a work of art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you want to\u00a0support me in this revolutionary practice?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI view Patreon as acting like the patrons of old. A patron was a person who gave financial and other support to an artist or writer as she learnt and developed her craft and/or fell on hards times. A patron alleviated financial worries, leaving the creator the time and space to create at their own pace. To create the masterpieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is making it easy for you to become my patron of today, and hopefully tomorrow. Through a system of monthly patronage, you can help to financially support me as I work towards the completion of this poetic collection, at the same time as reflecting on the process. \u003cbr\u003eYour patronage is providing the much needed mentorship I need from an established poet \u00a0who is supporting me through the writing stages of my poetry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are various reward packages that correspond to different levels of patron membership. I hope you can find a one that best suits you. All contributions are appreciated. I am truly grateful for the support you are able to provide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/shereeangelamatthews\"\u003eMake A One-Time Contribution (PayPal)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I realise that through this practice I am living wholeheartedly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter over 15 years of being a freelance writer and artist, only now, in the last couple years, do I feel I have allowed myself to show up in my life and my work as myself. For too often within society, we pretend to be someone we are not. We play the game, swallow our voices and attempt to fit in . In the process we lose parts of ourselves, the parts that make us unique and allow us to shine as we truly are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a traumatic experience where I hit rock bottom, I had no choice but to rise from my crumpled and raw heap as myself. This was all I had left, and the only person I could rely on. Trust even.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in myself and who I am and what I create. I believe everyone should be able to live their lives as their authentic self. This is why I make myself available, in service and as guide in supporting women in their rise; finding their voices to live their whole-hearted selves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is this space, I intend to share my current writings as I attempt to use my voice to bring about change. As a Black British women, I live my life within the intersections of race, gender, class, region. \u00a0As I write, I hope to connect with you and shift your lens to a new way of seeing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
