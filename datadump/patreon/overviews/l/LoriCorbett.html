Traveling is such a hassle, now, and no amount of wine and chocolate can make up for it. But I still love to teach. Seeing the lightbulb go on for a fellow artist is the ultimate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written a 256 page how-to book on sculpting birds from wood, called \"Carving Award-Winning Songbirds\", published by Fox Chapel Publishing (now in its third printing), contributed (27) painted illustrations to a four book series of reference for artists on birds of prey, by Denny Rogers, also published by Fox Chapel Publishing, and have contributed numerous articles on painting, and techniques to magazines.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m here, because circumstances have made it necessary that I work from home. Teaching and sharing my art is the logical choice! I\u0027ll reciprocate your support by making a new\u00a0 pastel or \ngraphite drawing instructional videos for you (including the line \nart and sometimes the reference photo, if possible), so you can follow along. This is my way of paying it forward for your patronage - giving back to you and others by sharing my knowledge.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s\u00a0going to be a blast doing this. I love to teach, and make folks laugh. So, pull up your chair, grab your favorite beverage, and your art supplies, and get ready. Expect a visit from my companion, Absurdity, now and again, as well. She tends to be a bit of a stalker, so if you hear a crashing sound in any videos, it\u0027s her fault. She made me fall off my chair.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My main\n artform is bird sculpture, but any animal  that strikes my fancy will \nget it\u0027s portrait drawn. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s some photos of a bird sculpture I\n carved and painted, just to show you some of what I do. It\u0027s an American \nAvocet, carved out of tupelo wood, and it is a completely smooth \nsurface. The textured appearance was done with acrylic and alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be creating video tutorials for birdcarvers as well as pastel, graphite and colored pencil artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colortheory.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FB_IMG_1470546352754.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colortheory.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FB_IMG_1470546374588.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colortheory.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FB_IMG_1470546364647.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colortheory.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FB_IMG_1470546389382.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colortheory.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FB_IMG_1470546396313.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here is some of my pastel stuff I\u0027m doing - a series called \"PatterEyes\" that I\u0027ll be offering here, to you, my future Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colortheory.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FB_IMG_1470546073337.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colortheory.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FB_IMG_1458000426675.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(C\u0027mon!

A how-to \nbook about birdcarving called \"Carving Award-Winning Songbirds\", \npublished by Fox Chapel Publishing, was planned to be a 96 page book, \nbut morphed into a 256 page behemoth. In addition, Fox Chapel Publishing\n contracted me to do 27 illustrations for a four book reference series \nfor artists on birds of prey, by the artist Denny Rogers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince\n these sculptures are one of a kind and handmade, they take a very long time to \nmake; so I branched out into flat art in order to provide folks access \nto my art a lower price point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what I\u0027m concentrating on now, so that I\u0027ll be able to provide you with fantastic rewards for helping me do this for other, newer artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and please consider supporting me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(((HUGS)))\u003cbr\u003e",
