I love languages very much and I have begun to share my language knowledge with many people around the world. have been a classroom and online professional language instructor for more than ten years. Now I am taking an advanced course specializing in Psychology in University of Social Sciences and Humanities which belongs to Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City, one of the best national universities in Viet Nam. I wish I could improve my teaching skills and I could be a language partner of all people in the world. Besides that, I wish to share my knowledge about Vietnamese culture, one of the most striking representatives of the Asian culture. Up to now I have helped hundreds of people to learn Vietnamese as well as the culture of Vietnamese people. They can be tourists, students, scientists, businessmen and women... and most of them have had a wonderful holidays in Vietnam. Let\u0027s Discover Viet Nam, you will find many things new and interesting for your life...\u003cbr\u003eFor me, the time with my students is not only a lesson, but also a time for enjoy, when we can enjoy a new experience about new things and also improve our thinking, our intelligence and our passion. \u003cbr\u003eNow please choose one of your suitable time and tell me anything you want about your language expectations of Vietnamese, so we can arrange for our first meeting and discuss about our studying, our language sharing. For the learning material, I will send to you all the necessary materials for learning Vietnamese as soon as I have your contact and they are all free of charge. \u003cbr\u003eBest wishes,\u003cbr\u003eNguyen The Vu\u003cbr\u003e",
