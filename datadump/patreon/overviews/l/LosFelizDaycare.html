The support from the Twitter community over the years has been overwhelming, and has led to development opportunities in the TV space (which I hope to have a good update about soon), but to continue to grow and establish this crunchy world across different platforms, I need to dedicate much more of my time. \u00a0And to do that, I\u0027m asking for your support. My plan is to expand the LFDC Twitter account into a weekly podcast with new written and audio content to accompany it. I\u0027m excited to create as much LFDC content as the community can take. Thank you very much for even considering supporting this, and I would love to hear your feedback as we get started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExpect the first episode to drop in March and bonus written material very soon.
