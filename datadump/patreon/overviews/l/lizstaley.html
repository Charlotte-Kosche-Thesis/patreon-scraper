    "summary": "My name is Liz, and some of you may know me from \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/mastering-manga-studio-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMastering Manga Studio 5\u003c/a\u003e\" and \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/manga-studio-ex-5-cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Manga Studio EX 5 Cookbook\u003c/a\u003e\". I wrote both of these books for Manga Studio 5 through Packt Publishing, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love Manga Studio 5. I love to talk to other artists about it, I run panels about it at conventions, and I get asked for help with the program constantly on social media. Very often someone will be asking about an issue on Twitter and I\u0027ll get tagged to come help- and I do help when I can! I also maintain a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjUhQuSZ1M--3c3vzWlR59YQMRP_fXDMh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e where I put up recorded tutorials, and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/adrastuscomic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGumroad\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eshop where I sell pay-what-you-want resources like custom speech balloons, page templates, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what am I doing with this Patreon campaign?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI absolutely love sharing Manga Studio 5 and its incredible features with the world. I love to create tutorials and answer questions about the software. It makes me happy, especially when I can solve a problem and make another artist\u0027s life easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut all the tutorial-making and question answering take time. Time away from my other projects and time away from my family. Recording a ten minute tutorial can take several hours, from researching the technique and going through it so that I know the steps and can make sure everything works, to actually recording (which may take several takes), then editing, uploading, and promoting. A lot of work goes in to even making a simple tutorial!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I get a question on social media, I try to answer it right away. Sometimes I know the answer, but sometimes I don\u0027t. I have to research a fix or a technique, test it, then sometimes take screenshots to show what I\u0027m talking about for the answer. This can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour or more! I love receiving these questions though, because I love to explore Manga Studio 5 and I love to talk about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all comes down to time though. When I\u0027m working on other projects (commissions, freelance work, etc), it\u0027s hard to make the space in life to produce free content and free videos. I just don\u0027t have enough time to try to make money elsewhere and produce regular, free content for YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook! I would like to be able to start off making a tutorial video every other week, and eventually move up to creating 3 or 4 times a month or MORE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can help me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is all about enabling creators to make more content by giving them a steady, reliable stream of income for that content. It\u0027s only with your help that I\u0027ll be able to help fellow creatives by giving them more tutorials! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy establishing a steady income that doesn\u0027t involve junking up my current YouTube videos with ads, everyone wins. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eManga Studio 5 artists get the benefits of video tutorials detailing how to use this incredible software.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatrons get cool rewards, like access to MS5 resources, early access to videos, and Google+ Hangouts where they can ask questions and get personalized help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI get to share more of my love for this software with the world, because of being able to take on less freelance and commission work. Less other paying work = more time to spend helping others and finding cool new MS5 features and tips to show!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron Today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s easy!
