It\u0027s my mission to help people heal their mind, body, and soul while expressing themselves with the pieces I create uniquely for them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy artisan healing jewelry is completely one of a kind. Each piece is made using energy from nature. I feel the natural vibrations of each component and that tells me what they want to be, based on several factors. When it\u0027s a custom piece, what that person wants and needs is also factored in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the materials I use include natural crystals and gemstones, charged under the full moon, glass and stone beads, nickel-free findings, recycled vintage jewelry parts, and many other materials. I like to use items from nature, as well as used items that can be repurposed to help create less waste and more enjoyment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT ME\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.writewavemedia.com/uploads/1/3/4/2/1342874/22886095-10155951331492241-5658874463360603796-n_8_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMyself and my husband are life \u0026amp; business partners.
