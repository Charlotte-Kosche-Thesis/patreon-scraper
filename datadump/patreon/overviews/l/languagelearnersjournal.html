But then she started to make real progress with her learning, especially in French and science. Initially the teachers accused her of cheating and made her redo her work under close supervision \u2013 however, it soon became apparent that a switch had finally been activated and the progress she was making was real. Trisha went on study psychology to postgraduate level at university and then studied a diploma in history at the University of Oxford!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat was Trisha doing differently?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe was applying a more\u003cstrong\u003e holistic approach\u003c/strong\u003e to learning that included simple \u003cstrong\u003emindfulness techniques, positive thinking strategies, improved productivity\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003etime management skills\u003c/strong\u003e.

Drawing from my personal experiences as a fellow language learner and my professional knowledge of mindsets and how the brain works I want to help \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e achieve your language goals. This is why I have created \u0027Language Learners Journal\u0027 and launched the \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2018The Language Learners Amplified Program. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith Brexit, Language learning in the UK is now more important than ever, yet one of the first things to be cut in schools and adult education programs is funding,\u201d \u003c/em\u003e T\u003cem\u003ehe Language Learners Amplified Program (#LLAP) is a global program, based in the UK.
