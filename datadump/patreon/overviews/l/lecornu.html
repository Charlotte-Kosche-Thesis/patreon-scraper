    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMight as well start at the beginning...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing for as long as I can remember. As a kid I had stacks and stacks of college ruled spiral notebooks filled with all kinds of drawings. These notebooks included original work, fan art, comics, and even some hand lettering. Looking back now I don\u0027t think I was very good, but I stuck with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAfter years of practice, my doodle days were behind me and I was starting to try new mediums. By the time I hit high school I had real sketchbooks, I was painting with acrylics, and I was starting my journey in formline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know, formline is a term often used to describe the type of art specific to the Northwest Coastal tribes. I am part of the Tsimshian, Tlingit, Haida, and Nez Perce tribes as well as the First Nation Nisga\u0027a (It\u0027s a mouthful, believe me, I know).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I was saying, in high school I started working in formline. I read books about the art form and practiced the essential parts. Eventually I understood how to use the different forms and shapes to create different animals. I worked with formline as a way to stay close to my cultural identity and as a way to do my part in preserving the art of my tribes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was the same time that I discovered the world of theatre and technical design. So there I was, a 16 or 17 year old kid with a love for both visual and performing arts. That is when I knew,\u003cem\u003e truly knew, \u003c/em\u003ewhat I wanted to do with my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo let\u0027s fast forward a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI started college and decided to major in Theatre with a focus on lighting design. I kept up with my formline and visual arts but not as much as I would have liked to. I tried to fit my art in between classes, my day job, and various theatrical productions but there just aren\u0027t enough hours in the day. So my progress was put on hold while I finished school. And it stayed on hold due to work. I\u0027ve spent the last few years working 2-3 jobs at a time while still trying to find time to draw. Luckily my day job was pretty chill so I was able to draw there, but it still wasn\u0027t enough. I knew that in order to be better I had to pour all my focus into what I love doing and at the end of the day, that\u0027s art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNovember 2016 was when I finally worked up the nerve to quit my day job. I was done trying to fit my art around a job I didn\u0027t care about. So what do I do now? I\u0027m a Lead Technician at Mount Baker Theater, I design for various productions around town, and I spend most of my days drawing and painting. I decided to be a full time artist and work towards supporting myself solely through art. So far it\u0027s working out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m still trying to figure out how to be a self sufficient artist. I\u0027m still learning the ropes when it comes to print making, online shops, and reaching a broader audience. Patreon is obviously a great platform to help raise money. Art is expensive, and with your support I\u0027ll be able to spend more time focusing on my work, purchase tools to create higher quality pieces, and who knows, maybe I\u0027ll even be able to start working digitally.\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s not even the part I\u0027m excited about. I\u0027ve wanted to start a Patreon for a long time because it\u0027s a platform that allows me to give back to my supporters. Not only can I provide more content, but I can also give fun tips, lots of free prints AND original works, show you what tools I\u0027m using, and make progress/how to videos. You can see my work as it comes to life through different steps and be more involved with what I produce. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour support and contributions truly mean the world to me. Wether it\u0027s on Patreon, through my social media feeds, or in person, I hope to have you with me on this journey. I appreciate you all so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh, the tier names?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eGlad you asked. Each word is part of the Tsimshian language, or Shm\u0027\u003cem\u003eal\u003c/em\u003egyack. These are the Tsimshian words for one through six (and the word for \u0027surprise\u0027). I thought it would be a fun way for me to learn a little bit more about one of my tribal languages and share that information with all of you."
