    "summary": "So this is us finally! \u00a0We\u0027ve decided to start up a new channel and upload things we think you will enjoy. \u00a0We\u0027re hoping many of you decide to back us with this patreon, no matter how small, to help us continue to move forward. \u00a0As you know its extremely time consuming to edit and produce videos. \u00a0Sometimes it takes hours or days and that sort of free time is hard to come by now and then. \u00a0Especially if you have a job and a family to support. It\u0027s also fairly soul shattering to put in so much effort and time into videos and not really get much back. \u00a0It pretty much turns into either a second job or a full time job depending on how many hours we put into it.\u00a0 So we\u0027re looking at patreon for that extra kick. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve put up some tiers on the side with figures attached.\u00a0 There are other things we\u0027d like to include but at the moment we\u0027re unsure how to go about some stuff or what exactly we could add. \u00a0Hopefully with your feedback we can add to what we have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would we be doing with the donations? \u00a0Well firstly it would go to buying games, multiple copies for us to play co-op in and upload the videos recorded from them. \u00a0Most of the time we cant afford the new release games and end up waiting till theres a sale 6+ months later. \u00a0By then you might not be too interested in watching that game since you will have seen others play to the point that the game bores you now. \u00a0So thats our main hope. \u00a0Secondly upgrading our ancient computers which havent had a face lift in 4-5 years. \u00a0This will help improve the quality of the videos too. \u00a0After that if we happen to make enough it will go straight to a combination of bills and possible renting of servers to play certain games with our fans. \u00a0We think this would be great fun and even make the videos better. \u00a0If we freakishly make more then we ever hoped to make, thats when those of us who work will shift to either part time or leave the job completely to focus fully on making videos and playing every day, interacting with fans etc. \u00a0That would be the dream right there. \u00a0Whatever we make will be put into a group pot but ultimately split 3 ways. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really hope you decide to help us out. \u00a0The more support we get from here, the more we\u0027ll see about improving the patreon incentives and adding in special things. \u00a0For the time being thanks for any support!"
