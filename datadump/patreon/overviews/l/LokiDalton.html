    "summary": "Hallo all! My name is Loki Dalton, and I am an Abstract digital artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been an artist for as long as I can remember, but back in 2014, I began experimenting with many different forms of art. It was then that I discovered my love for Abstract digital art, and have done all I can to continue and improve my work. The main reason I was drawn to this form is because of its unique way of speaking to different people in many different ways. They are struck emotionally in some way because of the colours, the shapes, and/or the motion within the piece. What piece someone is drawn to is completely unpredictable, thus making my work fresh and exciting. My main goal, however, is to help others in some way, especially in an emotional sense. I am told by many that my work sparks a sort of positive emotion within them even during their toughest times, which makes my work incredibly fulfilling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been thinking of joining Patreon for a long while now, but never thought that my work would bring in any supporters, since it is such a niche art form. After a long period of musing, and constant support from those closest to me, I have decided to go forward with the idea, regardless if I gain an immense amount of followers or not. I simply wish to share my work with a larger audience, and allow them to join me in my artistic journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to go ahead and thank those that decide to follow me in advance; your support means the world to me, and I will forever be grateful!"
