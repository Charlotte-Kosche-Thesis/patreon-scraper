    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eShwmae!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Louis Thomas, and I\u0027m intensely passionate about creating \u003cstrong\u003ehonest, insightful and unbiased video content\u003c/strong\u003e revolving primarily around \u003cstrong\u003ecryptocurrencies.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been posting cryptocurrency-related content on YouTube for well over a year now, and in that time I\u0027ve been able to generate an income via the \u003cstrong\u003eGoogle Adsense programme. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this is becoming \u003cstrong\u003emore and more difficult as time goes by\u003c/strong\u003e. Throughout much of 2017 we witnessed \u003cstrong\u003ewidespread demonetisation\u003c/strong\u003e occur across the platform, and in the past week we\u0027ve learned that \u003cstrong\u003eGoogle will now be banning all cryptocurrency-related advertising on their platform \u003c/strong\u003eas well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis leads independent content creators towards finding alternative ways to monetize their content. One of the most popular and lucrative ways in which \"influencers\" or \"cryptotubers\" can do this is through ICO-sponsored content. \u003cstrong\u003eCompanies offer to pay influencers obscene amounts of money in exchange for coverage of their upcoming coin offering. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is not the route that I wish to go down with my channel\u003c/strong\u003e. Not only are there \u003cstrong\u003eethical issues\u003c/strong\u003e relating to influencers pushing ICOs onto their audience when they themselves wouldn\u0027t choose to invest their own money into them, but there are \u003cstrong\u003epotential legal issues\u003c/strong\u003e that arise out of doing so as well, particularly if the project in question turns out to be a scam (remember Bitconnect, anyone?). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, in an ethical effort to ensure the long term sustainability of this channel, I\u0027m reaching out to anyone who would like to support me by sponsoring the channel. With your support, I can continue to provide you with insightful and unbiased content that will be 100% free from the influence of any companies or ICOs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOnly if you have the means to do so, and if you consider my content to have provided you with enough value over the past year\u003c/strong\u003e, would I ask that you please consider becoming a patron. My intention is to pay you back tenfold by creating an abundance of high-quality content that you will extract an enormous amount of value from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegardless of whether or not you decide to contribute, I would like to thank you for the time you\u0027ve spent reading this, and you can look forward to seeing more content from me very soon. Cheers!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
