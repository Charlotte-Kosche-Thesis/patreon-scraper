Little Moth Games stands as a testimony to gaming, art, and philosophy. We strive to create games that tell under-represented narratives, with our current focus being mental illness and mental health.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKIM: The Untold Story is a psychological narrative game about healing from trauma. The game follows Jonas, a man haunted by substance abuse and mental illness, into a nightmare world where he finds his demons and symbolic places of his past. With the guidance of his demons, Jonas starts to understand that his daily suffering is caused by a sinister force deep inside him. By confronting his repressed memories, he becomes stronger and more emotionally capable of overcoming his greatest demon: himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKIM: The Untold Story is a dark and immersive narrative that invites the player to relive Jonas\u2019 memories alongside him. We focus on cinematic light, color, framing, and sound to convey Jonas\u2019 experiences with mental illness. The bulk of the gameplay consists of exploring these nightmarish realms and interacting with symbolic objects that define Jonas\u2019 past. Ultimately, our main goal is to ask the player: \u201cHow can we heal if we do not know ourselves?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Edit: for previous patrons, we have halted Little Moth\u0027s other games while we work on The Untold Story*\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny inquiries, comments, suggestions, or advice can be sent to our email at littlemothgames@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMuch moth love to you all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
