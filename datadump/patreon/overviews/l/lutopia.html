    "summary": "Have you ever thought of videogames as a mere waste of time?\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever felt like videogames are just a form of digital narcotics? \u003cbr\u003eHave you ever caught yourself concerned about their addicting force or their gross power to exploit?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I\u0027m here to tell you that videogames do not have to be that way. I and other game developers are working diligently to put the immersive\u00a0\u00a0power of videogames to good use. There is no reason why videogames have to be designed to addict and exploit to be profitable, they can be engaging and stimulating while also being educational and useful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, a successful videogame doesn\u0027t have to be a waste of time, but in order for us good game developers to be able to do something about it, we need your support (the bad guys certainly have plenty!). So, here is your chance to contribute to the good fight and do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a handful of change, not unlike the average amount of money dispensed to the ordinary beggar, you will not only help the quality of the games I make but also cut down on development time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis one dollar is not charged to you right away, but at the beginning of the month, so don\u0027t worry if you do not have a dollar available in you card or PayPal account right away. You can easily cancel at any time, this is not a permanent commitment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can give more than $1 if you so wish. The more you and other patrons give, the better it will be for game production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese funds will go solely to game development and I will give you patrons a monthly financial report of how the funds are being appropriated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese funds are not a substitution for the ones already being invested from myself personally. I will still keep my day jobs and continue to invest in the games as well, but now you can help carry the load.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those unfamiliar with my work, please visit the website at: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.lutopia.co/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLUTOPiA.Co\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Thank you for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"No dream has ever been realized by an unbeliever\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
