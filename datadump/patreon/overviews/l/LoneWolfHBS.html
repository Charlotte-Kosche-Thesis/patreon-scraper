    "summary": "Hey fellas! Here\u0027s LoneWolfHBS, or \"Sayn\". Thank you for checking out my Patreon page and I hope to provide as much as I possibly could. I joined up on the recommendation of several friends and I wish to expand with my content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGallery:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LoneWolfHBS\"\u003eYoutube (Animations and Other Videos)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lonewolfhbs.deviantart.com/).\"\u003eDeviantArts (Art Gallery)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how can I support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon enables fans to support their favorite content creators more directly than before. After making an account, you can choose to support me through a monetary donation of your liking. As little as $1 can be donated, and very dedicated fans can donate even more. The amount will be charged by the end of the month whenever I post a paid post and in the very rare moment that I post many times per month, you can set a maximum for the month. There are bonuses for contributing as well. And finally, if you decided it is not worth it to contribute anymore, you can cancel at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to turn what was originally my content creating hobby into a career. Your support would enable me to get better equipment (namely, computer) to create better quality content. Thanks to all my supporters and so, let\u0027s get to the main details:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContent Scheduling:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the large array of content I do, I will focus on one project at a time and each time I switch project, I will notify you. Only now and then will a few randoms pop up.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eMore details for the scheduling of each type of content below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do:\u003cbr\u003eAnimations (Main Focus)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m an animator, using\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/1840/Source_Filmmaker/)\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSource Filmmaker\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0who specializes in storytelling and due to the software I used, I tend to focus on universes that SFM is capable of supporting. This includes Valve games like Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead, along with others that were ported into the Source engine like Five Nights at Freddy\u0027s and Overwatch. \u003cstrong\u003eSo far, I have only ever done videos of TF2 and L4D, the former was halted temporarily and the latter is fully done, so I\u0027m moving on to Overwatch now, which are comedy-focused sort of storytelling.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople tend to underestimate the amount of time to create just a minute or two worth of animations so I\u0027ll just say it right here: It often takes at least a full day to make at most a minute worth of animations and that is assuming that nothing disrupts it. Due to shifting schedules, I will be sticking to making at least one video, usually within 1-5 minutes long, per month. Originally, I tend to make 10-15 minutes long videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support on YouTube has been invaluable. What was originally my hobby became a job and now that I am on Patreon, I am hoping to turn this into a career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImage Renders/Pictures\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn a lot of my spare time, I make pictures, either for myself or on the request of other people, and share them to others, primarily on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lonewolfhbs.deviantart.com/).\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edeviantArts page\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lonewolfhbs.deviantart.com/).\"\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e I also occasionally make teases in the form of picture renders for future videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike videos, most image renders can be done very quickly and \u003cstrong\u003eI tend to make them faster than I would on a full video so for patrons who wish for a request, I am very willing to provide. The only rules I have for requests is no nudity. \u003c/strong\u003eAlso, due to my reliance on SFM, I am limited to models that are ported into SFM so take note before any requests are made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStory Writing\u00a0(Least Focus, Hobby)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is the least flashy of the things I do. One of my life goals is to become a writer and I\u0027m starting on it really soon. So yes, when I am not uploading a video or pictures, I am likely writing a story or two so expect these to pop up as well. My English is not the best but I will do my best to make my stories easy to follow without making it painful for the eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, the stories within my YouTube videos are the ones I plan to write now, but modified to adapt to the universe that I was applying it to so the original, novel versions will seem different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of now, my stories will almost always be of the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genres and most of them take place within the same universe. I avoid making stories that maintain the same protagonist throughout so expect different perspectives when the story changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOthers\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am also a gamer and every now and then, I might upload a gaming video or two for the sake of sharing. For instance, when Fallout 4 came out, there was a lack of videos showing all the possible companions leaving the player in anger and I took the initiative to upload one myself. So yes, these are possible content too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lonewolfhbs.deviantart.com/).\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMoney Usage:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMajority of the money will be used for daily necessities like food, transport and things like that but every now and then, I will use them to get better equipment, which ensures that the quality of my content gets better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than that, thank you to all my supporters and even bigger thanks to those who supported me directly until now!\u003cbr\u003e"
