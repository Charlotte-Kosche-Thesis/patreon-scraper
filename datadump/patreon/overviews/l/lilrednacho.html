The majority of my labor focuses on dispelling misinformation about Indigenous peoples (specifically Virginia and East Coast natives) on Turtle Island by compiling historical and modern resources and analyzing them using a decolonized framework. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIssues such as cultural appropriation, savage tropes, Pocahontas myths etc. are pervasive and impact several of our communities, but in different ways. When discussing the various issues that impact our communities, I feel emphasizing the nuances and historical context between our cultures is increasingly important, especially when attempting to combat monoliths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to dispelling misinformation, my hope is to highlight the discrepancies and hypocrisy in American settler society to better assist readers in understanding the impact of ongoing genocide and their everyday complicity in our erasure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that Patreon will provide an opportunity for me to document these observations in an organized fashion and preserve my intellectual labor from uncredited exploitation. Although I dislike having to exchange content for monetary compensation (and therefore contribute to the harmful capitalist structure), I have a plethora of medical and legal bills that I am currently drowning in, and that wage gap hasn\u0027t helped much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try to post as much Public content I can, so if you would like to compensate me for my labor without paying monthly, you can donate to my CashMe app at: $kimaNieves\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy what you read, and the content here helps broaden your perspective regarding the societal structures we all reside in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
