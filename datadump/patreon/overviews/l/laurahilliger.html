I do webby stuff and big brain stuff with global  communities. \u003cstrong\u003eI contribute to open source, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://laurahilliger.github.io/presentations/\"\u003espeak at conferences\u003c/a\u003e. I do stuff  around culture shifting, co-ops, open behavior, ecology, psychology, leadership. You can google me and find all  that stuff. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m also a maker\u003c/strong\u003e. I write. I tinker and make.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still writing \u003ca href=\"https://leanpub.com/maybe-zombies/\"\u003eMaybe Zombies\u003c/a\u003e. I write \u003ca href=\"http://laurahilliger.com/newsletter\"\u003emy newsletter\u003c/a\u003e every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIt\u0027s not the money that motivates, rather the intent behind it. Paying people for their creativity is like going to the dive bar where your friend\u0027s band is playing. Entrance is cheap, and you\u0027re supporting your friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI want to write books, lots of them. I  want to make a game called Coffee Quest. I want to make a spider that crawls the internet and collects hilariously outdated websites. I want  to make a sculpture out of crayons. I want to do a digital art project  that traces my data in correlation with my learning*. \n\nI want to finish the Emotional Mapping project I started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003e*I have  a floppy disk from when I was in kindergarten. I want to start there  and then make a crazy visual that tracks my skill with computers  from childhood. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI don\u0027t have a lot of time for these things. My \"day job\" requires enough of my brain power that at  the end of the day I\u0027m spent. It\u0027s my first Patreon, monetizing to make art feels strange. Maybe it won\u0027t work, and then I\u0027ll delete my data and carry on. Or, maybe you\u0027ll choose to be a patron, and we\u0027ll see what happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have feedback for me?
