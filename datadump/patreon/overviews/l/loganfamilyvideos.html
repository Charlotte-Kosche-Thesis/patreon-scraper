We\u0027re the Logans and we launched a family YouTube channel where we love to make videos of our family for YOU! Our channel includes family vlogs, craft and activity ideas for kids, family field trips to cool places, and silly challenges. Here\u0027s a look at our YouTube channel trailer:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"height: 0;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMWWvStopyc?ecver=2\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched a Patreon page as a way to give our audience a way to gain access to exclusive videos they won\u0027t see on YouTube while also being a part of our journey as we grow a YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs YouTube creators we have been able to do a lot with what we have but there is so much more that we could do with a bigger budget including more frequent vlogs and better quality videos. It would allow us to visit and review more places that cost money or buy the props that we need for some of our challenge videos. It would allow us to improve the equipment we use or even better, perhaps become full time vloggers someday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Become A Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron will give you exclusive rewards such as early access to our videos before they\u0027re released on YouTube, to exclusive videos and content that is only for our patrons here on Patreon, to private video calls on Skype, having YOUR NAME mentioned in a video, and even hand drawn pictures from a two year old. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose which rewards you want by choosing which tier you want to sign up under."
