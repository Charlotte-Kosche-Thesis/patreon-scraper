    "summary": "You like art. I love making art!\u003cbr\u003eHow lucky we found one another!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a self-taught, full-time mixed media Artist, with a passion for surrealism, symbolism and telling stories. Making art is not just something I do, it is the core of who and what I am. \u003cbr\u003eArt has both saved and sustained my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been fortunate to be able to earn a modest living with my artwork. \u003cbr\u003eThat is, in big thanks, to my studio shoppe on the mezzanine inside The Last Bookstore in DTLA. \u003cbr\u003eThis little shoppe has become my day job and a blessing, wherein I regularly meet new fans, collectors, and enthusiasts of my artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessing or not, it is a tricky way to make a living. However it shakes out, I continue making the art, as often as I can, like a woman falling in love, stealing every moment possible to spend with my creations. Even though I show up often, it is the shoppe which steals my attention and focus most of the time, 7 days a week. \u2028\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short answer as to why I am on Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2028Help me get back to the core of what I\u2019m here to do - help me get back to making the actual Art. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an artist first. A shoppe owner second.\u2028\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I\u2019m asking you, as someone who enjoys my artwork, to pledge...\u003cbr\u003ePledge knowing that I will complete new work (more) regularly, \u003cbr\u003eand in turn, I create for you...knowing that an appreciative audience is waiting! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent a lot of time considering a proper exchange for your patronage, (in addition to the making of the actual art). I value your support, and have come up with some exciting patron-only rewards just for you! (check these out below). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have opted for a per artwork format, as opposed to per month. \u003cbr\u003eEach piece takes several months to complete, so it would probably average out to something like one completed artwork every 6 weeks, which is how often your patronage would be. And as a patron, you will see the creations in their unfolding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider supporting this artist, this work, in any amount you can. \u003cbr\u003eMore than anything I want the work to continue. You have read this far I suspect you want the work to continue as well. Ultimately, you should support me because you want to, and for reasons that are all your own... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll contributions will go towards funding my time to make art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, in closing, I thank you for your time, your interest, your consideration, support, enthusiasm and willingness to help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a heart full of love, gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eto the art life!\u003cbr\u003e~Liz Huston,\u003cbr\u003e25 November 2015\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52dc725de4b03cda32c3d7d5/56032a6be4b0123b464d419d/5604883be4b076a3e91dfd03/1443137938666/WhatEverYouLoveYouAre-LizHuston2012.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 571px; height: 713px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
