So here\u0027s Patreon, giving people the option to throw some dollars my way to keep me at this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough incentive I can actually stick to making updates in a timely manner and less sporadically. At least, that\u0027s the intention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you wanna throw money, I can do some extras for you as well, so I guess there\u0027s that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money I (hopefully) get from this\u0027ll be going towards paying for stuff to make arting easier. My Photoshop subscription, Picarto subscription, buying more art programs, tutorials, etc! Every little bit counts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is NOT a paywall.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s just another place to post things and get people\u0027s opinions and maybe make some extra dollars (you know, like artists are wont to do, heh)\u003cbr\u003eFor that matter, this place\u0027ll be MORE SFW than elsewhere due to Patreon\u0027s T\u0026amp;Cs in regards to adult product. So there\u0027s that too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/h3\u003eCause everyone does Patreon, so why not me?! MWAHAHAHA..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, it\u0027s cause I do like writing and drawing Lulu\u0027s Bad Dates (it\u0027s a good incentive to make my lazy ass actually draw) and the more incentive to do it the better. Money is a super good incentive. Knowing there\u0027s fans is incentive. Fan interaction is an incentive. Money to art is a pretty good incentive. All of these together and huzzah, Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy love and appreciation! Well. Some. Maybe. Probably. Nah, you do. Even if you don\u0027t throw money, just knowing peeps like what I\u0027m doing is awesome. But like every starving artist out there, a couple of dollars helps too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnywho!\u003cbr\u003eDifferent tiers get you different things. A dollar gets you the above. $5 will get you a scribble each month. More money and things get shinier, all the way to being included in the comic at some point (\u003cem\u003efrom the low low price of $10 a month\u003c/em\u003e).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaces to find me and Lulu\u0027s Bad Dates comics.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFA:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/lulusbaddates/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/lulusbaddates/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeasyl:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~luluamore\"\u003ehttps://www.weasyl.com/~luluamore\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFurryNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://beta.furrynetwork.com/luluamore/\"\u003ehttps://beta.furrynetwork.com/luluamore/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoFurry\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"https://luluamore.sofurry.com/\"\u003ehttps://luluamore.sofurry.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFurrific\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.furiffic.com/LuluAmore\"\u003ehttps://www.furiffic.com/LuluAmore\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://inkbunny.net/LuluAmore\"\u003ehttps://inkbunny.net/LuluAmore\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTumblr:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lulusbaddates.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttps://lulusbaddates.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePicarto:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/LuluAmore\"\u003ehttps://picarto.tv/LuluAmore\u003c/a\u003e (NSFW)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LulusBadDates\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/LulusBadDates\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFB:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lulu.amore.716\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/lulu.amore.716\u003c/a\u003e (I totally don\u0027t look at my messages, but feel free to add me and fail to have any real interaction because I tend to ignore FB entirely, woo)"
