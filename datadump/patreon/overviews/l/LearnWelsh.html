I love teaching the Welsh language and feel passionate about teaching anyone who wants to learn Welsh. I believe in teaching conversational Welsh, so that when you speak to a fluent Welsh speaker, you are easily understood and sound like a natural Welsh speaker.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does the Learn Welsh Podcast need my support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create a complete Welsh course, with videos and audio that teaches beginners Welsh and helps people to become confident fluent Welsh speakers. I also think it\u0027s important that the learning materials are \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e for everyone, so there\u0027s no barrier to anyone being able to learn Welsh. But\u00a0because I work full time, I don\u0027t have enough spare time to create the podcasts and videos as regularly as I would like. So what I\u0027m asking, is that if you believe in what I\u0027m doing, it would be fantastic if you were able to support me through Patreon. The more people that support me, the more of my working hours I can cut back on and dedicate that time creating language learning podcasts and videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is great because if you support me you also get something out of it.

My videos and podcasts will always be free and there\u0027s lots of other ways you can support me, such as subscribing to my YouTube page or writing a fanatasic Podcast review on iTunes.
