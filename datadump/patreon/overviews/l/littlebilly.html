Seasonal layoffs and random hiatuses make it necessary for me to generate alternative forms of income while (and for) developing my project. Enter Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe ideal scenario for a production like this is self-reliance. That is, to get paid simply for working on the project just like any other full-time job. That\u0027s where you and Patreon come in! Unlike other sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, Patreon has no end-dates, deadlines, or minimum goal requirements. Think of this Patreon page as an endless crowdfunding platform where \"Patrons\" can pledge to contribute monthly for various, ongoing Rewards...or just to support the project.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s my original animated series,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eLittle Billy.\u003c/em\u003e Inspired by my own childhood growing up with Tourette Syndrome, \u003cem\u003eLittle Billy\u003c/em\u003e is the ultimate nostalgia cartoon about life with Special Needs.\u00a0The classic 2D traditional cartoons of animation\u0027s Golden Age and family sitcoms from the 1980s are the creative influence behind it.\u00a0It\u0027s a real cartoon about real people! The project began in 1999 as a series of doodles and ideas. Now, over 15 years later, it has seen the success of two crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter and Indiegogo! It has also gained the love and support of many Special Needs communities, most notably TSA (The Tourette Association of America.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Series:\u003c/strong\u003e Meet Billy Harper...the most hyperactive child in the world! As the sun sets over 1980\u0027s suburban America, the decade that gave rise to Generation Rx is about to come face to face with Patient Zero! \u003cem\u003eThe Simpsons\u003c/em\u003e lead animator, Chance Raspberry, invites you to be yourself, embrace what makes you different, and rediscover the heart, adventure, and magic of childhood like never before! It\u0027s the show you missed...that never existed. Until now! It\u0027s \u003cem\u003eLittle Billy\u003c/em\u003e, the world\u0027s first and only animated series about life with Special Needs!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\"People hear \u0027Special Needs\u0027 and immediately think \u0027Educational\u0027, hence boring, or \u0027Niche\u0027, hence \u0027I don\u0027t have Special Needs so this doesn\u0027t apply to me...I won\u0027t get or enjoy it.\u0027 This aspect of Little Billy is just one of the key ingredients that make the series stand out and unique. It\u0027s not a show about life with SPECIAL NEEDS; it\u0027s a show about LIFE told through the eyes of a family conquering Special Needs. The \u002780s nostalgia, animation quality, story, adventure, and universal heart of Little Billy all play equally important roles. The Special Needs layer of the series is just the icing on the cake.\"\u003c/em\u003e - Chance Raspberry\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBilly\u0027s Condition:\u003c/strong\u003e Growing up with Tourette Syndrome, my tics always varied. I never came close to the swearing, screaming, stereotyped version of Tourettes (still) portrayed in mainstream media - my greatest attribute was my energy! I was fearless and relentless. I never stopped. My parents would carry me everywhere because the second they put me down, I was gone! Cliffs, swimming pools, and other mortal childhood dangers were no match for my brazen curiosity and wild, untamed spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was also a very sensitive, emotional child - I felt very strongly and deeply about everything. I still do. Even \u002780s TV commercials for dog food or Happy Meals\u2122 could (and did) make me cry. The unique specifics above are precisely why I created Billy\u0027s \n\u003cem\u003efictitious\u003c/em\u003e condition:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUHS\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e(Ultra Hyper Sensitivity\u003c/strong\u003e) - A medically rare, neurological condition caused by enlarged, overactive adrenal glands and a shortage of reuptake inhibitors (RI) resulting in hazardous, potentially destructive levels of excess adrenaline. All senses and sensory triggers, both physical and emotional, are peaked. In extreme cases, patients have been known to experience and exhibit superhuman amounts of energy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy inventing a neurodiversity for Billy instead of just giving him Tourettes or an existing one (which society has already labeled), I\u0027ve made \n\u003cem\u003eLittle Billy\u003c/em\u003e a universal character and series that anyone can relate to. No fan, friend, or audience member will ever feel left or singled out. Regardless of our conditions, situations, or lack thereof, we can all enjoy and identify with \u003cem\u003eLittle Billy\u003c/em\u003e because we\u0027ve all \u003cem\u003ebeen\u003c/em\u003e Billy at some point in life.
