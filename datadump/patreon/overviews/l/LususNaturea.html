    "summary": "Hi everyone, so you are probably what this is all about. Well, my friends and I want to create a tabletop RPG\u00a0and we know with we can do it by our selves, and we are nowhere near asking for Kickstarter\u00a0or other investments we want the game more done. So my hyperactive over the top friend suggested we try to Patreon this, she shall henceforth be called the Great Skull or the Witch of Dead Dreams, not my choice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo before we start let\u0027s get a couple things straight, the game is no were near complete like ar skill section is barren but their\u00a0kind fo straightforward. But the start is all set up so you can start the game up and evolve once ya that kind of are Main Mechanic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now to explain what the actual game is about, we are making a game about being the monster instead of the hero or the good guy. you are the minotaur of the labyrinth, the Sphinx\u00a0guarding the gate, and all that cool stuff. Some of are the main thing is that individual skill or talents level up separately\u00a0to your actual character just like in most video game RPGs. But you do not start as the super badass monster no you are the simply goblin trying to raise though the rank and try to evolve which is are main thing the power to go from a goblin to a god yup that is a possiblility\u00a0good like trying to figure out how but it is a thing.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiscord \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/qVr227R\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehttps://discord.gg/qVr227R\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the files are at \u003ca href=\"https://lusus-naturea.itch.io/the-grand-monster-rpg/patreon-access\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehttps://lusus-naturea.itch.io/the-grand-monster-rpg/patreon-access\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
