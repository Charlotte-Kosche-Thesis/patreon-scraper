    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003eThanks for stopping by. Let me tell you a bit about myself and why I\u0027m asking for your patronage.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nShort Bio: Now With Cats!\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tSince 1984 I\u0027ve supported my family by one sort of publishing or another: technical writing, game design, educational publishing, web design, editing, even some reviews. It\u0027s all been a compromise with a 10-year-old me who read  \n\t\u003cem\u003eRobinson Crusoe\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and ached to tell such stories. Now I\u0027m retired and don\u0027t have to write to survive. I can write novels.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tEvery author bio seems to involve cats. During my working years I didn\u0027t have any. Now I live on a farm, and three cats have adopted me. They\u0027re staring at me now from the porch outside. They follow me wherever I go. I love them. So there\u0027s that.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tEvery author bio also includes an out-of-date photo from when the writer was young. The one above is from 1987. That\u0027s how far back I had to search for something that appears earnestly authorial. All my newer photos have Hawaiian shirts, or ironic T-shirts, or a fanged smiley mask.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy This Patreon Page?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\t\tLet me be serious for a moment. Retirement doesn\u0027t mean having nothing but time on your hands.\u00a0Chances are you have even more friends and family than when you were young. Nurturing those relationships means dropping whatever you\u0027re doing when there\u0027s a need. There are also more home projects. And, sadly, more doctor visits. That\u0027s all important stuff, but it does use up hours.\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\t\tAnd the act of writing itself can be daunting. It\u0027s far too easy to neglect when the going gets difficult or you\u0027re outside your comfort zone.\u00a0\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\t\tThis page is a contract with patrons to devote time to creating. It means I owe you. Specifically because you put your faith in me. The money involved means far less, which is why I set the pledge levels so low. You\u0027re buying me coffee. That\u0027s a kindness I intend to\u00a0repay.\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Am I Writing?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\tThe current project is entitled \n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Is Suzi-Q-Suzukie?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s about a John Doe amnesiac who wakes from a coma with that question on his lips. To answer it he must first search out his own identity. This is my first prose novel, so I\u0027m finding my way through the process. And figuring out what sort of Patreon updates to make without giving away the ending.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWait, your first \u003cem\u003eprose\u003c/em\u003e novel?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\t\tYes. My first novel, supported by this Patreon page, was \n\t\t\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Pastime Machine: A Byronic Mashup of Dante \u0026amp; Wells, in \u003cdel\u003e1001\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0101 Raving\u00a0Sonnets!\u003c/i\u003e Most of my previous creative writing was post-modern poetry (meaning less \u003cem\u003efree verse \u003c/em\u003ethan \u003cem\u003eformal verse\u003c/em\u003e.)\u00a0I have a few awards and am a past president of the Wisconsin Fellowship of Poets. Writing a novel in sonnets seemed a good way to start learning to tell long stories.\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003cem\u003eThe Pastime Machine\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is an irreverent tale about a secret corporate trans-dimensional war. The idea was inspired by seeing a marble building with a McDonald\u0027s in Rome, on a European backpacking trip. All my patrons get a free PDF as a bonus.\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003eThe End\n\t\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\n\t\t\tThat pretty much sums things up. Thanks for reading. Please become a patron. I\u0027ll do my level best to keep you entertained.\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\t\t\u2014Lester Smith\n\u003c/div\u003e"
