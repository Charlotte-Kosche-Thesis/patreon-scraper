I\u2019m constantly creating new illustrations, I write and design RPGs occasionally. I work making commissions, and sometimes writing but only in Spanish. Now that I\u2019m living in a new country it\u2019s hard to find new local jobs because it\u0027s complicated to verify the previous job references.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you\u0027re signing to\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nThe idea of this patreon is to create 2 stock art pieces per month so you can use in your projects. I usually will be making single character or object pieces, but with some milestones reached, I will make more elaborate pieces. Of course I still will be making commissions works, but in the process that I receive more money through here, I will be making more stock arts and the less I will need to look for commissions. Also, as we hit some milestones, the stock arts will improve in quality and quantity. Of course I have a lot to improve as an illustrator, so with the more milestone goals hits, I will have more time to dedicate to make online studies and improve the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the end of each month the patrons will have the\nchance decide and vote what will be the theme of the arts of the next month\nwhether is fantasy, cyberpunk, gothic, pirates or more specific themes like\nspaceships, animals or portraits. Of course I consider myself as an illustrator\nwho still have a lot to learn, so this could be, not only a great chance to\nlearn, this could be a great opportunity make pieces that otherwise I would\nnever do and it\u2019s a powerful chance to investigate and to improve. Right now my\nnemesis it\u2019s perspective and textures, so it\u2019s a New Year resolution to get\ncloser to conquer it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso, once a month I plan to release one art under \u201cCreative\nCommons\u201d license so everyone could use it and to help everyone out there. The\npatrons will decide which art will be release. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor what I will use the money\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nThe money I make with the patreon will help me pay the\nbills. Also I will have the chance to avoid constantly seeking for commissions\nand dedicate more time to create better stockarts. Also I will dedicate some of\nit to make online studies and improve as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e"
