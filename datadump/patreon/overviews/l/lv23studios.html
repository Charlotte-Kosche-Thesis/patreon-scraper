    "summary": "Hey everyone! Laney here, creator of No Evil Robots!, and I just wanted to tell you a little bit about me, and about this webcomic in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"No Evil Robots!\" was born right in the middle of a really odd time for me- as many whimsical ideas often are. I had gotten married to my equally nerdy other half, graduated college, and moved to California from Texas (with said equally nerdy other half) all in the span of about half a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first, I just relished the down time after all of that shenaniganry. I mean, I hadn\u0027t even picked up Skyrim yet, or Pok\u00e9mon Black\u0026amp;White and I- well, I digress\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, something felt very odd about the whole situation... And that was the fact that I really had no clue whatsoever to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I get this feeling a lot, actually, but again, I digress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was more than just the \"I don\u0027t know what to do today\" confusion, but more of an \"I don\u0027t know what to do for the next (x) amount of years\" confusion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I finally got smart(ish), thanks to the wisdom-wizardry of some close friends, and fell back on what I really love to do- and, well, what I have a degree in: I started drawing. And trying to make people smile (ok, so I don\u0027t have a degree for that second one, but how awesome would that be?!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was back in Texas a while back, and was talking to my good friend Burt, when it hit me: Why didn\u0027t I draw a small comic strip? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout what, though?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, about the awkwardness and often comedy that comes from graduating college and being dropped on your head into the real world. Plop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause you see, there\u0027s this uncanny feeling that builds up in some people when that happens: It\u0027s like your accelerating rather quickly towards an oncoming cliff with such confidence- and then you think to yourself, \"Oh. Wait. Am I in a car, or an airplane?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHmm. You know what? Scrap it all but that last part. That\u0027s really all there is to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic has the rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly hope you enjoy it, and that it can bring you a smile today. Few people get the chance to really do what they love and potentially make a living (or part of one) of it, so I don\u0027t want to let this one pass me by. Skyrim and Pok\u00e9mon can wait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell\u2026 Lemme just slay this last dragon real quick\u2026\u003cbr\u003e"
