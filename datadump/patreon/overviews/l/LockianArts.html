Cute cartoon animal people, I like things that are soft, colorful \u0026amp; fluffy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a UK based traditional artist, I\u0027m 21 \u0026amp; living in Nottingham!\u003cbr\u003eI love to draw artwork for the furry community, along with fan-art of my fave things in the world, like, Pokemon! Doctor Who! Avatar The Last Airbender! My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic! Among so many others, I want to set up this patreon so that I can spend more time creating original pieces, more fan-art \u0026amp; drawing what people would like to see more of! I want you guys to have a input into what you want me to draw in my style, it sounds fun, as well as just supporting me in being able to continue doing artwork, promarkers sadly are not free!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWjt-j4X0AAwq-b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eI\u0027m first and foremost a animal artist, I love fluffy critters, both real and fantasy! It\u0027s why I always felt such a draw to the furry community, being a animal lover is really just a gateway to this wonderful community, the animals I love to draw tend to be canines, Wolves, Dogs, Puppies, Cheeky foxes, there very good! Big Cats are my fave animals, so I crave to draw them more, I also love very sweet hoofers like goats, and moo-moo cows! \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWju5aBWkAAQF1Y.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eOne of my fave things to create is badges! There little pieces of art that help identify people at furry events, especially if they are in costume because they are usually silent when performing, here\u0027s a lovely badge I made for Rox!
