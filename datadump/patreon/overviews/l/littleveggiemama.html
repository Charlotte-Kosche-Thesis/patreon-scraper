     "about": "Hello!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am a yoga teaching mother of 2, living as sustainable as possible and improving every day! I went vegan back in 2012 and now, in 2017, I am the most comfortable and confident with my decision. My daughter made the leap when she was four and I followed in her footsteps. She simply said, that if you wouldn\u0027t eat a cat or a dog, your pets, then you shouldn\u0027t eat cows and chickens! She said she didn\u0027t want to eat animals anymore and I decided to support her decision. Fortunately for me, it alleviated my chronic sicknesses such as tonsil stones, chronic bronchitis, acne, chronic sinus infections, and hyperthyroid. After seeing the health benefits, I opened my eyes to the cruelty toward farm animals, animals used for testing cosmetics, medicine and the like, and the torture of animals raised to die for fur coats, I became a sort of advocate for a cruelty-free world. I became peaceful in all aspects of life, a better mother, a better friend and more compassionate human. I have never regretted choosing plant-based meals and cruelty free products. My life has only improved. I hope to pay forward what my daughter has taught me and have decided to do this with youtube videos and Facebook and Instagram, and teaching kid\u0027s yoga! I look forward to what the future will bring! MUAH! thanks for reading! :::HUGS::::\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Little Veggie Mama",
