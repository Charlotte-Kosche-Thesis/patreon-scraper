I\u0027m a young lady studying animation, and my big dream is to work on really cute, inclusive cartoons for kids and young adults someday. In the meantime, I\u0027m studying hard and trying to make cute art, fun crafts, and unique visual novels for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI focus on making \u003c/strong\u003eillustrations of original characters, tiny mascots, my favorite video game/cartoon characters, and whatever else pops into my imagination. I\u0027ve also recently taken up needle felting. Writing-wise, lately I\u0027m focusing on writing visual novels, and I\u0027ve been in the process of writing/illustrating/programming a dating sim called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Duenkhy\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for the last couple of years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI set up this Patreon because \u003c/strong\u003eart school is big and scary and I need to be making money, but when I have classes, I rarely have time for anything other than working on art at home. Having an income would allow me to pursue more venues of artistic expression, such as making products and more video games. (\u003cstrong\u003eAt this time, being supported financially will especially help me work more often on The Duenkhy, so if you want to see that finished sooner, consider contributing!\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I\u0027d like to make more games, more needle felt dolls, art books, prints, stationery, stickers, pillows, keychains, tote bags, pins, notebooks, calendars, stamps, zines!!!!, charms, mouse pads, mugs, shirts... I want to try making all kinds of things!!! In return, I want to offer resources, art learning tips/materials, and other entertaining peeks into my working process, so please stick around and see what kinds of things I come up with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThis lil otter wants YOU to support me on Patreon!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/f72b0b4385bdad6ef8b621c6b6408200/tumblr_nqc4ywtyrc1qbcwmwo1_250.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
