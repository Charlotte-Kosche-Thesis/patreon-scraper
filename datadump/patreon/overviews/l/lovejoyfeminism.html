    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWho is Libby Anne?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI am a twenty-something writer, mother, academic, and activist living in the Midwest. I grew up in a large conservative evangelical homeschool family.\u00a0My parents followed the teachings of a variety of high profile Christian homeschool leaders, including Michael Farris, Joshua Harris, Doug Philips, Michael and Debi Pearl, and Nancy Campbell. As a result, I am the oldest of a large number of children and was raised in a home where childhood obedience and female submission was upheld as the standard. I came of age expecting to court, marry, have my own large brood of children, and homeschool as any good Christian wife and mother should, but this was not to be, and I found myself scrambling, as a young adult, to figure out who I was and was not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eOkay, but why do you blog?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMy blog\u003c/a\u003e started as a place where I processed my experiences. Where did the beliefs I was raised with come from? How had my parents gotten swept up in them? Where precisely did they cause damage, and how could I correct it in my own life? What did life look like, after all of that? How could I ever fully integrate into a society so profoundly different from that of my childhood? Would the cultural experiences I\u0027d missed out on forever make me feel like an outsider? Over the years I\u0027ve come to terms with much of this and plugged in many pieces of the puzzle. I\u0027ve also called out various Christian homeschool leaders for the harm they\u0027ve caused. And as I\u0027ve grown in who I am, my writing has shifted towards politics and culture wars.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy should I read what you write?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in the perspective of someone who came from a thoroughly conservative background and now identifies as a political progressive, you may find my writing worth reading. I write about feminism and women\u0027s issues from the perspective of someone who grew up believing it was wrong for a woman to hold a job outside of the home, and about parenting from the perspective of someone who has transitioned from authoritarian, parent-centered parenting to positive, child-centered parenting. Finally, I write about religion as someone who grew up evangelical but is no longer religious, and about homeschooling as a homeschool graduate sending my own children to public school.\u00a0If any of this sounds interesting, my blog may be for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat is the \"lesbian duplex\"?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWhat is the \"lesbian duplex\"? Some time ago I spent two years on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2015/12/created-to-be-his-help-meet-a-compilation-of-posts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea week-by-week review\u003c/a\u003e of Debi Pearl\u0027s book, Created To Be His Help Meet. Debi explained how to be a submissive wife in great detail and with many stories as illustrations, going out of her way to beret, shame, and frighten her readers into following her teachings. At one point she warned readers that if they did not follow her advice, they might end up lesbians living in duplexes, and thus the lesbian duplex -- which my readers resoundingly deemed preferable to the hellish marriage Debi described -- was born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy \"Love, Joy, Feminism\"?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI grew up viewing \"feminism\" as a dirty word. Learning what feminism was (and was not) became central to my process of rebuilding who I was and how I understood the world as a young adult. As I began blogging, I found myself wanting to help redeem the term and make feminism more palatable to others in my generation or from my upbringing. Galatians 5:22-23 states that \"the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,\u00a0gentleness, [and] self-control.\" I took the first two words from this passage and attached them to feminism, creating a play on words that I hoped would help create a more positive view of this term.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy should I become a patron?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eDon\u0027t worry! My blog content will remain free to the public just as it has always been! I post new content every weekday, and quality content requires\u00a0a lot of time for research and writing. This work is meaningful and rewarding to me and I appreciate the opportunity to earn my way and support my family through my writing. I receive compensation from Patheos, my blogging platform, for the page views I bring the site.
