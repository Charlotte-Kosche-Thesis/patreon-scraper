Bradley\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I want to send hugs and HUGE thank yous to ALL of my supporters! As a 52 year old invisibly ill artist (fibro, IBS, and arthritis) I am unable to hold down a \"regular job\" and literally do not know what I would do, or how my family would make ends meet, without your help! I send blessings to each and every one of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought long and hard about what I\nwanted to offer my Patreon supporters for 2018, and in the end  I\nkept coming back to the notion of sharing something that I myself\nwant to learn, in the hope that my research and process of discovery\nmight also benefit others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I\u0027ve felt inspired to work on\nmy Book of  Shadows again. As the new year approaches, I\u0027ve been\nconsidering various approaches to a personalized Wheel of the Year\nfor my practice and have ended up with the realization that the\nstandard Wheel of the Year festivals actually don\u0027t hold much meaning\nfor me anymore. So I hit on the idea\nof crafting a LUNAR Wheel of the Year for 2018, and inviting all of\nyou to come along for the ride!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI want to make clear that I am NOT\nteaching anything, here; I don\u0027t feel I\u0027m cut out to be a teacher,\nplus a lot of the material shared will be new to me as well. But what\nI\u0027d like to do is explore the new and full moons of 2018 from an\nastrological, magickal, and devotional perspective, and share my\nfindings and insights with my supporters. As we go through the year,\nfor each new and full moon period I will choose a theme, as inspired\nby the astrological correspondences for that moon phase; I will also\nprovide a ritual and/or journaling prompt for that lunar period.\nTogether, we will explore how these themes and correspondences can\nenrich your magickal practice and devotional life (regardless of\npantheon or specific religious path). I hope you\u0027ll join me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
