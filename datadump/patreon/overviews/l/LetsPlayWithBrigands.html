If you\u0027re familiar with the channel, you know I hold a all request month in July which I ever so cleverly refer to as \"Total Request July\". If this goal is met, I\u0027ll hold a second request month (think \"Total Request January\") for everyone\u0027s pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1,000 a Month - \u003cstrong\u003eA Dedicated Request Day Each Month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of one or even two request months a year, what if we had a request day EVERY month? At $1,000 a month in pledges (after consecutive months of meeting this goal), on the final Wednesday of each month I will begin playing a request voted on by you. Just like with the request month, requests will be voted on at LetsPlayWithBrigands.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$2,000 a Month - \u003cstrong\u003eTWO Let\u0027s Plays a Week Instead of One!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I reach $2,000 a month (after consecutive months of meeting this goal), I will upload a SECOND UNIQUE let\u0027s play each week. Those of you familiar with the channel know I upload a let\u0027s play of a unique game each Monday. While I occasionally add content on Fridays, it\u0027s typically part of an ongoing series of a game. Meeting this goal would mean a second unique live let\u0027s play each week. Double the fun for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, these are all \u003cstrong\u003eLONG TERM\u003c/strong\u003e goals and admittedly a very, very long way off from being a reality, but it\u0027s definitely something to look forward to if and when they happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs Anything Going to Change on Your Channel?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope.
