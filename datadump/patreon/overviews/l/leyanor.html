Art has been my passion all my life and it has been my dream to make being an artist my full time profession.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me you allow me succeed in my studies. I\u0027m a full-time student with a work schedule on top, so sadly my art output is not as high as I\u0027d like it to be. I will be able to do more works in the future, but be aware that I\u0027m also trying to slowly get away from ponies, furry and NSFW art. Art is truly my calling and I don\u0027t want to have to rely on just one sort of content for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter having said that, I hope you understand how much even a single dollar can help me out. So any support, even the slightest bit, will be greatly appreciated, and I hope the rewards I offer are a welcome sign of appreciation for the great support you show me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank you a lot in advance and mention again how much your support means to me.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eNothing will be paywalled, all content is available for free to everyone. However, you can get early, HD and WIP access through donating.\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u0026amp;A:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat kind of content do you provide?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily produce NSFW and SFW artworks and comics of a large palette of fantasy characters (cartoons, games, movies, comics, concepts etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI try to involve my Patrons as much as I can to decide what kind of content I produce, which is why I create a monthly poll where donators can choose which character will be next to be drawn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eI have no money but would like to support you, what can I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eNon-monetary support can be just as valuable as a donation and I appreciate all of it. The fastest you can do is giving my artworks a Reblog on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://leyanor.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e to spread the word. If you feel like you want to do more you can upload my artworks on your favorite art-sites (e621, rule34, derpibooru etc.) with a source-link guiding back to the original artwork, or directly share the artworks with your friends and sharing a link to my art-blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDo you take commissions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eYes, I take commissions of all sorts. The prices vary depending on complexity and size.\u003cbr\u003eTo get an estimate, think of one full color character costing around $80, detailed backgrounds count as a character aswell. A precise price can be given if you provide me with a detailed description of your commission. Comics are cheaper, of course, but in lower resolution per pannel and less detail overall.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that depending on demand, I\u0027ll have to close commissions sometimes in order to catch up with the ones in production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
