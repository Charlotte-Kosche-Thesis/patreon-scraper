My name is Danielle(or Dani for short), I\u0027m an amateur artist and exercise mainly digital art, but of course would like to widen my range of mediums as well as my skill. I like to mainly create my own characters, draw my friends or fanart of my favorite kpop idols or video game characters\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://img11.deviantart.net/f034/i/2017/013/2/8/draw_this_again__jonghyun_drawing__revamp__by_danichingu-dava8os.png\" style=\"width: 477px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve never had much time to focus on art, and because of moving a lot, missed the time to enter art college, and then decided that isn\u0027t exactly what I want for the next four years. I wish to one day proudly say that art is my main source of income (not necessarily on Patreon, but in general). I\u0027d like to improve my art through my own practice curve, and very specific courses (such as concept art, environments etc), but currently am far from being able to financial support myself and purchase/own all the tools needed to improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://img05.deviantart.net/7dc6/i/2013/077/4/a/fail_simple_speed_painting_practice_xd_by_danichingu-d5ygtb6.png\" style=\"width: 478px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyou guys\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and Patreon come in. I believe that my art is not good enough for me to open up commissions, I don\u0027t think I can ask people to purchase my art with a price I unfairly set. \u003cem\u003eWith patreon\u003c/em\u003e, you have the upper hand and the choice between the different support paths, as much as you can, want, or see fit.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I don\u0027t see a need or wish to fully live off Patreon, but your support and love would be most welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e**REWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE ACCORDING TO PATRONS\u0027 SUGGESTIONS**\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo where does your money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and most, it will go to upgrade and purchase the equipment I need in order to draw, sketch, and paint. I\u0027ve been using the same \"Bamboo Fun\" tablet for the past 6~7 years, it\u0027s worn out, the surface is all scratch and loses its sensitivity, more over I would like to purchase a legal version of PT SAI, Adobe products, and even hardware for my computer (that\u0027s also quite old at this point).\u003cbr\u003eOf course as an artist, I strive to improve in different mediums as well, I always wanted to try copic markers or good color pencils but couldn\u0027t afford them, with your help I will be able to consider those!\u003cbr\u003eFurther into the future I hope to use your help to pay for courses in concept art and design, animation, and game art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom Line\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I can show everyone my improvement through this page, different rewards will give you access to more \"peeks\" into my progress, weather it\u0027s progress of different pictures, sketches and WIPs, and even sneaks into my sketchbook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting the page, and a big fans to my future patrons. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img15.deviantart.net/14e5/i/2013/107/e/8/rose_by_danichingu-d6216or.png\" style=\"width: 256px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
