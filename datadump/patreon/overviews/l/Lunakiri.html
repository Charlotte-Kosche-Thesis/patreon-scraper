I don\u0027t mean help me get over it, either. No no. I mean help it flourish, help me grow as an artist, and help me become a quality artist like those amazing people out there. \u003cbr\u003eNow, let\u0027s get down to the details. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\t\u003cimg src=\"http://lunakiri.com/wp-content/uploads/p/wp.png\" style=\"height: 30px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003eThis patreon page is to help keep me out of the red. As it stands, I have enough money through my work to pay rent, get groceries, and the like, but there is no free money to play with. I can\u0027t replace things if they break, and I can\u0027t add new things that may help. It\u0027s livable, but not very fun. So this patreon page is merely to help me be able to continue to put work out there for you all to see at regular intervals. \u003cbr\u003eAnd along with that, that means my quality would improve too, making my future pieces to be far more interesting than my past pieces! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\t\u003cimg src=\"http://lunakiri.com/wp-content/uploads/p/wc.png\" style=\"height: 30px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\t\u003cimg src=\"http://lunakiri.com/wp-content/uploads/p/nudes.png\" style=\"height: 15px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003eWell, of course I mean nude \u003cstrong\u003edrawings\u003c/strong\u003e!
