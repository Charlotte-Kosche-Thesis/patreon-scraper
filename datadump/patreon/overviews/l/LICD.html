     "about": "\u003cp\u003eAt just 35 years of age, Ryan Sohmer has amassed a body of comics writing work that rivals those twice his age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2003, Sohmer created Least I Could Do, a newspaper-style strip that is published online daily at www.licd.com . The strip follows Rayne Summers, a not-so average narcissistic 20-something who is living a life that is best described as \"consequence free.\" Joining Rayne are his best friends, Noel, John, Mick, and Issa. Over the years, the cast has ballooned to include over 30 different characters, each one playing an intricate role in the life of Rayne Summers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of all this, Sohmer worked as freelance writer and columnist. His \"According To Me\" column was published in over 100 newspapers in Canada and the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeast I Could Do has enjoyed immense popularity, regularly seeing over 30 Million page views a month. Nine volumes of Least I Could Do strips have been published.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSohmer also created and writes the incredibly popular comic Looking For Group. A fantasy-comedy, Looking For Group centers around a group of warriors including the heroic Cale, and the wildly popular Richard The Undead Warlock. Looking For Group is published twice a week at www.lfgcomic.com and has been released in six hardcover collections. Looking For Group enjoys a readership of well over a million people, both online and in print.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2008 Sohmer and deSouza won a Shuster Award for their work on both Looking For Group and Least I Could Do.\u003c/p\u003e",
