    "summary": "Firstly, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e for supporting Leicester Animal rights!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLAR was established in 2012 and has since developed into a thriving community. We regularly hold demonstrations such as \u0027Cube of truth\u0027 and outreach stalls as well as many other events. We are a non hierarchical group, run by members and we have one goal- \u003cstrong\u003eAbolition of animal use\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to reach our goal we need \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e. In order to make a bigger impact in our demos we require equipment, one example of the money raised through our patreon is that we would love to have a virtual reality headset to immerse people in the reality of what animals go through as a victim of these industrys- this, among others, is a very powerful outreach tool. Any surplus of money would go towards other animal rights groups to support and help our communities \u003cstrong\u003eTHRIVE\u003c/strong\u003e through activism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we are launching a \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027buy a cup of coffee\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e for Leicester animal rights! This required you to give what you can to LAR, (i.e.. the equivalent to a cup of coffee) once a month by supporting our patreon! if\u003cstrong\u003e all our 500 members gave just \u00a31\u003c/strong\u003e we could have \u00a3500 a MONTH to work with- just imagine this impact!.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine if everyone gave a cup of coffee \u00a32.50 a month, just 63p a week\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We could make our activism, \u003cstrong\u003eEPIC\u003c/strong\u003e and this would be down to just simply the \u003cstrong\u003eequivalent\u003c/strong\u003e of buying LAR a cup of coffee!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease give what you can, every single one of us has the power to make a real impact through supporting vegan activism!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027\u0027 We have a moral obligation to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves\u0027\u0027- Earthling Ed.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
