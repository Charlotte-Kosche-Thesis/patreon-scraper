Using both traditional and digital media, I have been drawing for as long as I can remember and it is something I truly love and feel the need to do on a daily basis. I also love sharing the things I learn with others and would love the opportunity to post tutorial videos and step-by-step guides for how I create my work. For the past couple of years I have taught both drawing and Copic Marker workshops. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may know me from Supanova and Epic Diem pop culture conventions. Together with my best buddy Sarah Murray, I am one half of the dynamic duo that makes up Cherry Culture Studios and we have attended many conventions together. We are also slowly but surely working on some secret-squirrel-comic-business! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for my technical background, I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Animation from QUT University and my day job is at a high-end art retail store (all the pretty art supplies!) on the Gold Coast, Australia. I am also currently studying my Masters of Business in Strategic Advertising.\u00a0 Unfortunately studying part time and working as a casual has meant I do not get the time to practice, create and draw as much as I would like to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why, with your support through Patreon, I hope to change that and share all the goodies I make with you! Your support, either by pledging or sharing the word, will help me to cover my day-to-day expenses and get back some much needed drawing time! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
