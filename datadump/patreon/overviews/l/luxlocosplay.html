I have loved art and creating ever since I could first pick up crayons\nand paint brushes, and after growing up and developing interests in most things\ngeeky I landed on the perfect projection of my love for them and art via\ncosplay. This started for me in 2012 when I first cosplayed and attended my\nfirst convention! Since then I guess you could say I got hooked. Most of my cosplays are handmade by me but I\u0027ll also wear premade costumes sometimes too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCosplay has been an amazing way for me to\nmake both fun and intricate cosplays showing my love for video games and other fandoms,\ndesigning some of my own costumes, traveling, and meeting so many awesome\npeople and friendships through it. I hope to keep cosplaying for as long as I\ncan!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love that I can have a place to post so much extra content for those who are into that! MORE LUXLO! Also Patreon can help me to stretch and develop\nmy passion for cosplay, however far it is able to take me! Cosplay becomes extremely pricey though, and with support of\npatrons, I will be able to put pledge money towards building materials (worbla, foam, paint, fabric, wigs, contacts),\nequipment, software, photoshoots, travel cost, conventions, and more. I will be able to make\nmore cosplays, and have more content to put out both for my patreon exclusive\ncontent and all my other social media content as well! Along with more\ncosplays, I would be able to do more photoshoots, travel to more unique locations, and buy equipment that could\nhelp me put out MORE \u0026amp; NEW CONTENT! :D This would really help me have more opportunities\nwith something I love doing, and be able to share more of it with all of you.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eWhat to expect from joining my Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI have lots of ways here for my Patreon tier rewards to\nthank you for being along this cosplay journey with me and having some fun\nexclusive content that won\u2019t take away from my regular social media, but just\ngive something extra for those who want to go that extra mile to support me\nfurther! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n Expect to see more \u003cstrong\u003ebehind the scenes (BTS)\u003c/strong\u003e and\n\u003cstrong\u003ework in progress (WIP) photos\u003c/strong\u003e from my projects/conventions/photoshoots, more \u003cstrong\u003ecos-test\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0pics,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003epersonal posts\u003c/strong\u003e/selfies/etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FpJ9Ygw.jpg\" style=\"width: 281px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI post a lot to my patreon-only snapchat! :)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThese costest photos give ya the very first look at the new cosplays I\u0027m doing!
