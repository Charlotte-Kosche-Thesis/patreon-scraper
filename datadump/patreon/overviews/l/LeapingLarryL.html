If you can afford it and like the stuff you read here, $2 and $5 are other great numbers.* In fact, let\u0027s just pause a moment and appreciate their numerical beauty. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBigger numbers than those are also lovely if you happen to have developed a whopping surplus of leisure funds and/or a slight leak in the head.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll contributions are received with genuine and astounded gratitude by Unca Leapster, i.e. me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_____________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(* In the interest of fairness, I should point out that the numbers are in $US as Patreon is a US website, so you\u0027ll be charged $1US or $5US, or whatever your chosen monthly subscription rate is.\u003cbr\u003eI also like using the expression \"in the interest of fairness\" due to a running gag on the WWE\u0027s old pro wrestling TV shows which ran that whenever the company\u0027s boss, Vince McMahon, appeared on the shows and used that expression, it meant that the opposite of fairness was about to take place.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
