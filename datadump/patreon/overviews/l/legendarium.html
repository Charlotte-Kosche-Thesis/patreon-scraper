    "summary": "Hello you wonderful listeners! Craig here, making the case (the plea, really) for you to support the Legendarium. If you\u0027ve stumbled across this page, here\u0027s the rundown: The Legendarium Podcast is a podcast for fantasy and sci-fi readers. We read stuff that is having or has had a significant impact on genre literature, and we give you our take on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhat makes us different?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e We almost always have at least one person on the panel who\u0027s reading the work for the first time, so you get a fresh perspective without falling too far down any rabbit holes. The core of the group is me and Ryan (the founders) and Kenn and Todd (the regulars). We\u0027ve been podcasting together since February 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eIt takes (no) money to make (no) money\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003eFirst things first: You should know that when Ryan and I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thelegendariumpodcast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Legendarium Podcast\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0we were under \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eno delusions that we would get rich\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e off this thing. That continues today, and we aren\u0027t starting a Patreon page for the wealth or fame. HOWEVER, we \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003enever wanted to get poor from podcasting, either\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of ways to produce a podcast, and we never wanted to do it the easy way. So together we\u0027ve spent thousands (no, seriously) of dollars to make this thing as good as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWe spend for a reason\u003c/h4\u003eWe spend all that money because as long as you\u0027re going to pipe our voices through your headphones or your car speakers, we want to give you \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003ethe best audio quality we can\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. Microphones, mixers, headphones, cords, adapters, speakers, acoustic foam ... I could go on, but you get the idea: recording well doesn\u0027t come cheap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the content of the podcast itself, it\u0027s not free either. Four panelists purchasing a single book in preparation for an episode, it can run anywhere from $30-70, depending on the format of the book. Spread that over about 35 books, and you can see, the costs add up fast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I haven\u0027t even gotten to the costs of hosting our content online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e3 ways we want to get better\u003c/h4\u003eLike I said, as long as we were going to produce a podcast, we wanted to make it sound great.\u00a0So far, I think we\u0027ve done a good job there. We can do even better, but it\u0027s getting harder to justify the costs coming from our own pockets. Your patronage will help make the Legendarium better in several ways as we move forward:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll help us\u00a0acquire \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003ebetter equipment\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003ebetter software\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e to bring you the \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003ebest sound\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e we can.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll help us \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003ebook more and better guests\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e by offering a modest stipend for time and travel.
