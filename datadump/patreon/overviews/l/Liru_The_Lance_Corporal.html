    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eYou should back me on Patreon because i\u0027m the best Zeus game master for Arma 3 out there.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s a pretty bold claim to make, but I think I can officially say that now confidently. I\u0027ve seen other zeus players in different communities, though there seems to be a very large lack of understanding on what a Zeus is supposed to do. Sure, people come to play zeus players\u0027 missions, but at the end of the day, EACH AND EVERY OP IS FOR THE PLAYERBASE. That\u0027s the #1 issue I see with other Zeus game masters. As a zeus, you need to hold the playerbase\u0027s hand and understand what they\u0027re after in an experience. That\u0027s why I zeus so many different styles of missions and ops: each player is looking for something different. A good zeus can make ops and experiences for players, but a great zeus can and will actively work with their playerbase to deliver consistent yet varied ops for a variety of different players on a consistent basis. That\u0027s exactly what I do, and that\u0027s exactly why i\u0027m the best. Sure, you can go find a different zeus to back and follow them, but tell me this. How often do they get zeus content up on youtube? I try to get 2 videos up minimum a day at the VERY LEAST. How often do they stream? I stream EVERY DAY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny zeus can make an ammo cache operation to destroy, or an AO to capture and hold, but tell me, have you ever watched or played an op quite like a Liru op?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you wanna see the halo universe in Arma 3? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgLoy6CmkXs\u0026amp;t=25s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgLoy6CmkXs\u0026amp;t=25s\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWhat about Vietnam style ops? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daCAsobvJvc\u0026amp;t=1216s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daCAsobvJvc\u0026amp;t=1216...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHow about Iron Front for Germany? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q45E6LnLmc\u0026amp;t=25s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q45E6LnLmc\u0026amp;t=25s\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOr maybe the USSR on Winter Cherno? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUjbzLIzd-g\u0026amp;t\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUjbzLIzd-g\u0026amp;t\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe you want to fight ghosts? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmbsE2VBvSk\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmbsE2VBvSk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr even zombies? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCNdeJdSEqg\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCNdeJdSEqg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe you wanna do a solo spec op? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bcdnU-Rb2g\u0026amp;t=25s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bcdnU-Rb2g\u0026amp;t=25s\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr a spec op with your peers! \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTtchA37G7I\u0026amp;t=4s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTtchA37G7I\u0026amp;t=4s\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe you\u0027re a brony that likes killing Storm Troopers: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4uvMfsFSLg\u0026amp;t=25s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4uvMfsFSLg\u0026amp;t=25s\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhat about offshore platforms? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK9TSmQWrA0\u0026amp;t=19s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK9TSmQWrA0\u0026amp;t=19s\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMaybe fight on Trump\u0027s Wall? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8syJ9kIaQ\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8syJ9kIaQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr a GIANT pirate ship? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cpx3kGZS8A\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cpx3kGZS8A\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr fight Zeppelin vs Zeppelin? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzyq7TvhIE0\u0026amp;t=974s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzyq7TvhIE0\u0026amp;t=974s\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMaybe someone that can host for someone like Jester814 and be asked back every Wednesday?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6MOLrt5bxs\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6MOLrt5bxs\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of these ideas catch your eye, then you\u0027ve found the right zeus!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll always be adding to this list as I zeus more and more, but there\u0027s only so much space I have!
