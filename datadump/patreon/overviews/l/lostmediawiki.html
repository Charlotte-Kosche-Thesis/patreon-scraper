    "summary": "Hey guys, dycaite here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since The Lost Media Wiki\u0027s move and 2015 relaunch, it has been a high priority of mine to keep the site free of advertising. In the hope of being able to sustainably run the site, donation buttons were implemented on both the wiki itself and the forums, but sadly, the low amount of donations over the months (ie. a total of less than $100 - the site costs roughly $60 to run per month) has resulted several times lately in the site going down due to a lack of funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven as I type this, the wiki is down and there is not a thing I can do about it. I want to make it very clear that I am immensely grateful for each and every donation that has ever been made to the site, I truly am, but it has slowly become apparent that the current donation model we are using is simply not effective enough in raising site funds (so, inevitably, said funds almost always end up coming out of my pocket and when my finances run dry, we get into the situation the site is currently in -- which has been, I would estimate, 3 or 4 times already this year).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is for this reason that I have decided to create a Patreon account for the site, to help with running site costs. I really do not want to have to resort to putting ads on the site, but it\u0027s more and more looking like a choice between either that, or frequent periods of downtime; at the very least, I figured I would try a Patreon account before resorting to that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please, if there are any funds you can spare to help the site out, any amount at all, I would appreciate it greatly (as would all the other users of the site). Thanks for your consideration and have a great day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003e-dycaite, LMW founder"
