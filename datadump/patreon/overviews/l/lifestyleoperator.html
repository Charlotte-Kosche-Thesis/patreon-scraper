Growing up in a low income neighborhood in New Orleans would have definitely been a recipe for a cycle of poverty for most. Fortunately, I went to a high school that comprised of many teachers that were dedicated to giving the students a quality education despite the lack of resources. I also had parents that knew they had to do everything in their power to give their kids something that would provide an advantage to keep them on par with others from wealthier families. That gift was a set of encyclopedias which I read every volume over and over again. This gave me insight and knowledge on an array of topics and fostered a yearning to seek out everything the world had to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhat do you get out of this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI began writing several books over the past decade, however, I never really liked the fact of a book actually ending. In other words, I really like the idea of soap operas and long running series where the story seemed to continuously go on and on with excitement and twists and turns along the way. I began one such story that follows a single, strong-willed, young woman and her two best friends. They are all originally from New Orleans but have relocated to Las Vegas to seek better opportunities. Just a hint..If you like series like \"Insecure\" and \"Shameless\" you\u0027ll love becoming a Patron of mine! I will be writing a new chapter/episode at least once a month (sometimes more often). Also, since my mind is always so busy I will also be including podcasts and other short stories along the way. As an added bonus guess what? The book/series is untitled for right now. I WILL be asking patrons for suggested names and let my patrons vote on the final name! How cool is that! Become a Patron today!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0What if this series/book is hot garbage?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI assure you that these writings are so engaging and entertaining that I (the writer) go back and read things that I have written and am laughing and clutching my pearls as if I have never seen the words before! Just like Baskin-Robbins the first little sample is on me. I would definitely want to know what I\u0027m getting into before committing to me on a monthly basis! My first post is open to the public and is a little glimpse into my first chapter/episode. So scroll ALL the way down and go check it out!\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you loved what you just read and want to know what\u0027s next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have gotten this far down the page then many thanks already. I sincerely hope that you decide to become a Patron and fund me. For only $1 a month you can have access to all my posts, feeds and each chapter as they come out. If you want to donate more than $1 you certainly can.\u00a0 I look forward to seeing you on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
