Never one to adhere too heavily to popular trends, he attempts to create unique variations to mainstream electronic genres and provides a quirky, retro vibe to the sounds he creates. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA self-proclaimed auto-didact, he has pursued his education in electronic dance music thus far via practical application of courses provided across venues online, among them YouTube courses, tutorials provided by PointBlank Music School, and industry lectures taught via DJ Game of BusyWorksBeats and independent music tutors on Lynda.com . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHe believes music is a language of transcendent meanings that are hard to articulate verbally, not simply an artistic skill, and having learned several verbal languages in addition to English, has stated that his current goal is now to \"learn to speak Music\" and to generate moods through his work that can help those who suffer from chronic depression \u0026amp; PTSD.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong his stated personal influences and inspirations are New Order, Kraftwerk, Daft Punk, Armin Van Buuren, Puscifer, Nine Inch Nails, \u0026amp; Massive Attack.\u003c/em\u003e"

Monitors allow you to hear the sound of your music during the production process in a way that is sufficiently close to the way it will be heard at a club or an auditorium - this lets you master and equalize from home without paying multiple times per month to use a professional studio. I\u0027ve found the least expensive home studio monitors available to me at the moment and am hoping to get them by the end of June or mid-July. My own finances will be brought to bear on any of the goals I place on Patreon - your help will simply make it that much faster.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
