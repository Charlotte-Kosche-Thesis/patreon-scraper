He was laughing aloud with a gentleman whom he assumed was homeless. They noticed how everyone other than themselves were ignoring one another with blank faces, staring into their cellphones. Their ears plugged with music; ironically, all disconnected from the people right beside them. Matt thought, \u201cNo, we all have big hearts and the ability to be loving and kind.\u201d This lack of compassion and neighborly support, inspired Matthew to go home and sculpt out of clay, a robot character programmed to love. Years later, after a colourful history of large murals, sculptures, graffiti art, street art, toys and more, a love movement called the \u201cLove Invasion\u201d was spawned (see more on \u003ca href=\"http://lovebot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003elovebot.com\u003c/a\u003e). Lovebot is currently a company of six people, along side Matt. These are highly skilled best friends diligently working with many positive volunteers to build the foundation of this globally expanding Lovebot family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/UGPnzj4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UGPnzj4.gif\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLovebot has evolved into a studio of people with the intention and work ethic to better the world a little more each day. The internet is a big place for us Lovebots so we\u0027ve built a metaphorical technologically superior pirate ship to navigate it all and send reconnaissance\u00a0to our patrons. We will send you videos to inspire creativity and kindness. Through many avenues like story telling, unique large scale art murals, sculptures, community events, products/toys, paintings, children\u0027s books and more, pathways will be created to strengthen the love and intensify the light in this world.\u003cbr\u003eLovebot is a cute robot with a big heart \u0026amp; a powerful message, but we need support right now to continue with love as our strength. \u00a0As a studio our mission is to \u201cIgnite and elevate the love that exists all around us; to disrupt the complacency that keeps us from doing more of the things that inspire us. We seek to enhance lives with beauty, art and design, inspiring people to express themselves and their values with more wonder, play and love in their lives.\u201d With that said, fighting for love globally isn\u2019t easy, so we need patrons to support our voyage to shine a brighter positive light on us, humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/28fVdIG\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/28fVdIG.gif\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what we\u0027ll do with your donations: Create videos and lots of them and film the many, diverse happenings at Lovebot from the everyday antics to the professional art practices.

You (get to know?) will meet all of us, expertly profiled and then videotaped for you in our element here at Lovebot. As a patron, you will receive all things Lovebot with the behind the scenes footage, special (patreon only?)videos and pre-releases, art tutorials and more. We need the professional services of our human Nick to beautifully edit these moments for your viewing pleasure. You\u0027ll also be entered and eligible to win the LOVEBOT or LOVEBOX LOTTERY, in which the winner of a one of a kind art piece is drawn monthly.

As a patron, you will receive all things Lovebot with the behind the scenes footage, special (patreon only?)videos and pre-releases, art tutorials and more. We need the professional services of our human Nick to beautifully edit these moments for your viewing pleasure. You\u0027ll also be entered and eligible to win the LOVEBOT or LOVEBOX LOTTERY, in which the winner of a one of a kind art piece is drawn monthly. That\u2019s 12 paintings a year that go to randomly selected patrons of Lovebot here on Patreon.",
