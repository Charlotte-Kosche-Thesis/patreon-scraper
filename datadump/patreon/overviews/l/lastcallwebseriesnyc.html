    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eCreating LAST CALL has been my labor of love as an actor and writer. From writing the first outlines to shooting our first two episodes, I\u0027ve spent the last five years bring this project to life and giving creative people an opportunity to join in, from behind the camera to in front.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our biggest accomplishments happened last October when we became \nan \u0027Official Selection\u0027 and invited to premiere at the 2016 Brooklyn Web\n Fest. In addition, we received \u003cstrong\u003eFOUR\u003c/strong\u003e award nominations. \u003cstrong\u003ePREMIERE SERIES AWARD, EMERGING VOICES AWARD, MADE IN NY AWARD and AUDIENCE AWARD\u003c/strong\u003e. We were blown away and honored. Thank you Brooklyn Web Fest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand how much crowdfunding has had a huge impact on how we live our lives. We also understand we all have budgets we have to stick to and not everyone is able to give/donate large amounts of money all at once. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, give what you can. Is $10, $20 what you can swing, then we proudly and appreciatively accept it. It takes a decent amount of money for a production like ours. From \nrenting equipment, paying for locations, transportation, licensing \nmusic, post production costs, basic operating expenses, and of course \nlunch. It all adds up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at our first episode. Episode two is also available on our Youtube channel along with lots of behind-the-scenes footage you\u0027ll love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy and from all of us at LAST CALL, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Mike Dreyden\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
