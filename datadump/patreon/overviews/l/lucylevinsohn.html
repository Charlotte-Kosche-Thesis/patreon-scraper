I\u0027m a songwriter. I\u00a0have been writing songs since I can remember as a small girl sitting at the piano.\u00a0 Music has given me so much in life and it\u0027s been an interesting journey so far.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been able to tour a large portion of the United States doing what I love and meeting so many wonderful people.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have discovered me as the\u00a0lead\u00a0singer of\u00a0the Los Angeles Rock Band, EVOLOVE, or maybe you know me through an earlier project like Waiting 4 Wyatt or Lily\u0027s Siren.\u00a0 If you have somehow stumbled upon me you can check out EVOLOVE\u0027s music here: \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/evolovetheband\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/evolovetheband\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can google the other projects and see what interesting things come up :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been married\u00a011 years to one of my key musical collaborators, Billy Berman, aka the bassist and co-writer of the above listed projects.\u00a0 After a decade plus of\u00a0unforgetable musical\u00a0experiences we\u00a0are now on to a new adventure as\u00a0the proud parents of two AMAZING and CRAZY kids, Zoey\u00a0and Benny.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParenthood\u00a0has made my life more grounded, literally, as I have not toured since the birth of my first.\u00a0 I have enjoyed this detour\u00a0but it is my hopes to build this Patreon up to have the funds to tour again one day, with babies in tow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have not been on stage the\u00a0past couple years\u00a0I have kept myself involved in music,\u00a0working on film and tv placements. I managed to get a\u00a0placement in this year\u2019s film \u201cMother\u2019s Day\u201d by the late\u00a0Garry Marshall\u00a0with a quirky song called \u201cMomma Knows Best\u201d \u2026. That was a big milestone for me, a big budget film!  WHOOO!

I am finding that I get as much joy\u00a0creating music for other people as I do for my own material.  In between all of that I\u0027m writing my first Musical Comedy for\u00a0film and stage\u00a0which I plan to share with my Patrons from the ground up\u2026. Like I said, I have lots of ideas but I don\u0027t have the means to record and produce it all.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow lets get real for a second, sustaining a music career is EXPENSIVE.
