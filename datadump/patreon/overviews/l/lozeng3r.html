I don\u0027t accept random friend requests anymore because I started receiving too many invitations to play games with people every day when I was busy. This level is mainly aimed at people wanting to learn about Source Filmmaker, as i\u0027m more than happy to chat about SFM and offer my help/feedback and personal tips on how you could improve your videos, but of course this is open to anyone, so if you just want to say hi and play the occasional game of TF2, then climb aboard! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncludes all previous rewards!\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

I figure you must have a pretty good reason for being so incredibly generous, so no matter how busy I am i\u0027ll still make the effort to at least play a couple of rounds of TF2 or a match of Dota 2 with you every now and then!
