Freaks like me can\u0027t help but do what they do, and one thing is true... it is expensive to create quality, competitive musical productions, including their marketing and promotion. It\u0027s difficult to balance working a job in addition to writing and rehearsing, performing, booking, and managing myself as an independent artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic is definitely the most challenging and rewarding career path I could have ever chosen. I consider myself blessed to have any of your support in this endeavor (from participating in my Patreon journey to simply telling a friend about my music.) \u00a0I am proud of the projects and experiences I have had in my career thus far, and have been working to create new content that will help rebrand my music and image so it\u0027s not so \"genre specific,\" and rather, specific to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0would love for you to be a part of the next phase of my music career, taking us on this personal journey of development and discovery.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Laura Ivancie is seducing hearts and minds of fans with a blend of musical stylings, lyrics and vocal deliveries that are frequently breathtaking. Laura\u0027s music is inescapably soulful - a mix of many genres, including electronica, R\u0026amp;B, alt-folk and blues.\u003cbr\u003e\nMost often found wrapped around an acoustic guitar, Laura\u0027s soulful voice and captivating smile turn her performance venues into a communal living room. A Portland native, Laura has distilled the passions and travels of her life into a seemingly effortless powerful presence that is captivating and infinitely approachable.\u003cbr\u003e\nAttending college in both Southern California and Oregon, her spirit blossomed playing college basketball, fighting fires with the US Forest Service, and songwriting, while pursuing her academic program. Having acquired skills in Applied Psychology and Organizational Development, she hit the road with her guitar, immersing herself in Spanish culture in South America while working as an English teacher briefly in Buenos Aires. After graduating and returning to Portland in 2008, music became her focus - and the gift she shares with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\nLaura takes from her life experience to create songs that paint images and stir the emotions of those who listen. Growing up in a conservative catholic political family (Laura\u0027s grandfather is Mayor Frank Ivancie 1981-1985) has contributed to many of her songs.\u003cbr\u003e\nRecently her musical and energetic exploration journey is diverging a bit from her initial acoustic sound.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a solo singer-songwriter, she\u0027s released a \"live\" DVD/ CD music and video project, having made a debut performance in \"Reach Out,\" a dream-like urban anthem produced by hip hop artist My-G.\u003cbr\u003e\nHer improv vocal performances along side local DJ\u0027s and producers such as Carl Solovox and Dave Levi, push her stream of consciousness stylings in new free form directions.\u003cbr\u003e\nClose to Laura\u0027s heart, is her back up vocal work with Grammy recognized vocalist and producer Skyler Jett - and his Conscious Music for Causes inspirational organization.\u003cbr\u003e\nRecently, Laura had the honor of performing for a \"Pre-Event for Bruce Springsteen\" in the Sphere Room for the premier members of the Portland Trail Blazers at the Rose Garden.\u003cbr\u003e\nMost immediate was her first Kickstarter Fundraising Project launched Nov 2012 thru Dec 2012 where she raised over 10K to fund her debut EDM (electronic dance music) E.P., produced by herself and Keith Schreiner of Auditory Sculpture. This project acknowledges a deep affinity Laura has always had for electronic music. Being a fan of Keith Schreiner since she first heard him in 2002 with Dahlia, this E.P. Project is a dream come true. \u003cbr\u003e\nIn terms of wider exposure, Laura has performed at Portland\u0027s Waterfront Blues Festival with Reggie Houston and Janice Scroggins two consecutive years, has shared the stage with blues legend Norman Sylvester. Laura has also opened for national acts such as NBC television\u0027s \"The Voice\" finalist, Vicci Martinez, John Mayer\u0027s former guitar player, David Ryan Harris, An Horse, New Zealand\u0027s Ladi6, and most recently, the Indigo girls.   \u003cbr\u003e\nLaura was also awarded a semi-finalist award for her song \"Candy\" in the 2014 International Songwriter competition. Since Laura\u0027s first turn in the spotlight with her song, \"Little Girl\" holding the #1 spot for 3 weeks straight in the Portland Lilith Fair 2010 songwriting contest, Laura has proven she is not simply content to please her loyal fan base. This remarkable woman shows a poise and level of skill that is just begging for a larger stage. \u003cbr\u003e",
