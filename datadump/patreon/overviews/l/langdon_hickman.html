    "summary": "UPDATE 5/25: I\u0027m going to be releasing a Patreon-exclusive serial novel called VICTORIALAND as well as launching a few Patreon-exclusive tidbits later on. Anyone pledging $1 and up is eligible to receive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea behind me making a Patreon is simple: While I am still pursuing traditional publishing means for some of my work (music writing, novels, poetry, comics, short stories, essays, etc.), I would like to continue to have a conduit for releasing certain work that would be harder to publish traditionally directly to you all. I\u0027m a socialist, and I like to put my money where my mouth is; people have a right to art (corporations do not, not without payment), but I also have a right to food and shelter. This is why I encourage you, if you decide to become a patron, to pledge only $1 a month; while I would appreciate more if you are willing to give it, $1 seems more equitable to me and more fair to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current goal with this Patreon is not so much to alleviate my need for a day job (though that would be grand!) but more to cover the cost of things like soliciting artists for comics work I script, paying friends and associates to design me a proper webpage to host my work, paying server costs, etc. While my life is not inexpensive (due mostly to low-income day job and high-cost antidepressants), this Patreon is intended to focus more on upping my production capabilities in the art, writing, and criticism realms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a number of projects in the wings, both solo and collaborative: panel-by-panel annotations of comics from a literary and arrangement perspective, podcasts about metal and comics and writing and mental health and the occult, comics work, serial fiction, etc. I will continue to publish as frequently as I can, totally for free, on places like Medium; if you like that work and would like to see the more developed projects that, unfortunately, require money to develop, I encourage you to become a Patron. The money gathered here will go toward costs for those works. In return, when they become available, all Patrons will be given a discount or be given the works for free, depending on the total cost of the work itself. I also intend to be transparent with the costs of work. It is only the capitalist who obscures cost in order to secure greater profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe patronage is monthly and not per-item because I want it to be clear that this is not transactional in the traditional way: You do not get to tell me what to write and I do not get to feel entitled at any point to your support. However, posting here or contacting me on Twitter with desired work or criticism is always accepted! While I cannot guarantee you will receive what you ask for, I cannot possibly take the thoughts of you all into consideration if I don\u0027t know them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore info about coming collaborative/larger-scale projects as they become more certain!"
