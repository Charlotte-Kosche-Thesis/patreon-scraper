    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA Bit About Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0It has been almost 20 years since I picked up my first camera a Canon AE-1 and started shooting. Soon after I found myself spending many hours in a dark room learning to print and taking all the art classes I could. I was smitten with the process, the math, the science, the mystery and especially the art the medium could offer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 During this process I remember being asked by a teacher if I would, should I continue shooting, call my self an artist or a photographer. It took me a while to really understand what this meant, overall and personally. \u00a0These day\u0027s\u00a0after shooting for more than half my life, I am 100% in the artist camp. The Camera is my medium, my conduit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 What this really means is that I desire to create works that seek to question the viewers perceptions of reality, rather than document reality as it is found. \u00a0Although I have worked in other mediums photography has always been my main interest, it allows an artist to bend reality and create a believable fiction in a way few other mediums allow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Pairing this ability to bend light and reality with my love of folklore, fairytales, feminism and pagan beliefs has been the main focus of the last few years of my work. \u00a0I still feel like I have so much work to do and paths to explore and that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5237690fe4b0b1ca594cf44f/52376e16e4b05150ff030e09/52c44a06e4b00f698a1b279d/1388595727966/Photo+Dec+22%2C+4+06+24+PM+%281%29.jpg?format=500w\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Although I started out shooting film and processing my work my self, soon I no longer could afford to keep my darkroom, and sent my film out. As time went on the cost and availability of film and processing became crippling and I moved to shooting primarily digital. \u00a0The reality is I was having a hard time making the art I wanted with the money I had, and this is still true today. Even with shooting in the realm of digital, costs mount up, from upkeep of gear, to hosting costs, and even basic supplies for shoots. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0I hope to use the money you donate to maintain my current gear and potentially work film back into my work as well as afford supplies for more shoots each month. With the long term goal of having a body of work that explores the feminist connection to witchcraft and the occult in book form.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiving Back.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs patrons of my work you are enriching my day to day process and making it possible for me to create, and for this I wish to give back. \u00a0After donating through Patreon you\u2019ll receive special access to my work and my process. \u00a0 (Patreon allows for this and there\u2019s no extra signup anywhere else). I want to give people a chance to be part of what I am creating and have a tangible part of the \"magic\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll in All.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith yours and other fellow patrons\u2019 support I hope to be able to, not only continue to expand my body of work and grow as an artist but to do so with less anxiety and restriction of the cost . Without the support of all of the people who follow and believe in my work I know none of this would be possible. I\u2019m grateful to everyone who has kept me afloat and who continue to allow me to pursue my passion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
