    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHi Everyone!  Nice to see you here!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are Isabela from Brazil, Fabian from Germany and our two dogs \u201cUni\u201d from Spain and \u201cBasco\u201d from Bavaria. However, if you are here, you probably already know who we are and what we do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nOur story started\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e six years ago when we met in Barcelona. Fabian was emerging from burnout and was looking to make a life change, professionally and also for his health. He traveled to Spain where he met \u201cme,\u201d a Brazilian who had moved to Spain eight years earlier. We connected and we realized that we shared the same tastes for travelling and enjoying life to the fullest. From that moment, we began traveling together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur journey started in 2014 when we bought our first VW camper bus (a 2005 / VW Karman) that we loved so much. The need to travel full-time was growing in our mind and finally in 2017, we decided to make it a reality. We financed our EV Truck 4x4 from Bimobil EX480, rented our home in Germany, left everything behind and started our own journey as Live and Give 4x4.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLike others who have been able to quit their corporate jobs and travel the world, we feel very blessed. One of our favorite things has been to document the lifestyle we have created, to show the world the beauty of our planet. Our YouTube channel is our pride and joy, and watching everyone \u201clike\u201d our social media and being able to engage with everyone brings us so much happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing on the road for a while now, we have realized that people take interest in our life style. Everything from Isabela\u2019s cooking on the road, to our \u201cFrank the Tank\u201d rig, to Fabian\u2019s humor, the adventures of our beautiful doggies and the unique places we explore on foot and film with our Drone to the crazy places our Rig can get to! We just love it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo why are we here?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith PATREON, we are able to help and support others and get a little back for the work we are doing. We are filming every day, translating our English conversations into different languages, editing, and still want to be able to drive to really interesting spots on our planet in order to show them to you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, we make a small amount from ads on YouTube but its not enough to cover the expense of keeping it all up. A lot of people assume we are rich or that we won in the lottery (we wish, and we tried!), but if that were the case, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\u003cbr\u003eWe take care of everything ourselves and always have, but there is a lot of expenses with our video production. From camera gear, better video music, editing equipment, internet coverage to taking care of our home on wheels, everything adds up!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCreating those videos is our passion and has become a serious \u201dfull time job\u201d.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e We love it, but it is not enough to keep on going forever. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe want to inspire people to believe that this lifestyle can be a reality!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing community where we can get to know eachother. It\u2019s a collaboration where we\u2019re able to hear your opinion, comments and feedback. Together we can set goals and cheers in a meeting for those achievements. You literally become a part of our production team, our family!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe best part of this journey though, is you = the people. This is all about building a community, creating something meaningful and sharing it with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat we will show on Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour input will help us\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e show you the real life on and off the road\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.

Either way, every dollar helps and will be used for documenting this journey! There is an \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eoption to cap your monthly contribution\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e if you are concerned about a video upload spree.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are planning to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eadd a maximum of 4 videos per month charged by patreon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e which you will see before the rest of the world as a patron.The \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBONUS videos can be seen from a pledge of 5 dollars on and will not be charged extra\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Let us know in the community section here on patreon what you think and what you like to see or just enjoy the journey with us as a patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur big dream is not just to keep on documenting our travels to show YOU the world in our 4x4 truck with our 2 dogs, we also want to inspire you\u2026Make your dreams come true! \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe WANT you to be part of our journey and hope one day meet you personally on this beautiful planet and drink a coffee or a sangria together.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCheers and safe travels to you out there. We are so thankful for the people we meet on the road, the people who follow us, our friends and family and of course for our PATRONS to make this lifestyle every day possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo many thanks and welcome to Live and Give 4x4 family!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFabian , Isabela, Uni and Basco\u003cbr\u003e"
