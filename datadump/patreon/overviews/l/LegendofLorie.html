My name is LegendofLorie or just Lorie and I\u0027m on a mission to prove to everyone who joins \u003ca href=\"http://www.legendoflorie.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy broadcast on Twitch \u003c/a\u003ethat they are legendary in some way. Whether you decide to support my broadcast by becoming one of my patrons or you\u0027re just checking out some of my goals thank you for taking some time out of your day to take a peek!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e I chose to set-up Patreon because streaming and entertaining is what I do now for a living while I attempt to go back to school and be mommy to my energetic daughter and a new baby boy. This is just another way to help support my endeavors of full-time streaming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon or Subscribing on Twitch?\u003c/strong\u003e Either one is a wonderful way to support me and doing both is even better, however, if you can only do one then the choice is up to you and I\u0027ll be grateful for your support either way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow else can I support?\u003c/strong\u003e If you cannot support monetarily, then hanging out in my streams when I\u0027m live, spreading the word about the stream on social media, or following my social media and Twitch are awesome ways to show your support for my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027ve pledged and want to receive my awesome rewards! When does this happen?\"\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you so much for pledging and supporting me as a content creator! Once you have pledged then you will receive your rewards as soon as payment has gone through!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are there only two options for pledging now?\u003c/strong\u003e With the addition of subscription tiers on Twitch, I\u0027ve decided to utilize Twitch\u0027s options first and foremost before Patreon. Where I still appreciate the support here, it is easier for me to manage rewards if they were mostly on one platform. If you find yourself not wanting to pledge $50 or $100 then feel free to check out the $4.99, $9.99, and $24.99 subscription options\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.legendoflorie.com/subscriber-perks/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and consider supporting via one of those.
