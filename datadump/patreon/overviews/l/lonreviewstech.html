But I don\u0027t want to always rely on having all of my eggs in that basket!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I have the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lon.tv/store\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLon.TV Store\u003c/a\u003e to help recoup some item acquisition expenses, and why I put affiliate links in the description of most of the products I review. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now launching this Patreon - partly because all of the cool kids are doing it - but also because I\u0027ve received some notes from viewers who want to support the channel monetarily. Patreon (at the moment any way) feels like the most friction-free way to do just that. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t like asking for money so I won\u0027t be turning the YouTube channel into a telethon anytime soon, but if you feel like you\u0027re getting some value out of the content every little bit will help the channel grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also don\u0027t want to do backer-only specials as I feel this excludes people who are not able to contribute. So I think I might do more of the things the Patreon backers would like to see but make those videos accessible to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e"
