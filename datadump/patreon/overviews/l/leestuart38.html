    "summary": "First, I\u0027d like to thank you for making your way to my patreon page! I started my channel because I believe in putting out high quality content for everyone to enjoy, while going totally outside of the box of what a motorcycle vlog channel usually is. I want to give a close personal look at my riding, my bike knowledge and my life, while positively promoting the motorsport culture that I love and maybe inspire new people to take an interest and get involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do I Need Your Support?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour support will allow me to keep producing entertaining and high quality content for all of you to enjoy. Producing these videos causes broken motorcycles and camera equipment on nearly a daily basis, which can get extremely costly. Helping cover those costs will help me to produce higher quality content with better equipment, better locations, show more bike builds and feature more types of riding. From as little as a dollar a month to as much as you like, every bit helps make this channel better and allows me to make more frequent content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little About Me\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have been involved with motorsports since the age of 5. I started racing motocross and snowcross at the age of 10 and quickly rose through the ranks to the pro class. By age 15 I became a professional rider competing in the FSX world tour and other top level events, winning the FSX world championship in 2005. I retired from professional touring in 2009 and really found my love for the riding again. Since then I have been exploring all aspects of motorcycle riding, as well as working as a motorcycle mechanic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my time as a professional rider, I was able to work with many of the best film and television companies in the business and took an interest in videography. In 2015 started to put that interest to work and have been using all of my free time to learning the ins and outs of the field. My first project \"Stoke Or Broke\" was widely popular on social media and collected over 25,000 views in 2 days, which was shot on a budget of about $1000 including the purchase of cameras. I have since decided to go the route of youtube and other video hosting platforms to start putting out more frequent and high quality content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
