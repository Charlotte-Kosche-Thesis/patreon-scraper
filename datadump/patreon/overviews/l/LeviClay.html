    "summary": "Hello, one and all! If you\u0027ve taken the step to click on a link to this page, it\u0027s fair to say that I already like you quite a bit, but as you\u0027re not a captive audience yet, why don\u0027t I tell you who I am, and why I\u0027m doing this?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e7 years ago I quit working for the man. It probably wasn\u0027t the most calculated move (living in London it was essentially suicide!), but somehow over the last 7 years, I\u0027ve managed to do alright for myself. I\u0027ve completed over 1000 music/guitar transcriptions for various websites and publications and held an amazing position at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.licklibrary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLickLibrary\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.iguitarmag.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGuitar Interactive Magazine\u003c/a\u003e which has seen me released DVDs, meet my childhood heroes, and travel the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo What\u0027s Changed?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWell, in all honesty, nothing. I still love all of the people I work for and will continue to do so as long as I\u0027m required. However, in recent months I\u0027ve come to wonder if there\u0027s not more of myself I can put out there, not what someone else wants me to be, but who I am.... and I think the answer is yes!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely live for education and entertainment, but at the same time, my sense of humor doesn\u0027t always sit well with clients or advertisers. While I completely understand this, I don\u0027t want to ever find myself in a position where I\u0027m censoring what I think or feel to secure a paycheck (To be clear, this hasn\u0027t happened, but I can absolutely see it happening at some point!).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI want to be here to tell you what I think, expose scumbags, devote my time to you... but also feed my family, so to Patreon we go!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a huge fan of Patreon as a platform as it\u0027s a direct way for me to connect with you, my friends, fans, and students.

I\u0027ll pick out 3 challenges a month, a beginner, intermediate, and advanced track or video, and we\u0027ll all transcribe them.

I\u0027m incredibly lucky to be able to do as much as I already do, but I\u0027m not in it to get rich! This page isn\u0027t for me to have an ever increasing wage to retire on. While I absolutely have overheads I need to cover, I live for my work (as you can see from the time stamps on most of my transcribing videos), so once I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not going to be evicted or starve, all money I make is constantly being reinvested into making more content of better quality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThese things include, second (and even third) cameras for filming better multi angle content. Microphones for voice capture on live videos. Computer upgrades to handle the capture of so many inputs. Designers and animators to improve videos. Supporting my Amazon shopping habits (all these books add up!).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re still reading this and want to support me, then check out the perks on the right.
