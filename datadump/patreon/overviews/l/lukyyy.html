It was supposed to be a story with no intention that spoke about \"What would happen if Satoshi was alone in a Pok\u00e9mon world, like a Mystery Dungeon without turning into a Pok\u00e9mon?\". The idea could work but not the story. After watching XYZ 40 and the creation of the Genocide AU, the idea was taken up again and many stories were created. At first, the idea to create a comic was because the new Anime \"Sun\u0026amp;Moon\" didn\u0027t really hype me and, also, nobody really wrote any Fanfiction about what happened during the Team Flare Arc. The second is also, for me, an exercise for creating my own comics/projects in the future. The third reason is because I wanted to do a tribute for the Pok\u00e9mon Anime.\n\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e\n\t\t\t\tSummary of Elys\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cem\u003eWhen Satoshi wakes up, he notices the world has changed. He can understand what Pok\u00e9mon are saying and the towns and cities he knew have disappeared. Also, where are the other humans?\u003c/em\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo you remember XYZ 40? What if Satoshi was controlled at this moment? That\u0027s what makes the Genocide AU. (Idea and design created by myself and\u00a0Mari) If the Genocide AU tells what would happen if Satoshi was controlled by Fleur-de-Lys, then Elys is set in a reality post-Genocide. How does Satoshi deal with the fact that he is now in the world that Fleur-de-Lys created? So, to understand the story, you only need to watch the end of the Kalos League and the beginning of the Team Flare Arc (or rather, just XYZ 39 and 40)\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"

Actually, right now I\u0027m doing a fan comic for Pok\u00e9mon (anime). There isn\u2019t any commercial or monetary stuff involved, however; I only do it for enjoyment! Lately, times have been a bit hard for me, and I really have just wanted to keep going and live by doing what I love and am passionate about. I opened this Patreon to gain support for this very reason.\n\nI have just one dream: that one day, I can show you my own original series and make my characters come alive.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u0026lt;form\u0026gt;\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u0026lt;/form\u0026gt;\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
