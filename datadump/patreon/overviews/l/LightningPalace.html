Long story short, I owe so much to the cosplay community and to show my appreciation, I\u0027ve been running the Lightning Palace Blog over on Blogspot! Here\u0027s the link to it:\u003cbr\u003ehttps://thelightningpalace.blogspot.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of 4 years, I\u0027ve amassed a very strong following and gained recognition from many cosplayers from within the community. Aside from the INSANE talent that is within the community, I strive to provide other content like Interviews with cosplayers, Game Reviews, and experimenting with other content related to cosplay such as exclusive first looks at a cosplay as it\u0027s been debuted, guest pieces and photo journals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning this blog has really given me so much joy and I wanted to share a behind the scenes look as to what goes into my blog. I\u0027m thinking snapshots of what I view on Blogger\u0027s homepage, sneak peeks as to who I\u0027m sharing next PLUS sitting in on when I do video interviews over on Google Hangouts (if possible) \u0026lt;3.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way this will work is that my Patreon is COMPLETELY FREE! The only \"cost\" will be with a $1 tier that\u0027s mainly a tip jar. Whether you decide to or not, know that I want to grow my blog into adding much more content. Cosplay is one of the best things to have happened in my life, I want to share it\u0027s amazingness with you guys on here through my blog for as long as I run it :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you ever so much for taking a look at my Patreon!"
