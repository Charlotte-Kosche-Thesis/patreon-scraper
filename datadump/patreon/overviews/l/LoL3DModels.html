    "summary": "Hey guys - LoL 3D Models here,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emaybe some of you know me already. I upload(ed) already many 3D models from League of Legends characters on my channel. After the release of\u00a0Yasuo (13.12.2013) it wasn\u0027t possible anymore to open the newer .skn files with the Riot File Translator Plug-in in Maya. \u003cbr\u003eWith some scripts that I wrote with a friend, we are able to convert the model files into .obj files, so you can use the models now in almost any 3D model software or you can just make your own custom skins, to play characters from different games in League of Legends (watch the video).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly I had to stop my work, because I had to pay the softwares \u0026amp; other stuff, but hadn\u0027t enough money to pay it anymore every month. You guys already reached the required\u00a0mark, so I was able to reopen the channel! Thank you so much for your support!! You make this all possible!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are still always welcome to join us as a Patreon and get some cool extras for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI upload ~20 models each month:\u003cbr\u003e- 0.25$ each model:\u003cbr\u003eYou will get an additional file with the already completely rigged model, so you are instantly ready to go!\u00a0(You will never have to bind \u0026amp; set the skin weights of a model again.) \u003cbr\u003e- 0.50$ each model:\u003cbr\u003eYou can request every month a specific model that I will send ONLY YOU. You will get all regular files + .obj file (not rigged!)\u003cbr\u003e(I upload all models in reversed release date order. So if you need a very old model, you are the only one who has it for months or even years before everyone else get it.)\u003cbr\u003e"
