Because I make great art, sometimes. Because I need money. [And my sponsors don\u0027t?] Because I\u0027m ill-equipped to earn it the usual way. I hate that lifestyle, and if I could just make art all day and eat and sleep and poop I would get ~~really good~~ I *am* really good. Not the best, but I could be. So let me make art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt;WHAT WILL YOU CREATE WITH THE MONEY YOUR SPONSORS GIVE YOU?\u003cbr\u003eEnchiladas. I\u0027ll probably start with enchiladas. All things begin with a meal. Something to feed off of. When you were incubating in your mama\u0027s belly, she ate ***TONS*** of food because she had to feed you. When thoughts are incubating in my mind, they feed off the mire I call the \"compost heap,\" which is a potent blend of the loose, assorted bits and pieces I think up on the side. It\u0027s the table scaps off my day job, my dreams, the exceptionally chilly air of one monday morning at 4 AM, steeped in the mire of emotion. From this volatile compound germinates the sprouts of characters, plotlines, technology, planets, people... Some never grow big enough to take root, so they fall back into the mire and are consumed, to become more compost for the heap. Others take root and grow, joining the network of mega-concepts, or, on rare occasions, to stand alone, and form their own tree of thought. So the body runs the brain and the brain runs the mind, and my body runs on food. So we\u0027ll start with enchiladas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
