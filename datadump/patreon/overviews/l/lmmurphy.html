(The Patreon, not life or whatever. That\u2019s a bit too deep for an intro post.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u2019t familiar with my particular brand of weird, hey hi hello and call me Murphy. I\u2019m a queer, chronically ill Canadian writer and hound dog wrangler. I snark, I swear, and whenever I can grab a few minutes, I write. My usual tends to be fantasy, often in an urban or alt-world setting and typically with a hefty amount of creepy mixed in. Sometimes the stuff I write ends up a little less fantasy and a lot more horror. I\u2019ve also been known to write essays about queer stuff, chronic illness stuff, and mental health stuff, among other things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s a lot of \u003cem\u003estuff\u003c/em\u003e, is what I\u2019m saying, so if you want in on any of it, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u2019re in luck\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started this Patreon, it was as a means of supplementing a truly crappy income. However, there have been\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/long-overdue-17174443\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esome\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/things-and-stuff-17854299\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echanges\u003c/a\u003e (note: those are two separate links) in the past couple months and I should be starting a new job soon which actually pays me enough to live on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I still need to survive until that job starts paying me, and you know what? I enjoy doing this, so the plan is to keep it going. It\u2019s proven to be a solid motivator to keep me going, and I\u2019m hoping to keep things rolling and get my writing out into the world sooner rather than later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd this \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eis where you lovely folks come in\u003c/strong\u003e. Writing is how I\u2019ve wanted to make my living for a long time. Patreon makes that possible. By chipping in here, you\u2019ll get access to my writing before anybody else does, plus additional behind the scenes stuff ranging from essays to Q\u0026amp;As with me or my characters and plenty more in between. Everyone gets access to whatever the current serial story is as soon as they pledge, with the extra stuff coming in at each additional tier, and I always want to hear from patrons about what kind of stuff y\u2019all want to see, so don\u2019t be shy about getting in touch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe long and the short of it is this: You get stories, essays, rambles, and a peek into my head. I get motivation and a little extra cash. Shall we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
