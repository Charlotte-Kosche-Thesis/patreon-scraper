    "summary": "My name is Luke Stephens and I\u0027m thrilled to have you here reading through my Patreon page! I create high-quality, often long-form critiques on video games that aim to give an intellectual approach to video game analysis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow a bit about me: a few years ago I graduated from a classical charter school where I studied Latin for 3 years and where I was brought up in the ways of \"exegetical analysis.\" Now, I am studying Business Administration at Colorado State University and working full time a large electronics store where I am the Sony Home Theater \u0027\u003cem\u003eexpert\u003c/em\u003e.\u0027 I do all of this while performing in plays with local community theaters and playing an unholy number of video games. The latter necessitates long scripts of written adjacent to the gameplay and then the recording of said scripts into Premiere Pro where I edit them together with the gameplay into hour+ long critiques and analyses. Naturally, you can see how I\u0027m pressed for time. And that is where this Patreon page comes into play:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be real, money is an important part of the artistic and creative process... As unfortunate as it is, it is a reality of our world. As a result, the content that I create on my YouTube and Twitch channels becomes increasingly expensive and difficult to maintain. Time is money, and time is required for me to create the content of which I, and many of my followers, enjoy and am proud. In my current situation, I have to work 40+ hours to make end\u0027s meet. This, when paired with the other things I have to do for money and basic living expenses means that I do not have much time left over to create content for all of you. The eventual goal is to make this my full-time job so that I can devote 8+ hours a day to creating the content that I love to make. This Patreon page will help me do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can start to set aside more and more time to create more critiques, analyses, and video essays. If enough of you guys pitch in, we\u0027ll be able to go full time; I\u0027ll quit my job and I can start to build an infrastructure to support the channel independent of donations from viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it all starts with me, and you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can commit to you that I will put your contribution\u00a0towards improving the content and the efficiency of output. I will hold myself accountable to you, and that is my pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to provide entertaining, thoughtful, intriguing and bluntly honest content as frequently as possible. By becoming a patron you will be directly contributing to the growth of the channel and this community, and I will be eternally grateful. You will also get all sorts of special goodies and surprises as well as special access to Patron only rooms in our discord server!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this and even considering supporting me, it means more than you know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKind regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuke Stephens"
