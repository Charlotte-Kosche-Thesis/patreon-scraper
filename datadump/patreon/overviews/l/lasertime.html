    "summary": "Back in 2008, a handful of nerdy editors for a major gaming website had a dream: They would goof around on microphones, post absurd articles and drink on the job. And thus, the wonderfully profane podcast known as TalkRadar was born. Hundreds of hours and thousands of amazing listeners later, best pals Chris Antista, Brett Elston, Dave Rudden  and many other cool people knew they needed even more time\u2026 more LASER time\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.lasertimepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sBa5l8t.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the first episode of Laser Time went live in September 2011, we\u2019ve been doing our damnedest to give you the best podcasts ever, putting to use all the esoteric knowledge we\u0027ve collected from our press, publisher and entertainer backgrounds. We covered pop culture topics that ranged from the most expensive EVERYTHING to Japanese ape attacks to songs that fill us with shame, and who could forget the dirtiest Xmas music ever recorded and erotic fan fiction read with gusto? Despite having full-time jobs, we worked hard to make the ever-evolving show as fun as it could be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it kept growing. 2012 saw the additions of the weekly comic book show, Cape Crisis, the game music show VGMpire and the dedicated wrestling program, Cheap Popcast. In 2013 Vidjagame Apocalypse gave LT listeners a dedicated gaming show in the grand TalkRadar style. And thanks to YOU and YOUR contributions to our Patreon, we\u2019ve added two huge new shows to the roster - Talking Simpsons and Thirty Twenty Ten.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iojhLdexitc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this in addition to streams, articles, and loads of custom videos, all housed on lasertimepodcast.com. And it\u2019s all because you and your continued support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Patreon has seen its fair share of alterations since it went live in June 2015, but we\u2019re still cranking out the content and you all continue to step up and be the coolest, most responsive and patient fans of any podcast on Patreon. Our tiers and rewards have changed informally, but now we\u2019ve updated the page to more accurately reflect what it is you receive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.lasertimepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1459868_597654680293684_2075319012_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe biggest soft benefit for anyone over the $5 level is \u201csurprise\u201d content that we post in the Patreon feed. Could be game streams, extra Cheap Popcasts, bonus commentaries or even a look at new video content before anyone else sees it. We don\u2019t have a set schedule or pitch in mind, we just post it when possible / something strikes us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe arrived at this arrangement because over the past year it became clear we were making TOO MUCH STUFF. So we\u2019re down to a show a day (LT - BT - TS - T3 - VGA), streams (Mon-Tue-Wed 3pm), hangouts (once a month) and then whatever else we\u2019re able to get done. Lately that\u2019s been fun video stuff and extra articles, but who knows what it might bring in 2017!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.lasertimepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/laser-time-episode-29.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf helping us was too complex before, if you were waiting for us to do a Patreon, if you were on the fence before, now, now, NOW is the time to make this work. We have so many plans for the future - just look at all those milestones! - and you can make them come true. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo check out the different tiers of support and give whatever you can! Then tell a friend, tell your mom, and tell your worst enemy, Daryll! Let everyone know that Laser Time needs all the help it can get to become the world conquering juggernaut we want it to be! And we know we can do this together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEveryone at Laser Time!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nP.S. - We promise not to spend your money of drugs. Illegal drugs anyway...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
