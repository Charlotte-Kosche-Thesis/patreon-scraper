For the first time in her life, she feels noticed, and attractive, which ends up being far more complicated than she thought. But the more things fall apart, the closer she is to finding her true self\u00ad worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLife After Fat\u003c/em\u003e isn\u2019t about how inspiring it is to drop a lot of weight, nor is it a message for everyone to love themselves exactly as they are. Instead, it\u2019s an exploration of the changes we make and why we make them, as much as it is a statement on the oftentimes laughable madness that is being a severely confused 20-something living in a massive city.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOUNDS GREAT!
