    "summary": "Hello! It\u0027s lovely to have you visit my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome, grab your favourite nibbles, put your feet up and have a browse - there\u0027s loads of non-patron content here for you to get a feel of what I create and post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI paint and draw many things, but mainly create cloudscapes and landscapes in either soft pastels or oil paints - inspired by the stunning vistas on and above the Isle of Skye, UK. It\u0027s my aim to capture what you see \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e what you feel when you look up at a mesmerising sky, or out at a beautiful landscape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know when you look up and see the most gorgeous sunset you\u0027ve ever seen? Remember how that feels, where you were, who you were with, and most importantly, that sense of wonder at how something so amazing could just form all by itself? That\u0027s my inspirational aim: to paint pictures that combine what I see with how I feel when I see it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write blogposts after finishing each painting. Some of those form in my head whilst I\u0027m working on the picture, but mostly they arrive out of my fingers onto the keyboard just as I\u0027m reflecting on the piece. I usually derive the name of the painting from those blogposts. I publish the blogposts here and on my \u003ca href=\"http://www.lynneforrester.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way that people like yourself can gain access to art (and lots of other bits and pieces depending on which tier you select) whilst also making it possible for artists like me to carry on painting. That\u0027s my hope anyway and I love being an artist - and would love to be able to continue that way. If you choose to pledge (even $1 would be fabulous), I would be simply delighted and utterly thrilled. You can see the rewards for each level of pledging on the right of the screen - if there\u0027s anything that you think would be great then please let me know. I\u0027d be happy to incorporate anything that\u0027s workable :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading - and considering being a Patron ;0), Lynne"

     "about": "I\u0027ve been drawing and painting for as long as I can remember - it\u0027s something I love to do. My initial art training was at the Aberystwyth School of Art. Since then I\u0027ve been the lucky recipient of many words and techniques of wisdom from lots of art tutors on courses I\u0027ve attended. My professional life has been completely different, wending my way through many diverse but totally enjoyable paths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I\u0027ve gradually dedicated more of my time to producing and promoting my artwork. It\u0027s something I always wanted to do when growing up, and maybe it\u0027s time to live a little of that dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeography has influenced my artistic activities as until recently I\u0027ve lived between south-west England and the Isle of Skye. When in Scotland I\u0027m moved and inspired by the beautiful scenery - especially the views towards the outer Hebrides. In England, I focused more on the life drawings and any abstracts that arise from workshops I attend (the large swirling abstracts are drawn from people). I think each style feeds the other and for me, as long as I\u0027m creating, I\u0027m learning and hopefully becoming better at what I do. Pastels are my main medium when working from a subject, I love the way they work for me on the paper. Inks are different again; I usually work with those when creating abstract pictures from photos or an idea on a much smaller scale. I\u0027m looking forward to seeing how my artwork develops as my husband and I live on the Isle of Skye all the time now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of creating art I like to run, do yoga, watch fabulous films and books that make me think and chuckle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to see more of my work and exhibitions?
