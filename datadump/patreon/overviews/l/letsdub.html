As of right now, we are running a number of series, working with over 50 voice actors, and all editing is shouldered by Tyranee and everyone directing the other series, all currently putting in their free time to create content for the Let\u0027s Dub Project. The chance to reward them for their efforts will generate a lot more enthusiasm, which means the content we give you can be even better quality!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith financial backing,\u00a0I will also be able to afford better quality equipment, eventually a recording studio as a long term goal, and quality of these dubs will also be increased. One day, if (or should I say when) the project goes big, I will, as a REALLY long term goal, be able to quit my job and direct these full time which again, equals an increased amount of content put out. I will say this again: All of this is volunteer work right now and people are still bending over backward to help me release content because \u003cstrong\u003ethey believe in the potential of this project\u003c/strong\u003e. In short, we get things done. If there was any doubt in my mind that we would eventually be able to reach the goal of becoming a full time voice acting studio, I would not be setting up this Patreon page today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
