It features a diverse and motley cast of characters from all walks of life who come together to help rehabilitate werewolves who seek to control their animal appetites - and to protect their community from the ones who don\u0027t.

I hope to use the money graciously donated by patrons to spend more time at home producing new work, both fandom-related and personal, and to hone my skills in the process.\u003cbr\u003e"
