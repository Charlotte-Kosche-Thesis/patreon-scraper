From workshop attendances and custom creation orders to your incredibly kind words and referrals, I am constantly humbled and overwhelmed by the enthusiasm with which you greet my work.\u003cbr\u003eIt is my joy to create content and products to share with you and I\u0027m so grateful to be in a position to be financially stable throughout the creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a new fan... or an intrigued wanderer, here is a little about who I am:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jewel and I\u0027m based on the banks of the beautiful Swan River in Perth, Western Australia where I facilitate workshops and social groups. I create mythological-archetype based inspiration, using the wisdom of the ancients and the sacred cycles inherent in nature to empower individuals to move toward their best life. My most popular work focuses on the archetypal energies of the phases of the menstrual cycle. Linking your cyclic nature to the wisdom of different nature-archetypes helps you to understand your changing needs throughout your cycle, optimise your productivity and ease interactions with the people surrounding you. I also work closely with the moon cycles and seasonal cycles in my writing and I create beautiful, meaningful products such as crystal jewellery, Moon-cycle trackers, books, meditations and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
