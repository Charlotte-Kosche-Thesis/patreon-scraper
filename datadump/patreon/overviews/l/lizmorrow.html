    "summary": "For the greater part of the 7 years of my blogging career, I was supported through companies and shops who sponsored my blog. \u00a0While it compensated me for the hundreds of hours spent working on photographing, editing, writing, and doing admin work for every blog post, it also ended up resulting in me feeling like I had to keep writing a certain kind of blog, always posting to keep bringing in the pageviews so I could give my sponsors the visibility and clicks they expected, and in turn keep them coming back to support me. \u00a0In 2015 I decided I didn\u0027t want to be a part of that any more. \u00a0I wanted my blog to be free of the influence of sponsors and the pressure to create in order to keep my traffic up. \u00a0I wanted to be able to post, or not post, without guilt or obligation. \u00a0So I stopped taking any sponsorships, took my sidebar ads off my blog and returned to blogging just for me and for any readers who decided to stick around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no longer blogging as my main source of income, but I wanted to let my readers support me directly. \u00a0I\u0027d much rather accept the support of a reader who enjoyed my content enough to send a little support my way, instead of feeling beholden to companies who expect me to post in order to send them traffic. \u00a0If you\u0027ve enjoyed\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.delightfully-tacky.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDelightfully Tacky\u00a0\u003c/a\u003ein the past and/or want to support Delightfully Tacky in the present and future, I would be so grateful for your backing! \u00a0I\u0027ll also be creating special content just for patrons: various little treats such as behind the scenes videos, special discounts on items in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/lizmorrow\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy shop\u003c/a\u003e, and little freebies like downloadable resources and digital art prints!"
