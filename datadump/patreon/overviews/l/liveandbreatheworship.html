In that time I have written many worship songs and while I have be content to use them in my own church, I felt prompted to create Live and Breathe Worship and record the songs, so that others might enjoy worshiping God with them.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I about\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLive and Breathe Worship is about creating quality christian worship songs and soaking music that will help people draw closer to Jesus and deepen their experience of his amazing love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting, arranging and \nrecording a song or musical piece takes hours, so your support\n will give me the financial freedom I need to give the time required to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you receive\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to release one song or musical piece every month, so If you join the Live and breathe worship community and become a patron, for your financial support and depending on the level of support you choose, you will receive access to exclusive content such as high quality mp3 versions of each song at \"Worshiper\" reward level or get extra rewards at \"Worship musician\" reward level such as lead sheets with chords and Lyrics. Other rewards may become available as time goes on or as I get requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a secure way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. You can pay a few bucks \u003cem\u003eper month \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eper post\u003c/em\u003e that\n a creator makes.  For example, if you pay $2 per video, and the creator\n releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of \n$6 that month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly (every time \nshe releases something new), and you become a bonafide, real-life patron\n of the arts. Imagine your favorite creators \u003cem\u003emaking a living\u003c/em\u003e doing what they do best\u2026 because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
