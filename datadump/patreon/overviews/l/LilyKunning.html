    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Lily Kunning- a community herbalist in Columbus, Ohio. When I moved here in 2012, there was no large herbalism presence in the city. So I decided to make one. I started teaching classes and selling at farmer\u0027s markets. And demand grew. Demand grew to the point that I opened up a shop in 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoline Apothecary quickly became a community institution that helped many families, people with chronic issues, and local causes. Trouble was, small brick and mortar business is really hard, financially. So hard that I went for months without being able to pay myself for formulating products, teaching classes, or staffing the shop. I tried to make it work, but in the end- herbalism and profit don\u0027t often mix- and frankly, I am OK with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHerbalism is the people\u0027s medicine- and I want it to remain that way. I teach so that people are empowered to control their own health. I write for the same reason. And I keep my product\u0027s prices low so that everyone can access what they need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eColumbus still needs herbalism- heck, the world needs herbalism! And I need to find a way to meet the community\u0027s needs *and* feed my family. So I am starting now with a more sustainable model:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. I will continue to make products that folks have come to rely upon. The new brand is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://havenherbs.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHaven Herbs\u003c/a\u003e- there are three women who are worker owners of this new company- selling online and wholesale to select small businesses and coops. We believe in right livelihood, so all the ethical requirements for packaging and ingredients that I had at Boline remain in effect. And this is a worker owned cooperative work model, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Paid consultations. I am now doing wellness and herbal consultations at Preserve on Calumet and The Reiki Center.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lilykunning.wixsite.com/lilykunning\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can make an appointment here.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Teaching classes. I am a firm believer in people having the knowledge and skills to empower them to take charge of their own health. I teach classes weekly in person and online and will be expanding my offerings in this area now that I do not have to manage a shop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. A Patreon. This will allow me to do so much community organizing around herbalism:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003ea. Start a sliding scale holistic clinic. This clinic will serve the uninsured, the houseless, the immigrant populations that came into Boline (and I do not want to fall into the cracks). The clinic will also allow me to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb. Start a clinical herbalism class in Ohio. Currently, I offer a community herbalism class, but with no clinic for herbalists to do internships in, I had no way of offering more. This clinic will train Columbus\u0027 next generation of clinicians!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ec. Create an annual kids herbal day camp! Herbalism is for everyone- and we do not want to lose this important knowledge- pass it on to the next generation, starting early!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ed. Create an annual herbal conference that lasts a weekend and draws herbalism\u0027s rockstars to central Ohio. Currently, folks have to travel to Wisconsin or North Carolina (or farther!) for these events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ee. Write and publish specialty tracts, publications, videos, and webinars on topics that do not have a lot of material: trans and non-binary folks getting herbal support, people living with chronic pain and illness, and auto-immune issues, to start\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ef. Create well-edited, titled, and multi-camera educational videos on herbalism. Currently, it is very hit-or-miss with herbalism videos on YouTube. Most are hour-long, unedited, hard-to-hear classes. Better than nothing, but I want better for us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eg. The Patreon will allow me to teach more, as this community is thirsty for herbalism. I would love to start a scholarship fund for people coming from marginalized communities (new immigrants, working poor folks- especially those of color, houseless, and trans folks so they can treat their communities as well.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou reading this is super exciting to me. If you partner with me, we will help the people of Columbus have more wellness options. We will get herbalism out there as a viable alternative and compliment that many have never heard of. I truly believe that we (and the plants) can change lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI publish my herb blog here on Patreon- I intend on publishing all the exciting happenings as they happen. Partner with me to see amazing things begin to take form.\u003cbr\u003e"
