More self-indulgently, I\u0027ll also be able to purchase a toy with a cumtube (which I\u0027ve wanted for a crazy long time). If I get that, you can plan on hearing both a review of me trying it out, wet noises in audios, and you\u0027ll be making this ridiculously horny chick very, very eager to moan for you XP Everybody wins!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother incentive: if we hit this amount, I\u0027ll do a raffle for a 15-ish minute custom audio that a patron of any tier can win!",
