That\u0027s how most conversations begin. \u003cbr\u003eI am a singer. I am a songwriter. I guess I\u0027m what you\u0027d call an artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to mix genres, and I prefer songs where I can play with high notes or flirt with a country twang. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a healthy obsession with former Eastern Europe. The fallout from communism and the politics of today. I\u0027m usually reading two to three books at the time (which makes me sound very academic yet it\u0027s more a result of being forgetful) This passion slips into songs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is freedom.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s a platform for those of us who\u0027ve decided not to wait for the other shoe to drop (ie: for a \"someone\" to \"discover\" us). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the songwriter, the producer, the stylist, the roadie, the booker, the marketer, the help-desk and sometimes I sing too. It\u0027s pretty much a one woman show with some handsome men to lend a hand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of waiting for someone to invest in me, I decided to bet on myself. Best decision ever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does it mean for You to join me, as a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, begin with my deep appreciation of you, as a person and as a friend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn practice, it\u0027s basically like paying for a CD or Cassette (if you\u0027re old enough to remember these) BEFORE you can hold it in your hand. It\u0027s flowing money to making a music video or a cool gig or a new song - to a creative endeavour. Truth is, it takes Money to create something, and to do it well. Having the money \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e the product makes sure the dream will come true.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, the idea is to make you feel more included in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the difference between Patreon and crowdfunding like Kickstarter?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor a lot of crowdfunding, you gather money for a specific project. The difference here is that you support me (or any artist on Patreon) for the long run. It\u0027s about continued support. It\u0027s a way to take away power from suits and gatekeepers, and put it in the hand of the artist themselves. All a good thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth is, I think few of us makes art for having it wither away, hidden from sight. I want to make art for You to enjoy. And I want to make it with you involved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now I\u0027m about to go and do some of it. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for joining me in that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
