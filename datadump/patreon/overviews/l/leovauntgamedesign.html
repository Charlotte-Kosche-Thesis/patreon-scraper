One must\nexperience life\u2019s thrills and horrors to truly learn what it means to be\nalive!\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGreetings,\npatron! My name is Matt, also known as Leovaunt. I am a writer and game\ndesigner who loves the narrative; stories of greatness, heroism, and villainy.\nOf course, what better way to invest yourself in such tales of grandeur than\ngaming?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have dedicated\nmy time over the past few years to developing tabletop roleplaying games\ndedicated to existing intellectual properties, namely those of video games.\nCurrently, in development is my Starcraft Second Edition Roleplaying\nGame and my Fallout Roleplaying Game. Both games are in a revised version of\nthe d20 ruleset of my own creation, that takes heavy inspiration from systems\nyou might be familiar with. All of this is available for FREE on my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.leovauntgamedesign.com/\"\u003ewww.leovauntgamedesign.com\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I doing this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re\nlike me, you\u2019ve spent much of your time invested in digital universes beyond\ncount, invested in every careful action or plot by the character before you. Or\nperhaps you have woven tales around a card table surrounded by books, friends,\nand record sheets, while the fictional avatar you lovingly created has their\nlife hanging by the edge of a rattling dice ominously teetering closer and\ncloser to the table\u2019s edge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLong have\nI increasingly wanted to combine the two into a singular dimension. Video games\ncraft rich worlds with their artwork and storytelling prose, and often gives a\ncraving to live directly within that dimension. You want to have unrestrained\naccess, free from the parameters of a digital simulation. You want to talk to\nwho you want. You want to do whatever you want. You want to interact with the\nstory at a scale and depth you never could before; effect the universe you\nbattled over in a digital battlefield in more personal ways. THEIR setting, but\nYOUR story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s why\nI am doing this. To bring alive amazing settings built by brilliant creative\nminds, and pump a little extra life in them to be suited for tabletop game\nplay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eTactical and adventure based games for the ultimate adventure\nsettings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\ngames blend dynamic tactical combat and open-form character design while still\nsupporting an unrestricted narrative. The goal is to stay true to the settings\nmy settings occupy, using the lore from all aspects of the game universe,\nincluding novels and comics, rather than just the video games themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  One\nof the core concerns is introducing tactical RPG combat that feels real and\nallows for a wide variety of possible actions while being fun and engaging.\nEnemies are designed to be elaborate and full of many different actions and\npossibilities, so that each form of monster or non-player character feels\ndifferent and dynamic. This allows your enemies in combat feel different from\none another, to force adaptation to different strategies against different\nfoes. In the meantime, players have a host of different action combinations\nthey can perform on their turns. Will you aim your weapon, evade incoming\nprojectiles, deploy a tactical stance, demand your enemies surrender, or use\nthe chemical injector in your armor? All these can be performed in a single\nturn, in addition to other actions. Despite it all, the game plays quickly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  All\nthe game systems are designed to be played with a single type of dice, usually\nd20s. One single roll tells you everything you need to know about your attack,\nfrom your accuracy, to damage, to whether or not you cripple your foe. While\nthe system is different, anyone who has played d20 tactical RPGs should be able\nto pick it up quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  The\nsystems are designed as a sort of \u2018one-size fits all\u2019, meaning that everything\nin a game system is cross compatible. For example, in the Starcraft RPG, a\nmarine, a siege tank, and a battlecruiser can be used in the same encounter,\ndespite their massive difference in size and power level. There is no\nlimitation of vehicle combat, personal combat, and super-massive entities\ncombat; all can be one single fight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  One\nof the most interesting aspects of the game is the aforementioned free-form\ncharacter design. Everything your character has comes from the expenditure of\ncharacteristic points gained upon leveling up. These characteristic points can\nbe used to increase any of your attributes, skills, and purchase new traits in\nthe form of Talents. In addition, there is plenty of gear customization in the\nform of item upgrades and higher level item tiers. Your character\u2019s development will\nbe consistent and constant, with always having something new to look forward to\nin the growth of your character. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  There\nis many more features I could talk about and promote, but you should honestly\njust see it for yourself!
