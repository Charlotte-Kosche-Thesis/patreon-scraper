    "summary": "It\u0027s fantastic when you get a book and simply cannot put it down before you finish, or before your house is completely engulfed by flames because you paid too much attention to the book to realize your house was on fire. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis type of experience is what makes me want to be a writer, but I draw the line on people actually letting their houses burn. Burning a cake is fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need readers. Writing stories is great, but knowing someone actually read them and was moved by it in some way is even better. So here I am, and that\u0027s where you come in. I want you to be a reader. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, I was lying. I don\u0027t want readers. I wanna call you experimental subjects. Do you like that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want people who not only will read the stories, but will help mold them. I want to get feedback from people on what they\u0027d like to read about, and build on top of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what happens? Every month I\u0027ll send out a poll with possible storylines and you\u0027ll get to decide which one will be developed for that month. If yours is not the winner, don\u0027t worry, as it can always come back next month. And depending on how much you\u0027re pledging, you might get to suggest keywords I\u0027ll turn into storylines for our poll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to become a patron of my work, you\u0027ll receive at least one short story per month, but usually more than that. You might get more, you might get a drawing, or a picture of a cat, anything could happen. Just want to keep you guessing. I would never want our relationship to become stale, you know? I love you too much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do give most of my stories away for free.  I think everyone should be able to read them and enjoy a little mental adventure, regardless of anything else. So what I\u0027m offering here is a bit more than just the reading experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5 Ways You Can Participate\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1 - Read!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, read the stories.

There are too many ideas in my head and sometimes it may be hard to decide what people are interested in reading. So, if you\u0027re contributing to this project, you get a say on how it goes. I\u0027ll provide you with a bunch of storylines (or sometimes just keywords, to keep you extremely confused and interested), and you\u0027ll have the opportunity to choose your favorite.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3 - Be part of a story!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re contributing at a certain level, you get to be part (or have someone you love be part) of one of the stories.

Maybe you have a hilarious idea for a short story, but don\u0027t have the patience. Maybe you just ran out of ideas for a Valentine\u0027s day gift. Whatever the case may be, if you contribute at a certain level, you\u0027ll get a short story written about anything you may wish (I draw the line at some places, though, but you can read more about it in the reward boxes below), in my style of writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5 - Get some cool stuff\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis one is still under production.

I am old. Older than Time itself. I\u0027ve seen things that would make your blood curdle. I\u0027ve been places not even Life itself has gone. I\u0027ve assembled Lego structures that resemble Kim Kardashian\u0027s head. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m originally from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where I grew up reading anything I could get my hands on, be it books, newspapers, dictionaries or medicine information leaflets. I started my professional life as a journalist and then evolved into a technology-thingy type of worker. I worked at Google for eight years, doing various things I never thought I would. And then, like that, one day I woke up and realized it was about time I accepted that what I really wanted to do was write. So I put a mortgage on my cats and started a sabbatical year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now living in Dublin, Ireland, and working hard to create as much as I can, making people laugh and smile and cry. I know it\u0027s mean to make a living out of people crying, but hey, you take what you can get. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides being a journalist by trade, I\u0027m also a singer and creative writing teacher. I\u0027ve also taken too many creative writing classes where I\u0027ve got lots of praise for my creativity and voice. But since my landlord decided not to accept praises as payment, here I am. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first full-length novel is due out in the end of March, and I hope to make that available to patrons as well. For now, please enjoy a complimentary piece of flash fiction and a glass of Chardonnay. Please help yourself to the Chardonnay in your own fridge.\u003cbr\u003e"
