Your donations help us pay writers a fair fee for their work, compensate editors through stipends, and pay for our overhead costs like website hosting.

The project was founded by two historians of science, Leila A. McNeill and Anna Reser. Each month, we publish three original, researched essays about the history of science, focusing on the margins and the marginalized. Our work explores the intersections of science, technology, and medicine and how women participate in, interact with, and are impacted by these fields. We mainly focus on history, but we also cover pop culture, relevant current events, and academia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLady Science has a number of recurring expenses that we need help with in order to continue and expand the project. We\u0027re on Patreon to raise funds for our hosting and domain fees and capital for merchandise we\u0027d like to make, and to endow a scholarship for women graduate students in history of science to attend conferences. We currently syndicate our content with\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/author/ladyscienceinfogmail-com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe New Inquiry\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, which is how we pay our contributors.
