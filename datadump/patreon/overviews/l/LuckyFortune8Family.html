We\u0027ve shared tragedies like the loss of our home and triumphs like the twins\u0027 selection to represent our state and country in sport. We hope that being open about our own ups and downs on social media will make you feel less alone with your own imperfect roller coaster through life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does LuckyFortune8Family Hope To Achieve Through Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe trialled doing daily videos for over a year and found that our followers were super keen for us to continue producing daily content. Unfortunately the workload substantially increased as our channel, community, and production standards have grown. We lacked the skills and wellness required to keep delivering daily videos of a standard we\u0027re comfortable sharing, so we cut back to uploading on Saturdays \u0026amp; Sundays \u0026amp; bonus days. The obvious solution would be to follow the example of other daily family channels and outsource many production and business tasks to a support team. But we do not have the financial resources to take on regular staff at this time, although we do outsource our bookkeeping to an Australian and our art, graphic design, and animation work to contractors in the USA, UK, Canada, and elsewhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe hope to build a sufficient income through Patreon to fund a small support team. The goal of our team will be to improve and increase LuckyFortune8Family videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Did LuckyFortune8Family delete Patreon in early 2016? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe publicly shared the collapse of our family finances because we knew it would help de-stigmatise financial troubles that other families experience. We realised it was not possible for anyone to rescue us financially, so we shut down all Patreon and fan funding options to prevent people from contributing to our channel out of sympathy for our circumstances. It wasn\u0027t a matter of pride. It simply felt like the right thing to do given our followers tend to be young and soft hearted.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe feel 1st June 2017 is the right time to re-activate our Patreon account option in context of #adpocolypse. The mass advertiser boycott of Google/YouTube in recent months has badly affected the income of all YouTubers - even the super family friendly channels like ours. We\u0027re learning the importance of developing and maintaining connections with you outside of the YouTube platform, and Patreon affords us a more reliable and mutually beneficial way to connect than other social media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur past, present, and future Patrons are LuckyFortune8Family\u0027s most powerful allies. We\u0027re incredibly grateful for your support and encouragement and even the smallest $1 pledges raise our spirits and keep us going on challenging days.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
