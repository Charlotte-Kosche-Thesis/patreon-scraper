I was not sure about how to answer, so for a long time I asked that donations be made to charity or to other 2A channels who are proving great content. The emails continued to come along but more and more requested that I look into creating a Patreon for supporters and I have heeded their advice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eContent Creation\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nAs you are probably aware, creating a significant amount of 2A and gear-related content while being a full-time nurse is not easy, nor is the process without expense. While the shooting and buying gear are part of a hobby which I freely spend on, extra funding helps me to properly capture and share the experience in higher-quality with the world. Funds donated by patrons will be used to improve the quality of the content by upgrading cameras, lenses, lights, microphones, approaches, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eCore Audience\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nPatreon does look like a great way for me to remaining independent from company-based obligations, which is something that is super important to me so that I can bring you unbiased content. It also helps me to connect with my core audience (you!) who really are involved \u0026amp; interested in the same activities that I am and who ultimately are the individuals I create for. As rewards, I will look to post interesting additional content as well as feedback \u0026amp; updates on how your pledges are being used.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
