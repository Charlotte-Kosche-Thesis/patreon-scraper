I sketch, draw, paint, and illustrate and do graphic design as well as sometimes play piano and produce music. I am a multimedia artist.  I\u2019ve been creating things since I was a kid. I\u2019ve always been fascinated with cartoons and old video game art as well as posters for movies.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve studied music and art at Washington State University with amazing faculty and amazing peer groups and mentors, but never graduated.  \u003cbr\u003eThat didn\u2019t stop me though. I am still chasing my dreams seeking mentoring, fellowships, grants, participating in local art events, meeting new artists, and still learning from my old teachers.  I read, research, and learn what I can from libraries and people. \u003cbr\u003eYour contribution to this all pushes me to new heights and provides you with artwork, discounts, invitations, and thanks. possibly even food and laughter or maybe even tutelage. \u003cbr\u003e"
