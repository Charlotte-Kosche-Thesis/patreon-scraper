    "summary": "\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eA Quick Introduction\u003c/h3\u003eHi! My name is Lexy. I am a musician, producer, singer, rapper and beatboxer. I make all different kinds of music and post it on YouTube. I am a music tech geek. I enjoy puppies. And Harry Potter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always try to do something different, so I release a wide variety of content on my channel. If you like my music, and would like me to make more, please consider giving me a dollar (or however much you like) per video that I upload to YouTube! Your support means so much to me, and I love you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Real Deal\u003c/h3\u003eHere\u0027s what\u0027s up: I don\u0027t have a production team that edits my videos. I don\u0027t have a fancy studio with private booths and soundboards as big as the Eiffel Tower. I create absolutely everything myself. I conceptualize, record, mix, master, film, edit and produce all my own videos, from start to finish. There are no labels, no publishers. Everything you see is 100% me! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat This Does\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is AWESOMESAUCE. It\u0027s a site where you can help me take my music to the next level, and in exchange, I give you REALLY cool rewards! YOU decide how much you want to donate per YouTube upload. I usually release a new video about once a month, sometimes more, sometimes less because I\u0027m in college. But if you\u0027re concerned about spending too much, you can set a monthly cap on how much you\u0027re willing to spend. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can always change or cancel your pledge at any time, no fees, no restrictions. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you\u0027ve never supported me financially, watching, liking and sharing my videos and subscribing to me on YouTube is so amazing and helps me move forward musically. But if you\u0027ve been enjoying my videos and want to have a direct role in helping me make bigger and better content, please consider becoming a Patron. Anything you can give is SO helpful, and everything I\u0027ve been able to do so far is thanks to all of YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhere Your Support Goes\u003c/h3\u003eDoing everything myself can be very time consuming, and sometimes I need a helping hand. Becoming a Patron will help me hire filmmakers with smooth moves, purchase new swanky equipment, and work with producers who have been around the block a few times. This way, not only will my videos get even bigger and better looking, but I\u0027ll also be able to bring them to you on a more regular basis! With your support, I might even be able to do this full-time, go on tour and meet all of you! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You\u003c/h3\u003eALL ZE THINGS. Seriously. Scroll down to check out the rewards below! From Twitter and Facebook shoutouts to voice and beatboxing lessons, I can\u0027t thank my Patrons enough for supporting me! I\u0027m so excited to get to know you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Lexy :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome Examples of my work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Qd5WLrQBs80\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/862vnxkBN60\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/GOBo53_0yuc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Important Details: \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eNO - Pay in any currency!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0As this is US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many music videos will you release a month?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAround two (max four) videos every month.
