    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome to my \u003cstrong\u003eBRAND NEW PATREON REVAMP\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve decided to make some change to this, feeling that the first run was not the most successful. For the sake of full disclosure, I didn\u0027t feel like I knew what to give you guys and I don\u0027t think it turned out what any of us wanted it to be. So here\u0027s a new run, a fresh face, a new purpose for my Patreon. I\u0027m a writer. And by that I mean I\u0027m a struggling and often broke human trying to make the LA TV writing life work for me. That means I\u0027m often moving back and forth between projects, trying to fit writing in between odd jobs, and trying to navigate the world of information I have about what does and doesn\u0027t work when writing TV scripts or whatever I\u0027m working on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is where I will document that process. I\u0027m going to use this Patreon as a blog. About what it means for me to try and be a TV writer. I\u0027ll post whenever I\u0027m having thoughts I want to share with you, give you weekly updates on what my writing process is looking like, make note of bumps I\u0027m having in stories and talk to you guys about how to fix them. I\u0027ll be going through my process with you for the pilots I\u0027m working on, and introduce you to the things I\u0027ve learned so far in my two and a half years in Los Angeles working on TV. I will share with you my journey through different types of outlines, using cards, motivating myself on scripts I\u0027m stuck on, how I get back in touch with a story, how I figure out what is or isn\u0027t working, and what things I\u0027m using as inspiration to get there be it TV shows I like, characters that teach me something, or music that inspires me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal here is to open up this process to you guys. I am not a professional. I have not gone to school for TV. (I did go to school for writing). I am pretty young in my time in this industry. But frankly, I think that makes me uniquely qualified to talk to all of you, to show you what I\u0027m learning as I\u0027m learning it and to give you something that feels more relatable and more on par with your own experiences. It will also make me feel less like an imposter when I talk to you. I love to talk to you but I don\u0027t consider myself the end all be all of this advice. All I can do is tell you what I\u0027m doing, what works for me, and what doesn\u0027t.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely apologize to and thank all of you that had been part of my Patreon on its first incarnation. I have every intention of this being a better and more worthwhile experience for you guys and for me and I am so truly jazzed up to begin not only sharing all of this with you, but documenting and understanding my own process and what I\u0027m learning better. I truly hope you will come on that journey with me, and appreciate any and all support you can give.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis blog will be public so that all of the content is available to anyone. Supporting me financially is only a helpful bonus if that\u0027s something you want to do. The more support I have, the more time I can spend working on my craft and dedicating time to this and to all of you and our stories. Thank you for reading this, thank you for your support of all kinds, and I hope you are all having a wonderful Holiday Season,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLayne\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
