You can befriend him, seduce him, submit to him, or dominate him, or combine these approaches as you like, and as you play the game, you will learn about Lith and help him to solve his own internal conflicts. Can you and Lith find happiness together, or will you linger forever in the Void?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game is over halfway complete, but there\u0027s still much to be written, and fans always have more ideas and suggestions to expand the game than I could ever implement, but with the support of players like you, I could turn My Very Own Lith into a much better game than I\u0027d ever dared hope when I first started laying down the foundations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur \u003cstrong\u003eearly goals\u003c/strong\u003e include raising funding to start \u003cstrong\u003eadding art to the game regularly\u003c/strong\u003e, to make the first moments of the game more appealing to new players getting started and eventually to illustrate some of the most important scenes throughout the game. After that, we can see about \u003cstrong\u003ehiring on a committed writer\u003c/strong\u003e focused on expanding existing content to better reflect players\u0027 choices and preferences such as gender, species, anatomy, and dominance; to expand scenes to accommodate more of these options in the first place; and to eventually add new options to the game altogether, for more customizability. This should let us pack more treats into every update and make the game more fun and rewarding to play for the second or the fifth time!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re also hoping this support will help push the game along toward the big finish faster. With a regular income, I can cut back my work hours to make more room for the game. MVOL has been slow to update in the past, partly because I\u0027ve been so careful to only let my best writing make it in, but the schedule system I\u0027ve established has helped get a more regular flow going. If we can raise enough support, I\u0027ll push myself to \u003cstrong\u003eaccelerate this schedule\u003c/strong\u003e and devote more of my time and energy to making MVOL, and making it right, as quickly as possible. Part of that would be to push \u003cstrong\u003efrom a full release every three months to one every two months\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe other part of accelerating MVOL\u0027s schedule leads into the new rewards that can be unlocked through goals. If we can earn enough support, \u003cstrong\u003enew rewards\u003c/strong\u003e and new levels of support will be opened, including getting access to monthly \u003cstrong\u003e\"mini-updates\"\u003c/strong\u003e of the game. Those of you that just can\u0027t wait for more will get new content every month, albeit in rough draft form. And if it goes that far, I\u0027ll even open the option to get \u003cstrong\u003eInstant Updates\u003c/strong\u003e: every time I write for the game, you\u0027ll know because you\u0027ll have the rough copy in your hands!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal with this Patreon is to make MVOL into a \u003cstrong\u003erich, varied, illustrated experience\u003c/strong\u003e, and to turn it from my big hobby into my second job. Maybe, if it goes well, into my first job. I would be honored if you\u0027d support this project and help My Very Own Lith become the best game it can be, as quickly as it can be.\u003cbr\u003e"
