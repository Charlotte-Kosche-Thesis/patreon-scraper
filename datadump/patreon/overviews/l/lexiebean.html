    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHellohi. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lexie (theythemtheirs). I\u2019m a lover a words, long letters, pancakes and finding family in unexpected places. Most of my previous work includes writing / workshops / performances in collaboration with domestic violence survivors, writing for \u003cem\u003eTeen Vogue\u003c/em\u003e, and filmmaking (usually around themes of bodies / homes / queer foreshadowing). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter two successful Kickstarters to organize the self-publishing and touring of my first two anthologies, you might gather that I like projects. I decided to make a Patreon because my life has become a practice of juggling a few projects at a time, as well as developing things that are ongoing. It has been difficult staying afloat. Side-hustles (helping with wedding proposals, cleaning out storage units, banquet catering, etc.) can make for a funny story in the future, but can also be incredibly draining and literally closeted. The world is A LOT right now, and it\u2019s as important as ever to invest in what we want to exist. Alas, I\u2019m back and re-learning how to ask for help and longevity; always in awe of new ways to develop trust and intention and belittle overly-bureaucratic structures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want my content to be as freeeeee as possible, which is a tricky goal in a money-driven world where there are fees for things like performance venues, compensation for other collaborators, classes, and my basic living expenses living in Queens, New York (the most long-term home I\u2019ve had since high school). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow is a lil list of all the projects I am investing most of myself into right now, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Written-Body-Non-Binary-Survivors-Domestic/dp/1785927973/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1512669244\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=Written+on+the+Body%3A+Letters+from+Trans+and+Non-Binary+Survivors+of+Sexual+Assault+and+Domestic+Violence\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWritten on the Body\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy third anthology in which I collect letters that people write to their body parts. This one is focusing on fellow trans and nonbinary survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. So far, the project has been featured in \u003cem\u003eTeen Vogue, Huffington Post, Ms. Magazine, Bust, The Establishment, FTM Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, Logo\u2019s \u003cem\u003eNew Now Next\u003c/em\u003e, a print issue of \u003cem\u003eBitch Magazine.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eIt also took the form of a performance fall 2017 at Gibney Dance\u0027s annual \"Cracks of Light\" domestic violence showcase. The book will be published late March with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.jkp.com\"\u003eJessica Kingsley Publishers\u003c/a\u003e. Throughout 2018, I hope to co-organize events and continue the fight for trans-inclusion in the ongoing dialogue around sexualized and gender-based violence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Ship We Built\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Ship We Built\u003c/em\u003e is a manuscript-in-progress about two kids who imagine a world where they can dream, learn, grow, and be together without limits of words and empty homes. The narrator finds a safe place in their pal, D\u00f3ra. The friends give each other an uncharted strength and magic that they didn\u2019t know existed outside of their drawings. Together they build something new. The first segment of this was written in snow covered mini-van and is my first children\u0027s story, secretly made for adults too. In the process of turning it into a YA picture book, a segment of it became \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cEVwoQqgG4\"\u003ean animation\u003c/a\u003e, thanks to the brilliance of Rosalie Eck and Harry Rubin-Falcone. The short film was featured at the OUTSpoken Performance Series in Knoxville, Locomoci\u00f3n Festival de Animaci\u00f3n in Mexico City, and \u003cem\u003eStirring: A Literary Collection\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/217425210\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFull\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA short experimental documentary based off of poem I wrote and read at \u201cNarratives of Pain,\u201d and event curated by Zain Ali Shamoon at the Detroit Institute of Arts. It collages together original footage by Zachary Jamieson and home video, documenting dissociation, sexual assault, and all the times I didn\u0027t have words for myself. The film premiered at the Szczecin European Film Festival in Poland, and will soon have its second screening in Iceland. I am currently navigating other ways to share the project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat They\u0027re Made Of\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA short film following a teenage trans boy who has his period for the first time.

It\u2019s the greatest gift to make things that remind others that their own stories are also important and worthy of holding space. Thank you for reading this far and for choosing one out of the infinite ways to directly the support my imagination / work. Thank you for considering being a part of this experiment. I\u2019m excited to discover what I can share / collaborate on / produce when I\u2019m not lost in the side-hustles, and have an ongoing budget to add layers to all these things above. Plus, actually pay the heros who have animated, edited, co-created alongside me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you lovingly share a dollar a month, you give me real fuel to pay it forward.
