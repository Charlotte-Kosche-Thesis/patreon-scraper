I come from a background of extreme poverty (I\u0027ve been homeless twice!) and live with a chronic illness, so I know just how powerful hope can be when you\u0027re on a difficult journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0WHAT IS YOUR NEED?

The tumors are typically benign (if sometimes painful), but the migraines are very debilitating. I\u0027ve been dealing with them daily since I was a teenager and my health makes it very difficult for me to work a typical job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of the reason I adore writing and making youtube videos is that my schedule is flexible. I can work as much as I can when I\u0027m healthy and I have a little more safety in my timeline if I fall ill. However, both of these passions take a while to build into a livable income. Patreon is a way for fans of my work to support the work they enjoy/learn from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral times in the past, I\u0027ve had to take long breaks from making videos or writing because of intense financial stressors. When I became homeless, my biggest fear was not that we wouldn\u0027t find a home, but that I\u0027d never be able to return to writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon can help me afford to prioritize my passion and create things for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lilymeade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gifsection3.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eREWARDS:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn designing my reward tiers, \u003cem\u003eI wanted my reward levels to scale in a way that assigned a lot of value at a reasonable price point.\u003c/em\u003e You can check them out in the column on the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI priced them based upon things I like indulging in and tried my best to offer exciting perks at affordable prices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lilymeade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/patron-calendar-square-promo.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 351px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eOne of the perks I\u0027m the most excited about is also the most accessible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve designed a monthly word count tracking calendar that you can download and print as many times as you like for as many projects as you need!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s designed to help you plan and track your writing productivity no matter what you write!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part is that each level builds upon itself!

I really love that \u003cem\u003eas long as it maintains a certain goal level she allows all patrons access to most perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThis allows me the same benefits at $1 as if I had donated $25. I\u2019ve learned a lot by being her patron and I\u2019ve been able to do so for a year because it\u2019s at a price point I can afford. $1 may not seem like a lot, but she has over 700 patrons split between her $1 and $2 tiers, so I promise it adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know what it feels like to be on the other side of the fence, wanting so badly to be a part of something but not having the means to do it. That was really big problem for me in starting Patreon in the beginning. I hated the idea of holding things from people who couldn\u2019t afford it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we hit and sustain certain goal amounts, one-by-one each of the $3 through $15 perk levels unlocks for ALL PATRONS, even those who can only afford $1 a month. You can check them out in the column on the left.\u00a0Eventually, all of my lower priced tiers could be unlocked for all patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a win-win situation, because the more sustainable the income from this Patreon is, the more time I can dedicate to creating things to share with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://lilymeade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gifsection_plans.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal would to be in a position to help others the way people have helped me. I know exactly what if feels like to be entirely consumed by the impulse to create things and inspire and help others, but not be able to do anything about it because there\u0027s too many other things weighing you down. I know what it\u0027s like to cry yourself to sleep at night because you think you\u0027re never going to get out of debt. I know what it\u0027s like to sleep in a car in a Walmart parking lot, unsure if you will even be alive in a month\u0027s time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know what it\u0027s like to be at the very bottom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always want to help someone else climb up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy deepest wish for this Patreon is that it helps me pay it forward.\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
