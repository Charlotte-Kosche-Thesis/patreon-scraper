    "summary": "Everyone plays. Kids and adults. Men and women. Uptight or relaxed. Tall or short, from any place on the Earth and with any skin colour. We play with our hair and our food. We play when we tease our friends and family about their weird habits. We play videogames and boardgames. We roleplay as practice for a big interview or new job, or just for fun. Play is a natural part of being human, and even if we don\u0027t realise it we all spend at least some of the time every day playing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to capture the most fascinating, heartwarming, funny, surprising, and embarrassing stories centred around play \u2014 to celebrate all that is wonderful and diverse about how we humans, and the company we keep, play with each other and ourselves, and the things we build to enable new kinds of play. I\u0027m taking inspiration from radio shows like This American Life, 99% Invisible, Snap Judgment, A Life Well Wasted, and many more. That means episodes will be scripted and edited from interviews to tell a story \u2014 or many stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a time-intensive task, however. So I need your help if I\u0027m ever to make this show a regular, long-term thing. Your pledges will go towards production costs \u2014 I do everything myself, but I could do with better software and recording gear than I have right now \u2014 and towards living expenses. Every day I spent on the show is a day I\u0027m not earning money as a freelance writer/journalist, so your support buys me more time to spend working on Ludiphilia."
