    "summary": "my name is Luke Hazard. i publish ambient music under the moniker \"Ourson\" which i primarily self-release via Bandcamp. i also run an electronica label called Earstroke Records that i started in NYC in 2004. on top of these main two projects, i am sitting on years and years of music and art, photos, videos, collaborations, and more that needs to see the light of day. so, that\u0027s where Patreon comes in. i\u0027m using this site as a platform to launch all of the artistic endeavors i\u0027ve started, finished, and am still working on; the first of which, is...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOurson\u0027s Secret Garden Project:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eso far, this is my main inspiration for Patreon. the idea is an audience-inclusive album to be compiled as the tracks are posted throughout the year. fans who support this page will have access to totally exclusive content as well as a unique perspective on the artists creative process as this project comes together and is ultimately compiled and released for the general public (with Patreon exclusive bonuses, of course) it\u0027s my hope that this unique way to support my work will serve as an incentive for myself and my audience alike. at the moment, there are four tiers available, with various rewards. all tiers will grant access to the Secret Garden project with varying degrees of access (streaming, downloading tracks, albums). i tried to be generous with the rewards, but i\u0027m definitely open to suggestions. thank you for checking this out~!"

Occasionally, I produce electronica/idm and my old moniker, \"Plantre\", will make an appearance to show that off. I also started Earstroke Records back in 2006 as a way to get my friends music heard, and since then i\u0027ve made a lot of friends and released a lot of albums. While it is great fun, it\u0027s very difficult to make a living with it, so that\u0027s why i\u0027m trying Patreon.",
