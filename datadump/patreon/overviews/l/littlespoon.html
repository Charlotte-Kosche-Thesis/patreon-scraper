And there\u2019s a reason for that. Story teaches. Story creates empathy. Story gives voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLikewise, we can\u2019t get enough food. Americans spend an average of $8,500 a year eating out. (If you\u2019re wondering, that\u2019s two around-the-world tickets.) We like food. We\u2019re fascinated by food. And we tell stories over food and through food. We share our stories at the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYet, most people haven\u2019t experienced Italian food in Italy or dumplings in China or ceviche in Peru. Work gets in the way or money is an issue or family or health or whatever. The next thing you know, you\u2019re 86 and in a nursing home watching Jeopardy and wondering what you did with your life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u2019t want the highlights of my life to be told by Jeopardy reels, so I\u2019m pursuing my dream. I\u2019ve decided that 2017 is going to be my remote year. I\u2019m going to be a digital nomad, and I\u2019m going to write about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEvery place I travel, I\u2019m going to connect with a local and have them teach me a recipe that\u2019s dear to their culture.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m going to sit at their table and hear their stories and bring it back to you. Think of it as a cultural cookbook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake sure you subscribe to and catch up with my adventures in the \u003ca href=\"https://littlespoonbook.com/category/the-weekly/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLittle Spoon Weekly\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSo, why me?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor starters, I\u2019ve been storytelling my whole life. It started with chalk on the sidewalk and turned into writing short stories and songs. In high school, I learned visual storytelling through photography. In college, I found the principles of design. For the past ten years, I\u2019ve honed my design craft and started a \n\u003ca href=\"http://designitplease.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eboutique web agency\u003c/a\u003e. And for the past two years, I\u2019ve hosted \u003ca href=\"http://discussiondinner.club\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscussion Dinners\u003c/a\u003e here in Austin with the explicit purpose of bringing people to the table to share their story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo whether you\u2019re a foodie, a traveler, or just plain curious, this book and this trip are for you.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat the money will be used for:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCreating and delivering the rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e They all take time and money to produce!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHosting and MailChimp.\u003c/strong\u003e These virtual homes aren\u0027t free, and expenses grow as the audience grows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTravel expenses to visit the cooks.\u003c/strong\u003e Whether they\u0027re in the same city as me or a couple of hours away, I don\u0027t want transportation costs to hold me back from the best recipes and stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eContributing to food costs.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d like to offer to help the cooks pay for the food.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWriting.\u003c/strong\u003e As expected, books don\u0027t write themselves.
