    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is where I can explore things, photographically and artistically, that I do not always do as a model. It is a creative outlet, it motivates me to show new content, and it has kept me consistently practicing on my own work for about two years now. I\u0027ve been able to keep in touch with friends from different continents and countries, and I\u0027m very thankful for all of the support I\u0027ve received from so many amazing people. It\u0027s also now a place where I can display uncensored artistic nude work that I do as a model. Currently, this is the only place where you can consistently follow my uncensored modeling work as I travel and create with new people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotographically, what interests me most are emotional connections and images that are not contrived. I love simplicity, window light, and intimacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m normally nude and running about in front of the lens as an art model, but I\u0027ve also been doing self portrait work for nearly a decade. I\u0027m currently using Patreon to display my work on both sides of the camera, with an emphasis still placed on my own self portrait and photography work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also keep a sort of traveling journal with updates as well so that you can see what the life of a traveling model is like. I will include snapshots from my travels (and my little semblance of a home life) along with small anecdotes and stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther places you can find me:\u003cbr\u003e@asmallwoman on instagram\u003cbr\u003ewww.livsage.net is my professional portfolio\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also on etsy as ASmallWoman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll work here is under copyright and not to be downloaded and reposted elsewhere - including the work of the artists I post. You must contact them if you are interested in their work. It is purely for the consumption of those supporting my art and any family members or friends they gift something (such as a print) to.
