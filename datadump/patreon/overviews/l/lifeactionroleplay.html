    "summary": "When Cynthia Marie and I started our LARP podcast, Life. Action. RolePlay! we thought we were only going to be our own little chatty forum about a geeky activity that we loved that a few friends would listen to. Over time, we had our friends on the podcast and to focus our discussions, we picked a topic. One of those topics was costuming and we invited Kai as a guest. With our synergy we immediately made him a host, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we recorded more podcasts, we invited all sorts of guests, from LARP creators to content developers, to political players and storytellers from different games. We were fortunate to have the guests we had on the various subjects we hear from the LARP community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, some of our listeners have asked if there was a way where they could contribute. I admit I have a hard time asking for this kind of help, but I have a personal rule that I follow: When three people who don\u0027t know each other suggest you do something, it\u0027s worth following. The thing they all suggested was \"start a Patreon!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve created this page in good faith, not knowing what to expect, but deeply appreciative to all our listeners for even considering it. We will always to keep coming up with more content, more guests for our little podcast that could, \"Live. Action. RolePlay!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Ryan Omega\u003cbr\u003eHost and Producer"
