    "summary": "The Little Metal Dog Show has been running since April 2010, and since that launch has grown into one of the most popular podcasts around when it comes to the world of board and card games. If you can play it on your tabletop, we\u0027ll generally cover it. The show looks to speak to people who have a story to tell about their games, whether it\u0027s a designer who\u0027s been in the industry for years who is still delighted to talk about their creations or a first timer who wants to bring their new game to a wider audience. I strive to provide a show with high quality content that, while informative, is also accessible, relaxed and friendly. Even if an interviewee may not immediately strike you as someone you want to hear, I like to think that everyone deserves their chance to be heard - and my fantastic listeners seem to agree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will I use my Patrons\u0027 support? Well, doing all this costs money, of course. Not a huge amount, but it\u0027s a significant chunk when the annual renewal bills come around. I\u0027d also love to upgrade my rather shoddy equipment - using a USB mic from my old Rock Band setup really isn\u0027t cutting edge technology! I\u0027d also love to get to visit more conventions and move into doing more video stuff, but for now... well, it\u0027s just good that people listen. Keep doing that, it\u0027s lovely :D"

The Little Metal Dog Show has been running since April 2010 and strives to bring you the stories behind the games that people love to play. Whether it\u0027s someone entirely new to the industry who is looking to bring their first game to market or an established name who has been around for years, I believe that everyone has something interesting to say; they just need a platform to say it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, with hundreds of interviews recorded and a whole bunch of game reviews written on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://littlemetaldog.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLittleMetalDog.com\u003c/a\u003e site, we\u0027re still looking for people who want to tell their story, and with the world of games growing every day, there\u0027s always going to be new folks to talk to.
