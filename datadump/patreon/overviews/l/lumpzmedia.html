This website is admin\u0027d by myself and David Kirby, a renowned author who\u0027s work has appeared on Forbes and Huffington Post, as well as an avid gamer with a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://castleroid.com/blog/gaming-101-a-beginners-guide-to-collecting-for-the-playstation-2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehuge crush on the PS2\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs for myself, I started my own YouTube channel way back in 2013 with no aspirations to start a website. Shortly after, I started writing video game reviews and walkthroughs for various retro games from my childhood, but didn\u0027t like the majority of the big websites that were available for publication. Wanting to avoid a soul-crushing editorial process from a corporate peon that may or may not have an ulterior agenda, I started a Blogger page and thus, the foundation for Lumpz Media was born.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe pride ourselves on:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eActively avoiding corporate sponsorship.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eHaving complete control over our content.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePainstakingly conducting deep dive research to give you the best content possible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBuilding a fun and educational resource for gamers, by gamers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNot employing spammy website practices like pop-ups, autoplay videos, or aggressive ad placements.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nLong story short, you\u0027ll never have to endure an AdBlocker nag screen, long load times, or nonsense product placements/endorsements at Lumpz Media. We\u0027d rather empower, educate, and entertain our visitors rather than annoy them with ads because we feel the same Hell-spawned hatred when we encounter these online abominations ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eSo Why Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWebsite Costs\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLuckily for us, our website maintenance costs are minimal (~$100/year) due to our design choices.
