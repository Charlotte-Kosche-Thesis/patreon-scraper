My dream is to enable myself to find work within the gaming industry specifically, while being able to do my freelance work on the side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to my background in vocal training, I\u0027ve had opportunities to get involved with voice acting, working with notable people within the gaming industry such as Solid Audio Works, and have a game release in 2018 where I play a titular character, and have also lent my voice to phone apps and short films.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started cosplaying in 2010, with my first convention being Auchinawa 2010, and have just recently began to make my cosplays from scratch. Although I don\u0027t want to compete in cosplay competitions or become a seamstress, cosplaying has enabled me to network within the gaming industry and is a fantastic way to promote myself, as well as a great way to have fun and share my love for all things nerdy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may know, working in the creative industries is hard work, especially when it comes to making a living from it. I\u0027m still at the beginning stages, and so pledges would enable me to expand my career and career opportunities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently moved to Glasgow, in Scotland, to be closer to family and friends, but that meant leaving my old job. I am currently unemployed and so I lack the funds I\u0027d normally have to put into my freelance work. Pledges would allow me to gain that funding again, and expand on what I did in the past and can do in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking time out of your day to visit my Patreon page, and a big thank you to those who wish to pledge to my work.
