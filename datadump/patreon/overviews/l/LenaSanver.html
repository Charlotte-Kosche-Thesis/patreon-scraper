Yes that\u0027s right, I\u0027ve always have had a hard time to decide what I want to do so I just do it all. If my work is good? Erm, I do sell some of my artworks from time to time and sometimes my landscape shots, and I have had a couple of exhibitions. And people say I\u0027m good but that might be because they are nice...\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When it comes to me writing fairytales I\u0027m a noob. Not that I haven\u0027t been writing storys since day one, or at least as soon as I learned how to write, but I \u00a0have really never had the guts to let anyone read them. I have decided to change this and that is one of the reasons I\u0027m at Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe other reason is such a boring thing as money. I simply need more money so I can buy the material that I need for growing as a creator. As it is now I can\u0027t use any of the money I earn on anything above the necessities *sigh*. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The truth is maybe out there but the truth for me here and now is that I need help in a lot of different ways and I hope I will find some of \u00a0it here at Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027m writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0a short fairytale for kids in the age of 8-14. The story is about Eldon the wood fairy boy from the In-Between-Land who falls asleep under a cinnamon bun berry bush only to wake up in The Kingdom of Fairytales. Or more precise in Bertie the gardeners garden. The adventure seems to be a simple one, it\u0027s all about how to get Eldon back to his village in the In-Between-Land. But nothing is simple while dealing with Squadron 511....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I will make\u003c/strong\u003e 8-10 illustrations for the book. One of the illustrations that I already made is the one that I partly have as cover here at Patreon. It shows Ivan, Frankie, Ben and Ken four out of five members of Squadron 511. Tony the seagull is missing in the image since he was at a training camp to learn how to fly like an eagle. Yes I know, but Tony always believe he can do anything and there are no way to tell him he can\u0027t. \u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you will learn much more about Eldon, Bertie and Squadron 511 and all the other characters that try to bring Eldon back home. Maybe you will have some fun on the way from half finished to finished fairytale. I know that I will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
