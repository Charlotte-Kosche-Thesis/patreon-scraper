Upon landing in New Orleans in early 2011, I became convinced that I could re-invent and re-invigorate my entire life by painting.  \u003cbr\u003e\nIt was extremely difficult at first to both pay bills and find enough leftover to eat, but I was determined and I made it happen.  I carefully studied technique out of art periodicals at Barnes \u0026amp; Noble bookstore as part of my education.  The other way I have managed to grow was to paint as many pieces as I could, mostly as live demonstrations in public, favoring speed and drawing accuracy over a polished end product.\u003cbr\u003e\nI am inspired by every place I have traveled to, and have tried all genre of traditional oil and acrylic painting, yet I still am drawn to the power of portraiture, so I want to paint large-scale contemporary figurative works (36\"x36\" or larger) of New Orleans artists, writers \u0026amp; musicians within their homes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage helps me to afford the time away from local markets and related material costs to focus on painting more important and relevant subjects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy subjects so far are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusicians Abby and Glori Cosio of the band Bon Bon Vivant\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.reverbnation.com/bonbonvivant\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eReverb Nation\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriter and Director Brian Paul Brightdawn\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Brian-Paul-Brightdawn/e/B014C6K4H6\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmazon Book Link\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotographer Josh Hailey \u0026amp; Painter Brittany Schall\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.photoamerica.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
