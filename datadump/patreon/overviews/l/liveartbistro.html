Our hard work nurtures and supports countless artists in their journeys and our approach is to provide the space for people to express their freedoms in all forms. Apparently, we are really terrible at writing funding applications, so the income we generate comes directly from the efforts of our labour. We are a not for profit organisation and we put every penny made back into the continued growth of what we do. We have setup this Patreon to enable us to further our goals in supporting artists to create the work they want to make and also so that we can begin to create unique digital content that becomes an extension of our creative output and it able to reach wider audiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur patrons will also be helping with the day to day running costs\u00a0of our venue and which will free up funding to allow us to continue to support Live Art from the UK and beyond. We have been operating on a shoe string budget, unfunded for over\u00a03 years in our venue on Regent Street and it has only been with the continued support of the community that supports us that we have been able to have a consistent programme of touring work come through our venue. All Patreon subscribers will be\u00a0invited to our \u003cstrong\u003eannual Patreon party\u003c/strong\u003e as a\u00a0thank you and there will be\u00a0rewards\u00a0for different levels of contribution.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have exciting plans to help get the word out about what we do and to support and promote the artists that come to LAB. See our goals for what your money will help support. \u003cbr\u003eWe are constantly looking for new ways to support the live art sector and we will be adding goals to our Patreon page throughout the year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for supporting Live Art Bistro.\u003c/strong\u003e"
