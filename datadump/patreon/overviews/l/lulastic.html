I\u0027ve been creating stuff on Lulastic.co.uk for seven years and support through Patreon is helping me realise some seriously huge dreams!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron you will give me the room I need to create more resources that build a fairer, kinder world for children, and to make more films about treading gently on this beautiful earth. \u00a0I am SO passionate about these two things, I have a huge, bubbling energy to create them, but they don\u0027t really make any money. It\u0027s depressing, but as the primary breadwinner for our family of four, it makes it hard to prioritise these dreams. YOU will make this happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision is for a parenting website and book and workshops delivered to communities that can\u0027t afford to host fancy parenting gurus. And I would love to spend more time creating beautiful films about loving the earth. With freedom from advertising and sponsors and creating resources for other organisations, I can focus on bringing these dreams to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll find my Patreon bursting with goodies including three mini-series on Happy Homes, Wellness and Journalling, a chapbook of poetry, an ebook download, a 2018 calendar and livestreams! I hope you enjoy being part of this community as much as I do :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - You can pledge in any currency using Paypal. There is a paypal fee of 20p per transaction, but it is less than the credit card fee.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200968585-Payments\"\u003eFor more payment questions please see this page.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
