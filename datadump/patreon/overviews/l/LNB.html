I had no motivation, I didn\u0027t want to talk to people and I remember not wanting to look at my phone in fear that someone might actually desire or require my attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually I realized that instead of working for someone else, I needed to try and create something for myself, something I could spend a lot of energy on and feel passionate about. Being a nerd and rather introverted I realized that I could use my passion for gaming, and it was a sheer stroke of luck that my younger brother one day randomly suggests that I should try making a build guide for PoE - and so I did. If he hadn\u0027t said that, I am not sure I would have realized the opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward 2 years and here we are. I am today making my living of my work on YouTube and Twitch, and it is still pretty damn amazing. I am immensely grateful for the opportunities that has been given to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledging \u0026amp; Patronage\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIf you are one of those extra generous people who wishes to show support for the content I create, then you can do it here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to pledge 1$ a month, then that is great! If you wish to pledge more, then that is amazing too. I appreciate it regardless of the amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople who pledge more than 5$ a month will be able to request direct build advice for Path of Exile, if they wish to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it is important to mention that none of my videos or content is gated behind a pay wall, and so it isn\u0027t necessary to pay for anything.\u003cbr\u003eAlso I want you to know that if you\u00a0ever do become a patron, but later decide to stop, then no hard feelings. I fully understand, sometimes the budget is tight and in those situations I would much rather prefer that you take care of your own needs rather than mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou becoming a Patreon, means you are an integral part of keeping it possible for me to keep doing this whole YouTube and Twitch thing. Your support means a lot to me and you have my sincere gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest\u003cbr\u003eKristian\u003cbr\u003e"
