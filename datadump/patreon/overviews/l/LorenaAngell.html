I\u2019m Lorena\nAngell, author of \n\t\u003cem\u003eThe Unaltered\u003c/em\u003e, a 5-book young adult fantasy/sci-fi series set\nin modern day--a J. K. Rowling meets Steven King kind of read.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Unaltered series has achieved some pretty awesome stats\nsince 2011 when book one, \n\t\u003cem\u003eA Diamond in My\nPocket\u003c/em\u003e, was released. With five books in the series, and nearly 300,000 downloads worldwide, many of the books have reached\nnumber one on Amazon charts in multiple countries. Apple\u2019s iTunes iBookstore\nnamed \n\t\u003cem\u003eA Diamond in My Pocket\u003c/em\u003e a\nBreakout Book in 2013, and in 2015 the series was picked up by Hollywood\nproducers who are currently optioning the series for film and television.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is so cool, I have to stop and\npinch myself sometimes. Being able to catch the attention of Hollywood without a big name\npublisher backing my series is pretty incredible. You see, I\u2019m an Indie author. What is an Indie Author? Someone\nwho self-publishes their work through online outlets like Amazon,\nBarnes\u0026amp;Noble, Smashwords, CreateSpace, etc.  Indie authors, like me, don\u2019t make money till\nreaders buy the book, whereas traditionally published authors get an advance of\nmoney upfront to fund their work. Indie authors fund their own writing journey\nand it can run in the tens of thousands of dollars. I have a side\njob to supplement my writing income, but this cuts into my available time to\nwrite more books, which is what I\u2019d really love to be doing.\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon.
