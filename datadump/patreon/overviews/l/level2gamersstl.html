Hi. How are you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Patreon page for the Level 2 Gamers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we, and what do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Level 2 Gamers are two content creators from St Louis, MO. One child-like ball of hyper activity named Keegan, and one weird accented and slightly grumpy adult named Tom. We focus mostly on the world of gaming, but also dip our toes into the wider nerd culture at large.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe play mostly double-A tier games ($10-30) to help you decide if they\u0027re worth parting with your hard earned money, but also, do narrated reviews on similar content from the wider world of entertainment. Weekly, we have a vidcast that gets churned out to all podcast platforms as audio too, alongside delving\u00a0deep into the world of the virtual with our VR segments, and to top it all off we have random surprise videos about anything from Pokemon hunting to video editing techniques.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I support you, what do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll proceeds gathered here go to supporting Level 2. That means, better equipment, better on-location filming (conventions, etc), game and entertainment purchases and the widening of scope for our channel. So basically better and more diverse content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Legion member and Patreon supporter, this means everything from social media shout outs, joining us on live streams, choosing podcast topics or games for bytes or review, convention meet ups and on screen time for vlogs, getting to sponsor videos or even potentially becoming a part of them. Keegan and Tom also have their own unique talents, and higher tier subscribers will potentially be able to schedule time with them to discuss things like editing, writing, or general YouTube techniques.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting us is by no means an obligation. We will be keeping our content free and readily available to anyone that wants it - on YouTube and Podcast providers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, supporting us in any way, even if it\u0027s just a dollar a month, will help us considerably in making our dreams come true, and providing the best possible quality content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to hear us out - we love you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Keegan + Tom (Level 2 Gamers)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
