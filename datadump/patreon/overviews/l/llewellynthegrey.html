    "summary": "Hey, Llewellyn the Grey here. I am an artist with concentrations in painting, drawing, acting, directing, writing, as well as dabbling in modeling. Right now I am just getting started with working at doing this professionally.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney that I receive from patrons will go toward canvas and paint as well as other supply upkeep, upgrades that will help me with uploading the art to the page with more improved quality, and being able to get equipment for video projects and other productions that I am planning for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I am creating something I get this feeling that I don\u0027t fully know how to describe. The closest I can come to it is that I feel a oneness, not with nature, but with life. I am incredibly grateful that there is a way for me to be able to support my creative habits thanks to all of the great patrons out there who love my work. It is truly a blessing to be able to make a living doing something that I love. I hope that you enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor the Present:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment, I will be posting a new piece of content for patrons and releasing a post to the public once a week, approximately 4 times a month. Patrons who contribute $1 per month get the weekly post the week before it is released to other patrons. Those who contribute $10 or more can expect to see a post detailing my progress on one of my projects twice a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be posting links to my blog posts on the first of each month. These will immediately be open to the public. These blog posts range on observations and critiques on various aspects of the way in which our modern society runs, observations on different mediums of art and storytelling, as well as reviews and think pieces on various existing pieces of art. There also may be personal logs thrown in from time to time. Feel free to follow my blog directly if these topics interest you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Now that Photography Phebruary is over, patrons can expect the first Patron post of each month to be Phirst Photo Monday. Only one from each set will be made public and then only a month after the last of that set is finished being released, so there will be one less public post happening on most months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the Near Future:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently in the works for a partnership with another Patreon user that I have worked with in the past and will work with again in the future. There will be bonus content released for people who contribute to both of us. Details will be announced and displayed on my page once the details are finalized, so make sure to check in for details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the next short while I will be updating my page fairly often, adding and adjusting Rewards and Goals, so keep checking back to see what there is to offer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be working on an intro video that I hope to release\u00a0 at some point when life is a little less hectic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComing soon, I will begin production on the first in a YouTube series. This will be decided in the polls for the $5 tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Offers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will be taking commissions as well. These will vary in prices depending on the medium, cost of supplies, and the complexity of the process. I will be working on some special projects that will be public and will show examples of my work. More details about commissions will be provided as that aspect is prepared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I have enough income on here, I plan on making an online store to sell some of the paintings I create or using a site in which I am able to sell them. As of right now I can be contacted through messaging on here if you see something that you like (availability for sell will be designated in descriptions) until I am making enough to sustain a store of some sort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have experience editing and am willing to edit writing. The cost will be based on how many pages need to be edited."
