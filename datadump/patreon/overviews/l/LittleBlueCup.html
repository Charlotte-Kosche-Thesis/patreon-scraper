    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for coming to take a look at my Patreon page.  I have some really big plans for the future and I\u2019d like you to be a part of it all.  Not just a \u2018patron\u2019 but, hopefully, a friend.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou know about the #CupForBen thing right?\u003c/strong\u003e If not Google it or check my early YouTube videos on my Channel. Life went a bit crazy for a while and accidentally gave me massive inspiration, found me tons of new friends and helped give my son Ben something he desperately needed for the rest of his life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA simple Tweet I sent went viral and I was trending in dozens of countries and had news organisations chasing for interviews.\u003c/strong\u003e For a while #CupForBen took over my life. I carefully guided my interviews round to discussing real issues and bigger stuff - unpaid family carers, disability and Autism. I made a video, and then another, they too got a lot of attention so I made more. My plans developed, I was trying my best to use this minor fame to help carers. I was guiding the conversation and making a small difference. I know this because people were telling me. \"Make more videos\", \"please don\u0027t stop\" and plenty of \"thank you\" messages made me realise I could help people just by sitting in front of my iPhone and talking. Now what if I actually put some time and effort into it and made something of quality? Maybe that could really help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLittleBlueCup was born.\u003c/strong\u003e The website is being readied, the YouTube channel and the Twitter following is growing. There are Facebook pages for a few different parts of the project like the main /LittleBlueCup page which is helping parents find cups, toys and other items for their children with special needs and /AutismFriendlyProject which shares places that are making an effort to be \u0027Autism Friendly\u0027.  Most excitingly is a media project that starts with the YouTube channel, and I\u2019m working with a production company to grow it into something far bigger.  This is about Autism, this is about challenging the perception of Autism and helping people to learn more about it.  \u003cstrong\u003eThis is about changing the conversation, and I believe nothing like this exists already.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to make videos for parents and carers about a huge range of things\u003c/strong\u003e - stuff they may find useful: how to apply for this or that support; what to do when something happens; coping strategies; relaxation techniques; interviews with other parents and carers; interviews with professionals and MPs; even some funny stories to brighten the day. I\u0027m being told this stuff is helping others. Being able to sit and watch a short video with a cuppa when you get a spare 5 minutes seems to be a popular idea, preferable to reading even more documents and pages.  I want to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe project will make the most enormous differences in the tiniest of ways.\u003c/strong\u003e But I need a bit more help to make it the success it needs to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have started this Patreon campaign because I am determined to not only continue with the videos, but to develop the bigger project and make it successful and helpful to as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need to invest in some equipment and it will need to be maintained. I will need to pay some people for their time, and their skills. I get a lot of support for free, but I can\u0027t expect that forever and I\u0027m going to have to get some help with things like graphics, music, animation\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little help to do good stuff would be really amazing. The videos may not look demanding, but it\u0027s not easy, they take time to work out, film and then edit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you decide you want to help out I have some little rewards for you.\u003c/strong\u003e  They are not the most amazing things ever, I\u0027m going to try and improve them over time and if you are still a supporter when I change a reward you will get all the new extra benefits too, of course. The rewards are mostly to bring you and me together so we can talk, share, and I can say \u0027thanks\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI really want my \u2018Friends\u2019 to be part of this project, fully involved - sharing, communicating, watching video updates, helping me out with stuff as I go along.\u003c/strong\u003e The videos won\u0027t just be for Parents and Carers, there will be other stuff too, but it\u0027s important to know the focus for me is Carers, learning disabilities, special needs, Autism, mental health (I talk openly about my own mental health struggles), and my life with my weird and amazing family. Oh, and a good laugh - I struggle to be serious for more than about 4 minutes at a time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has helped many people to develop what they do.  It\u0027s potentially a way to help me give great things to the people out there who really need it. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is a way for you to help others through me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
