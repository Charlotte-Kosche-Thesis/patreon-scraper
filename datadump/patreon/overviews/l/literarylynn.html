Writer, Reader, Activist and an advocate for increasing marginalized voices in publishing and the media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last ten years I\u0027ve been working in the publishing and journalism fields specializing in speculative fiction and journalism about culture, travel and history. My work has been published in magazines such as GQ Magazine, Fodor\u0027s Travel, Conde Nast Traveler, Ebony Magazine, and the JSTOR Daily blog to name a few. I also spent several years as a freelance editor and literary agent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently graduated from San Francisco State University with an MFA in Creative Writing and the completed first draft of my speculative fiction novel \u0027Welcome to Wonderland\u0027, based on the mythology of my favorite city in the world, New Orleans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the real work begins! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt seems the most difficult part of being an artist is figuring out how to pay your bills while your art is still in progress. This is made even more complicated if, like me, you have physical disabilities that make finding traditional work difficult. That is why I\u0027ve created this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I will:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEdit, polish and prepare my speculative fiction novel \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://wonderlandnovel.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWonderland\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 for publication.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue collecting submissions for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://footstepsofbaldwin.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFootsteps of Baldwin anthology\u003c/a\u003e, a project that I began in 2015, which showcases the voices of African American expatriate writers living in Paris.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComplete, edit and publish more of my fantastical short stories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Begin the process of creating a nonprofit that helps increase diversity in the publishing industry.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, you can help me create art! To learn more about me and see some examples of my work, check out my \u003ca\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. Also, check out the cool perks I have available for contributors.
