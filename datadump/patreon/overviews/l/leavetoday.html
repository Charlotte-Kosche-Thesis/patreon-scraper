    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are Kat and Chris, and we are plotting our escape! A clich\u00e9 once said, you\u0027ll never look back on life and wish you had worked more, had more days in the office, basked in more florescent light.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, what is the alternative? Quit our day jobs? Reformat our lives to travel full time? Why not?! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLong before we met, both of us were stricken by an insatiable wanderlust that not even modern medical science could find a cure for. We lived out our localized lives with a longing pulling at the threads of our daily routines. We learned to cope. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe met on an adventure. Fell in love across a trail of six cities, and swore to each other that we would never be satisfied with a sedentary, stationary life. Kids, day jobs, car payments, et cetera have a way of holding you fast to one spot. We managed; taking vacations\u00a0or at least\u00a0the scenic route home whenever we could, but it was never enough. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen one day, we decided enough was enough. We couldn\u0027t wait anymore. We needed to roam. When we started to research, we found a few sites or YouTube videos, but nothing to guide our first foot-falls on our path toward making our dream a reality. So we decided to create it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLeave Today is our attempt to create a compendium of resources on becoming a full time wandernaut. Join us! \n\u003cbr\u003e"
