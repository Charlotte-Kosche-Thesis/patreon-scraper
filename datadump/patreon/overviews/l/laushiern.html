Google(Alphabet) is an online and mobile advertising company. They own Android, Google Search and Youtube. \u003cbr\u003e2. Google has been growing earnings at 30% a year. Google is taking away market share from TV and newspaper advertising side very strongly. The main driver behind this is because in the last 5 years, consumers/housholds worldwide have suffered great financial difficulties. Wages were stagnant, bank saving interest rates were very low and housing prices are up which all puts a squeeze on consumers/households. Many households went into debt to get housing and essential stuffs. As such, on the entertainment side, households responded by choosing cheaper products like the Internet and mobile phone to replace many things. The reason is because it is more expensive to get entertainment, news, movies, games, shopping etc in the physical world via cinemas, restaurants, magazine subscribtion, Paid TV, sports, meet ups, parties, shopping malls etc as compare to getting it in one place = Internet. Thus Google is a growth company and should be valued based on PE ratio.\u003cbr\u003e3. The current forward PE of Google is 27 times and the EPS growth is roughly 30%+. At this rate, Google is cheap. But if the financial markets correct within a year, you may be able to get Google at a lower price which is even better. \u003cbr\u003e4. Practical Value Rating = 5, Buy, Cheap Growth Play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron you agree that all information provided is only for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice or recommendations of any form.
