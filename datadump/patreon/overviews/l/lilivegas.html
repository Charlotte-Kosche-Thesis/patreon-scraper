    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCodename Q\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am creating a unique digital gaming engine and platform. The purpose is to unfold aspects of the truth from a spiritual, rather than worldly perspective, through the medium of a fun, engaging and ultimately enlightening digital game. I call it \"embedded truthiness\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game engine levels, scenarios and rules will be developed based upon insights provided by members of the Truth Support Network. The format will be typical of an adventure game, with a story line, levels, challenges, environments, characters, powers, etc., the premise being, \"the truth is stranger than fiction\". With the help of the Truth Support Network, my sincere hope is that through this game play, we can reach and engage many people of all ages and both overtly and subliminally, \"wake up\" humanity to a new way of thinking and perceiving their lives and the world in which we live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the Patron challenge. If you are a member of Truth Support Network, you can contribute by subscribing at a contribution level that fits the magnitude of your interest in directly influencing specific areas of game play. There is an assumption here: if you are a Truth Support Network member, you are likely engaged in an ongoing unfolding of discovering and sharing truth. Therefore, as a subscribed member, you will have access to continuously providing insight and content to the game developers so the game itself continues to evolve in parallel with the evolvement of the Truth Support Network itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the levels of engagement that are currently available:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$5/month - Seeker: \u00a0You are a truth seeker and wish to contribute to support the creation of the game. You are interested in playing the game, and potentially contributing as a beta tester and giving feedback about your own insights and intuitions during game play\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$15/month - Contributor: You have insights you wish to contribute directly to the essence of the game. You will have access to a forum where your contributions will be reviewed and potentially encoded into various game features\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$50/month - Guru: You will have direct influence on the guidance provided to game players during their game play. You will have the opportunity to create story and lesson scenarios.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$100/month - Creator:\u00a0You will directly influence the portions of the game that are of specific interest to you. This could be developing fundamental rules, laws of physics, levels and characters that demonstrate the truths that are known to, or are unfolding for you. At this level, I would anticipate that you would, in turn, be learning from data and analytics we collect from the players and iteratively applying this knowledge back into the game play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$500/month - Manifest Character: You become personified in the game as your own character. You receive all of the benefits of the other levels, as well as having an individual personality and physical manifestation inside the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy become a Manifest Character? If you are a member of the Truth Support Network, and you already have an active following, here is an opportunity for your followers/supporters to \"sponsor\" your character, through your own Patreon page. Those proceeds can then support your monthly Manifest Character subscription. Thus, you become personified in the game play, giving you yet another powerful medium through which you can share your manifest truth. \u00a0This also gives your followers a means to help you spread the truth to our game participants, who may not otherwise stumble into your current channels or who may be more susceptible to absorbing truth, in subtle, and perhaps not so subtle ways, through game play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
