I\u0027m an artist who is currently studying at the University of Georgia, pursuing my BFA in Drawing. Ever since I could hold a marker and scribble on paper (or walls), I have had a drive to create. All of my illustrations are painted with watercolor and gouache, which can create some magical scenes! My passion is to illustrate the lives of animals through wildlife scenes and stories. I\u0027m a learner and constantly absorb new information, either about new species, anatomy details, animal \u003cbr\u003elifestyles, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img02.deviantart.net/b424/i/2016/322/6/e/ensnaring_fangs_by_redwall151-daoujsu.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support my Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows art enthusiasts to support creators on a monthly basis, gaining specific rewards for different amounts of support. The support can be ongoing or just run the length of the month. With your support, I will have time to start new, larger illustration projects! I would like to eventually run art raffles and give art tutorials. Every amount of support helps and makes me forever grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pre10.deviantart.net/2efe/th/pre/f/2016/334/c/1/c1df71eb5fe7007f7f04772af28666d9-daq47zp.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my social media platforms will still provide all of the same free content, but my Patreon is a way for me to connect with and personally thank and reward my supporters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Supporters Receive\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, supporters have the option of a range of rewards, starting at $1+! This is a fun and interactive way to support my art and also receive some great rewards! I\u0027m a big fan of physical mail, so most of my rewards involve a fun envelope in the mail!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupport does not have to continue after the month is up, but any continual support is welcome and appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTheme of the Month\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery month will have a theme to guide the art made!

When do you receive rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach patron is charged at the beginning of each cycle, usually on the 1st or 2nd day of the month. Cards are usually charged around the 5th of the month. Mailed rewards will all be sent in the very beginning of the following month after pledging (to ensure all transactions have been processed). If you pledge after the 5th of the month, do not fret! You will just receive the rewards as if you pledged the next month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am always happy to hear feedback or comments from you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
