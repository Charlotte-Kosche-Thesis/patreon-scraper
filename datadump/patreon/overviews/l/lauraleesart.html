    "summary": "Hello! Laura Lee here. Thanks so much for taking the time to check out my page today. \u00a0I am a mixed media artist, predominantly working with acrylic and ink, based out of Winnipeg\u2019s St. Boniface neighbourhood. Much of my work and imagination has been beautifully inspired by exposure to diverse techniques, styles, and materials encountered through extensive travel to over 30 countries around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeeing artwork being created in ways that I could have never have fathomed has blown my mind wide open. Lack of supplies does not suppress people\u2019s artistic passion to create. On the contrary, they are creating masterpieces with the resources that surround them. It\u0027s just so inspiring!! The most beautiful origami bugs being made of grass! Baskets being woven from garbage! Jewellery made of seeds and nuts...Clay, silk, sand, grasses, \u0026amp; wools! Bringing a new life and lustre into those found objects brings me such great joy. So much inspiration is all around us to be creating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support I have experienced from fellow street artists and random strangers who happen to walk by my work has helped me realize that no one should ever hold back on their gift. Everyone has a gift and that\u2019s what we should be pursuing in our lives, if everyone lived their passions the world would be filled with happy people, less conflict and more love. All I want is to make people smile\u2026 To make them think about what is going on in the world around them. The world has enough cruelty, fear, darkness and despair. I want to place a piece of love and light into people\u0027s homes that spark their emotions, make them smile, inspire them in a positive light even in the most subtle of ways. I paint for the pure enjoyment of the process, to satisfy my artistic passion and, most importantly, to spread love. \u00a0So this is why I have created this page (with the help of my love, of course) cause we have decided that this is what I should be doing full time (well anytime in between chasing and snuggling my two little ones). Cause it fills our home with such warmth. Seeing my children and husband every morning when they see the piece I have been working on all night, their faces and reactions \"Wooooow mama dis painting soooo coollll! I lub dis one!l\". Getting emails and PMs from people from all over the world telling me how seeing these pieces come to life brings them such joy. My patrons enable me to continue creating art full time while being able to support my little (Giant) family.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many projects on the go, and I would be forever grateful if you would choose to support me in whatever way you can. Thanks again for stopping by and have a beautiful day!\u003cbr\u003e"
