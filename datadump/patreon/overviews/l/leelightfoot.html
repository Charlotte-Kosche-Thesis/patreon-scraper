    "summary": "Thanks for dropping in and thanks to any of you out there who are already patrons helping to create Black Ship Books!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lee Lightfoot. I draw comics, write comics and write about story in popular culture for Black Ship Books, which I set up with the writer, editor and journalist Evan Henry:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.blackshipbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Ship Books\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began reading Marvel Comics back in the eighties and later painted 32 pages of what would eventually become Dead Lucky, a submission for Dark Horse back in 2003. This didn\u0027t succeed so I went on to write Gia Giantess and finally, a graphic novel bereavement memoir for a PhD in the last couple of years. But now I want to share my ideas on story with a bigger audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m inviting you to join the crew! What is your reward? Ultimately, to help run and build a comics imprint with a growing collective of creators. Decide on the big creative decisions and contribute to polls on the best creative directions to move in. Help us all to move through the goals so that we can eventually distribute multiple artists\u0027 creative visions through Diamond to comic stores and bookshops worldwide. Also:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Post on the general feed and make suggestions such as writers for our comic anthologies, subjects for my future videos, subjects for Black Ship articles, or classic comic covers you think would be good to inspire me for a video on cover art?\u003cbr\u003e-Want some free comic art?\u003cbr\u003e-Comics premiered here first on Patreon in digital form?\u003cbr\u003e-Access to my patron-only video feed?\u003cbr\u003e-Your name in all of the video end credits?\u003cbr\u003e-Notes/scans of my \"in progress\" art, stories,\u00a0art-books and video lecture notes?\u003cbr\u003e-Want to see general posts on my comics work before anyone else AND hear about what art I am working on before anyone else (official Marvel or Star Wars licenses etc)? \u003cbr\u003e-Art available for sale to patrons before anyone else in the world sees it?\u003cbr\u003e-Art discounts on absolutely all my art, comics and sketch cards?\u003cbr\u003e-Input from me into your own stories?\u003cbr\u003e-You personally appear in the Black Ship Universe?\u003cbr\u003e-A Lee Lightfoot cover for your own comic?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron you also become a part of the Black Ship community. You are part of that exclusive community of readers, writers, artists and story fans who help to build the Black Ship narrative world. We are aiming to build a universe of mainly mature reader stories that are a little edgy or offbeat. Personally, I am also aiming with this campaign to enable myself and others to become better writers and artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other purpose of my Patreon is to facilitate weekly production of pages, as comics are so time-intensive and therefore money-consuming,\u00a0while at the same time bringing more readers and writers on board. And as you will see from the end of my intro video, there are plenty of stories to work on!\u00a0 By becoming a patron, you will not only get access to the thoughts and decisions behind these stories and art but also influence those decisions in a positive way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the campaign is a success up to the level of the stretch goals then that will also mean paid work for other creators...creators you yourselves as patrons might suggest to me along the way...or that creator might in fact be you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
