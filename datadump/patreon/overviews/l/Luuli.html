    "summary": "if you are reading this you probably know what i do already.. im a struggling artist in many ways. mentally, financially, socially, medically, culturally. i wish i really could express just how huge of a help its been so far just to have a little bit of support i have on here from generous people who believe in me and want to help ease this struggle. You are not required to donate any amount and i will keep doing my best to create no matter what cuz its the only thing ive ever really been good at or followed through on. \u00a0even just a dollar a month is a huge help and it ads up :) thanks in advance.. But before we conclude this i need to point out that this is not just about supporting me in my struggles.. I have some really special inventions and exhibits and installations i plan on creating once certain goals are reached. Public performance art, social experiments, gallery installations, inventions, and free albums if i can reach a certain level where I no longer need to charge for any of my music :) thats what i want i want to change the dynamic of art from a charge based transaction to a giving based one .. you give support i give art give give give .. rather than i make art i hold it ransom because if i didnt nobody would pay.. thats not healthy i want to be part of a giving based dynamic with you this isnt about me just taking your support this is about investing in me so i can give you back things that only i can give special and unique things\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eand i promise once i hit some of these support goals you will be delighted at what i can share back :) it will help once i can show you proof more than words that what im working on now.\u00a0"

I have been living a neo-nomadic life for several years now i currently live out of my car that was gifted to me. \u00a0In search of freedom. \u00a0Im a transgender woman and ive found it extremely difficult finding a way to appropriately support my needs in a culture where image is very important in regards to employment. Without an address or stable job history and with an unusual appearance ive been consistently rejected for all jobs ive applied for most never even call back. I used to do audio for movies but cant afford the equipment needed to do that work. Ihave \u00a0a college degree in multimedia design that is obsolete now. Im hoping to be able to finally devote my life to my work..I need to create to survive and i need to survive to create .",
