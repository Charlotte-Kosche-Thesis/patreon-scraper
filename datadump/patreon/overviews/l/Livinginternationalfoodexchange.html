If 30% of the population is learning the skill of growing food and using an infrastructure that is universal then we can take care of each other.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 We want to make it so that anyone with any kind of space no matter how small can be apart of the Exchange.\u00a0 We have a variety of plant systems already designed, but if we encounter a space that needs to be customized, we have the abilities to do so at no extra cost.\u00a0 We will do this in order for us to reach our goal.\u00a0 You have the ability to assist us in that journey.\u00a0 So Welcome to L.I.F.E."
