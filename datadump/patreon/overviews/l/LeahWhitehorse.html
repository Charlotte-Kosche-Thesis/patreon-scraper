    "summary": "Hello everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Leah Whitehorse and I\u0027m an astrologer and writer. Thank you so much for visiting my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you know me from my Monday to Friday postings on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LuaAstrology\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e which I call \u003cstrong\u003eThe Cosmic Tides\u003c/strong\u003e. Some of you may know me from my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.leahwhitehorse.com/\"\u003eLua Astrology\u003c/a\u003e or from my forecast writing for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mountainastrologer.com/tma/\"\u003eThe Mountain Astrologer\u003c/a\u003e magazine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a well known, established platform which allows people to support creators of all kinds through monthly contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT AM I CREATING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing The Cosmic Tides since 2012, each day posting a piece of writing inspired by the major transit of the day along with a public domain painting to illustrate the daily energies. Each posting takes around an hour to meditate upon, write and schedule, sometimes longer. Over these past five years, I have organically grown a following of around 13,000 people on Facebook as well as other readers on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thecosmictides.wordpress.com\"\u003eCosmic Tides wordpress site\u003c/a\u003e. Recently, I have also created an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thecosmictides.wordpress.com/the-cosmic-tides-oracle/\"\u003eoracle\u003c/a\u003e from the original daily postings. Some people use my posts as a creative springboard, some for contemplation and some relate to the words through synchronicity. I feel privileged to be followed by so many and joyful that people find my posts helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with the cosmic tides, I write about the Full and New Moon\u0027s each month, send out a weekly newsletter to subscribers, post a monthly forecast and also write other articles for my blog on all aspects of astrology. The extra cherry on top is that I\u0027m also writing a book - The Compendium of Asteroids!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I AM LOOKING FOR SUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially, I would like to raise enough support per month to re-instate writing the Cosmic Tides weekend posts. I used to post every day of the year but as my client base expanded it became impossible to continue doing this. But I miss the weekend posts and I know many of you do too! With your support, I can limit my some new client work to dedicate time to writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs writing reaches far more people than one-to-one readings, in time, I hope to be able to replace client work with writing and educational material on all aspects of astrology, tarot and spirituality. For current clients, don\u0027t panic! I will continue to work with you all for the foreseeable future :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO PATRONS RECEIVE IN RETURN FOR SUPPORTING ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your support, you get access to patron only posts and updates that no one else receives. Patron only posts will be mostly centred around current transits. Check out the reward tiers on the right to see which level suits you or you can set your own monthly contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany Blessings to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
