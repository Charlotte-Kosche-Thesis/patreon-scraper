    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my Patreon. I am an Amazon best-selling author of Gay Romance planning to expand into other letters of the LGBT spectrum as the muse and time permits. I\u0027ve written seventeen books and plan to write many more. (Stop by my website to check them out:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://letablake.wordpress.com)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://letablake.com)\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created this account with many goals, including the hope of one day being able to give up my day job on the strength of my writing. Though I love my day job in many ways, it has become very precarious due to my employer\u0027s ill health. I\u0027m concerned my position may even disappear entirely this year. I want to do everything in my power to replace any lost income from that job with writing-powered income. I believe in my writing and I believe in my readers.\u00a0I have many exciting things to offer a dedicated reader, such as access to unfinished drafts, discussion and story collaboration, deleted scenes, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, after several releases that performed well critically but not financially, as detailed in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://letablake.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/important-information-regarding-the-90s-coming-of-age-series-pictures-of-you-you-are-not-me/ \"\u003ea blog post on my website\u003c/a\u003e, it\u0027s become necessary to revise my release plans. I\u0027m grateful to have the option of Patreon to allow us to achieve these goals together. Please check out the goals section to the left to find out some of the things we\u0027re working towards funding this year and next!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn setting up this platform, I\u0027ve chosen to do the \"per month\" option in order to free us up to have fun together and not depend solely on delivery of a particular book or audiobook. However, I want to make sure that every time you act as my patron you\u0027re getting something you value in return. Always feel free to change your pledge up and down as you see fit. Always feel free to message me with suggestions and requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a patron is not the only way that you will have access to my books. Every book I write will eventually be available for purchase on traditional platforms. This is a way to have early access, behind-the-scenes information, see rough drafts and get a closer view of what goes into creating the books you love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you in advance from the bottom of my heart for your active support of me as a writer and a person. Together I hope we have a lot of fun and I hope to write a lot of enjoyable romance! Thank you for your help in doing that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, since this is my first time attempting something like this, I\u0027m grateful for any grace you extend as I get it all figured out and make adjustments. Thank you!"
