Initially designed to cater to the \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Smash Brothers\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0franchise, I expanded him to many other features. Floofy has all sorts of features, such as a fully functional \u003cem\u003emusic\u003c/em\u003e system, in-depth \u003cem\u003emoderation\u003c/em\u003e commands, an \u003cem\u003eeconomy\u003c/em\u003e system, \u003cem\u003egambling\u003c/em\u003e system, and much more. You may see for yourself by joining the following\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/0yUWR2OBEc62vtFU\"\u003eDiscord link\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nTo run Floof Bot requires monthly expenditure. That kind of spending I cannot afford on my own, unfortunately, so any and all help is beyond appreciated. I am currently unemployed and studying full-time at a university, so keeping Floofy alive is a draining project in both time and money, but I still enjoy it nonetheless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003eSome other things I do:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eFloof bot also runs on another project I am a developer for, called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome\"\u003eDiscord.js\u003c/a\u003e, which makes it easier for many people to create bots.\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I play a game competitively - as in, I aim to make money from it.
