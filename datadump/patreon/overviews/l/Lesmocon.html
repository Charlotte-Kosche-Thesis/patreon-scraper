    "summary": "Hey there, my name is Matt Leslie. Some of you might know me as \"Lesmo\" but you are objectively wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m starting a Patreon as I\u0027ve been making short films for Youtube for about three years now for essentially no money, and since 2015 is when they started to be actually good I felt now would be good timing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy friend James interviewed me for about half an hour regarding my work, its future and this Patreon which you can watch here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sI1xTdBV6JE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to describe my videos as most of them are completely different to the ones around them. Basically they\u0027re about games, I\u0027m not sure \"review\" is an appropriate term but I\u0027m sure some would choose to use it. Some are tongue-in-cheek \"look at this weird thing\", others are a commentary on some aspect of game culture and there are some hard in-depth critical pieces as well. In general, the philosophy of these videos is to engage with the subject in earnest, and hopefully come out of the other side with something to say after a fun ride. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe channel also hosts a series called \"Nathan Ruins\", which involves my friend Nathan engaging with games earnestly in a very different and somewhat ignorant way. They\u0027re edited mini-LP compilations which document a hardened aggressive live long \"gamer\" jerk (me) and his attempts to communicate with someone who doesn\u0027t know anything. It\u0027s just getting started but it\u0027s quite fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Need Your Support\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe key word is \"stability\", it would be nice to work on longer form videos for literally 10s of hours knowing that I\u0027m not completely wasting my time and not having to worry about where the rent money will come from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving an income from Patreon supporting me will allow me to focus on my work while still paying the bills. It\u0027s hard to say how many new videos I will release a month since they vary in length and obviously a 15 minute video takes a lot more work than an 8 minute video, but a new Nathan Ruins is released every Friday and I aim to get at least one Lesmocon review/feature out a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me will also allow me to purchase games for both shows (and any other video ideas I might get). Finding games for Nathan Ruins is difficult as Nathan is also poor and we both have to own the game to play it online since he lives in Australia. Also I have ideas for other projects that I can\u0027t start right now, such as a critical miniseries looking into the Uncharted games, but I need the Remastered collection to do it but can\u0027t afford it right now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eANY\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0support is hugely appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions best to @ me on Twitter @Lesmocon\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
