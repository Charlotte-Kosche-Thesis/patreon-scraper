I want to take a moment to say thank you for stopping by and supporting this dream. If you are a supporter, THANK YOU!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began making costumes about 15 years ago, when I realized that I couldn\u0027t find exactly what I wanted anywhere. I started creating my own, and back then I was not very good at it. Now, I\u0027ve got a lot more practice and experience under my belt, and I am pleased and proud to say that my clients seem to genuinely love my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support this page, you are supporting dreamers and strugglers. People who push giant rocks uphill in the hopes that they\u0027ll reach the top someday. People who want nothing more than to succeed at doing something they love with every breath. For me, you are supporting every day spend working until two am to get a seam \"just right\", or adding that last stitch of embroidery to give a garment extra flare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again. :)"
