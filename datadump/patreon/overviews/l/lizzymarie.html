    "summary": "As an artist by heart but also as a single mother I have had to become quite resourceful with making my own home d\u00e9cor, organizing my house on a budget, being my own handyman and cooking healthy meals for my family. I created this space to share with you all the money saving hacks, tips and tricks I have learned in order to be able to pursue my passions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last year I became interested in learning how to work with wood and chalk paint to make a variety of DIY projects. It felt amazing and empowering to be able to take a piece of wood or furniture and transform it into what I wanted.  This led me to opening up my business and Etsy store Sparrow Artisan Designs. However it wasn\u2019t a quick and easy journey. I spent endless hours on youtube watching DIY videos, reading blogs and researching what tools I would need and where to get all the supplies I needed to make my projects. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e I became very creative in finding all the little hacks, tips and tricks I could to spend as little as possible while still being able to create the projects that I wanted. \u003cbr\u003e I really wished that there had been one source I could have learned everything that it had taken me so much time to learn. And that was when I realized...I could do that. I could create one source for all of you who want to learn how make your own projects but have no idea where to start, what supplies you actually need and where to get them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have taken out the guess work for you and will be teaching you from where I started and showing you that it doesn\u2019t have to be costly or overwhelming to make a lot of these DIY projects once you have the right tools and information. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin me as I walk you through how you can get started on making your home d\u00e9cor visions come to life. And since I also happen to love cooking I will also be sharing with you many of my own delicious original meal plans and recipes that are adult and kid approved.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
