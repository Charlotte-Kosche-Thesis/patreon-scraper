    "summary": "Greetings and salutations.\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my page and enjoy your stay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Malaena Medford (muh-lay-nuh, if you\u0027re tripping over that), and I\u0027m also called Lycantis. I\u0027m a female \"werewolf\" living in America at present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe condition I have as a werewolf, often called \"werewolf syndrome\", is also known as hypertrichosis or hirsutism, with excessive hair growth being the most notable feature. I\u0027m just like everybody else. I like long walks on the beach, listening to everything from classical to metal, and snacking on the occasional human or two.\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003eI have this delightful condition called porphyria; a specific kind which makes me violently allergic to light with both skin and nervous system problems.\u00a0Yes, the sun is trying to kill me. *hisses and retreats into the darkness*\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hyper-flexible because of a condition called Ehlers-Danlos hypermobility syndrome, like those dudes squeezing through a tennis racket. Problem is, this is a connective tissue deficiency, so my bones just kind of float around whenever they want with chronic dislocations and pain. Makes for a great party trick at times, but loose joints and ligaments make life really difficult, and as a result, I use forearm crutches to walk.\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003eThe EDS comes with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS or dysautonomia), where the blood vessels don\u0027t behave. When I stand, my blood pools in my legs and doesn\u0027t return to my heart or brain. Nuff said.\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003eMost people are familiar with autism, but not as much with the type I have, Asperger\u0027s syndrome. It\u0027s a highly functional form. I still don\u0027t know how to human, and adulting is hard. I literally had to take classes on how to act like a human being. The only time I can handle crowds is when I\u0027m on stage, hilariously.\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003eBecause of my conditions, I started attending Kaplan University, now Purdue University Global, then adopted the Ketogenic lifestyle. I lost 125 lbs (57 kg), reversed multiple diseases (not the above ones, they\u0027re incurable genetic mutations), and my broken self is more manageable now that I can actually reach my toes.\u00a0My dive into the world of science came about after a near-death experience where I lost a large portion of blood volume and felt mortality in the form of excruciating pain from my intestines rupturing before I lost consciousness, then I woke to exhaustion from the blood loss and terror knowing I was nearly on my deathbed in that moment. This is what my scholarly articles will be on, with access to the supporting evidence for anyone who is curious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy I\u0027m here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI became a part of Patreon because it\u0027s a creator-based platform with opportunities to find people interested in the things I am interested in and who have that desire to read and look at my work. I strive to improve my craft, welcome feedback from those who love this wonderful trade I am a part of, and wish to please fans from all walks of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write fiction as well as some scholarly works, and I\u0027m a professional illustrator and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ecurrently \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eunpublished\u00a0American mangaka, or Japanese-style comic artist. My entire soul goes into my work, and is my passion ever since I could hold a crayon (which didn\u0027t amuse my mother when she had to wash it off the walls). Every piece I do is practice. I actually just wing everything instead of planning it out--my mind is my staging area. All of the work is mine; writing, illustrations, cover art, formatting, editing, and the entire process of publication and marketing. It is a lot of work and is very stressful, but it is also very satisfying and enjoyable. Almost all my work will be traditional, meaning paints, pencils, dipping quill pens, and physical media--not digital, because I hate this demonic little Wacom I own and detest using the nasty little thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be taking commissions for art and possibly short stories, and hope to see fan art if my fan base grows large enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet this be known that any commissions or stories may take a while to release.\u003cbr\u003ePatience, precious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy long-term goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e***I want to share my mind with the world. These worlds and characters have been locked away for so long, so come and experience the love, fear, joy, anger, and every drop of sweat and blood these characters shed as they fight for their existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***I am currently a student of Purdue University Global, working toward a side career in nutrition. It is my greatest desire to complete my Bachelor\u0027s of Science and help people become healthier, as that is my other passion.\u003cbr\u003e~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, I appreciate Patreon for this opportunity, and hope can be rewarding for both me and my patrons. I also greatly appreciate all my supporters, I\u0027m doing this fr you guys and hope you enjoy! Finding a place where I can actually share my work with others, to me, is more desirable and rewarding than anything. And hey, I\u0027ll even help a few people re-gain their health along the way if that\u0027s what you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonal author site: \u003ca href=\"http://www.Lycantis.com\"\u003ewww.Lycantis.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInformational site: coming soon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood hunting,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 60px;\"\u003eLycantis.\u003c/div\u003e"
