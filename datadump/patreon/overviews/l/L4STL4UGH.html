I\u0027m so glad you found your way to my page and I just want to give a brief explanation as to what this whole Patreon thing is all about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt works similar to Kickstarter in that I would receive funding from you all to be able to produce music and videos of live performances for the world to enjoy. However, instead of giving me a large one-time chunk of cash for one project, you would be donating smaller amounts of money for an ongoing flow of projects. It\u0027s GENIUS!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s as simple as you donating as little as $1 per full-length song or video that I post and I reciprocate with good music and small rewards as a show of gratitude. PLEASE do not feel obligated to donate!! I will continue to make music regardless. Your donations would just make it a lot easier for me to provide the best quality of music and videos possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my journey I\u0027ll be releasing \u003cstrong\u003eA LOT of Behind-The-Scenes footage\u003c/strong\u003e of various musical production shenanigans, however, your donations will only go towards fully finished songs or video performances that have taken me a while to create. I plan on releasing about 2 videos every month (sometimes more, sometimes less), BUT the best part is, if I happen to go bananas and release 4 songs in one month, you\u0027re able to set a limit on how much you are able to donate each month so you\u0027re not providing me with more than you can handle. Seriously, $1 goes a long way.. I\u0027ve become a Ramen noodle master chef.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTHANKS FOR STOPPING BY!!\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
