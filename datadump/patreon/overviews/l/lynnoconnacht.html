The lynnetbird is more commonly known as the lion-bird as cats have built up a positive symbiotic relationship with her. Sightings of Lynn E. O\u2019Connacht are rare as she is a shy creature, most likely to be seen in the early mornings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf one wishes to catch sight of this unique creature themselves, their best bet is to leave out books or RPGs that could be added to her diet, or to play music for her to mimic. One can also leave a plate with a variety of confections as the lynnetbird loves sweets and chocolate. These methods are especially effective in Lynn E. O\u2019Connacht\u2019s own territory as she is often too shy to venture far from it.\u003cbr\u003e",
