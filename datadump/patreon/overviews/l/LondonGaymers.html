    "summary": "London Gaymers was first established as a Reddit community in 2012, working as a social group to help more LGBT gamers in London to find and make new friends in a safe and welcoming environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then we have continued to grow into a thriving gaymer community while moving into new channels and ways to keep in touch. Always ensuring we retain the friendly and accepting values that make London Gaymers such a great place to hang out and meet new people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we have grown, so has our ambition. We strive to be the most accessible, most welcoming and most diverse social group we can be, and want to make sure that everybody who wants to join the London Gaymers, can find us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now, all funding and time put into the London Gaymers has been out of the pockets of the admins. We have never charged members for free access events, never imposed membership fees and never asked for money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots and lots of members have asked if there is anyway they can donate to help fund some of the things we do, which we are incredibly grateful for, but we\u0027ve never had a way of taking donations, hence this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe promise to use any funding we receive solely on purchases toward the group, and will ensure all purchases are accounted for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately Patreon doesn\u0027t allow one off donations \u2013 however, you can cancel your recurring charge after the first month, and you won\u0027t be charged again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for looking at our Patreon! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love from,\u003cbr\u003eLondon Gaymers\u003cbr\u003e"
