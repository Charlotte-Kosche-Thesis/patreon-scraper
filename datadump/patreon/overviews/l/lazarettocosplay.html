    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Ava, I\u0027m a cosplay artist based around Anderson in Indiana, I was born and raised in Indiana but my family jumps from place to place in Indy, growing up I was always a creative kid... a natural born artist you could say, art was my first passion but I always wanted to find ways to expand my artistic knowledge. I was always into geeky stuff, Star Wars and Dragon Ball Z were the gateway things into the Geekdom, I didn\u0027t start playing video games until I was around 10 and my first game was Forza 2, afterwards I got heavily addicted to WoW when I was 12 (I was spoiled by WoW and was super picky with MMOs) and have been since then! My favorite video game of all would be Tomb Raider but Skyrim is close.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started dabbling in cosplay back in 2013 or 2014 for a Halloween party that my old home school group had every year, the first costume I made all by myself was my Grell Sutcliff cosplay, I was always into Halloween my mom would make me extravagant ball gowns because I was a victorian period nerd and they didn\u0027t sell my version of accurate pieces in stores. So with her coaching I successfully made my first cosplay! I made an accurate vest to the manga and ended up tracking down a German pattern that was crazy accurate for Grell\u0027s coat. I didn\u0027t start taking photos of my cosplays until my Tomb Raider cosplay back in 2014, which turned out terrible by the way, which brought me to want to start modeling clothing! After modeling some of my BlackCraft pieces I gave it another go for cosplay modeling and here\u0027s a photo from my re-do of my Lara Croft shoot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sH1wAooWdPw/VyEhYdSkjUI/AAAAAAAAABs/AvyS_SSHhtYL3t84jqIImHJ2IXwAYW8HgCLcB/s640/IMG_1772.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy first ever con was GenCon 2014 with my ex boyfriend and I was a poorly thrown together Link from Legend of Zelda (I had 24 hrs and Grell was halfway done) but it was the most fun I had ever had and I ended up going to PopCon the next year as Lara.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_NrB6iKcGB8/V4fe6oZYaNI/AAAAAAAAAFg/BWZ3sSfcZGsSZP6c2XlIZabKOAeZYkksgCLcB/s640/SS%2B1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2016 was a year of getting my confidence up, I\u0027ve had the worst self-esteem most of my life and cosplay has definitely helped me in that department, wearing my Suicide Squad Harley took a lot of confidence for me but it was honestly so much fun to make and wear, hell it even gave me the confidence to finally make the classic Harley suit I\u0027ve wanted to do since I was 14!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pm1.narvii.com/6265/ac631c2485db3ef67848b8c2cab2444f63a7c4d2_hq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen finally in 2016 I made my very first armor build! Alduin from Skyrim\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xK2ffpQlJ_M/WGag67QzQcI/AAAAAAAAAGc/zU8ETLeibqgbnlpuYzzba3aqpQIaOQltgCLcB/s640/A5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately there aren\u0027t many art opportunities nowadays and I\u0027m one of those rare people who can\u0027t mentally handle a \"normal\" job. I currently do commissions but sometimes it gets to be too much and to live independently through my work here would be a dream come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can we expect?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can expect armor builds mostly but also pin ups, \"lewds\" and original shoots on my pin up tier! But I usually just stick with armor and extravagant mixed media builds! Here are a few of my favorites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/9up1ec9r20ukpy5/IMG_20171006_212950_875.jpg?raw=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bizkjgzeaku1f7l/DSCN0271.JPG?raw=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
