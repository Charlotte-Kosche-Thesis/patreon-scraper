Instead, the series will be taking an all-inclusive approach to crisis reporting, analyzing the under-represented, unpopular, and sometimes even jarring, perspectives present in our political spectrum. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to build upon the momentum of existing independent news sources such as NPR, Democracy Now, and TYT; organizations which value human stories, thoughtful discussion, and most importantly, truth. In a political climate that seems difficult to understand, let alone tame, we must constantly step back and assess the progress that has been made in order to keep moving forward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith every story of defeat there is a story of triumph. It is with these stories that we hope to unite and inspire a new generation of political activists, leaders, and organizers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Brian?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m a filmmaker by trade and a political activist by necessity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessionally, I\u2019ve worked in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4345566/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\"\u003efilm industry\u003c/a\u003e for over 6 years and am currently a visual effects artist for TV (The Good Fight on CBS, anyone?). Los Angeles has been quite a ride - I\u2019ve worked in a few different areas of the industry - doing everything from editing social media videos to running errands for executives to, at one point, remodeling William Shatner\u2019s house. (You can ask me about that last one if we ever meet in person - I\u2019ve got stories.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I became aware of Bernie Sanders\u0027 presidential campaign back in 2015 I knew I needed to use my passions to further his message. Now that the election is over, that desire is even stronger. A candidate like Bernie doesn\u2019t come around very often and - quite frankly - hadn\u2019t yet in my lifetime, which is what urged me to get involved. I even went as far as directing a promo video for the campaign: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LL3NyrIaCG4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough volunteering for his campaign I had the opportunity to get to know some amazing activists and community organizers, many of who are also involved in other social justice movements. I myself am a first generation American - my parents emigrated from Poland in the 80s during a time of socio-economic turmoil and political instability. They moved with the hopes to raising their family in a country which embraced Democratic principles, instead of one trying to suppress them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is one of the reasons I am inspired to stand with and support those pushing to create change. I am making it my goal to document the work of these activists and, through the series, I hope to share their messages and continue to report on the issues that affect all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do we make this happen?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe revolution will not be televised, but it is being livestreamed. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the 2016 Presidential Election we saw a tremendous increase in online activism through short-form video, Facebook marketing, and event livestreams. This phenomenon has allowed social media users (over two-thirds being millennials) to circumvent traditional mass-media outlets in favor of direct sources and independent news aggregates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the political revolution is happening on the streets and in our town halls, we must not forget to support the independent news sources that carry on to the message to the public. We need a grassroots media movement that will challenge the status-quo of corporate media and we can only do that with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a $1 Monthly Contribution Helps Immensely!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to become the first documentary series funded by grassroots, micro-contributions, and produced by YOU, our patrons.

With more and more activists getting elected to local positions throughout the country, it is clear that Sanders\u0027 Political Revolution has been successful in mobilizing younger voters towards the political process. However, an overwhelming majority of newcomers to the Democratic Party are saying that they are being faced with opposition when trying to push for progressive reform.\u00a0With the establishment leadership continuing to preach the idea of unity to to the public while casting aside new Party members, we can\u0027t help but ask: whose interests are Party officials really representing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we get closer to releasing the episode we will post updates about our progress and chat with a few of our activists on camera about their community involvement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generous contribution help cover the costs of equipment rentals for our interviews and backstory shoots.
