Having personally achieved many of the things society holds as tickets to happiness, I realised that they did not bring the fulfilment we are made to believe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in India, I was always somewhat aware of its spiritual traditions but thought them all too esoteric. Yet it intrigued me that Indian yogis had always asserted that life was supposed to be blissful. I became determined to find out what these yogis were talking about and what they knew that I didn\u2019t. I started LWP to share some of this priceless wisdom that can help so many people live to their fullest potential.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLWP helps to bring out the wisdom of ancient Indian culture in a way that directly serves people in living better and more fulfilling lives and in the highest aspect, in their search for Truth\u003cbr\u003eRead:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://livingwiseproject.com/about-3/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMore About LWP\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we need Patreons\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLWP is not a regular media venture that can be monetised or obtain funding by allowing the invariable compromise on content or frivolous marketing tactics.

She is as willing to talk about topics related to career, academics or writing as about spirituality and dealing with life issues in the light of consciousness.
