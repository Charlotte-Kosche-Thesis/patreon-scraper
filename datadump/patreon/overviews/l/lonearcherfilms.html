    "summary": "Hey guys, Grant Cook from Film Learnin here - dedicated to learnin you some filmmaking, and learnin ya good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to explain the purpose of the Pateron page - because its something I wrestled with for some time, do I do it or not?\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I decided to open a Patreon is a pretty simple one, as many of you know I create Film Learnin in my spare time and essentially work a full time job and take side gigs as well to pay my bills, which doesn\u0027t leave of lot of room for anything else.\u003cbr\u003eFor the most part, Film Learnin is a zero budget show - The biggest expenditure is always my time spent on an episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what happens when I need to buy... say for example a prop such as claws for a wolverine effect? or prop guns for a muzzle flash/gun episode? I put it on the backburner as I don\u0027t have the money to buy them with a mortgage, bills and a family to look after. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings us to the reason for the Patreon gang, I want to be able to bring these effects to you, to not have to question whether I can afford to buy props for an effect you have requested - So here\u0027s my pitch:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will only have 1 reward teir - $1, a buck, uno. I\u0027m not looking to rip anyone off, or ask people to contribute any more than what they can. I\u0027m merely trying to fund a part of the show I know is lacking and to improve what I make. It also means that everyone is on the same level, and it helps me administer the page as you know I\u0027d rather spend time creating Film Learnin than looking after yet another entity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s it guys, contribute if you can - and as always Keep Learnin!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
