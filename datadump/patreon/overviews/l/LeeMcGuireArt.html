My name is Lee and thanks for visiting my Patreon. Here\u2019s a little about my life and what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began my professional art career back in 2014, when I started drawing the odd art commission for friends and family. I was working in one of those dead end nine-to-five retail jobs and hating every minute of it. Business quickly grew as I started advertising online and began shipping my custom artwork to clients worldwide - America, Australia, even Hawaii! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ended up converting half of my wee living room in Glasgow, Scotland into a mini art studio to keep up with everything:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/3ea8a59ae65cce0eddaf1cf3084ae4a0/tumblr_inline_ozs387dTTu1qzy6uh_500.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehere it is \u201cevolving\u201d (getting messier) over the years:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/e48b7068db6254328a5c2697b642cbdb/tumblr_inline_ozs39iVsVk1qzy6uh_500.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2017 I quit my retail job and now make art full time! I sell my original art, prints and commissions on \u003ca href=\"http://leemcgui.re/shop\"\u003eAmazon, Etsy, Redbubble \u0026amp; Society6\u003c/a\u003e. I still work out of the flat/studio mostly so I can always have my muse close by for inspiration: meet Sam. \u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/c5baf9cb98fee8dad71e77d2dfbd63e0/tumblr_inline_ozs3y4FJHo1qzy6uh_500.png\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve painted, studied and learned more than I ever thought possible since that first commission all those years ago, made good friends from some wonderful clients around the whole world and genuinely had the most fun doing something I love everyday. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get by supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccess to my super exclusive Patreon blog where I show off new things I\u0027m working on, interesting commissions, and even work-in-progress of some of my new ideas!\u003cbr\u003eI even have a reward that gives you exclusive Full resolution wallpapers of my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way to pay artists to live a lifestyle that enables creating. Most people endeavor to support the arts, but not everyone can afford original paintings. Patreon allows anyone to offer individual artists like myself financial support for a flat rate per month. You pick the amount. I reward you for your efforts with art. Money I raise using Patreon will go towards art supplies, gallery fees, framing, print making, and other artistic business expenses. When I make a withdrawal of the funds I make a post explaining exactly what that donation was spent on and what I\u0027m doing to become a better artist. You also get access to my super exclusive Patreon blog where I show of things I\u0027m working on, new ideas and work-in-progress!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCreate an account, pick a reward tier, and donate to my work once a month through Paypal or credit card. I am asking for your help. Please support the arts. Without the support of art lovers, art does not get made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you cannot afford to donate, it would mean the world to me if you spread the word about my Patreon. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your Twitter followers. Any support you give will be a source of inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading,\u003cbr\u003e Lee McGuire"
