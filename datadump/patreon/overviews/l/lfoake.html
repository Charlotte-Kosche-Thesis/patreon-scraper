Also known as L.F. Oake, Lilzor, The Goblin Queen, and/or Cthulhuette.\u003cbr\u003eAfter ten years of writing, I finally became a bestselling author in teen fantasy, known most for \u003cem\u003eNahtaia: A Jayd\u00fcrian Adventure,\u003c/em\u003e which boasts a whopping 3.7 million online reads. Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, I moved to North Carolina where I write full time and am constantly at work on another book or my several blogs and websites I manage.\u00a0When I\u0027m not writing, I am educating my horde of goblins (*ahem* \"children\") in the ways of Middle Earth and Narnia along with my husband and fellow fantasy author,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.robertsonwrites.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJoshua Robertson\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAbout two weeks ago, I opened this Patreon account--my \u003cem\u003efirst\u003c/em\u003e Patreon account--and so far, I have received some amazingly touching messages and pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI never realized readers were keeping so close to what I was doing, and I suppose, after so many years of working on my craft, I shouldn\u0027t be so hard on myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut I know I have so much more room to grow! And I want to grow--for my readers. Growth is a painful process, and a very time-consuming process, but I have taken some significant risks these last couple years to really push myself. Including sacrifices that would take a whole other post to even touch on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eUntil now, I have never considered using Patreon. It was only when a couple readers brought it up over the course of a week that I gave in. No Patreon suggestion was related to the other. No one was responding to the initial idea from someone else. It was just several honest, interested readers who want to support my books, because they enjoy them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eJoshua and I spend all our time and what money we can in creating the best books we can, all from home, while raising our goblins(*ahem* kids). And I\u0027m going to be honest; though we have reached bestseller status on Amazon and have won international awards with our books, we don\u0027t \"make bank.\" But, with all the other sites and projects we\u0027re running, we\u0027re managing, and this is why we\u0027ve never considered opening up for help from readers. But I\u0027ve found that some readers just want to be a part of something they love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat does this mean for me? Whatever money comes from pledges, goes straight to the editors and artists of Jayd\u00fcr and my other works. That\u0027s the biggest support I can ever ask for! This is literally fans adding to the pot for the most effort possible in bringing these books to life.  And believe me when I tell you, artists and editors have been constantly working on my stuff for about two months now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo, here we are. Patreon is open for anyone who wants to be part of the growth of the many books coming this year. There are rewards, all of which can be seen here on my page.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eCheck it all out,  and let me know what more *I* can offer you--my readers-- on Patreon, and wherever else you may be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
