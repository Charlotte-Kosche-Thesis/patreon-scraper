    "summary": "I\u0027m an artist and writer probably best known for writing about network infrastructure and the American landscape.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lifewinning.com/tag/writes\"\u003eHere\u0027s some of my writing\u003c/a\u003e. I also published\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/networks-of-new-york/\"\u003ea book about internet infrastructure in New York City\u003c/a\u003e last year. My art tends to look like drawings and maps (and, lately,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nomegallery.com/exhibitions/reconnaissance/\"\u003elenticular prints\u003c/a\u003e of aerial and satellite imagery). Since the inauguration of the new American regime, I\u0027ve been spending a lot of time driving around the American Southwest and west thinking about how America thinks about the end of the world. I haven\u0027t published most of what I\u0027ve written about this travel because it probably should be a book and not an article.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn general, the things I am most excited to write and make work about these days are landscapes that don\u0027t lend themselves to obvious breaking/timely news-y hooks (nuclear waste cleanup and long-term storage, mining, electronics manufacture and recycling, land use and allocation in the American West, museology and American hagiography). But I think they are important to document and think about in the face of a political moment diametrically opposed to long-term thinking. Present-day writing about problems situated in geologic timescales isn\u0027t actually about dwelling on the past--it\u0027s about believing in and caring enough about the future to take time in the present moment to coherently and carefully record things and try to take care of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this year I\u0027d like to start collating some of this work that hasn\u0027t been published or hasn\u0027t been an easy fit in the news cycle into small publications, prints, and other formats. It probably won\u0027t turn into a full-length book project right away, but that\u0027s ultimately the thing I\u0027d like to be working on, and accumulating a lot of little-to-medium-sized outputs as I work toward one really big output seems like a good idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not very good at asking for help. I want to make work that isn\u0027t beholden to clickbait cycles and outrage framing. I hope that\u0027s work that people want to see in the world."
