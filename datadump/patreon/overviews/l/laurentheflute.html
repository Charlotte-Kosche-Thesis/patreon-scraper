I\u0027m Lauren. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been involved in the VGM scene since 2010, and I\u0027ve been posting my own solo YouTube covers as \"Lauren the Flute\" since 2012. I play flute and sing. I really like doing these things \u2014 especially \nperforming music from video games. Sometimes I dress up! In 2015, I \nstarted streaming my first Earthbound playthrough, and now I stream all \nsorts of things \u2014 gaming, but also music and cooking and soon art! I\u0027m working on my MFA in creative writing, so (unsurprisingly) I\u0027m \nwriting a novel. And I lead a video game cover band, The Returners. You could say I keep pretty busy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are lots of things I would love to be able to do: devote more time to my creative projects, make fun merch like buttons, commission costumes to wear on stage and in videos, travel to more conventions (and maybe perform and meet up with fans!), upgrade my gear and make better-quality videos (and not have my stream sometimes crash!) ... and having patrons can help all of those things come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve used my Patreon before specifically to support my music, but now that I\u0027ve branched out more, I would like to let you get involved in the other things I create! Do you want to hear my music WIPs and maybe read bits of stories I\u0027m working on? Maybe vote on what music I should cover next or what I should cook in my next cooking stream? Or just see lots of photos of my cats and read my long rambling thoughts in a newsletter? (I have a lot of words about many things.) This is supposed to be fun for all of us, so let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been the sort of person who dreams impossibly big dreams, but now that the internet has given us the power to work together, maybe some of my dreams will come to life.\u003cbr\u003e"
