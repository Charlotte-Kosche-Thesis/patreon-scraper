My name is Adrian and I\u0027ve been an illustrative artist for a good 15 years or so!

I tend to focus more on adult comics with more emotional themes but I have all kinds of stories in mind to write. But I have no time to make them all when juggling with commission work, so I\u0027m opening up this Patreon in hope that maybe I can get enough money to focus more on my own personal projects!
