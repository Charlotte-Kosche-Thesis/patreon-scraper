For the past couple of years I\u0027ve been creating free RPG content on a weekly basis, including maps, adventures, articles, and more. All of that is provided for free to you; all that I ask is that you enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing RPGs - and D\u0026amp;D specifically - for well over twenty years. It\u0027s one of my favourite hobbies, and Loot The Room is my excuse to revel in and share how much I love the game. My goal has always been for Loot The Room to be something similar to the old Dragon and Dungeon magazines that I grew up reading - a one-stop-shop for awesome resources you can drop into your game to make things even more awesome for you and your players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027ve always aimed to keep Loot The Room free of advertising and \"sponsored\" content. Some of my costs are paid by the One Book Shelf affiliate links in my monthly DMs Guild roundups, but they don\u0027t even come close to covering the cost of maintaining the site (let alone actually paying me for the writing and the maps and stuff). Patreon is the best way for those of you who enjoy the site enough to want to pay me for it to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eYou get the same constant stream of free content that everybody else gets, along with the satisfaction of knowing that you helped to make it possible. You\u0027ll get advanced access to posts, maps, and PDF releases before they go live, as well as the opportunity to help decide what content gets made in the future. Your support will also help us hit goals on Patreon that unlock even more extra content for the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Chris Bissette"
