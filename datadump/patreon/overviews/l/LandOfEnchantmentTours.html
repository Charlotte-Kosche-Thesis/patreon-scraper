As a young child he began drawing the monsters that plagued his dreams. Despite the reprimands of his worried teachers, Correll\u2019s parents supported him in his artistic endeavors, allowing him to creatively purge the often violent and grotesque images that came to him in his sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrawings made way for collages and sculptures, but Correll sought a larger audience and ultimately turned to filmmaking. In 2002, he graduated with a B.A. from Fairhaven College at Western Washington University, pioneering a degree titled \u201cImaginative Moviemaking.\u201d His studies included screenwriting, film appreciation, video production, and fine arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough Correll resides in New Mexico, his home state is Washington where he received local accolades at the Projections Film Festival with his video work, taking Best Feature Documentary for \u201cThe Many Faces of Homelessness\u201d (\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/pA1XuxnYBdU?list=PLjyUco8VlaAULWRh6zjmkbU908n4Txui6\"\u003e\u201cMany Faces\u2026\u201d Excerpt Here\u003c/a\u003e), as well as Best Animation for \u201cLabyrinth of Penumbra\u201d. Correll also interned with EVR Films, where he worked to master skills related to special effects, costume/set design, directing, producing, editing, and shooting. In addition, he has created TV commercials, music videos, and experimental narratives (check out some of his work here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/nrgcreations\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/nrgcreations\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis newest release, \u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4132230/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"\u003eChet Zar: I Like to Paint Monsters\u003c/a\u003e (2015), takes the audience into the dark and foreboding world of Chet Zar, where apocalyptic industrial landscapes are inhabited by disturbing yet beautiful monstrosities. Correll asks the question: Who is Chet Zar, and why does he like to paint monsters? Hailed by Tattoo Magazine as \u201cBeautiful, moving and thought-provoking\u201d, and regaled by Clive Barker as \u201cAn inspiring and important film\u2026\u201d, the documentary won an \u201cHonorable Mention\u201d at the Santa Monica Independent Film Festival, and the \u201cGuerrilla Marketing\u201d award at the Albuquerque Film and Music Experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.bigcartel.com/product_images/209721376/ChetZarDVDbox+no+background.png?auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;h=1000\u0026amp;w=1000\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
