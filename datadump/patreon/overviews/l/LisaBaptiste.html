    "summary": "First, thank you so much to those who support the vision God has given me to share with the world. It only goes forward because of you affording me the space to go deeper and explore the Father\u0027s heart through the lens of motherhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was in college the first time I prayed the words of Isaiah, \"Here am I, send me,\" hoping to dedicate my life as a missionary. It wasn\u0027t until nearly a decade later that prayer was answered, with, \"Write something, and I will send your words.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve written. I\u0027ve been blogging about my God moments in Parenting for going on 3 years, and have visited themes including abundant living, how to wait amidst the storms of life and identity as God\u0027s child. In the last year, I have been read not only in the US, but also Brazil, India, Indonesia, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Trinidad and Chile. It has been amazing watching the Father take the meditations of my heart to the ends of the earth, and as of February 2018, He\u0027s been calling me to greater dedication and wider projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt began with taking time off from blogging and writing a 46 day devotional for my church of 2500 to follow through Lent, which was received enthusiastically and positioned many to be transformed by opening up areas of resistance in their hearts, souls, and minds to the presence of God. Currently, I feel Him calling me to begin blogging again, twice weekly, in categories of noticing and pondering how the Godhead is revealed through my children. In the next 2 years, I hope to refine and compile these blogs into their own work which will be called, Through Abba\u0027s Eyes, knowing the Father by becoming a Mother. He\u0027s also laid on my heart to continue leading others to Jesus through devotional style writing, and I will be releasing Holding Onto Hope as a 30 day devotional in June 2018. If received well, my goal is to continue writing topical devotionals each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI struggled for a long time, wondering how I could possibly do all the Lord has placed before me and be a responsible mom who takes care of her family? After months of prayer, I have accepted that in the Body of Christ, God made me a mouth and have decided to dedicate my days to telling His stories. It is my hope that you will partner with me as I jump into a life committed to sharing the Father\u0027s heart. Thank you for making the dreams He\u0027s placed in my heart possibilities. His Kingdom come. His will be done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
