    "summary": "Bills contain big ideas for changing the American government\nand society. And since our society is a pretty complex place, it often takes\ncomplex language and complex terminology to express these ideas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWe break bills down into plain language that you can read and understand.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo paragraph-length sentences. No legalese or specialized\nterms, unless they\u2019re paired with a good definition (link verbiage to the\nglossary!) \u003cbr\u003e\n\n No linguistic\nsummersaults. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJust. Straightforward. Words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nThink of it like CliffsNotes\u003c/strong\u003e. Because democracy\nshould be accessible to all. \u003cstrong\u003eBecome a patron and help us maintain our extensive legislation library. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWe\u2019re creating digestible data of D.C. doings to help raise the political I.Q.!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s not all...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHolding your representatives accountable starts with knowing\nwhat they represent. Which is why we don\u2019t stop with the legislation library.\nEach entry in our library notes the authors and sponsors of a bill, and, if it\nhas been passed into law, how the votes split. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nClick on your representative\u2019s name, or search for your\nstate\u2019s reps. It\u2019ll bring you to their \u003cstrong\u003etrading card\u003c/strong\u003e. Think of this like a\nbaseball card. Quick summaries tally up what bills they have authored,\nsponsored, and how to get a hold of them.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with the other bills on their card, refer back to our\nlegislation library. These trading cards also have information about what\norganizations donate to your representatives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd when the next elections come, you\u2019ll know who you\u2019re\nready to trade out. Become a patron and help us stack the deck in your favor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you have access to this information so you can learn, share and be involved in our US government in an educated and informed way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s Build a Better World, Together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
