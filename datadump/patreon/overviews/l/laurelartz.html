I\u0027m Laura, artist and founder of LaurelArtZ.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a sculptor, painter, photographer, writer and animal activist. I\u0027m currently studying to become an illustrator and graphic designer. For the past few years I\u0027ve been selling shell and clay jewelry on Etsy and at craft shows and now I\u0027m looking to do something more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70); font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhere to Begin?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past decade I had been dead set on becoming a zoologist. Actually to be honest my sciencey wants were all over the place. I wanted to be a zoologist, a vet, and marine biologist, an oceanographer... And then at the same time I had been creating art which I really loved too. I began sculpting in high school and it quickly became my favorite because it came so naturally to me. Once I was in college, I had the chance to take some real science classes.... and I quickly realized which side of my brain was dominate! I finally had to sit myself down and think about what I really wanted from this life.\u00a0My passion in both animals and art are so strong that choosing was a nightmare. I wanted to really make a difference in the lives of the animals and the environment, but I also wanted to turn my art into more than just a hobby. Then I thought, who ever said I couldn\u0027t do both?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s my Idea...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been sculpting pet figurines for a while now and I want to be able to donate a good amount of money that I make from them, to the local shelters of my county. I owe it to the ASPCA for uniting my cats with me. Non-Profit shelters do so much for the lives of animals and take little in return.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor now I believe that donating to animals shelters is an amazing starting point for me! They are more than just our pets, they\u0027re members of our family, our little fur babies (and scaley babies!). I\u0027m ecstatic to be a part of both a good cause, and making some so special for people. It\u0027s all very inspiring!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m hoping to be able to donate the proceeds from each sculpture that I can to my local animals shelters. Currently I\u0027m donating 15% of each purchase. Being the generic broke artist that I am, it\u0027d be wonderful to get some added help! The more you, the patron, pledges to me, the more I can donate to the shelters! A lot goes into each one, and since I\u0027m a perfectionist, they all take a considerable amount of time for me to turn a blob of grey clay, into a vibrant representation of someone\u0027s pet. At the same time I work a seasonal job at a jewelry store which helps pay for my artsy expenses, while also allowing me some time to work on my art and learning graphic design. \u003cbr\u003eHowever this can\u0027t be a permanent thing for me since I do need to find something at least part time soon. I\u0027m really looking for this to take off just enough for me stick with it. Ultimately I hope\u00a0this will allow me to work full time creating and learning for my future.\u00a0Every little bit helps :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell my current goal is for the raising money for animal shelters through my sculptures to become a success. I know it\u0027ll take time, but I am promising to stick with it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy Ultimate goal is a much bigger one. Not only do I want to raise money for the shelters, but I want to be able to do that for other non-profit animal and environmental organizations. The last thing I want is to watch critically endangered species go extinct and to lose more essential habitats through deforestation and pollution. It\u0027d be amazing to recruit other artists who feel the same way, and so that they could be a part of the cause as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
