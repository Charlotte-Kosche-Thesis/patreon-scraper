And that our gifts matter.\u003c/strong\u003e Not when they\u2019re hidden away, safely wrapped in the old stories of our insignificance. But when they get up in the morning and greet the sunrise. When we take some stumbling steps towards them, embracing what we deep inside know is ours, and only ours, to do. And to be. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhen we feel our trembling knees and we do it anyway.

I\u2019ve had jobs, all sorts of jobs, but I don\u2019t really believe in them anymore. I believe in gifts. And I believe that the sharing of our gifts, the act of living them out in our rugged, beautiful lives, turns out to be the most revolutionary thing in this world, right here and right now. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNow, this is me asking you for support.\u003c/strong\u003e To hold me, like I, in my ways, hold you.

To share it with you, yes, even create it with you! My goal is to support my family, my children.
