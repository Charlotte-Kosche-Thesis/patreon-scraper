She has started co-op\ngalleries, been a community organizer and advocate, opened galleries, studio\nbuildings, and community screen printing shops, built exhibitions in the backs\nof rental trucks for the Democratic National Convention, curated shows, created\nspectacle and taken guerilla actions to the streets, all while maintaining a\nrigorous studio practice.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn\n2005 she was the first recipient of Westword\u2019s Mastermind Award in Visual Arts,\nand in 2006 was chosen Best Arts Advocate by the Rocky Mountain News.  In\n2010 she curated an exhibition for the Biennial of the Americas, titled\nObjectophilia, in partnership with the Museum of Contemporary Art,\nDenver.  She has shown her work regionally throughout the west and in\nToronto, Canada.  She moved to Columbus, Ohio to pursue her MFA at the\nOhio State University on fellowship, and spent the summer of 2011 at the School\nof Visual Arts Summer Residency in New York before completing her Masters\ndegree in 2012.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHer\nwork is currently concerned with nature and our relationship to it,\nparticularly in concern to mutation, illness, and the conversations and\npropaganda surrounding environmental politics.  By employing references to\nthe souvenir and the miniature, the abject and the uncanny, she endeavors to\nmake ideas and materiality meet by working with living systems such as\nhoneybees and bacteria, new technologies and socio-politically charged\nmaterials and imagery.  She is currently\nbuilding a tiny house on wheels in order to drive across the country having\nconversations with ordinary people about climate change and making a film about\nit. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
