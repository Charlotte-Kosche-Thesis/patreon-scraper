To put it plainly, a lot of you already donate frequently on my stream, and I feel I could be giving so much more back in ways of thanks like sharing my artistic side with a gift being sent to you, or even other perks that are actually in writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also a great way to better plan for future events that we can create with this Patreon, keep track of when I should and shouldn\u0027t go on an Amiibo splurge, and just overall create some harmony between us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also hoping this will help break me into doing YouTube videos, as it\u0027s been one of my long-time goals for years. I am incredibly shy when it comes to sitting in front of a camera with no one watching, and talking . . . how bizarre right? But gosh darnit I will do it for you guys! *sniffle*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may also think this is an evil plan to create an excuse to use the thousands of perler beads I have sitting on my desk waiting to be placed in an arrangement of awesomeness . . . and bitch, you might be right.\u00a0( \u0361\u25c9 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u25c9)"
