    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy contributing you acknowledge that you are 18+ years old or the age of majority where you live, whichever is higher.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome, and thanks for checking out my Patreon page. Most of you probably know me as Kaizer Ryu. I\u0027ve been at this writing thing for over a decade now, and fancy myself pretty good at it. For the last several of those years I\u0027ve put up a number of adult-themed stories for the fun of it, though I have done some commission work as well. While that will continue, by contributing here you will get access to them sooner. Should you be especially generous you can even influence what I write next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney I receive will go towards living expenses such as student loans, food, etc. I love writing. Being able to justify putting time and effort into it will go a long way towards a higher output. I\u0027m frequently asked when my next story is coming out, and through this I plan to have my answer be more concrete than \u0027when it\u0027s done\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThemes\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003eMy work is not what one would classify as tame. Excessive, over the top, and ignoring physics and biology when they get in the way of a fun time are more apt descriptors. Most of the characters involved are anthropomorphic in nature, though humans are not excluded. Before committing you can check out a number of examples (if they didn\u0027t bring you here in the first place) at the following link.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe site is adult in nature and you must be 18+ or age of majority before viewing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kaizerryu83/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFur Affinity\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome projects currently in the works\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBunny Invasion\u003c/em\u003e: The original series is over, but the universe is ever expanding. Future development includes delving into the historical, scientific, and social aspects of the universe it takes place in. Also in the works are sequels and prequels to the existing storyline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBusty Bunny\u003c/em\u003e: The so far enigmatic company has been mentioned in several stories, including one (mildly tongue in cheek) glimpse into its past. But aside from a product list, very little is known about how it works, or who works for it. I will be delving into details about this company that is not at all shady or questionably ethical. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFate Comes to Call\u003c/em\u003e: A sister series to Bunny Invasion, it has much more to go than has been so far published. Told from the perspective of a neurotic vixen surrounded by strong personalities, I really think I have too much fun with this one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDawn of a New Age\u003c/em\u003e: Dark and gritty, this story of war, hubris, and struggle will never be mistaken as a feel good tale. The main character has been put through the wringer, left broken, but never completely defeated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRandom Adventures of a Breeding Stud\u003c/em\u003e: It\u0027s a mouthful, isn\u0027t it? These tales are connected solely by the main character, with all else changed at my discretion. Slice of life? Sci Fi? Historical? Who knows what situations he\u0027ll be placed in next and how his outlook will change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn Your Dreams\u003c/em\u003e: A new tale that\u0027s been stewing in my head for some time. What happens when a strong-willed country girl ends up targeted by forces beyond her control, and even her reality? When your body and even your dreams are against you, is it possible to remain true to oneself? \u003cbr\u003e"
