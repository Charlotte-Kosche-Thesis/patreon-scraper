The wordsmith has no words to express how much your support means.\u003cbr\u003eThese are difficult times and I know that many of us don\u0027t have spare cash. If you\u0027d like to show support for what I do in other ways, please consider some of the following:\u003cbr\u003e1) Share what I write. Use your social media connections to \"spread the word.\"\u003cbr\u003e2) Talk to family and friends about the issues I write about. We need to talk. Seriously, we all need to talk.\u003cbr\u003e3) Tell me which issues or problems you\u0027d like me to tackle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4) Direct me to other writers or artists or activists you feel are making valid contributions. I need that in order to help create a community of like minded people.\u003cbr\u003e5) Tell me your stories, your problems, your solutions.\u003cbr\u003e6) Send me seeds for my free community garden project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll add more ways to help as I think of them.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a retired professional actor, a proud former member of the Screen Actor\u0027s Guild. I\u0027ve also been a political activist, commentator, essayist and general thorn in the side of the power structure throughout most of my adult life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy goal as a writer is to contemplate, dissect and call into question all preconceptions. First my own, then yours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI think we have the capacity and compassion to make the world safer, saner and more loving, but only if examine pretty much all we hold to be true.\u003cbr\u003eBe strong. don;t let the bastards get you down.\u00a0"
