I\u0027ve always loved competitive gaming and wish to see better games in the browser and on mobile. I\u0027m looking for potential patrons to help fund the development, server, and advertising costs of the game I am working on currently temp-named \u0027Lightyear\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working on this project since late last October part-time, written to be compatible in all browsers - no downloads necessary, and with mobile versions worked out over the coming months if I can get enough funding. Beyond the basics which I will go into below, this game features\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eArtificial Neural Network\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0implementation, with the player having the ability to \u0027train\u0027 their companions to react as they would prefer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery donation helps set me on a path towards working on this project full time. I thank everyone that can help me with this, as it means a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/cMtLom/liner4.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s Lightyear?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLightyear is a MMO tick-based 4X RPG. In short, it\u0027s a \u0027Clash of Clans\u0027 style 4X empire building game, mixed with an \u0027Asteroids\u0027 style bullet hell game - and can be played as one or the other or both. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4X is a genre of strategy-based video and board games in which players control an empire and \"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate\".\u00a0A tick-based game is a game that is played using ticks, or units of time.\u00a0RPGs or \u0027Role Playing Games\u0027 are games in which players take on the roles of imaginary characters who engage in adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach player starts with a standard, relatively undeveloped star system that comes with 6 planets, a small asteroid belt, as well as a single AI base that serves as your HQ for accessing game events and quests, raiding, trading, player auctions, and a \u0027gem\u0027 store (however I wouldn\u0027t call it pay to win).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning by developing your single colonized planet, from managing its environment in a responsible manner while mining for resources, to ensuring the citizens have proper entertainment and governance - it won\u0027t be long before you can begin eyeing up the other planets in your system, and eventually expand your empire across the galaxy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon enough you\u0027ll find your empire is demanding too much resources to be responsibly extracted from your main colonies, so you\u0027ll have to turn your attention towards other methods such as setting up bots to mine asteroid belts in your control, or to perform complex trade routes; the profitability of which varies given supply and demand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/h3Cfom\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jEN216/liner6.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps a simple raid, instead?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf fast-paced is your style, then look no further as you can jump into action in seconds with random dungeons and quests being available from your home system. No fuss, just warp in and start shooting and looting. Similarly, you and any players you squad, team, or alliance up with can raid other players systems, potentially taking them for yourself if you can manage it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith multiple different combat \u0027styles\u0027 to choose from, there\u0027ll be something for everyone. Whether you want to zip around in a light fighter, dodging blasters and finding weak points, or cruise around in a dreadnought, launching fighters and commanding other ships to do your bidding, or maybe you\u0027d rather sneak around and disrupt the battlefield causing general confusion in an effort to give your buddies the edge?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ultimate goal, if there is one, is to acquire control of the \u003cstrong\u003eblack hole\u003c/strong\u003e at the center of the galaxy, as it is the single most powerful source of energy known. The black hole can be used for a number of interesting things, from sustaining the only intergalactic wormhole in the galaxy, to blocking those very same connections from being made, to something perhaps more sinister than either of those two.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/crY9g6\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jSoxZR/liner3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArtificial Neural Networks?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou heard me. The latest in Artificial Intelligence technology, right here in this game, controlling little spaceships flying around. Evolve them as you please, gearing them for different intentions, and find new and creative ways to get them to do what you want. I wouldn\u0027t get too comfortable with ubers, either.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, trade them.

A \u0027pseudo-multiplayer\u0027 version in which the players fly around in single-player areas, yet can interact with each-other through forming teams and raiding/capturing each-others star systems is possible within a few months of the initial demo release.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually I plan on having it be live multiplayer in the browser by taking advantage of \u003cstrong\u003eWebRTC\u003c/strong\u003e and its data channels. I have already experimented with this, and others have shown it\u0027s at least doable in a \u0027League of Legends\u0027 arena style setting where the player count is capped out at a relatively low number, however the idea is to ultimately create a peer-cluster system to take care of the entire universe \u0026amp; thus allowing it to be a true MMO - all in the browser \u0026amp; on mobile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of the work has already been done and I\u0027ll keep plugging along even if I get zero pledges, with the neural networks being about \u003cstrong\u003e75% implemented\u003c/strong\u003e - the hardest parts involving that are mostly out of the way. I\u0027m a perfectionist so I was going to wait longer to create this Patreon page, however I also remember how fun it is to be part of the process so I was torn.. Alas, I have made it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/kVXfom/liner5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron, beyond feeling good inside for helping me achieve my dreams, there\u0027s tonnes you can look forward to! You\u0027ll have access to the latest updates and design decisions, pre-releases, as well as the ability to ask me questions directly or to suggest possible features to be implemented. Once I get Discord set up, you\u0027ll be able to talk to me there as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, until the initial demo release and launch of the forums, Patreon, Discord, and the Itch connected to it will be the \u003cstrong\u003eonly\u003c/strong\u003e official community surrounding Lightyear and anything associated with it! Making this the place to be for Lightyear related news!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a pledge of only $1 a month, you\u0027ll get full access to all of this as well upon release you\u0027ll get the ad-free version and a \u0027Supporter\u0027 title!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCoding a game takes time, a lot of time. Patreon allows me to spend even more time working on the game, so I can get you the content you want to see, sooner! Beyond that, your donations allow me to pay graphic designers as well as sound artists so the game can have that professional polished feel to it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if I don\u0027t meet my Patron Goals, they keep me motivated. As well, blogging about my progress should be fun and help keep me on track. With that said, every pledge counts. I love and appreciate everyone that helps me focus on and achieve my dreams, and look forward to building a community here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCredits to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://millionthvector.blogspot.ca/\"\u003eMillionthVector\u003c/a\u003e for the sprite work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Marcel"
