These last 4 years bringing LadyWatch to the people have been \u003cem\u003eincredible\u003c/em\u003e, and we couldn\u0027t be more excited to take our mission of celebrating fascinating women over the age of 50 to the next level. We\u0027ve been so grateful for our amazing LadyWatchers who have been along for this ridiculous ride, and in fact, we need your help now more than ever!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we\u0027ve managed to cover the costs associated with producing a quality, weekly podcast during this time, it has been on a bare-bones budget consisting of the most basic necessities. For quite a while now, we\u0027ve been in the difficult position of \u003cem\u003ewanting \u003c/em\u003eto run with the innumerable ideas we have to encourage the show\u0027s growth and develop other projects, but we find ourselves always lacking the resources to make them a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of the basic production costs (like online hosting of our digital episode files, and equipment upkeep), there are a number of things on our hit list for achieving bigger and better things. A few of these are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExpanded online server space to host and publish more content every month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnnual fees for the new website and our domain, as well fees to build additional features and functions of the website in the future\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgrades and continued maintenance for our aging recording equipment, and especially making our \"studio\" setup more travel-friendly and mobile, which will allow us to create more adventurous content and be ready \u003cem\u003eanywhere\u003c/em\u003e for catching Lady interviews\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSeed money for developing creative LadyWatch merch beyond the mug, and possibly facilitating more giveaway rewards similar to our current Muggams subscriber level bonus\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe many costs associated with developing live cabaret concepts starring Ryan \u0026amp; Jason, integrating Lady music and Lady conversation as live shows that are a little bit of both. This has always been one of our ultimate goals, which is why we were especially encouraged by the success of our recent trial run of the show we call \"LadyBoyhood\" here in L.A \u00a0in January. We feel confident that this performance template has the potential for us to create a \u003cem\u003enumber \u003c/em\u003eof different shows and uniquely tailored entertainment that can travel to LadyWatchers all over the country!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe dream big, but we hope that our dreams are only matched by the generosity and faith of the LadyWatchers who can make all this possible. If you love us and what we stand for, you are KEY in the effort to get more of what \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003ewant. In transforming yourself from a LadyWatcher into a \u003cstrong\u003eLadyPatron\u003c/strong\u003e, you are not only investing in your own Lady listening pleasure, but also in us personally - Ryan \u0026amp; Jason. That vote of confidence is worth more than you can imagine, and we don\u0027t intend to take it for granted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027ll join us, and that together we can make\u00a0this the start of something BIG!"
