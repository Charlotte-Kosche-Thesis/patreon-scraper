    "summary": "Dear buddies and pals present and future,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Leo, and I\u0027m a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.vinegarcreek.com\"\u003emusician\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://abrightunsteadylight.wordpress.com\"\u003ewriter, and seat-of-the-pants adventurer\u003c/a\u003e. Welcome to my Patreon page, a unique place in InterCyberSpace where I can share the various things I make with you. Making a living as an independent writer/ performer can be tough, and with your support, I will be better able to focus on the creative aspects of my work with fewer distractions like searching for quarters in the clothes dryer and calculating how many sandwiches I can coax out of that last tablespoon of peanut butter.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s how you can help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a bit like pledging to support your local public radio station, if that station were only broadcast from my dental fillings. It\u0027s a lot like buying your vegetables ( or in this case original, homemade entertainment) directly from the farmer who grows them rather than the supermarket (or record company or streaming service) that underpays him for them. If you enjoy the things I make and post here, which will include audio and video recordings of original and cover songs; poems; stories; \u00a0and travel writing pieces, you can pledge a specific dollar amount (of your choosing) for each song/ video/ story/ whatever (expect probably between 1 and 4 pieces of new content per month). You can also set a monthly cap on your contributions- Let\u2019s say you pledge 3$ per creation with a monthly cap of 10$. If I go off on some berserk writing bender and release a new song every day for the entire month, you still only pay the 10 bucks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs my patron, you\u2019ll have access to some special \u201cpatrons only\u201d content and rewards; legitimate use of the highfalutin title, \u201cPatron of the Arts\u201d (perhaps I\u2019ll make one of my rewards a silk sash with that on it); and the knowledge that you\u2019re facilitating and stimulating the creation of new art in a way that art-loving people have been doing since ancient times. In a time when the political tide is dragging in threats of funding cuts for arts programs, direct support of independent creators is a way for you to personally come to the defense of the arts. In our current cultural climate, it might almost be viewed as a subversive act, in the best possible way. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, is you is or is you ain\u2019t my patron? If you don\u2019t feel this is for you, that\u2019s perfectly alright. Most of the content here will be non-exclusive, and I invite you to enjoy it free of charge with my compliments. If you do decide to become a patron, I urge you also to browse around and check out the many fine artists who are using Patreon to share their creations with the folks who take delight in them. After all, without the patrons who believed in and supported them, even titanic talents like Michelangelo and Beethoven might have had to moonlight as window washers, and Bukowski might never have been able to quit his job at the post office. Without patrons, there might never have been a Renaissance, and you\u2019d never have the opportunity to be loudly shushed by Vatican guards as you murmur and gawk at the Sistine Chapel. \u003cbr\u003e\nAs always, I\u2019m grateful to the marrow for your support, whatever form it takes. Cheers, buddies, and excelsior.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(profile photo by David Gerz)\u003cbr\u003e"
