To give you the basics, I\u0027m twenty years old, a freelance traveling nude and fashion model, and possess a burning fire to create that has never left me in my years on this Earth. I\u0027m in the business of making things happen. The proceeds from my Patreon go straight to a savings account I\u0027ve created for a photography studio I\u0027m attempting to make real for me. I want to start hosting modeling and photography workshops with my local fellow creators that work very hard to put out the best content they can. Who are you? A fan? A critic? My mom? (Lol I hope not, I\u0027m so sorry Mom but hey at least my butt looks good) A curious person that has never been introduced to nude modeling but can appreciate the female form and flair? Whoever you are and whatever brought you here, thank you so SO much for even getting this far with me. Your presence, support, and contributions in everything you say and do means the world to me. It means so much to have people fighting alongside of me without me even being aware of it half the time! You\u0027re pushing me to be better, to put out better content with better resources. I just need to ask you to keep pushing me, and thank you so much for supporting my lifelong dream \u0026lt;3"
