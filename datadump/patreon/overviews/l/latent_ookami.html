    "summary": "My life has been artwork. Literally. My mother had me start art when I was the age of two. It sounds bizarre or maybe even cliche, but it\u0027s true. Sometimes I believe that people are born with a certain path they\u0027re supposed to take; and this is mine. I have been doing traditional works for a long time. I started digital works back around 2002, after having my world opened up to Photoshop and a tablet for my birthday. I\u0027ve been working hard ever since. I know that if I\u0027d be able to make a living doing artwork, I\u0027d be extremely happy. That has always been my dream. I\u0027ve also been working on a comic I\u0027d like to start getting into works. But it\u0027s hard to make any of this happen, so I\u0027m looking towards Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just need those who believe that dreams can come true. That people deserve and should be doing what they love for a living. All I\u0027m asking is for a little help along the way."
