    "summary": "\"I am Len Lee\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne may ask, \"Why say that? Obviously you are Len Lee.\" Len Lee has been my persona since 2009. Originally, this persona didn\u0027t have a name. I created this persona to have the traits I wanted. I was always shy and a complete introvert. This persona was outgoing and made so many friends. They were who I wanted to be. It wasn\u0027t until 2012 that this persona received the name \"Len\". I still wanted to be them but couldn\u0027t. In 2014, Len Lee became my alias. I was known as Len Lee by people in the cosplay community. I was slowly becoming the persona I created, who at this time had the full name of \"Len Lee\". As of 2017, I fully became Len Lee. When I wake up, I remind myself, \"I am Len Lee.\" It has saved me from ending it all for many years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I have grown, I\u0027ve come to realize that I am who I am today because I dreamed of Len Lee. I\u0027ve taken control of my life and decided to put all my effort into cosplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay and Len Lee go hand in hand. Len Lee was my persona as a cosplayer, so I was able to act. I started cosplaying back in 2008 and have loved it ever since. I attended my first convention, Anime Conji, in 2014 due to strict parents. From there, I looked forward to cons and new cosplay plans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time went on, I had multiple occasions of emotional trauma that has led me to remove Len as an alias. As of 2018, I have become Phi Lee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I ask is to put at least $1 to help me push more cosplay content out and to help me continue my dream as Phi Lee. Thank you so much for reading all of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch Love,\u003cbr\u003ePhi\u003cbr\u003e"
