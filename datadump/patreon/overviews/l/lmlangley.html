Even inside the niche it belongs in, it\u0027s much smaller than that. That\u0027s fine -- I never expected my incredibly niche work to become a huge seller, because that\u0027s not what the work is for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s certainly not enough to live off of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally think (and I\u0027m lucky that many people seem to think the same thing!) that the work I\u0027m doing is important, \u003cstrong\u003ewhich is the reason I don\u0027t want to stop doing it. \u003c/strong\u003eI know that the impact I\u0027ve made so far is minimal compared to what I can do, but it\u0027s not feasible for me to have crowdfunding campaigns every time I want to make something happen, considering that they don\u0027t cover my living expenses. Recently, my position at a start-up ended and I have had to take contract work incessantly, to the point where I\u0027m both creatively exhausted and struggling to get any work done at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue creating content, but at the rate things are going, that goal will simply become unsustainable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to abandon writing or game development, certainly not when I\u0027m creating stuff that I feel resonates with people. That\u0027s the main reason I have created this Patreon -- to allow me to continue writing and creating meaningful content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can even spare just one dollar a month and share this Patreon with your friends, you\u0027d be making a world of difference. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeader composite by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tofu.rocks/\"\u003eBai Yu\u003c/a\u003e, character drawings by Maggie Davidson and other designs by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaPiBond\"\u003eSigmaPiBond\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/khana_chi\"\u003eKhana\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
