The channel features tutorials focusing on Sketchup, Photoshop and AutoCad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date, the channel has received over a million views on YouTube, but the content has become outdated as new methods and software tools have come along. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eContent uploads have stalled from May 2013 onward as Digital Arch Land\u0027s account was removed from Youtube Partners advertising program that financially encouraged me to create content for students and professionals in landscape architecture. Despite repeated attempts to restore advertisement support, I have received no word from Youtube on restoring that function of the channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your financial support, I can start producing content that is relevant for working in 2018 and keep producing content for landscape architects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the emphasis on Live streaming?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eCreating recorded tutorials takes a lot of time and preparation in the course creation, recording, narration, editing, and publishing. Furthermore, engagement with viewers is limited to the comment section and the specifics of the video may not be what a user is looking for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy live streaming tutorials for an hour, I can teach more content with less preparation time and engage with users on demand to repeat previous steps, clarify an instruction, or have Q/A\u0027s at the end of the stream. They are also recorded and viewable after live streaming, thus creating an archive of digital courses for landscape architecture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupplement Your University Curriculum with Trade Skills \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eAre you just graduating from a university and entering the real world? University programs are crucial for the success of a well rounded professional, but its been the experience of many new graduates from a variety of university curriculums that they lack the \u0027trade skills\u0027 that are essential for a new employee to have in order to be a productive member of the office. University courses tend to rely more on the theory of the design of the profession, yet what employers want most from new hires is the ability draft efficiently, put a drawing set together quickly and accurately, follow office standards, effectively model in 3D and produce illustrative documents.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron and financiall supporting my education efforts, you can help prepare yourself to hit the ground running when you join an office\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe reality of \u201cSink or Swim\u201d Culture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eIt is widely assumed that you will receive adequate on the job training when you join a firm and that people in the office will routinely make themselves available to answer your questions or show you how to perform a certain task. That reality is that most design firms don\u2019t have a dedicated staff person who is always available to help you. Most firms don\u2019t have a standardized training manual that sufficiently on-boards you with sufficient training material. Many firms teach you by the \u201cSink or Swim\u201d method or \u201cTrial-by-Error\u201d methods. This is not because  they are jerks. Training takes time away from deadlines and developing training material is costly and is generally hard to implement/delivery to new employees in a timely way. Its best to train yourself on your time/dime. The payoffs in your salary/career path will be well worth your effort and investment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCommon Workplace Training Fallacies\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssumption 1: New candidates who join an organization are given training. This training familiarize them with the organizational mission, vision, rules and regulations and the working conditions.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReality: Many design firms don\u2019t have the time or resources of having dedicated staff member to train and/or have a clear training curriculum that is up-to-date and complete enough to onboard \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssumption 2: The existing employees are trained to refresh and enhance their knowledge.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReality: Most firms encourage you to be working on billable projects 90%-95% of you work week and will schedule you accordingly, leaving little room in your timesheet to bill to training; training is expected to be done outside of office hours. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssumption 3:If any adaptations and amendments take place in technology, training is given to cope up with those changes.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReality: Training is only as good as your current workforce. If your office isn\u2019t using the latest and most efficient technology, don\u2019t expect to receive training from a staff that isn\u2019t up-to-date. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssumption 4:\u00a0When promotion and career growth becomes important. Training is given so that employees are prepared to share the responsibilities of the higher level job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReality: One of the biggest fallacies of a workplace is that you expect your boss to be grooming and training you for a promotion each and everyday. Educating yourself into in a higher position is the quickest way for both yourself and your boss. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goals For You With This Patreon project.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncreases your reputation of your coworkers\u003c/strong\u003e- You would hope a coworker is willing and happy to help answer a question or two from you, and in most cases they are. But how much better would their perception of you improve if you are the one answering their technical questions? Become the person in your office that everyone goes to for help and everyone will appreciate you for the help you provide.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDecrease your supervision\u003c/strong\u003e- A well trained employee will be well acquainted with the job and will need less of supervision. Thus, there will be less wastage of time and efforts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDecrease your anxiety/stress with fewer accidents\u003c/strong\u003e - \u201cDid you move my XREF in my CAD file?!\u201d \"What did you do to my model?\" Errors are likely to occur if the employees lack experience and skills required for doing a particular job and the workflow of programs it requires. The more trained an employee is gardening these \"office smarts\", the less are the chances of committing accidents and the more proficient/less stressed you will be.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncrease your wages\u003c/strong\u003e- Time is money and every good supervisor knows it. The more work you can do in a hour, the more you will be compensated over your peers. Being well trained shows up in work in both quantity and quality of performance. There is less wastage of time, money and resources are properly trained\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChances of promotion\u003c/strong\u003e- Its simple: If you know more than your coworkers and are faster at you getting your work done, then you are more of an asset for the organization.
