    "summary": "Lie Likes Music is a weekly YouTube series that aims at explaining the story and facets of rock bands and artists in the form of 5 - 15 min videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img924/7586/ru8X6x.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi. My name is Christian Lie. I grew up in Vestby, a small town in the countryside of Norway. I\u0027ve been doing different projects on YouTube since 2014, but in 2016 i decided to start Lie Likes Music, a channel dedicated to rock music. I\u0027ve always been really interested in rock music ever since i was about 13. So since i had a decade\u00a0of listening experience within the field, i thought it would be a smart and fun idea to make snack-sized documentaries about it. And here i am!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore Lie Likes Music i ran a channel called Christian Lie. It was a channel where i made vlogs and personal development videos. It\u0027s still up and running, but i\u0027m not putting out videos anymore. Watching some of those videos makes me cringe... I didn\u0027t know what i was doing hah!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to loving rock music (and many other types of music), i also like jogging, entrepreneurship, self-improvement and watching absurd humor videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img922/2599/xjpgEk.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe goal of my channel is to make rock music more meaningful for other people. I believe i can do that through telling the stories of both famous and obscure rock bands/artists and also by teaching people about the inner workings of rock as an art form.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img922/8642/8fCxQD.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now i\u0027m posting about 3 - 4 videos per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img923/1821/pAgNTB.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main source of income right now comes from my two part-time jobs. I work in a clothing store every saturday and then as a door-to-door fundraiser for a charity organization 8 times a month. I also earn a little through YouTube adsense, but not enough to quit my jobs. My main focus is to possibly get enough\u003cstrong\u003e patreon pledges\u003c/strong\u003e to improve my videos and post more often.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img922/4690/6eJ8YA.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. Thank you! Lie Likes Music\u00a0would not be possible without your help. Patrons enable my career. I feel an enormous responsibility to deliver great videos to them -- to you -- and I work tirelessly to do so. I want this project to be something special. I want it to be a show you look forward to every week. Since the start, I\u0027ve tried to improve, innovate and push the boundaries of the format. I\u0027m interested in what YouTube can be, and I want to make the kind of content that could only exist there. Thank you so much for your help. Really. Making this video series\u00a0has been the joy of my life. I won\u0027t stop trying to impress you with every new video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
