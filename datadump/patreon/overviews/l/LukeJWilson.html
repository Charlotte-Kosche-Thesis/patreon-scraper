I love writing and reading, and learning more about the Scriptures and the Faith. What makes me really excited is being able to share that knowledge with others to help them along on their journey into the deeper things of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a recently \u003ca href=\"http://fortydays.co.uk/amazonUK\"\u003eself-published author\u003c/a\u003e and would possibly fall into the category of \"Christian theologian\", though I feel awkward calling myself that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut writing takes time. \u003cem\u003eA lot of time! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also requires certain skills that other people are better and more qualified in -- such as editing and proof-reading etc. I can do these things on my own (and possibly rope some friends into helping with too), but it would be so much better, not only for myself, \u003cstrong\u003ebut for you\u003c/strong\u003e, the loyal fans and readers, to receive an end product which is professionally checked and edited so that it can be the best possible book I can offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this costs money. I have a family to support, and \u003cem\u003eman\u003c/em\u003e.. babies are expensive (plus my wife wants \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e)! Babies/family take up much of my free time, along with my software business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnough about me for a sec. \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about you? What do you get out of this? Well, great content and books to read! Plus there are a few perks for pledging towards this which will get you a nice few bonuses, like no ads or \u003cstrong\u003efree eBooks\u003c/strong\u003e! Who doesn\u0027t want free stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally I\u0027d like to make writing more than a thing I do when I can scrape 30 minutes to myself, so that I can focus properly on what I write, what people actually \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to read and feel like it\u0027s more than simply a hobby. I am constantly reading and studying and have \u003cstrong\u003eso many notes \u003c/strong\u003eon my phone and computer of topics to tackle and write up on my blog, or to eventually fine-tune into a new book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said all that,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thatancientfaith.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e will always be free and I\u0027ll always be writing \u003cem\u003esomething, \u003c/em\u003esomewhere, so there\u0027s no pressure to pay to get any content (other than buying a book of mine via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fortydays.co.uk/amazonUK\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e, of course), but the extra financial and moral support goes a long way to help with this process. Plus, knowing there\u0027s people who care enough to give me money for doing this is a great boost to my confidence/motivation! So there\u0027s always that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whether you\u0027re here just to follow along and read my blog, give a dollar or more: welcome, and above all, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you for being here :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA short author bio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuke has a BA (hons) in \u003cem\u003eBiblical Studies and Theology\u003c/em\u003e and has been reading and studying the works of the Early Church Fathers for over five years.
