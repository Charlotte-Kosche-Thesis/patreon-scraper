Since our launch, we\u0027ve added over 100 bands, singer/songwriters, authors, film directors, actors, to our Blitz family, giving them the chance to be heard by our worldwide audience. The Blitz has been heard in virtually every country in the world. Yep, even China (when they turn the internet on.) It\u0027s our goal to be the go-to station for artists to have an advocate where they will be treated with the respect their hard work has earned them.

If we can find 5000 Patrons who can donate just 1 dollar a month that changes the dynamics of everything here at the Blitz. Not only will it allow us to turn our on-air talent from volunteers to paid radio personalities, but it will allow us to purchase all the music, books, and films that our indie artists donate to us. We\u0027d like to give back not only to the artists but to you the listeners as well! At the moment all music, books, and films you hear about on the Blitz is donated to us by the artists. We believe they deserve to be paid for their hard work, and by us buying their music, books, and films, not only will we be helping them gain royalties, but these items now become prizes for you the listeners. \u00a0This is why we ask for $1 buck a month. Grab a friend and you can both jump in for just $0.50 cents. \u00a0If you feel Radio Rock has value, and you can donate $1 Buck a month, you will be not only changing the lives of all who come our station but you will be instrumental in making Radio Rock 92.6 The Blitz one of the leading indie internet radio shows around the world.",
