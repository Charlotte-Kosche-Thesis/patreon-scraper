Bringing my medium of expression to patreon gives me a way to reach a different audience, a more difficult audience at that. My success with writing will be tested and hopefully rewarded here. This reward being the challenge... to make my target audience my peers alike. On a creative platform such as this, creativity will be an expectation if nothing else. Forcing the art of Hiphop to expand further... possibly creating new opportunities with my peers, and levels of respect for those who currently have little to no care for the art form referred to as current day Hiphop. My goal here is simple. To prove to myself and my peers that rap is an artform worth preserving and evolving. With your support I will be able to reach further than any contract will allow, and change the landscape of word crafting and storytelling for the better! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e",
