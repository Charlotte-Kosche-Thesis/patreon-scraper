    "summary": "\u00a0\u00a0 9 to 5 Nerds is a weekly nerd podcast with hosts Robert, Corey, and their trusty producer Katrina. We have rotating weekly guests who come talk with us about movies, comics, video games, and everything that falls into nerd culture. We did not set off on this adventure to make a profit, we started this because we are truly passionate about all of the things we talk about on the podcast. The point of this is not to make a profit, we are doing this for fun, the reason is so help with costs. Upgrading to a new hosting service, getting new equipment so we can do interviews with people, and getting out and covering events costs a bit. At this point all of that money has come out of our pockets which is fine, but we are now reaching out to our fans to see if they want to help. To all of you who donate I want to give a sincere thank you, and hey if you don\u0027t donate but listen you deserve a big thank you as well. \u003cbr\u003e"
