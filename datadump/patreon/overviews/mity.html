We\u0027re creating these games because there\u0027s not enough of them, and we love them, but we also hope you wouldn\u0027t mind tossing a few dollars our way.

We continually seek to prove how serious we are and how much content we have planned. We\u0027re pretty tired of how many game makers release tiny teases. We wanted something substantial, and don\u0027t be mistaken, this game is substantial. There are hours of content, containing dozens and dozens of naughty scenes with multiple characters, tons of quests, fights, intrigue, you name it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are \"books\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSticking to the \u003cem\u003eAvatar \u003c/em\u003eway of breaking up chapters, each \"Book\" is its own game, in it\u0027s own nation. \u003cstrong\u003eBook 1\u003c/strong\u003e is in the Water Tribe with Katara, \u003cstrong\u003eBook 2\u003c/strong\u003e is in the Fire Nation with Azula. \u003cstrong\u003eBook 3\u003c/strong\u003e is in the Earth Kingdom with Toph.

This will not only unlock higher levels of sluttiness (after hunting enough to unlock said activities), but is also the key to multiple quests.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTrain.

I\u0027m not telling you! There\u0027s plenty in there though. Alright, I\u0027ll give you one. ONE. Visit the mine a bunch.
