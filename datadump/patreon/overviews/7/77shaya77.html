Except the basics, I\u0027m mostly a self-taught.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThen, in 2007, I started drawing on the internet, on \u003cstrong style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/strong\u003e: what began as a pleasant hobby turned out soon to be a source of new experience and learning.\u003ca href=\"http://sta.sh/01gblsdf8xdp\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eOver the years spent on my DA page, I have to humbly admit that the quality of my works improved, thanks to the community and the advices and hints from the other visual artists\u00a0and friends.\u003cbr\u003eAnd again, It was thanks to the very DeviantArt that I discovered Patreon and its network. And I thought: \"Why not?\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is it: on my Patreon\u0027s page you will find mostly \u003cstrong\u003efanarts\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003efemale characters\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e Pin Ups\u003c/strong\u003e, which, let\u0027s say it, are my \"Weapon of choice\".\u003cbr\u003eAlong with the finished works, you will find the \u003cstrong\u003eStep-by-Step\u003c/strong\u003e process that led to the final product: this is also because I love \u003cstrong\u003eSketches\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eWIPS\u003c/strong\u003e and perhaps they will be useful for other artists in the same way they were for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do thank all of you, for paying visit to and supporting my page, and giving me the chance to further improve the quality of my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy my works...and \u003cstrong\u003ethanks again\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003efor stopping by! ;)\u003cbr\u003e"
