We knew there had to be a better way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the writing and shooting of this GBK (Gunrunner Billy Kane) series, we were dwelling on the creation of a long-term, self-sustaining show that was accessible to all people of any means. The idea was to use\u003cstrong\u003e a sliding-scale\u003c/strong\u003e to allow fans to support the series through a small monthly amount.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur goals became clear:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.

A fan-base\u00a0that gets to choose when and if they want to support a unique production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Gunrunner Billy Kane Sci-Fi series was released a short time ago and now has a fanbase that is growing exponentially. Thousands on Facebook, Vimeo, Youtube and Twitter have watched the show and are asking when Cycle two will arrive. (Cycle-Two is in post-production now) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re humbled that some of you appreciate the work and resources it takes to create an ongoing series and have become Patreons of the show. Thank You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Patreon/ viewer can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is really helpful for us to produce the ongoing series. For as little as 12 dollars per year, you can support a show that is truly one-of-a-kind. Can you afford 4 cents per day to support our series?\u00a0If you can great. If you can\u0027t right now..that\u0027s cool. Just enjoy the show and help us out by passing it along!\u00a0 An pro-active fan is priceless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will we use the money for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe set\u00a0an initial goal of $1000/month. That money plus the store income will be enough to keep the series active. Meaning more episodes being written and, hopefully, as more investors attach to our project, producing new episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are ongoing GBK costs:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u00a0A \"Cycle\" such as the first 10 episodes you see here (1 hour worth of footage) is expensive. It takes a month of shooting at various locations to create a Cycle of 10 episodes. We always have to have, permits, camera and lighting gear, transportation, on-set food, RV\u0027s for the desert locations, gas, workers comp, set insurance, crew, cast, transportation, post production, editing, sound, \u00a0visual effects, color correction and approximately 6 weeks of post production to deliver the finished product.

It\u0027s a website, so there are always upsetting glitches coming out of nowhere and occasionally, we add a new site feature.

We all have other jobs that keep the basic needs met but not much else.\u00a0 There are only so many hours in the day and a lot of those hours are used for production, especially for M.D. as he is also editing and mixing sound.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eOne employee. we need someone to handle keeping the internet updated, spam comment deletion, store upkeep, store customer service, website upkeep and repair, and a bunch of other little jobs. These things end up adding up to a few hours every day, and without this employee, there is much less time to write/produce.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThat\u0027s the basics.
