It will be like we\u0027re\u00a0reading you a bedtime story, only without the cup of warm milk or the\u00a0nagging questions about how we got into your house.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere possible we will read you a story we have discussed on the podcast.\u00a0We can only do this for stories in the public domain, and some may simply\u00a0be too long; when this happens, we will read you a different weird tale\u00a0instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccess to these recordings will be limited to backers. All backers will\u00a0receive new stories as they come out. Backers at $3 or higher will receive\u00a0access to the full back-catalogue as it grows.",

We will be selling them online, but\u00a0all our Patreon backers will get them for free. The specifics go like\u00a0this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 - You will get a PDF copy of each new catalogue as we release it.\u003cbr\u003e$3 - You will get a PDF copy of each new catalogue as we release it, as\u00a0well as PDFs of any existing catalogues.\u003cbr\u003e$5 - You will get a  print copy of each new catalogue as we release it, as\u00a0well as PDFs of any existing catalogues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are busy working on the first book (Lovecraftian Locations) at the\u00a0moment, and expect to release it in mid-to-late summer.",
