For\nfive years GvN produced its form of hilarity and shared it on the net\nfor free. The good news is that\u0027s not changing. The better news is,\nwe want to do more of it. Unfortunately, between life, jobs, and\nhater-slaying it leaves us very little time to expand. That\u0027s why we\nneed your support.  A monthly donation of $1 from our regular\nlisteners and viewers will go great lengths to expand GvN\nentertainment and allow us to create more web content, produce more\nshows, and tour to other cities and conventions.   \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease take a moment and a dollar to\nsupport us, and we will make sure it is used to entertain!\u003cbr\u003e",
