    "summary": "I\u0027m DJ Gilbert Matthews, and I run two legally licensed, 24/7 internet radio stations called The Retro Attic and Awfully Awesome 80\u0027s. The Retro Attic plays lost and classic 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s top 40 hits with hourly \"bottom 45\u0027s(truly forgotten minor and non-charters)\" and an hourly tune from a Featured Artist Of The Month. Awfully Awesome 80\u0027s plays lost and classic top 40 hits from the decade of excess with an hourly \"bottom 45\" and occasional weekend shows; special attention is paid to obscure MTV artists. I also do occasional podcasts(time permitting!) with my specialty being oldies record label showcases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have developed a good reputation for being different; of course I play the tried and true hits, but I love digging deep for those forgotten classics that terrestrial radio once embraced. Oldies radio these days is sorely lacking in deep playlists, and those of us in the internet radio world are trying to fill that void. Unfortunately, monthly streaming rates to legally broadcast have drastically gone up in 2016. If you\u0027re tired of corporate-controlled playlists and are looking for a couple of stations that are a breath of fresh air, then please help keep The Retro Attic and Awfully Awesome 80\u0027s afloat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for helping us out, you will hear many oldies that you forgot existed; you will also get to help program us by making unlimited requests and by telling us to ban a specific artist from the rotation for 2 weeks or a specific song from the rotation for 1 month! Feel free to check the stations out at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://retroatticrareoldiesradio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Retro Attic\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://awfullyawesomeeighties.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAwfully Awesome 80s\u003c/a\u003e - while there, you can request a live chat with me and I\u0027ll be more than happy to explain what is going on in the world of internet radio. Thanks in advance!"
