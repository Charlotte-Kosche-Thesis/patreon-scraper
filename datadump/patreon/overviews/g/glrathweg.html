You are amazing! I love you! You are the reason I get to do this job. I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit about me. I grew up in a area that was lets say, less full of Asian Americans, like maybe 10 in the town, I ended up joining the worlds created by fantasy authors. Starting with the classics like Tolkien and Lewis, I devoured fantasy literature. When my older sister let me read Piers Anthony and Terry Pratchette at the tender age of 10, it only intensified my love for the genre. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I got older and read all that there was to read, video games became more and more popular. You mean a real live choose your own adventure book? Sold! These two things, besides my loving girlfriend, family, and two crazy cats, and music are the loves of my life. I hope that I can share my own fantasy worlds with you now! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in the nations capital. My mother is from Korea, south, if you really need to know, and my father is from the USA, and is a 6\u00275 blonde hair American. I grew up all around the world. But, most of my time was in Florida, Cocoa Beach to be exact. Thanks to my father, I have lived in such exciting places as Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia! World Traveler baby! Yeah! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also did a stint in the USCG, Semper Paratus! I attended BCC and UCF! Go Knights!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I really do appreciate you taking the time to read my junk novellas!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHit me up on Facebook, Patreon, my podcast, and my new facebook group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://grathweg.podbean.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/glrathweg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2305071189719538/?ref=br_rs",
