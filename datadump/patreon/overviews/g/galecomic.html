As Gale\u2019s suspicions grow, buried memories of his mother\u2019s disappearance resurface and he refuses to hide from his dark past. With the help of his childhood friend, Laurie Gambill, Gale attempts to solve a seemingly ordinary mystery that could lead his life to spiral out of control. Will he uncover the truth to his parents\u0027 demise or will he become further entangled in the web of countless lies?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I read Gale?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGale is available to read for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/gale/list?title_no=118308\"\u003eWebtoon\u003c/a\u003e!

Patreon is a way to help indie creators like us pay our team so that we can devote more time to create top-notch content.
