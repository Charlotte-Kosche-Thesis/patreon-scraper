I am also not going to suggest that I can offer you amazing prizes, and super exclusive wisdom if you decide to pledge. \u003cstrong\u003eI am just a broken man who was put back together by God.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If I claimed to be anything more, I\u0027d be overstating my value. \u003cstrong\u003eAll glory is God\u0027s.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that being said, I love the Gamerfaith community passionately. You have truly changed my life, and your pledges help me to spend more time making Gamerfaith content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGamerfaith is currently a hobby ministry for me. I also work (I\u0027m currently a substitute teacher), go to college, and have a wife \u0026amp; family. Your monthly pledges help to support my family and I financially. This accomplishes two things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e1. It allows me to spend more time making Gamerfaith content. This improves quality and quantity of videos, posts, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. It helps me to afford upgraded equipment which improves the content.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few (seemingly insignificant) dollars here and there can add up. God can use your (small or large) contributions to change lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink about this for a moment... If less than half of Gamerfaith\u0027s subscribers pledged $3 a month (That\u0027s like 2 Mountain Dew\u0027s a month), Gamerfaith could become my career. That would give me A LOT more time to spend meeting people in the community, reaching out, and creating content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy pledging you help me to create:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideos for the Gamerfaith channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/gamerfaith\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyoutube.com/c/gamerfaith\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eContent for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gamerfaith.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGamerfaith.com\u003c/a\u003e website!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSide projects (Like E-Books) that are intended to help people in need.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge means the world to me because it shows that you believe in our mission.
