    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.gotaukulele.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Got A Ukulele website\u003c/a\u003e has, for some time, been one of the most popular sources on the Internet for impartial advice and reviews for ukulele beginners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing people wrongly assume though is that I get paid to write the site - I don\u0027t. The majority of the instruments I review are provided on loan only and I dont charge brands anything to write about them. The only income the site generates is a small amount of Google advertising revenue, but believe me - it doesn\u0027t pay the bills. I also want to ensure that the \u00a0loan reviews are mixed with non loan instruments - that keeps things balanced and more impartial - but that takes funds. And I am NOT buying them to create a mammoth ukulele collection for myself - I simply don\u0027t have the space! Once they are reviewed they are donated to local schools and charities, or sold to fund more ukes (which eventually end up being donated to the same places) The whole thing becomes self sufficient. So for there to be more reviews, more have to be acquired!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI WOULD like to keep the website going but have to justify it. I\u0027d like to get hold of more gear to review, but I can\u0027t do that on my own (or at least without losing my marriage!). \u00a0Think of dontations as a means to keep the site going, but eventually your funds end up with a charity or schoolkids to help people start enjoying the ukulele. Alternatively of course, you might just want to donate to say thank you. Of course that is hugely appreciated too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor whatever reason you assist, my thanks to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://http:/www.gotaukulele.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.gotaukulele.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
