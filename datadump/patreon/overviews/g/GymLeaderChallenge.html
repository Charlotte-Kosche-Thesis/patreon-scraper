    "summary": "Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign is for a fun pokemon event by fans for fans. After Pax East rolled around one of the events that stuck out was a 3Ds/2Ds pokemon tournament they held. It got fans of the series involved, fighting \"gym leaders\",collecting their badges, and granting bragging rights for a series that calls you to be \"the best there ever was\". Our local anime convention \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=1\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.animazement.com%2F\u0026amp;ei=wHpFVfbpLMi0ggTp5ICIDg\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNF5ryCgAhwGujxbi0dnnsAVxdvEzw\u0026amp;sig2=sET1QvVZKWCcFq3Z6wJfKw\u0026amp;bvm=bv.92291466,d.eXY\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAnimazement\u003c/a\u003e is pretty great, but there always seems to be plenty of downtime. The idea to recreate what Pax East did, and try to do it even better is our driving force. Plans have already been made for months now. The gym leaders have trained their pokemon and are ready for challengers and many of our supplies have already been paid for out of pocket. Some prizes are coming directly out of the leader\u0027s collections and many of the physical rewards are personally made creations that any fan will enjoy. This event is not a sponsored Animazement event and is 100% run and funded by fellow con goers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what would your contributions be helping us with? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds will go directly into the event. It will help cover supplies and prizes including: button materials (badges for defeating a gym leader), sashes and arm bands that the gym leaders wear to indicate they are a gym leader and to display and carry the badges for the attendees to earn, promotional materials, and the prizes. Yes you heard it right, prizes! Not only will collecting physical badges be a sweet reminder of your victory, but collecting 8 unique ones from our leaders grants you the title of \"Pokemon Master(s)\" (yes, we hope more than 1 can prove themselves to be a master). Ideally we would like the first to collect 8 to recieve a special prize, and any additional Pokemon Masters that follow, receive a completion reward. This is one of the main milestones of this campaign. Regardless of theses goals we will be having raffles on both Friday and Saturday evening. All those who have earned the Pokemon Master\u0027s title will get added to the raffle box and prizes will be given away, and yes, those who complete it before Friday\u0027s raffle do get to participate in both raffles. Some prizes have already been made (and are being made) but better and more prizes can be offered with additional funding. If you strive to be the best then we do too. We hope to make this an entertaining and memorable event and thank you for your contribution in helping that come to fruition!\u003cbr\u003e"

Specifically it will cover the badge costs, the identifying armbands and sashes, the promotional materials like rule cards and a few flyers, and lastly the prizes. There is no real way to gauge how many attendees will participate our event let alone how many become \"Pokemon Masters\" so the best way to ensure every victor has a shot at winning rather than first come first serve is though our raffle system.
