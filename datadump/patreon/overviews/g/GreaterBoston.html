It is a story of the Boston you know, the Boston it once\nwas, the Boston, we might wish it could be; a Boston where Wonderland\nis still an amusement park, the Spectacle Island trash fire is still\nburning, and the North End still has molasses in the streets. It is\nthe story of a radical plan\u2014a state-wide referendum to release The\nRed Line from its bureaucratic tether, and to establish a city of Red\nLine, incorporating all its trains, tracks, and stations, and tunnels\ninto a single mobile municipality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can listen at\nGreaterBostonShow.com! You can also find us on iTunes, PocketCasts,\nor most other podcatcher apps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe show is written and produced by\nAlexander Danner and Jeff Van Dreason. It is a love letter to our\ncity as much as a satire of it; a celebration of our community and an\naffectionate ribbing of the people who comprise it, ourselves\nincluded.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eGreater Boston is a work of many hands.\nAlexander and Jeff are responsible for the writing and production,\nbut it would just be words on paper without the assistance of the\nmany people who contribute their various talents throughout the\nproduction process. More than two dozen actors appear in our show, in various\nlarge and small roles; six musicians (most of our music is original\nrecordings); and of course Marck Harmon, our recording engineer,\ndevoted countless hours to making sure we had good, clean recordings\nof all of it to work with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe State of Production\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been working hard on Greater\nBoston since late 2014. Our 12-episodes of Season 1 is complete and freely available for you to download and listen! Season 2 is also complete, with 12 full-length episodes and six mini-episodes. We\u0027re currently on hiatus as we write and record Season 3. During the hiatus, we\u0027re releasing mini-episodes every three weeks to give our listeners a little reward for their patience. We also do not charge our Patreon patrons for mini-episodes, only full-length episodes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are serious about what we\u0027re doing, with a solid\nbuffer of completed work, a clear and realistic production schedule,\nand a commitment to giving our listeners a consistent experience and\nrelease schedule; there will be no delays or late episodes. New\nepisodes will be released every other Tuesday until the season is\ndone.
