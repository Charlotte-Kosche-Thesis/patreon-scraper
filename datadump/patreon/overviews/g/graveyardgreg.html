I\u0027m known for such webcomics as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gamingguardians.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGaming Guardians\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cdcomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCarpe Diem\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dungeond.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDungeons \u0026amp; Denizens\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m also known for my fiction such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/155128\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Species of Blessing Avenue\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/33174\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDEATHLESS\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, it takes money to help certain aspects of writing. While I would not mind just throwing out my fiction into the wild blue yonder, I feel it\u0027s important to give you readers quality work, and that means editing and having good covers for the stories. Some of the support will help pay for such things. The more support I get, the better the editing and covers can get. And believe you me, I need all the help I can get when it comes to editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCARPE DIEM\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0was a webcomic that ran for thirteen issues, one annual and a Halloween Special. Then it went on hiatus. It still is on hiatus, but I\u0027ve decided to wrap it up by writing the final storyline as a novel. There might still be a comic, so consider the novel to be an adaptation of it or the comic to be an adaptation of the novel, your choice!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe storyline in the novel will be six months after Trent (the giraffe on the right) tells his ex-lover Burt that he has cancer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot can happen in six months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my patreon grows, so, too will the projects. Thank you for considering my patreon, and we\u0027ll hope to see you soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
