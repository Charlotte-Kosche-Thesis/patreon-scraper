From our\nvery first conversation on the surprisingly progressive but ultimately silly,\nLittle Darlings, we\u2019ve made it our goal to bring you a few hours of laughter\nand entertainment each month. The show has evolved in just a short amount of\ntime to include listener feedback, theme months and birthday shows as well as\nanniversary shows voted on by you, the listener. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe still want to do much\nmore... But we need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy donating to the show\nthrough Patreon, you\u0027ll be assisting us with not just the day-to-day operations\nof GTGM, but also helping us plan for the future. With your patronage, you\u0027ll be\nallowing us the time and resources to not only produce the show that you\ncurrently enjoy, but also create more content, purchase better equipment,\nmaintain the website, keep our old episodes on iTunes, design merchandise and\nhopefully get us out on the road to perform live shows!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat we\u0027d like to do\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eMore content:\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0027re looking to step up production on sync-able commentary\ntracks and bonus episodes. As we\u2019re sure you\u2019re aware, these take time \u0026amp; money\nto produce.    \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBetter equipment: \u003c/strong\u003eWhile the sound of our show is passible, There\u2019s certainly room\nfor improvement. Your patronage will help us acquire better mics, mixers and\nother recording gear.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eDesign Merchandise: \u003c/strong\u003eAs of now, we have nothing at all with our logo on it, let alone\na t-shirt with the phrase \u2018I\u2019m magic\u2019s bitch!\u2019 on it. We\u2019d love to offer items\nlike these as rewards to listeners and any bit of money to get started would\nhelp.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eGet out on the road: \u003c/strong\u003eWe love the online community we\u0027ve developed through since\nstarting the show, but there\u0027s something exciting about the idea of doing an\nepisode of the podcast in a comedy club, or a real time commentary in front of\na theater audience. With your patronage, we hope to be able to cover all the\ncosts that go into touring including travel, lodging, venue fees and, for some\nlive commentaries, film licensing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat you can expect for\nyour donation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\nthing you\u0027re certainly going to get out of becoming a patron of GTGM is more bonus podcast content that non-patrons won\u0027t have access to! As of right now, this\nmeans seasonal bonus episodes and the option to choose a particular film for us\nto cover on a regular episode of the show. If there is enough interest from the\nlisteners, this may eventually lead to conversations of 80s cartoons or\ntelevision shows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe love watching these films\n(even though some have been difficult to get through) and regardless, we\u2019ll\ncontinue to bring you the show every other Friday. But time is moving on, and\nwe\u0027ve realized that if we\u0027re going to turn Good Times Great Movies into\nsomething even greater, now is the moment to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for\nlistening and even considering giving back to the show,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDoug \u0026amp; Jamie\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGood Times Great Movies\u003cbr\u003e"

In addition, we will offer up an extra episode at the end of the calendar year in which we cover a holiday episode of a cartoon from the 80s. Think, A Garfield Christmas, A California Raisins Christmas, etc. We want to reward those who support us and the best way we can think of doing that is through more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e- Doug \u0026amp; Jamie\u003cbr\u003e",
