    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a musician for most of my life. I spent years in practice rooms as a kid, passed a lot of theory exams, prepared for a career in classical music, and then took a left turn somewhere along the way and did a bunch of other stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got my first harp when I was in my mid-20s, and I wrote my first songs in roleplaying games. Sometime in my 30s, I discovered the filk community and got involved with a little band called Three Weird Sisters, where I started writing songs in earnest. I\u0027m influenced by traditional folk song, balladry, magic, mayhem, the interplay of darkness and light, and the way nothing feels better than a really good kiss.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron means you hear new songs as they\u0027re written. Much of what I share here lets you share in the songwriting process from its bare beginnings. I post new songs and lyrics here for patrons only, and what you\u0027re doing when you support me is enabling me to carve enough time out of the rest of my life to continue doing this, writing and recording songs, at least part time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m writing a series of songs in preparation for a new album. This is exciting for me because I haven\u0027t released a solo album in, well, years. I\u0027m really pleased with what I\u0027ve been doing; it\u0027s some of the best songwriting I\u0027ve ever done, and this is the place where it\u0027s all unfolding. All the new stuff is here.\u00a0"
