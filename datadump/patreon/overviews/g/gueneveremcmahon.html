    "summary": "I have always been an artist, but only now at the tender age of 47 have I decided to pursue art as my primary vocation instead of something I work at as a sideline. I recently left a full time university position as a Costume Designer, and what I miss most about working outside my home studio is having an audience--I enjoyed being able to work creatively with other people, and find that while my pit bull puppy, Choux-Choux, is happy to sniff a drawing here and there, she appreciates food a lot more than art. Also, she chews on sewing machine cords.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work in a variety of mediums due to the depth and variation of my interests in visual expression. My two main art forms are drawing (with colored pencil and marker) and fiber art (both wearable and art quilting). I was featured in Art Quilting Studio\u0027s Winter 2017 edition and was thrilled to know that so many people saw and appreciated my work. Supporting me means you never know what you\u0027ll see, but as a theatre professional I love a deadline, so knowing that you are here, waiting to see what I\u0027ll produce next, is very exciting. Welcome, and thanks for visiting my page.\u00a0"
