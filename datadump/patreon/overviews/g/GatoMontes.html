I promptly hated myself for monetizing one of my few sources of genuine altruistic pleasure, but who\u0027s perfect, eh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you read some of my work, you enjoy the world I create, or you honestly just feel sorry for me in a \"awk bless, they think they can write\" way, hell I thank you all anyway, thanks for helping me do what I enjoy: rambling madly via text at anyone who would be mad enough to listen.\u003cbr\u003e"
