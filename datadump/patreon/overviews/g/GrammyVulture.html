    "summary": "Hi Sunshine, I\u0027m Grammy Vulture. You can call me Leah. I\u0027m happy You\u0027re here. I hope you stick around and join the fun. I am usually BLUNT in your face and straight to the point. Here goes.....Why I need money for something I already give freely...Everything I do is paid for out of our home budget. My puppies are quite spoiled and usually the snacking budget takes the hit. Awe... poor puppies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eToday I am forty five and I live in Washington State US. I AM HERE TO SHARE MY BIG CRAZY BRAIN WITH THE WORLD. I have an amazing husband, Grandpoo Vulture, Martin, You may see him once in a while too! I am a woman who loves to make videos. I am on YouTube too. In fact, almost all these videos are there too. I enjoy cooking, making crafts and sometimes just hanging around. I want to share my life with you. If you learn anything, I am happy. I Direct, Produce, Star in, Film and Edit all my own videos. I am self taught and still learning. I am a Mom and Grammy and Friend. I gave natural birth to two and also have five step children. I have almost seven grandchildren. (One is on the way still.) The children are all grown and off to there own lives. I have two beautiful chihuahua mix dogs. One from a friend of Grandpoo Vulture, Max is 12 years old. One from the local shelter, Sam is 2 years old. I have two fish, guppies, we call one \u0027fish\u0027 and we call one \u0027meany fish\u0027. This is my family.\u003cbr\u003eI am here to share my life. Thru blogging videos. What I have on offer is my everyday life. I am not famous, I am just a regular girl. Everything takes money. The electricity to run my computer, and stove even. I put a lot of time into cooking crafting, and filming. I hope to entertain you and give you a reason to keep coming back. If you can not afford to give money, I totally understand. I appreciate you, please leave a comment to show your support too.\u00a0 Free? Nothing in life is really free, yet\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF0FVV0Ag6swVsyxH2Ae0Rg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e you can still watch for free.\u003cbr\u003eI hope to make you smile every time you visit. Plus someday have enough really good recipes to make a cookbook. I am not ready for that step yet though. I need to really test out my recipes. Here is one of my bestest ones.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/3QnWrs1PBCM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCherry Pie\u003c/a\u003e. Just mentioning it makes my brain work on recipes. Please support me in the journey. Being here supporting me means YOU are the ones who will have the recipes first. When a recipe is one I would not mind using over and over again. It is one for the book. I hear printing and publishing is harder than directing, producing, and editing. I am not there yet though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you just for taking the time to read all this.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
