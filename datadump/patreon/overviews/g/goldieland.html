    "summary": "My name is Goldie, and I am a visual artist from the Philippines currently living between New York and Rhode Island. I need your help to continue making my glass sculptures and installations! I am currently setting up a glass lampworking studio in Providence, Rhode Island and working on several projects in New York.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work deals with beauty, scent, nature, and my culture as a Filipina woman, like a flower waiting to be born from the dirt. I immigrated to America after receiving my MFA from RISD, and have been trying to live out my dreams of producing engaging work that brings people closer to their own experience of nature and sensing the world, with a touch of Filipina magical realist flavor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour first month of support has gone towards material and studio rent at Atelier Goldieland in Rhode Island and in the Brooklyn Fire Proof Stages, where I am currently a part of a women\u0027s art collective and working on a performance series involving scent, history and narrative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsually\u00a0I create sculptures,\ninstallations and performances that are grounded in the body, nature and the\nsenses. Often interactive and experiential, the themes in my practice center on\necofeminism and the body as it relates to my culture as a Filipina woman. I am\ninterested in exploring the relationships of scent to ecology and memory as it\nrelates to identity and storytelling. My work often addresses the politics of\nimmigrant culture through sensuality and the poetics of space and narrative. Through\nthe practice of glassblowing and its links to perfumery I recreate, shape and\ndevise sculptural tools and experiences that engage the senses. The sculptures\nare often incorporated in installations that serve as sets for performances\nwhere I create unique spaces for experiencing scent.  It is spiritual, invoking a sensation of\nmagical realism through fabricated rituals that reimagine cultures that are\nlost, colonized or undocumented. In my performances I explore synesthesia\nthrough collaborations with musicians and movement based artists, in order to\ncreate environments that allow for a full immersion of the senses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current entrepreneurial project involves the creation of glass jewelry based on a beautiful experience I had while in the mountains of Puerto Galera, Philippines. I was there with a group of artists and we were doing research on the local plants in the area. I noticed that a young girl was wearing a fragrant local flower on her clothes. I asked what it was and she said that this was their form of perfume - pure, decorative and impermanent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to combine my love of sculpture, scent and nature through a project that is entrepreneurial in order to help me create more installations and performance work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can view my portfolio website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://work.goldieland.com\"\u003ehere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eChristina\nPoblador, 30 years old, was born in the Philippines where she received her BFA\nin Studio Arts in 2009 before becoming one of her country\u2019s first few artists\nto pursue glass. In 2015, she obtained her MFA in Glass at the Rhode\nIsland School of Design where she was the President\u2019s Scholar for two straight\nyears.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe is an\nartist and a feminist exploring the art of glass blowing, performance and scent\nin contemporary art. Her work interprets autochthonous narratives\nfrom Philippine history and culture and shapes them into conceptual creations\nthat reflect her love for nature and her unique, cross-cultural personal\nexperience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHer work\nhas been exhibited extensively in the US , Europe and Asia including The Knockdown Center, New York; The Clio Art\nFair, New York; Islip Art Museum, New York; Cemeti Art House, Indonesia;\nSingapore Art Museum, Singapore; Bangkok Art and Culture Center, Bangkok; MuseumAtelierhaus\nMengerzeile,Berlin; Cit\u00e9 Internationale des Arts, Paris; Fine Art Museum of\nHanoi, Vietnam; Lopez Memorial Museum and Library, Manila; Metropolitan Museum\nof Manila, Philippines; The National Museum of the Filipino People, Manila; The\nCultural Center of the Philippines\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe won\nthe Philippine Artist in Residency Prize of Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Manille in\n2013 and was a finalist for the Ateneo Art Awards for two years.
