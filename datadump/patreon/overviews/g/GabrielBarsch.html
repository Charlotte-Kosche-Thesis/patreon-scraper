With your donations I will not only be able to keep making videos, but being able to continue working on videos each donation will help improve the quality of my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will make the most use of your pledge to pay bills and buy new equipment or programs that I might not otherwise be able to afford. With your pledge you will be able to help me produce animations a lot faster without any further occupations or distractions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Madness Combat ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMadness Combat is a flash series about senseless killing and plotless violence broadcasted on Newgrounds.com, created by Matt \"Krinkels\" Jolly, the amount of fans that this series has made is rather large, just like the stick figure community used to be. But this kind of content has become desaturated over time, a lot of people have dropped interest or moved on to different things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Why Patreon ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis kind of content is very time consuming, difficult and tedious to make, and very poor rewarding in some regards as well as unprofitable. But with your support I will be able to work a lot faster, and spend more time on making my silly comedy fused violence. I make sure to aim in quality of my cartoons, rather than going from a quantity standpoint and regurgitating the same \"Man wants revenge, he walks into place and kills tons of people untouched\" scheme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a side note, you will not be paying for me to make collabs, compilations, shorts, loops or any spam movies I make. This is strictly for my own solo made movies, that are made for enjoyment rather than an inside joke. My upload schedule is always aimed for September 20th, Patreon donators will be benefited with early access to my videos, screenshots and previews!\u003cbr\u003eYour suggestions and ideas are very important to me as a content creator, so don\u0027t forget to give me some feedback on my videos about what you think could be improved, or even what you liked the most and would like to see more of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease Note: Becoming a Patron is Totally Optional !\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe animations will still be released to everyone on youtube and Newgrounds without any fees or advertisements, but your pledge will help support me financially while I dedicate more time to work on new videos, and even special bonus content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
