I am Claire Cassidy (she/her), also known as \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/GeekStarCostuming\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eGeekStar Costuming\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e or just GeekStar. For over 10 years I have made wearable accessory art like shiny acrylic lasercut geeky themed jewelry, LED glowing costume cat ears and LED glowing feather hair accessories. I identify as a maker and geek, full time. LEDs and lasers are my love languages.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/26BFrqbm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy pledge a monthly donation to me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause a\u00a0momentous thing has recently occurred, dear reader. Unlike previously when I had to outsource my laser designs, I now own MY VERY OWN powerful laser cutter. It is a Glowforge Basic, and it is my new sweetheart. It currently resides in the intimacy of my living room. It is named Laforge, because it is smart, attractive AND funny.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo put it mildly this is significant because I am a HARDCORE laser NERD. Having taught myself from the ground up as a wearables artist I believe I have an engaging and enticing approach to lasercutting and laser design. I also have approximately 1 bajillion un-prototyped methods and designs I need to work through or my brain will explode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8zF6aeTl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nAnd here\u0027s why I need your help, dear darlings:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nHonestly, vulnerably, I need to get back to a living wage so I can breathe and eat and make room to be creative again.\u00a0I have been quite successful as a full time artist all things considered for how difficult the dream truly is. The key reason for that is because over the last 8 years I have made the bulk of my income by traveling to, setting up, vending at, breaking down and driving home from large events. Everything from comicons to street fairs, sci-fi fantasy conventions to fashion shows. Maybe we met there!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnd it\u0027s been incredible. I have learned and grown so much, I am so rich in life experience and eternally grateful for that. However, it is an extraordinarily high-paced lifestyle and I have finally hit a wall mentally, emotionally and physically. I can\u0027t continue the rate at which I have been vending. I need to shift to more productive online work, and get back to more creative work.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/f06oFt5l.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLast year I attended about half of my regular events as a vendor and my income took a nosedive.\u00a0I struggle with anxiety and depression and it has been a very hard year for that with my business in flux. It is clear that my path needs to be more sustainable and give me breathing room, as well as integrate time for creativity and play, if I am going to survive as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VspwyCGl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA custom necklace I made to survive a convention last fall, which inspired me to make other mental health assisting and themed pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon and your subscription is the trampoline made of dreams and clouds to bounce back on that I never thought I would have a chance at. If I could go from currently starving, struggling artist to sustainable happy human oozing creativity and sass once again, well...it would mean literally everything to me. So Thank. You. for even being here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Brq8xcQl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I am embarking on this new path, I will still be attending 2ish large events a year (which I will make a lot of noise about here and on my social media) so I can see many of your wonderful faces. Hopefully if I am already making a living wage outside of that I can focus my time at events on making my presence there more fun and exciting then ever, giving more hugs, and savoring my time with everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZaHSid4l.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat YOU get!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou should be warned, I am outrageously motivated by cold hard cash for my efforts. I will BRING IT for my followers! 100% real GeekStar, shiny, unfiltered and pure. Socially I will invest the time and attention to interact with my fans and friends that I don\u0027t traditionally put into my social media because I\u0027m scrambling to make ends meet. AMAs!
