Patrons can see my progress develop during residencies in patron-only posts, while my weekly studies and older works are patron-only for 21 days before being released to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need this support help me take the next steps: getting into studio space, buying materials to develop more studies and final works, and spending more time in residency programs. These residencies are essential to my development, learning, and networking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn general, I take abstract ideas and I develop them into works that can be more easily understood by the general public. It is important to note that several of my projects often mix with each other under the same over-arching project, which is noted below. For example, I spent a year working on minimalist charcoal portraits before that line was combined with Color Field studies to produce minimalist Color Field portraits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project focuses on the gap between the media\u0027s message and the audience\u0027s understanding of the truth. More specifically, I create works based on the question: what would that gap look like if it were a real place instead of just a concept or state of mind? So I take messages from the media that I think are not completely honest and I ask what would the objects used in these messages look like if they were actually real. I do this mostly with paintings, sculpture, photography, and installation works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy would you support me?\u00a0By becoming a patron, you would be supporting an artist dedicated to increasing critical thinking of the media, expanding transparency, and encouraging dialogues between parties with contrasting ideas. But more importantly you\u0027d be supporting a driven creative goal, one that started with a bad day at the office and ended with a piece of art hanging in a museum. Do you want your name next to that piece as someone who helped me get there? So do I.

     "about": "Greg Mason Burns is a contemporary artist who focuses on emotional unknowns and in particular societal pressure, adventure, fear, frustration, stress, and chaos. His current works include paintings using oil, watercolor, charcoal, and oil pastel, and can be abstract and reductive in nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has recently dedicated himself to establishing the movement known as Novo-surrealism. Novo-surrealism is an aesthetic, conceptual-art philosophy that he created during the events leading up to the 2016 coup d\u2019etat that resulted the impeachment of the Brazilian President, Dilma Rouseff. Philosophically it examines how the media and the media\u2019s audience communicate with one another with the understanding that there\u2019s a gap of understanding between the two parties. Aesthetically it recreates in visual terms what that gap of understanding might look like if it were an actual place instead of a state of mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe creates works, using whatever materials are necessary, that define or describe this gap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has been heavily influenced by Ernest Hemingway, Wassily Kandinsky, and in general the Fauvism and Expressionist movements, and to some extent transcendental idealism.",
