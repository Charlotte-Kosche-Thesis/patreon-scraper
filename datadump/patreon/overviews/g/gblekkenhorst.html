Next year, I will become more aggressive with my releases: You could call 2018 an Anthology Year, releasing small games \u00a0that are stand-alone vingettes on a regulated schedule. \u00a0And in 2019, I hope to start releasing episodes of a more sustained storyline, probably either \n\t\u003cem\u003eDemon, Embodify Thyself!\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eComfort vs the Annihilators.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e"
