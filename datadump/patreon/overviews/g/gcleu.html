Wolff.\u00a0 Started nearly a decade ago in Manhattan\u0027s Brecht Forum, these monthly updates on global capitalism began as small intimate discussions of major economic events and trends from a critical perspective. The 2008 crash of global capitalism had provoked growing interest in understanding an increasingly unstable and unequal economy. Anxiety was also growing about the direction of jobs, incomes, debts, rents, and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last few years, our host has been Manhattan\u0027s historic Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square. Each month we explore the twists and turns of a declining capitalism, their causes and effects, and how people might best respond with new directions in economic life and institutions.\u00a0The programs begin with 30 minutes of short updates on important economic events of the last month. Then Professor Wolff analyzes several of today\u2019s major economic issues. Our goal is to develop all viewers\u2019 understanding and ability to explain current economic events and trends to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGCLEU has always been available to all free of charge on YouTube for the last 7 years. But now, to keep this series going, we ask your help to cover the costs of producing and bringing these programs to you. We ask each member of our live audience for a $10 donation, but we understand and accept that while some can give more, others can only contribute small amounts.  Every dollar of your generous contributions enable our work to continue. Thanks for your commitment and for partnering with us to make these programs possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron of the Global Capitalism series \u003cstrong\u003eyou will get access to exclusive content and a wide range of archives for videos spanning years! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
