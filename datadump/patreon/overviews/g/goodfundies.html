    "summary": "Since its debut on April 7, 2016, Good Fundies has chronicled the highs and lows of the New York Mets over the podcast airwaves and on social media. Every Terry Collins decision. Every off-season move (and non-move). Every GIF-able moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re Brian Mangan (\u003cem\u003eMetsBlog\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHardball Times\u003c/em\u003e) and Roger Cormier (\u003cem\u003eFangraphs\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMental Floss\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSplitsider\u003c/em\u003e), and we pride ourselves on being honest, informed, funny(ish), unique, and above all, independent, and staying that way requires a little help from our incredible fans. We want to continue our podcast and expand with a website that pays writers to write about the Mets, baseball, and the things and attitudes baseball and its fans embrace, without resorting to advertising. Good Fundies fans are the most engaged, knowledgeable, and good-looking fans around -- the show would be nothing without you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter presenting 60 episodes (with over 20,000 listens!) and engaging tens of thousands of baseball fans on Twitter @goodfundies (Mike Trout follows us for some reason!), we are asking for your help to expand. We want to have the freedom to continue producing new podcast episodes and build http://goodfundies.com into a website reporting on everything and anything a Mets/baseball fan would be interested in, free of any interference from a team or advertiser. (In the way \u003cem\u003eRolling Stone\u003c/em\u003e is about music, Good Fundies is about the Mets. The early, cool \u003cem\u003eRolling Stone,\u003c/em\u003e of course.) If we can scientifically determine that Gavin Cecchini is a better dancer than Jerry Blevins, we want to break that story. If Jeff Wilpon has been hoarding millions of dollars inside walking boots in a vault hidden behind a secret Willets Point speakeasy, we want to break that story too. We want to be as fully engaged as possible in making something that is a function of what we are: hopelessly devoted connoisseurs of pain, and occasional sweet, sweet joy. Also, we will never ever ever ever ever never ever become exclusively comprised of video content. That dream can only happen from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn example of what our reporting can bring to the table:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://goodfundies.com/new-mets-manager-mickey-callaway-who-is-this-guy-does-he-know-things-54bc87d292b1\"\u003ehttps://goodfundies.com/new-mets-manager-mickey-ca...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur iTunes page:\u003cbr\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/good-fundies/id1101545191?mt=2\u003cbr\u003e"
