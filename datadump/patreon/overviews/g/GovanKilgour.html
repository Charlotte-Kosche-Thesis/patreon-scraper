It varies because some topics require detailed coverage to be a complete breakdown, while recipes, or short news updates can be much more succinct. The average video length can be assumed to be around 20 minutes though, so base your donation on what you think you\u0027d like to contribute for something around that length.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe article scheduling for \u003ca href=\"http://GovanKilgour.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.GovanKilgour.com\u003c/a\u003e can vary depending on a \nnumber of factors, but the more my audience grows the more the content will increase in quality and quantity. The three \"macro topics\" I cover are health, socio/political issues, and spirituality, so if you only wish to sponsor 1 or 2 of those 3 topics, by all means simply deny pledges at the end of each month for any topic you don\u0027t want to contribute to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I have three YouTube channels, it makes the most sense to just have one central Patreon account since many of my readers and viewers do follow all of my work. I hope you can learn and grow from the well referenced, critical thinking I apply to the issues I cover! I am immensely grateful for your patronage, or even your participation as just a viewer as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e for taking the time to study health above and beyond the basic level of ideas we see repeated online, and thank you for also allowing me to have this platform.\u003cbr\u003e"
