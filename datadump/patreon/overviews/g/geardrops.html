    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m a writer in San Francisco (that is, I\u0027m a writer when I\u0027m not working at my day job). Mostly science fiction, fantasy, and horror, stuff that\u0027s kind of a blend of all three. Right now I\u0027ve got a few stories published, most recently in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nightmare-magazine.com/fiction/and-with-her-went-the-spring/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNightmare Magazine\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027m working on a novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s this Patreon about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s pretty simple. Once a month, I will produce one unit of art, like a short story, which I will post here on Patreon, for all to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m only making one support tier of one dollar per month, to support said unit of art. I\u0027m starting as simple as possible, while I figure this thing out for myself, and I wanted to make a promise I was confident I could keep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your Goals?\u00a0What will you do with the $$$?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomeday I hope to be writing full-time, and this feels like a good way to get that ball rolling.\u00a0Since this is about writing, I plan on using the money for writing things. Stuff like, paying for my Microsoft Word subscription, contributing to travel costs for conventions, things like that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon? In THIS Economy??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get it, money\u0027s tight, and not everyone can spare a dollar a month. But that doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t want and need your support. Luckily, supporting art is more than just money! There\u0027s loads of ways to do it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e - You can click Follow.\u003cbr\u003e - You can share my Patreon with others.\u003cbr\u003e - You can share my fiction with others.\u003cbr\u003e - You can click like on my posts.\u003cbr\u003e - You can leave me comments cheering me on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that does a LOT to help me out! For one, sharing lets other folks who may not know about me see what I\u0027m writing, and see if they\u0027re into it. For two, hearing that people like what I\u0027m doing and seeing them share my work gives me such good feels and inspires me to write even more! So, don\u0027t worry, there\u0027s more ways to help than just money :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, thank you for reading this, thank you for wanting to support me, thank you for being here! I appreciate you!"
