You can see some of my finished articles\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://gekk.info/articles/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere on my website\u003c/a\u003e though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve also written about ADHD, human sexuality, masculinity and the agony of living under capitalism. I want to get all those tweet threads into articles, and write further articles about all those topics and more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to the website I have a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXnNibvR_YIdyPs8PZIBoEw\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e which I hope to pack with an obscene amount of videos, though those will be less socially conscious and more about my interests. I like old computers, electronics and videogames. There\u0027s weird stuff out there, and I want to document it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m good at explaining things and people tend to like how I dig into a game or a device and find elements to be fascinated by. One of the more complete projects I have is a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gekk.info/vga/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edetailed narrative\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eof obtaining a vintage IBM PC and learning how to capture video from it, along with reviews of several types and methods of video capture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also into woodworking, particularly hand tools, and while I\u0027m still a beginner I hope to put up some content about that eventually.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThings I\u0027ve Made Or Intend To\u003c/h1\u003e\nIn addition to the couple articles linked above, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve already uploaded several Youtube videos, including:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI painstakingly restored an antique hand drill\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI browsed antique radios on eBay with my friends and commented on their aesthetics and design\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBought and disassembled a weird game controller and I want to do more of that\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBought, disassembled and demoed a Japanese computer and I want to do more of that\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI bought a broken keyboard, opened it up and figured out how it was built and how it was broken. I don\u0027t want to do more of that - I want to buy instruments that work!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a substantial collection of 80s computers - MSX, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST - and I want to do a lot with those:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDemo games with analysis and commentary. There\u0027s plenty of let\u0027s plays and clips on youtube, but I\u0027d like to talk about the experimental nature of a lot of older games, in particular\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDemo utility software. This is a huge thing for me - I don\u0027t just want to do games, I want to find old spreadsheets, databases, word processors, \u003cem\u003erecipe catalogues,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and see how they worked\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also want to:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eGet older IBM PCs and explore 80s and 90s software - particularly utility programs, but games as well\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAcquire a Colecovision and ROMcart. Those games were fascinating!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAcquire an NEC PC-98 and play the first three Touhou games (:P)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAssemble a complete red Sharp X1 (they\u0027re beautiful machines)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDo teardowns and repair on vintage electronics\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhy Pay Me\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t promise anything. I have a lot of anxiety and depression and a busy life and sometimes I go months without putting anything out. But I will definitely put out \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0if I have money coming in, for several reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst, donations would convince my animal brain that people appreciate what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\nSecond, they would make me feel more compelled to put stuff out, because I would feel a little guiltier. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to put up static webpages, not just videos, for whatever I can. Also, any software I acquire should get imaged and go up on Internet Archive so I can provide downloads in my video descriptions.\u00a0That requires more effort and time, and it\u0027s very hard to stay motivated. Income would help me keep on track.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor my vintage electronics stuff, I need to buy old equipment at surplus stores and eBay. That means I need extra cash - I am in substantial debt just from the first month of semi-casually collecting for my own interests.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn other words, if you like what I\u0027m doing, send me some money and I\u0027ll almost certainly do \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of it, I just can\u0027t promise quid-pro-quo. If there are specific things that would convince you to contribute, let me know and I\u0027ll see what I can do!\u003cbr\u003e"
