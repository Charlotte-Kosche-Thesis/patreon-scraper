I always say it, \nbut I am seriously just a regular dude using my creativity to make a living. Now that I have a following of over 30,000 fans that have invested their time and \ntheir trust into me, I won\u2019t let you down and I will not stop making \nvideos to help better your life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84,141,212);\"\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84,141,212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future of My Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI plan to continue producing informative series for FREE on YouTube because I \nunderstand that not everyone can afford formal schooling and there are \njust some things that I can share that you cannot learn in school...plus....I \nam a very giving person at heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84,141,212);\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eShow Your Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo get to the next level that YOU want me to be at, I am going to need the support of my loyal fans. Time is Money and like everyone else out there creating Free content, I \nhave bills. I currently work and freelance about 60+ hours a week and on top of this all, in my free time, I run this blog\u2026..but my most important job is taking care\n of my family.\u00a0I am and have always been someone who puts 110% into everything and most\n nights I work well into the AM hours to support them. Each YouTube\n video takes at least a full day set aside for things such as planning, \nstoryboarding, sketching, recording, video editing, and designing \neverything from the actual tutorial piece and all social media graphics \nto accompany them. I also answer all emails, social media messages and \nvideo comments which take up a lot of time as you can imagine......and here\u0027s the kicker......I\u0027ve been doing\u00a0it all on MY OWN from the beginning for FREE. There is \nalso a cost in purchasing new software, lighting and camera equipment as\n time goes on. I want to take my teachings to the next level and be able to dedicate my time doing new things for YOU like personal one-on-one coaching and critiquing, live events, hangouts, podcasts and of course more frequent tutorials and design tips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeing A Patron Has Some Very Attractive Perks\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e (see below)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
