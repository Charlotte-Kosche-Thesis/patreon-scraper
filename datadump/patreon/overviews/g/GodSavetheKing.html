What many do not realize however is\nhow dramatically this one fact alters the traditional Nativity Story. For\nhundreds of years, believers and unbelievers alike, clergy and laity, student and\nscholar, took it for granted that Jesus was born on December 25th.\nAnd as a result, their research and teaching on the subject supported this notion\nbecause it was simply assumed to be true. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the mid 1980\u2019s I was introduced to a provocative\ntheory regarding the accurate birth date for Jesus of Nazareth\u2014and you guessed\nit\u2014it is not December 25th. This theory fascinated me because it was\nbased on detailed biblical, historical, and scientific evidence, and not on\ntradition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike\nmany of you, I wanted to know the truth, or at least the facts\u2014I wanted to\ndecide what I believed on the preponderance of evidence and not on tradition. As\na result, I have been researching and teaching what the Nativity Story would have really\nlooked like for over 25 \u00a0years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\narticles, videos, online discussion groups, and other products produced by this\nproject will answer the obvious question, \u201cIf Jesus was not born on December 25th,\nthen when was he born?\u201d And many more. Just a sampling of these questions\nincludes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhy\ndid God choose shepherds as the first to receive the message that the Messiah\nhad been born?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWho\nwere the \u201cwise men\u201d?

The community that is growing around this subject\nthrives on digging into the historical, archaeological, astronomical, and\nbiblical evidence that reveals the social, political, and religious realities surrounding\nthe birth of the Christ.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen\nyou sign up for a tier reward you will become eligible for one or more of a\nvariety of educational materials produced by \u003cem\u003eGod Save the King\u003c/em\u003e.
