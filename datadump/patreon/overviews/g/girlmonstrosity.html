I take my work to local markets and I draw portraits at markets and on the street of our local tourist town. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My name is Tori, i\u0027m 26 years old and live in Christchurch New Zealand. There is no dire need for me to raise this money, but it would cover all of my basic expenses for 2015 (not including art supplies and classes etc) and greatly reduce the financial pressure on my hardworking mother, who at present, picks up all the slack when i cannot afford unforseen costs, ie doctor, work on the car, vet bills for my little dog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week i can contribute very little to mum\u0027s mortgage (the property we both live on) and the cost of my own groceries, from my benefit as an invalid (now called supported living). I have been surviving on government money since being discharged from Kennsington hospital two years ago, where i was admitted for trying to end my life, and stayed for three weeks. I have a long history of depression, generalized anxiety and poor physical health, caused by severe glandular fever when i was 13 years old. These days i am finally starting to regain some energy, thanks to a wonderful doctor, and have been able to attend multiple courses on socialphobia and anxiety, thanks to the wonderful, fully funded clinics available in the Christchurch area. Most recently completed the Recovery Works course at MHAPS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the while my mother has helped me drag myself out of bed in the mornings, driven me to the doctor, driven me to clinics, paid for prescription meds and been my best friend and support worker, often taking days off work to stay at home to keep an eye on me, or sit on the couch and let me cry all over her. I can confidently say, i would not be alive today if not for her. She has been the most enthusiastic supporter when it comes to doing what i love, which has always been (since i was 3 years old!) art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow in 2015, after a very productive (possibly the most productive year of my life) 2014, i hope to push myself even further and create things that make people smile. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the later part of this year drawing, studying and painting birds and was given a years pass to Willowbank Wildlife Sanctuary for my birthday. One of my mid to late 2015 goals is to hold a small exhibition for artists (myself included) to sell artwork inspired by nature and donate the proceeds to Willowbank and/or Orana Park (depending on how well we do). These wonderful, inspiring places depend on donations and fundraising and have some of the most successful conservation programs in the country. It would be a great chance to exhibit some artwork for a good cause. At this stage it is just a dream and i have yet to raise money for venue cost etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryday or weekly goals. I believe in healthy living, equality, buying local, protecting the environment and supporting the community.\u003cbr\u003eIf i could raise $1000-$2000 i could invest in a cheap cargo bike and sell my Honda City (which sits mostly unused anyway). I would love to be able to bike out to Prebbleton to get fresh locally grown produce from the small green grocer there. With a good enough bike i would be able to take my little dog, Abby along with me. She is the most gorgeous and lovely dog and always makes people smile. If you get to stop and have a cuddle with her she will make your day, and often gets told so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith excess. If i were to achieve a healthy income i would like to become a patron of the arts. I see so many wonderful budding artists in little galleries around the place, and i know how wonderful it feels to sell something you\u0027ve poured your passion into. Supporting other artists is not expensive and you get a wonderful artifact to brighten up your home! I am also a book-addict and like to support my local secondhand bookshop and Scorpio (independant book sellers) in town. Any books i have read enough or do not need get donated for fundraising, along with clothes and other bits and pieces. \u003cbr\u003eFor my own mental health i keep a number of animals to care for but i would like to be a better supporter of SPCA too. This might mean donating art, volunteering or buying supplies from them rather than cheaply elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is all i really have time to write up at the moment but more details in future if needed.",
