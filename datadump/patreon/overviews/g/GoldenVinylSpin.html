Over the past two years of posting videos for all of our followers we have never asked for a cent and strongly use to be against asking for money because collecting records and passing\u00a0 our knowledge is a passion of ours. However, since starting our channel we have learned that even passion cost money. We have spent $100-$1000\u0027s on camera gear and editing programs and advertising to get our brand and knowledge passed on. Even if your a stay at home mom making videos you soon learn that it cost money. We also sponsor our own radio broadcast, buy all of our own camera gear, lighting, records to review. Even most products we have done free promotions, we had to buy the product first and ask the company\u0027s if we could do a video on their product. This gave them a free product promotion.\u00a0 We like to bring you the best honest videos we can for your entertainment. By becoming a Patron it allows us to start to make some money to be able to improve our gear, help pay for road trips to shows, buy more products to be able to give honest reviews and much more....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eif you can afford to become a Patron, that\u0027s ok. Continue to enjoy our videos. Our videos will never cost you a cent to watch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can afford to become a Patron it cost as little as $1 per month ( or what ever amount you like to give)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goals are to become the best one stop channel that you can enjoy and learn all about collecting records.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach video we strive to make something different that you can relate to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
