    "summary": "Welcome to the GD Art Patreon page. This is the place where you get to be a part of the planing and creating of this channel and help me make some really great gaming content. So far in my short time making videos I have focused on Dungeons and Dragons. I have a series on getting started playing D\u0026amp;D, some tips and tools for game masters, interviews with people currently playing D\u0026amp;D, crafting videos on creating 3D elements for your table top game as well as reviews on affordably table top gaming products. I have recently been getting into LARP, Live Action Role Play and been able to show you what I do to prep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of my channel is aimed towards aspects of gaming that are new to people. So someone who has never played D\u0026amp;D or a new game master, or people who have never played an MMO RPG, and letting them see me do these things, meet others who have played, all to make our great hobbies (or professions) accessible and less intimidating to people. I want to be able to show viewers what it looks like, what people wear, how it works so the anxiety is eased and people will be more open to diving into our gaming world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here then you are already considering the value of supporting this cause. I love what I am doing and I will continue to bust my butt to keep doing it. With your help, however large or small that may be, I can do it better and more often. The more support you can offer the larger a role you will be able to play in the planing, production and benefits of these videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me inform and entertain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to visit and read all of this, and for stopping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
