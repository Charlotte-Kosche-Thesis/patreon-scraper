    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Camille, and I run GayWrites on Tumblr and YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2010, I\u0027ve been blogging about LGBT+ news and media on Tumblr. Every day, I write about LGBT+ headlines, find cool media by and for our communities, and build up the voices of other LGBT+ writers and artists. A little while ago, I also started a YouTube channel where I talk in-depth about how LGBT+ issues affect me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe response has been amazing and humbling. Nearly 200,000 people read GayWrites. That\u0027s an incredible network of people who tune in to learn from each other about issues that affect us all. GayWrites readers come from all over the world and have all kinds of identities, backgrounds and stories to tell. When we come together and speak up about our lives, the results are powerful. And in a world that often tells LGBT+ people we don\u0027t matter, it\u0027s a life-changing feeling to hear firsthand that we aren\u0027t alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do so much more with GayWrites. I want to write more posts, make more videos, build a better website, collaborate with other LGBT+ writers and YouTubers, and more. But producing lots of content for zero profit is really taxing, financially and mentally.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach year, I pay to host and maintain GayWrites.org. As the demand for video content builds, I want to invest in better recording and editing equipment. Every so often, I invest in professional design help to make GayWrites.org more user-friendly. I began selling GayWrites stickers a few years ago and have sold just enough to cover the printing costs, and many of you have requested more merch. Sometimes I buy books or other things to give away to readers. And it would be a dream come true to know that the 15+ hours I spend on GayWrites each week were helping to pay my rent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGayWrites content has always been (and always will be) free to access. GayWrites.org is ad-free.\u00a0By becoming a patron, you\u0027re supporting the work I do every day, you\u0027re sticking up for LGBT+ media and online community-building, and you\u0027re believing in the future of GayWrites. As a small thank-you, I\u0027m offering cool perks -- and my infinite love and gratitude -- in exchange for your contribution. Even a dollar a month makes a difference.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support so far, and please consider becoming a patron!"
