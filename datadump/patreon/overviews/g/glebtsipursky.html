When people get bad information and believe in lies, they make bad decisions: garbage in, garbage out, as the saying goes.\u00a0People fail to get accurate information and thus make bad decisions in their everyday lives, which results in them losing\nmoney, time, relationships, health, and happiness.

My activism aims to\naddress the messed-up decision-making and lack of long-term orientation that\ndrastically undermines people\u0027s personal well-being and success on an\nindividual level, and that results in fundamental challenges and dangerous\nrisks, including catastrophic and existential risks, for our society. I do so primarily in my role as the volunteer President of Intentional Insights (\u003ca href=\"http://www.intentionalinsights.org/\"\u003eintentionalinsights.org\u003c/a\u003e), which popularizes these ideas for a broad audience, to which I dedicated almost all of my volunteer time and 10 percent of my income.

My aim is to produce high-quality, rigorous content, and every article I write goes through a rigorous editing process, as do all posts at Intentional Insights. It takes me about 25 hours of effort to research, write, edit, pitch, and promote the post. Thus, I usually write about 2 or so articles per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the articles are high-quality, as is my work in general, they attract substantial media attention, with media venues writing to me wanting to interview me, and also with me pitching the article to various media venues that might be interested in it. So each article may result in several media appearances - an unpredictable number, depending on how timely and newsworthy the article happens to be. For each media appearance, I take time to do research on the venue and prepare talking points, and sometimes have pre-show discussions with the hosts on what we will talk about on the show, with the result of an average of 3 hours of my time per appearance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post only the original article and each new media appearance on Patreon as paid posts. You should consider the time I put into my creations in evaluating how much you want to spend per article or appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso keep in mind that Patreon\ncharges you once a month for all the posts I made that month, and you can set a\ncap on the amount you pay. So if you like what I do and think my creations are worth\n$10 each but you can only afford to spend $30 per month, set that as your cap. You can also do a once-monthly support if you wish. Remember, you are only paying if you want to support my activism, because all the articles, videos, podcasts and so on I post here are also freely available elsewhere, such as on my FB page and Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in conclusion, pay the amount of money that you think each piece is worth, in proportion to how much time I spend on it. That way, you can show your values - what you truly care about - with your money!\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1619848/thumbs/s-MONEY-HEART-large640.jpg\" style=\"width: 503px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo in a nutshell?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIn a nutshell, our world is\nmessed up because people believe in lies and make bad decisions that really harm their happiness\nand wellbeing on an individual level, and cause big problems and catastrophic\nand existential risks for our society.
