My name is Gavin and I am the founder of \u003ca href=\"http://gameswarp.com/studio\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGamesWarp Studio\u003c/a\u003e, a one year old, one-man-band independent game development studio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFormerly a senior engineer and project manager, I decided to follow my passion after more than 20 years travelling down a road that was basically leading nowhere... I\u0027m sure you have heard that story before, so I won\u0027t bore you with the details. Anyway, that was perhaps the best decision of my life, for here I am - finally able to create fun and innovative games for everyone to play!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been playing games for more than 30 years now and have lots of experience with every genre that is out there. Somewhere along the way, I also picked up programming - and as they say, that was\n\u003cem\u003e a match made in heaven\u003c/em\u003e. Over the years, I have mastered C, C++, C#, Visual Basic (the big 4) and a plethora of other languages. Nowadays, when I am not working for a client, I make games (and applications) and then release them to the world for free. At the end of this writeup, you will find samples of what I have released so far - with links for you to try them out directly. In the meantime, I hope you have already watched the video I embedded above... it features game play from Pachinko Parlor, my most popular game by far...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlright, let\u0027s get straight to the point.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI need \n\u003cem\u003eyour \u003c/em\u003ehelp to bring GamesWarp Studio to the next stage. Kickstarter may be a do-or-die-semper-fi kind of website, while Patreon is definitely more crowdfunding friendly, especially to content creators like me. Pledge what you can, so that I can continue to work on getting great stuff out to you. I have in mind several mini-projects I wish to release to the world for free: a shoot-em-up game, an RPG game, several kid-themed games, an adventure, and a sci-fi simulation game.\u00a0Let\u0027s go through what I lack now: I need to invest in a good game development engine - and I think there is no better engine than Unity. I also need funding for professional artwork included in my games. The art you see in our games is either drawn by myself or free art resources obtained from the Internet.\u00a0Your patronage will help me greatly in these areas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlright, I have made my statement... so that\u0027s out of the way.\u00a0Now, for the fun part...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFREE GAMES/APPLICATIONS/OTHER STUFF\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuzzball\u0027s Fortress\u003c/strong\u003e - this game was my idea of having a reverse Angry Bird game.
