    "summary": "Hi! My name is Gera (any pronouns), and I am an aspiring queer writer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see from my header (is that how that thing is called?), my goal in life is to write stories for women who love women. As a gay woman myself, I feel underrepresented in the media, and more often than not, my representation is mishandled. When I was in the process of understanding myself and coming to terms with my sexuality, I longed to see myself in my beloved stories. I wanted the princess to escape the castle herself and run away with a handmaiden; I wanted the knight to be a tall, strong woman; I wanted to see the girl get the girl for a change. As I grew older, I clung to any resemblance of representation. To me, just like to the majority of you, I\u0027m sure, the subtext is text, because that\u0027s all we really have. Media proved that it can\u0027t be trusted to handle our stories right. Mostly because people who write them aren\u0027t us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I want to be someone who brings our stories to life and, as an actual member of the community, is a part of those stories. I want to be able to fully devote my life to writing our stories, and this is why I am here - so you can help me bring joy to our community. So we can see our love stories, life stories, horror stories, romance stories, mystery stories - so we can finally see ourselves as someone who isn\u0027t just a tragic plot device.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all of you amazing peeps who appreciate my writing (hello, my bbies from tumblr and ao3) chip in a buck every month, I will have enough to quit my time- and soul-consuming job and focus solely on writing, which will mean many\u00a0more works and an undoubtedly higher quality as well. All of you seem to quite enjoy my work on other platforms, and I can guarantee that anything I publish here will be bigger and better. So many of you have reached out to me, thanking me for my work and telling me how much my stories helped you. Helped you accept yourself. Helped you cope with a difficult time in life. Helped you mend your relationships, even! And I want to keep helping you. There is no bigger joy than knowing you made another person happy. I would love to fully dedicate my time to crafting those stories that make you feel so many wonderful things, and to do so, I need to have some sort of income. And I hope that you will help me do this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hopeful and grateful for all of your help. You\u0027re making my dream come true, and I will forever cherish this. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

It\u0027ll help me move things along and hire people I need to hire for these two projects. Hopefully, very soon you\u0027ll be able to hold a paperback copy of my work!
