Maybe you played Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons as a kid, maybe video games or board games are your weapon of choice, or maybe you just love getting lost in a great story. Through the use of role playing games and collaborative storytelling techniques, the Glass Cannon hopes to not only\u00a0entertain but inspire people to play more games and get back into those nerdy creative hobbies they gave up long ago when life got in the way. With your support, the Glass Cannon brand can expand to include not only one podcast, but one for every day of the week; not only audio, but video content too! We have a lot of exciting plans for the future. Help us get there and you will be glad you did!\u00a0"
