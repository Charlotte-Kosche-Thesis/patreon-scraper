If you\nwished to increase your support, for high-resolution tier monthly rewards, you\nwould need to pay the difference between your current car and that car\u0027s cost\nfor the higher resolution tier. For example, if you paid to move 9 cars ($27+$3\nfor the month) you would need to pay that difference to get all those pages in\nhigher resolution ($20 extra, as each move and the month\u0027s payment would be $5\nfor high resolution for a total of $50, not $3 for a total of $30). \u003cbr\u003e\nThe same applies for going from a $5 high-res tier to a $10 threshold for\n4k-resolution. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2.

The closest-most car you can reach as a new supporter may move\nto a two month delay in the face of additional security concerns or sheer\nnumber of pages.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note! \u003c/strong\u003eIf\nPatreon cannot process your payment for some reason, there is a three month\ngrace period before we will consider your account with us forfeited and cancel\nyour delivery subscription as above. If there are circumstances that would keep\nyou from paying for such a period, notifying us beforehand with a legitimate\nclaim will allow us to pause your account, rather than flagging you as\nforfeited.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf Patreon not be able to process your donation, you will be notified that the\ndelivery of content is suspended. This happens quite often \u2013 such as if your\nbank details change, you lose a bank card or your account is overdrawn. If you\nsolve the problem quickly, there is a high chance Patreon will be able to\nprocess your donation without missing updates.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you miss 1 month, then on the 2nd month Patreon is able to process a payment\n(the usual amount per month) \u2013 you will get the pages of the FIRST month you\nmissed, effectively moving down cars to keep pace with the rewards you have\nalready earned! You\u0027re buying the whole book, remember, not part of it and due\nto security issues we are no longer distributing only the newest pages of early-access\nmaterial to those who offer to support but only make a payment every handful of\nmonths in order to claim all the content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEach missed month\ndonation will cause a lag in your updates by a month\u003c/strong\u003e. You will\nlikely receive these in a lump update once a month - immediately after handling\nthe donation all of the pages created in that month will be accessible to you.\nAs opposed to an up-to-date \"Car #1\" account where each new page is\nuploaded when created.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf your account is lagging behind, you can \"catch up\" all missed\nmonths by making a proportional contribution (your usual amount due over the\nnumber of missed months + the coming month). In this case, after Patreon has\nprocessed your donation, you will get all the updates for the missed months and\nwill receive the new pages as they are uploaded to the server.\u003cbr\u003e"
