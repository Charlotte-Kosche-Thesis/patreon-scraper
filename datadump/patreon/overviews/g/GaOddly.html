I\u0027m a 23 year old musician from Hodgenville,Ky the birth place of Abraham Lincoln. Other than that, and a corrupt local government, Hodgenville isn\u0027t known for anything. I\u0027m more than determined to change that. I find it crazy that even people who live in Kentucky dont know it exists. Okay enough about where I\u0027m from let\u0027s talk music... Ohhhhh music! I love it! There is no word other than pure love that could describe my feelings for making a song I know the few fans I do have will love. I had a tough childhood mentally. I was admitted to mental hospitals, put on medications \u0026amp; attended special schools at a young age. My Mother \u0026amp; Step Father supported me through that rough part of my life. I developed social anxiety and even now continue to deal with issues of depression. My therapist once told me I should have at least ten coping skills, I had plenty, but only one worked.... you guessed it Music! Having social anxiety is something that holds me back from advancing in many aspects of my life. Its very difficult to have face to face conversations \u0026amp; the crowds?...geez they get my heart racing and I get the sweating. Its just too much for me to handle at times. When I create a song I can communicate from the heart with people that I don\u0027t even know. I try to make music I feel a lot of people can relate to. I want them to know your not the only one struggling, I\u0027m right there with you. I know what it feels like to be viewed differently because of who you are and what you look like. I know what you\u0027re feeling when you say I\u0027m depressed and don\u0027t want to leave the house. Also, I call myself Ga\u0027Odd Braga often, please keep in mind I do believe in a higher power. I know He or She is our creator so in my mind that makes us all Godly beings no matter the color of your skin. When I say KKK that\u0027s stands for Krazy Konnected Kiddz (Krazy) because we believe in peace and where I was raised there is no such thing as peace. If you try talk about peace they\u0027ll think your krazy. (Konnected) because we\u0027re connected mentally, meaning we understand each other. (Kiddz) because we\u0027ll always be children of knowledge. I spelled everything with a K as a stance against racist. My music will explain more about that. Well thank you for your time \u0026amp; I hope you have a blessed day."
