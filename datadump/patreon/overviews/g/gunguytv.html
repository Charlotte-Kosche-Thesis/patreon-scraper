    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Joel Persinger and I\u2019m the Gun Guy!  I love shooting, hunting and making great\nvideos on Youtube, Dailymotion and BitChute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started GunGuyTV on YouTube as a hobby in 2015. It\u2019s been\na wonderful experience and I have truly enjoyed every minute of it!  My son helps me whenever he can. But, even when he has\nto work or can\u2019t help for other reasons, I still create new videos each week\nabout guns and gun related stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGunGuyTV\nmay have started out as a hobby, but it has grown way beyond being a hobby at\nthis point.  It\u2019s taken on a life of its own. \u00a0To be honest, I never thought it would grow like it has. Every day I look at the stats for the channel and it blows my mind. I\u2019m so grateful for your support. Without you, GunGuyTV would never have amounted to anything. Your support has spurred me on.\u00a0Now,\nI have some goals I\u2019d like to reach with the channel, and I could use your\nhelp.  That\u2019s why I\u2019ve teamed up with\nPatreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, here are my goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027d like to make the best gun videos on the internet.  I want to establish a place where honest\nfolks can learn about guns, shooting, and the Second Amendment in a clean and wholesome way that you\nwon\u2019t mind having your kids watch with you. \nIn order to do that, I need to purchase some equipment, another\ncamera (or two), a new computer for editing, and I desperately need to have the\nability to purchase ammunition in bulk to extend my purchasing power.  To do those things, I need money that I\nsimply don\u2019t have.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProduct reviews need to be objective and honest. \u00a0As a result, I don\u0027t charge manufactures and retailers for reviews. \u00a0Unfortunately, reviewing products free of charge eliminates a major source of income that we could use. We\u0027d like to continue doing free reviews, but in order to do so we need your help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\nwant GunGuyTV to continue for a very, very long time.  In fact, I\u2019d be thrilled if I could spend my\nretirement working on this project and producing great videos for you. In order to accomplish this, the channel has to be self-supporting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTaking the channel on the road is a big goal of\nmine.  I\u2019d like to bring you videos from\nplaces you might not be able to go yourself: like SHOT Show in Las Vegas; the NRA Annual Meetings and the Great Outdoor Show.  There are also some hunting trips I\u2019d like to\nbring to you through GunGuyTV.  But, it\nall costs money and I need your help to do it.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStarting a podcast has been on my list of goals for a while.  I didn\u2019t think it would cost much to do it.  Boy... was I wrong! \u00a0Even so, I bit the bullet (no pun intended) and invested in the equipment and the project. \u00a0Now that I\u0027ve started, I want to continually improve the podcast with better equipment, interesting guests and a lot more. Unfortunately, it all takes funding. I need your help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eSupporting GunGuyTV on Patreon will allow me to achieve the\ngoals I listed here, along with a lot of other cool stuff I\u2019ve got\nplanned.  I\u2019m sure it goes without saying\nthat I am very thankful for your support, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway.  Thank you very much for watching and\nsupporting GunGuyTV.  I really do\nappreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRespectfully,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJoel Persinger\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
