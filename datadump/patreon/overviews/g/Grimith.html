The theme here, \"Let\u0027s Get On With It!\", originated from my ancient Dailymotion account: \". . . because I\u0027m the only one playing. However, since we\u0027re all watching me play, it seems perfectly natural to SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH IT.\" Effective results have yet to be seen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t do this for financial reasons. Viewers regularly ask for more ways to give me stuff. The rise of Corporate Grimith has been a slow process, and it gains strength through this Patreon\u0027s existence. By making a contribution, you will become part of the problem. Your money will pay for my gourmand lifestyle and ameliorate other expenses. In return, I offer you contempt. Are you so bad with money that you must entrust it to me? Buy an ice cream! Save an animal! Make better life choices, I implore you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I do not lock my content behind a paywall, Corporate Grimith may offer incentives. You can\u0027t control what I do or save yourself from being blocked, but you MIGHT get a kitschy trinket out of it all. And, really, isn\u0027t life all about making choices you\u0027ll regret five minutes later? Gotta learn somehow, right? (\u30c4)\u003cbr\u003e"
