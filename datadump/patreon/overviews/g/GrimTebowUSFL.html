    "summary": "My name is Rich. I\u0027ve taken the name Grim Tebow on the internet after the greatest college football player of all time if he writing for a Halloween episode of The Simpsons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love many seemingly unrelated things; fancy beers, football, arts and crafts, and dumb internet jokes. My downtime is truly monopolized by these activities, for \u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003efun\u003c/b\u003e. I think the key to all of these things is enjoyment, they make people happy, they start conversations, forge friendships, create their own language, and change the way people look at things. Unfortunately, they are all often taken really, really seriously. This is fine for a lot of people, but to me \u0027\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003efun\u003c/b\u003e\u0027 should be the goal.\u003cbr\u003eI want to bring some \u003cstrong\u003efun \u003c/strong\u003eback to Fantasy Football, back to the NFL, to the old grizzled meme veterans. I\u00a0want people to take a moment and realize that maybe, just maybe, we don\u0027t have to take this stuff so seriously. The coloring book will be the major project, but there may be other things in the works like podcasts, joke books, flawed fantasy advice, and other exciting stuff, that can all be worked out later. Right now it\u0027s all about the coloring book, and making it worth it to support with some extra content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFull disclosure, even though my main goal here is to bring \u003cstrong\u003efun\u003c/strong\u003e back to people who take it too seriously and remind them why we all love Football and the internet, I would also like to make money. This idea was born out of a conversation with my wife who told me that I couldn\u0027t afford to make it to my in-person fantasy draft, unless I found \"someway\" to pay for it. I already work, and work extra, I save, I told myself if I\u0027m going to fund a \u003cstrong\u003efun\u003c/strong\u003e trip, it\u0027s going to be through a \u003cstrong\u003efun\u003c/strong\u003e endeavor. Lucrative or not, this work is so damn enjoyable to me, all money not going into printing and shipping will go towards my league\u0027s fantasy draft and keeping it as over the top as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 240px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLets have fun, again.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eGrim Tebow\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 140px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*Founder of the USFL (Ultimate Super Fun League)*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
