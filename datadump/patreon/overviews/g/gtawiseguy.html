So I\u0027ll thank you now for even considering to help and being curious enough to read thus far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of YouTube having it\u0027s own problems, I\u0027ll be honest about my own situation. Following up the content I\u0027ve found myself passionate about and truly at home with in these recent months; modding vehicles for GTA V. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve found myself falling into a sticky situation financially as the work I put in to serve my own and the communities passion for car culture in Grand Theft Auto, has become somewhat of a burden as infrequent content is not rewarded by YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese ambitious projects take time and non stop man hours to deliver a polished industry standard piece of work, that the car community in V deserves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I strive to pay intricate detail to every part of my work, the YouTube clock ticks away as the algorithm favors daily and consistent content which can\u0027t be guaranteed on my part as it depends on the scale of each project and thus financial support from YT is incredibly inconsistent and not sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not post regular content then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not to say I can\u0027t produce daily content, I certainly can as I\u0027ve done so before and enjoyed it for a time. However, this short form pumped out content is not what I\u0027ve come to enjoy any longer or what you as my fans have become (at least I would hope) mesmerized by. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my fans suggesting what projects to take up, I\u0027ve endured to produce the cars the community wants to see and in doing so I\u0027ve found I can apply all the skills I\u0027ve picked up as content creator into a single content package with cinematics, gameplay, commentary and of course the 3D work as the subject of the videos. However, to truly do the content justice the production of such takes a lot of time to be produced at an industry standard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ll receive various rewards depending on the tier you subscribe to, mainly focused on providing insight or having you directly involved in the development of each project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecognition for your support through my videos and tailor made rewards to your choosing such as mod pieces for each vehicle that players can apply as a customization option to use in the final free to download public mod and appear in my videos.
