Your support will give us the ability to keep making amazing videos, and taking our dogs on great adventures, camping, hiking, and more!  Maybe one day we can even upgrade our cameras to make our videos even better!  \u003cbr\u003eSo who are we?\u003cbr\u003eWe are a husband and wife, with 3 furry kids, and 1 furry angel.  Shiloh was our first husky, she started our love of the breed.  She was on our Youtube channel for the first three years of her life, and sadly passed away on Jan 17, 2013.  Then we have Shelby.  She was our second husky, and her and Shiloh were who helped us to start doing YouTube Videos!  Later on we adopted Oakley!  She is a furry fluffy butt that has stolen our hearts.  And then there is Baby Memphis, the newest member of the pack. \u003cbr\u003eOn our channel \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/GonetotheSnowDogs\"\u003eGone to the Snow Dogs\u003c/a\u003e, we share insight into the life of our dogs.  We go on adventures, make treats, answer questions, and share part of the joy of having a dog in your life!",
