All I have ever wanted to do was share my thoughts with the world, let people behind the curtain and into the madhouse. I love gadgets, tech, scifi, science, anime, I love it all! I am also a huge believer in medical marijuana and for good reason. I am currently on disability due to a severe injury I sustained several years ago. That injury led me down a dark road of pain killers and serious health issues. I have also been diagnosed with depression. \u00a0I hope to help educate people about medical marijuana so I will do a biweekly review of several Medical Marijuana strains from dispensaries \u0026amp; collectives on the show to update and educate people on the uses and benefits of the various types of cannabis available. I hope you come give it a listen just remember...we\u0027re all a little mad here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this patreon because for the last year I have covered all the expenses of the podcast out of my own pocket but im on a limited budget. \u00a0This could create the possibility of creating more content by helping to cover the hosting cost etc. \u00a0I am also attempting to start videos of the podcasting and cannabis related events in Ca for everyone to see. \u00a0I\u0027m not asking for much, anything will help. \u00a0I would greatly appreciate a donation of 1-2 dollars a month and would make it possible to continue following my dream and bring you a bigger and better show more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
