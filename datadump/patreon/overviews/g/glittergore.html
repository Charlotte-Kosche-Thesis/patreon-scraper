I work mainly in traditional mediums - acrylic being my favorite, though I do do random crafts and digital art from time to time as well! I paint what I like - aka mostly half naked ladies \u0026amp; spooky stuff, 90 percent in a limited four color palette.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m chronically ill so I...don\u0027t really get out much, but making \u0026amp; sharing my art has become a semi productive way for me to entertain myself without going completely stir-crazy.\u00a0(You can see more examples of my work on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/glittergoreart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e, or my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.glittergoreart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emain website\u003c/a\u003e!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i764.photobucket.com/albums/xx288/KittyKush/GGA/examples_zpspgvtjeno.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i764.photobucket.com/albums/xx288/KittyKush/GGA/whatthehell_zps7qqb1mim.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an \"ongoing crowdfunding\" site, or in actual human terms - a tip jar and a way to support your favorite creative types and gain access to content you wouldn\u0027t otherwise! I do offer a lot of free content already, but I\u0027m hoping to utilize Patreon to give y\u0027all a little something special while also being able to grow the business end of this whole \"Hey I do art\" thing. \u003cbr\u003e(If you\u0027d like to support me otherwise,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.glittergoreart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy webstore never sleeps\u003c/a\u003e!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i764.photobucket.com/albums/xx288/KittyKush/GGA/contrib_zpsqnaik4sz.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned above, I\u0027m chronically ill and currently a \"real job\" isn\u0027t really something I can physically handle.
