This whole thing honestly just started out because, well, like many of you, I just really like Dragon Age. When I first got into the series in 2015, I was hungry to learn more about Thedas, but the mountain of lore seemed intimidating. I wanted someone to just take my hand, and lead me through the history so that I could get a better understanding of the things I was seeing in the game- but at the time, I couldn\u0027t really find anything. While I eventually did find the time to immerse myself in the history and lore of the Dragon Age universe, I want to make that climb easier for others. For you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue bringing lore and history, gameplay, and even other Dragon Age content creators to the Ghil Dirthalen channel for you to explore and enjoy. I want it to be easier for others to really sink your teeth into this wonderful world and community like I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eSo What Changes?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pure coincidence, and starting with my first video, I called anyone who subscribed to me patrons. Because that is what the actually spirit of Ghil Dirthalen called out to anyone who would listen. I\u0027ll be mimicking their approach here, in that I want everyone to know that the nothing will change for those of you who don\u0027t want to give on Patreon! Non-Patreon users will still be able to submit video ideas and lore questions like before, and have their submission be equal to those who do give on Patreon. If you want to see what Patreon users gain, check out the Rewards section! As of right now, it\u0027s not much, but as time goes on, more will come! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eBut Why Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou may be asking, \u003cem\u003e\u0027But don\u0027t you get money from YouTube?\u0027\u003c/em\u003e. Nope. I get nothing. I have chosen not to monetize my videos for various reasons: Because YouTube monetization is broken. Because if an older video gets de-monetized I don\u0027t have the view counts to dispute it. Because I have been using an Ad-blocker for years, and it would be pretty shitty of me to ask you to not use one when watching my things because I\u0027m a special snow-flake. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating things, even in this format, takes money. I\u0027ve invested my own cold hard cash to upgrade my PC to bring you better footage, but in the future, It would be nice to have some help. Eventually, I\u0027d like to get a better mic, with one of those puff filters so I don\u0027t blow out your ear drums every time I say a word with a \u0027P\u0027 in it. While I have physical copies of the DA books and a few other things, I\u0027d like to get digital copies so that I can easily show you important passages in the novels. Hell, if things get far enough that I could quit my day job, I\u0027d love to expand and make more videos per week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf nothing else, while I love doing this, this is a side job. I\u0027m a strong believer in supporting those who create. Think of an artist who is asked to a do a job for free for just exposure. While they can take the job, and the exposure may be good for them, the artist community as a whole suffers. The price of artwork goes down. If all artists do their job for free, then no one would be able to create for a living. And then people don\u0027t get to enjoy art, because no one has the time to create it!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eBut most importantly, no matter what you choose, THANK YOU!! Even if you have just watched one second of one video, I honestly and truly appreciate all the support and love that everyone has watched me as given me, and I hope that I continue\u00a0to make myself useful to you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDareth Shiral, Patrons!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
