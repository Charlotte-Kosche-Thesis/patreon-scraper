ADWCTA will move beyond conventional terms \nlike \"tempo\" and \"card advantage\" and into new concepts that will take \nyour gameplay to the next level  Guaranteed that you will never think \nabout Arena the same way again.  The \"Arena Theory\" series will go deep \ninto Hearthstone\u0027s fundamental Arena gameplay design, so deep that other\n infinite players will watch and go \"whoaaaaa\", so deep that one day in \nthe not too distant future, the first doctoral candidate on TCG theory \nwill cite to these very videos as ushering in a brave new world of \nnext-level theorycrafting.  Be a part of where it all begins.  \nFundamental concepts that are timeless and meta-less.  Released weekly, \nin 5-minute video chunks.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Okay, I may have oversold that a \nbit.  But seriously, it\u0027ll be good.
