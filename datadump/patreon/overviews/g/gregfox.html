    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Greg Fox, and I\u0027m the writer/artist of \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.kylecomics.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKyle\u0027s Bed \u0026amp; Breakfast\u003c/a\u003e\"... the ongoing comic strip series about a gay B\u0026amp;B, and the lives of the various guys who live there. It\u0027s full of romance, drama, laughter, suspense, and some occasional wackiness, (okay, maybe not so \"occasional\"... more like delightfully frequent wackiness!). In a way, it\u0027s kind of the TV-show-in-comic-strip-form that I have always wanted to see, and I feel blessed and tremendously grateful to get to bring the adventures of the B\u0026amp;B boys to the world with each episode. I also did a comic strip called \"An Angel\u0027s Story\" about an angel named Steve, who still continues to show up occasionally in Kyle\u0027s B\u0026amp;B episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the beginning, I\u0027ve always been very clear that I want the most current Kyle\u0027s B\u0026amp;B episodes to be available to everyone for free online at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kylecomics.com\"\u003eKyle\u0027s B\u0026amp;B website\u003c/a\u003e, and I certainly am not planning to change that. (The B\u0026amp;B is open 24 hours and all are welcome! A warm place in a sometimes cold world). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking comics was not always a full-time job for me, but it is now. I reached a point where I needed to go full-time to be able to do my comics properly and meet deadlines, (and be able to sleep, too!). And while I love it and I am deeply grateful to be doing this, the income it brings in is not nearly enough to be considered a sustainable income. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027ve created this Patreon page... to give readers of my comics work the opportunity to become supporting members, (just like with public television and national public radio!). But, hey... this is a win-win situation here... not only is this a way to help give me a sustainable income, it also will help fund some exciting new comics projects that readers have been asking for! And there are rewards for YOU for becoming a supporting member! At the very beginning $3 a month level, you\u0027ll have immediate access to my Patreon Activity Stream, (it\u0027s like a private, members-only blog that I\u0027ll be posting on regularly, right here on this page, with behind-the-scenes Kyle\u0027s B\u0026amp;B art, info, and fun stuff...and you\u0027ll also get early access to new Kyle\u0027s B\u0026amp;B episodes, before the general public does! As well as participate in reader polls!). At higher levels there are additional rewards, such as signed books, prints, T-shirts, your name in the \"thank you\" credits in upcoming Kyle\u0027s B\u0026amp;B books, and original artwork from me, (see the various pledge levels on the right-hand column to see the specific rewards for each level). There\u0027s even an adorable stuffed animal Frosty, the blue-eyed Siberian Husky, as a reward at one of the levels! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I\u0027ve always had an interest in astronomy, space \u0026amp; all things celestial, (just like Kyle, and Njord, in Kyle\u0027s B\u0026amp;B!), I\u0027ve assigned each of the reward levels with a planetary designation. From the $3 per month level, (the \"Pluto Level\"... yes, on this page, Pluto is still considered a planet!), up to the $400 per month level, (the \"Jupiter Level\"). If you just scroll down the right side of this page, you\u0027ll see the various levels and the rewards at each level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you have more questions about how Patreon works, how payments work, how soon you get rewards, etc, etc... you can click back to the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kylesbnb.blogspot.com/p/become-supporting-member.html\"\u003eFAQs page\u003c/a\u003e at my own website and scroll down on that page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to check this out, and for considering becoming a supporting member. I really, really appreciate it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

As of now, I do some of the local New York area shows, and I\u0027ve been able to do several, (3 since 2012), in southern California as I have family out there in Orange County which allows me to have a place to stay and ship my books to. (But even those shows are kind of on hold right now, as that sort of cross-country extravaganza is a bit out of my range). But, at $5000 a month, that would mean I could start visiting selected cons in places people have been asking me to come to, (like the Northwest, and Atlanta, and Texas, and elsewhere). And maybe do some of the more expensive ones in my own backyard, (like NY Comic Con! And MoCCa!). So, anyway, I know that this is an ultimate dream goal, but you folks have helped make my dreams come true already, so I\u0027m not ruling this out at all!\u003cbr\u003e",
