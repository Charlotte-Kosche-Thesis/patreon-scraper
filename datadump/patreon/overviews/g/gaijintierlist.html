    "summary": "I\u0027m a\u003cstrong\u003e Granblue Fantasy\u003c/strong\u003e player since April 2016, and have been immensely enjoying playing this game ever since then, with its MMO-esque mechanics coupled with its typical JRPG feel. Ever since then, I\u0027ve tried to involve myself in the english community, writing \u003cstrong\u003evarious guide\u003c/strong\u003e and at the start of 2017, and working on what would be call the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lo-r5oP5PVDBjDtN8SlJBpFCqCcYnZmvy1d0mIQsriw/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGBF Gaijins Tier List\u003c/a\u003e that would have different sensibilities to rate characters compared to sites like GameWith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s now been a year that I\u0027ve been taking care of the tier list, but the increasing amount of characters released is making it difficult for me to update the list in a timely fashion :\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI don\u0027t swim in money, so I\u0027m not able to get every character in order to test them intensively. This not only forces me to wait for exterior data until I can do the characters write-ups, but it also makes the assessment less precise as I couldn\u0027t experience the character myself.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdating the tier list regularly has taken more and more of my time as it\u0027s getting crowded with characters, and any update often take me\u003cstrong\u003e a few hours minimum.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t really have anything to offer in exchange for pledges, but seeing the effort of working on the tier list remunerate me would definitely \u003cstrong\u003eboost my motivation\u003c/strong\u003e, both in the short term when updates and \u003cstrong\u003enew characters\u003c/strong\u003e are released so that I can do the write-ups as soon as possible, and in the long term so that \u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t end up dropping it \u003c/strong\u003ebecause of the increasing burden maintaining it is becoming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I say that, this doesn\u0027t mean I will stop working on the tier list if I don\u0027t get money. \u003cstrong\u003eBut a token of your appreciation goes a long way, and I would be extremely grateful and thankful if you decide to support me with this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiamonit - GBF-Gaijin Tier list main contributor\u003c/strong\u003e"
