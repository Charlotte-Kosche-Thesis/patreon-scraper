    "summary": "Thank you for coming here, and if you\u0027re already a patron, double thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Garrison Dinsmore (as it says over there by the selfie window), and I write fiction. I also dabble in a few other things, but my primary focus right now is The Song of the Revenant diptych, a two-part book series set in an original low-fantasy universe. The first part, The Plea of the Dead, has existed in a complete draft since the end of 2015, and I\u0027ve been slowly editing it since. It will finally be released this year. I launched a Patreon so I could spend more time working on my art, and speed up the time in which my books would be produced. Eventually, I\u0027d love to create art full time. This is my dream. It won\u0027t take a lot for that to happen, just 1,700 people giving one dollar every month. That\u0027s the bare minimum; it won\u0027t pay for web hosting or editors, just basic necessities with a little wiggle room. But it would allow me to do nothing but create art and pay the bills, which would be beyond fantastic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything over that would allow me to better support my novel writing, and branch out more into other arts I have a passion for. I\u0027ve already begun screenwriting (I\u0027ve contributed to a narrative short currently in post-production), and cobbling together rough musical demos (it\u0027s hard to play piano when you don\u0027t know how), and a friend and I have started making a text adventure game based on my first novel. I\u0027d love to do more of these things, and better. More money would allow me to take lessons, buy equipment, and ensure I wouldn\u0027t have to work other jobs on the side, allowing me to create as much art as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope we can all reach these goals together, so that I can bring the creative ideas inside of me out into the real world, hopefully enriching a lot of people along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have reward tiers. I don\u0027t like them. Why? I don\u0027t like the classist tinge they have, and I greatly appreciate everyone who donates, whether it be for $1 or $100. I think people give according to what they can spare, and they should all be treated equally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one reward for all patrons will be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerpetual access to free digital downloads of every book I ever write, beginning this year with The Plea of the Dead (a 112,000 word novel), until I die or you stop donating (yes, this means that for only $1 a month you will get everything I publish). When/if you stop donating, you will get to keep the books you\u0027ve already downloaded, you just won\u0027t get any new ones beyond that for free (you can still buy them, of course). If my books end up also being released as hard copies (I hope so!) those will not be included, even if you donate $100 a month. Everybody gets the same rewards. Furthermore, you\u0027ll get regular posts from me about the process, or whatever\u0027s on my mind. You\u0027ll get some behind the scenes content, and clips of work that may never get published! Plus, there\u0027ll be exclusive story content posted here only on a weekly basis. If I choose to publish short stories or anthologies, those will be included as well. My other works, music, movies, games, etc. are not necessarily included, though some will be. That\u0027s a long ways off, though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and I hope you\u0027re willing and able to join me on this artistic journey! Have a wonderful day!\u003cbr\u003e"
