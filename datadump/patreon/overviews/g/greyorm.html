There is no set release schedule for pages as they must be written and illustrated, and each one can take weeks; however, I am often working on multiple pages at a time so the project is not slowed by a particularly stubborn design. \u003cstrong\u003eSecond\u003c/strong\u003e, you gain access to patron-only discussions, and materials that will only be released to current patrons. \u003cstrong\u003eFinally\u003c/strong\u003e, you gain \u003cstrong\u003einput into the direction\u003c/strong\u003e of the project and can \u003cstrong\u003esuggest additions I will incorporate\u003c/strong\u003e into the project itself.
