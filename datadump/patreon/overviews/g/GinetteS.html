    "summary": "So, I make music playlists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI listen to a lot of new music, and I started making playlists as a creative impulse (you know the kind that can\u0027t be helped!) as well as a way to get organized and share my love of music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Ginette\u0027s playlists are fire!\"\u003cbr\u003e-Friend\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to get folks moving and inspired, and I also hope to help people make a good impression if they need a playlist for a social or networking event.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI imprinted on the pacific northwest homocore of the \u002700s in my 20s, but I\u0027ve rediscovered a deep appreciation for music recently with\u00a0contemporary R\u0026amp;B/Soul (which often veers into hip hop and pop sounds).\u00a0My playlists can serve as an introduction to local QPOC talent, something to get a party started, a dive into 90s nostalgia, or just a chance to listen to the music that (mostly young) people are putting out right now.\u00a0Each playlist is obsessively curated, so if you\u0027re looking to explore music, I hope you\u0027ll find that this is a good place to start!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout my illustrations:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also an artist (etsy page coming soon!) and I can add custom drawings and doodles here if there\u0027s interest. I mostly work with themes revolving around ferocious women and femmes, weirdos, mermaids and critters, natural elements (flowers, seashells, cacti), the lunar zodiac, and catholic imagery. I work on paper only so far, using watercolour pencils (sometimes without the water and brushes, so... just colour pencils) and a variety of inks (pens).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by :)\u003cbr\u003e"
