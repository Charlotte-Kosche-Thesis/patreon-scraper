I love to see the details and all the hard work put into Anime, Manga, and Video Games, especially in places where most people won\u0027t notice it. Taking in those details, talking about those experiences, and really appreciating the finer points is what keeps me coming back. And more recently, I\u0027ve started sharing my thoughts with you guys as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA year ago I started this whole Youtube thing as a bit of a hobby, but since then I\u0027ve realized that I love the process - so much so that I\u0027d like to expand it into a full-time career. Whether it\u0027s making analytical videos about what makes a scene work, shining a spotlight on series that did their homework, or just shooting the shit with people on Twitch, I want to create a lot of content you\u0027ll enjoy watching, and I\u0027ll enjoy making. Hopefully, with your support, I\u0027ll be able to make that happen!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhy per-video rather than monthly?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve got quite a range of videos that I want to make. Some of them will be shorter, some of them will be longer, but ultimately, I can\u0027t promise a To-The-Day accurate upload schedule. A per-video pledge more accurately covers what I\u0027d like to do on the channel, basically. Feel free to adjust your pledges accordingly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s the money going towards?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eGeneral cost-of-living purchases. Once that\u0027s sorted, I\u0027ll focus on better recording hardware/software, and other improvements to the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhere\u0027s my exclusive content?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m not a fan of locking anything I make behind a paywall. I mean, half the reason I want to do this is to see everyone\u0027s feedback, so why would I limit that, y\u0027know? It \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0mean I don\u0027t have much to offer to higher-tier pledges, so I\u0027ll understand if that\u0027s a deal-breaker for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n---\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI realize not everybody can support me via pledges like this, nor would I expect as much. To anyone out there who enjoys what I do, gives me feedback, or supports me in any fashion, you have my heartfelt thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo anyone willing to take the plunge here, you have my sincerest gratitude. By myself, I wouldn\u0027t be able to accomplish this - but together, we can build something wonderful.\u003cbr\u003e"
