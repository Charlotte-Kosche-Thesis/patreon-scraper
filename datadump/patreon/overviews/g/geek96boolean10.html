I\u0027ve pioneered a few original and inspired series, many of which have yet to come to fruition simply because I can\u0027t spend enough time drawing away from school and work. Lend me a hand, and I will be able to bring even more of my creations to life. I currently have a on-going comic series, releasing at every opportunity I get, but I have to keep them simple and quick. Any sort of incentive here would be incredibly helpful to keep it going."
