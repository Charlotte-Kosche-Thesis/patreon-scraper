    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Believe:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIn the purest way possible, I have always felt that making things is the reason we exist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor some people that means making lives, making families, making memories. For me it means making music. So far in my life I have made five full-length albums of original songs, writing, playing and recording all the music myself, and in a very real sense these artworks (if I dare call them that) feel like my children - my bequest to the world and the hereafter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be delighted if you felt willing to support me in continuing to make these things, and the YouTube videos that promote and give context to them. Any pledge will be gratefully received, much valued, and wisely repurposed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Can Expect From Me:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m always trying to do things in a new and interesting way. Like this (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_xVZfcI38c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwo Week Album\u003c/a\u003e), when I wrote and recorded a new ten-track album from scratch in two weeks, or this (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqkzqH1ai0c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePedestal\u003c/a\u003e), when I made a song almost entirely out of old bottles and food containers I had lying around the house. Or this (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9pC9orvH4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLemmings\u003c/a\u003e), this (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9-As0gn4Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeparate Our Fingertips\u003c/a\u003e), or this (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owLGXsZo6ug\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eindiVidYoual\u003c/a\u003e), when I made super-awesome music videos with my friends on no budget at all. I don\u0027t want to be a pop-star. I\u0027m not trying to win anyone\u0027s love or admiration. I just really like making something out of nothing, and imagining it resonating with people (maybe long after I\u0027m gone).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Would Love Your Support:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThere are many reasons why I need to make money out of my work, not least that I have personal living expenses like everyone else (rent, food etc.). I also need to maintain and insure a lot of equipment and space, from cameras to guitars, from recording studio spaces to pop-shields. I am an efficiency-freak and do my best to keep all these expenses as low as possible (in fact it\u0027s become a sort of game to me, to see how much I can do with little or no budget), but the more money I make, the more free I am to do more and better creative stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most of all, I want you to support me because you genuinely want to. I have found great joy over the past few years in surrounding myself with people who really care about the things I make. If you love the stuff I make, and want me to make more stuff like it (or maybe some even better stuff) please come on board with as little or as much as you can afford, and be a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow It Works:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment I\u0027m taking pledges per month - Patreon will charge you (and add VAT (20%) if you\u0027re in the UK, so be aware!) on the first of each new month. Very important: never forget you can stop being a patron at any time. That\u0027s totally ok. I won\u0027t be hurt or upset or anything. It\u0027s your money, and it\u0027s my job to keep doing good stuff so that you ACTUALLY WANT to support my work :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my love \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eGeorge\u003cbr\u003e"
