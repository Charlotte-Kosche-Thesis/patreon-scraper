    "summary": "Hi there! You\u0027ve found us on Patreon, congrats! We\u0027re Gallery 86, a hybrid virtual gallery and artist collective. We were founded in early 2017 and have been hard at work creating the foundation needed to make a stable living as full-time artists, and Patreon is an important part of making that happen! We\u0027re all currently working in positions other than full-time art. Some of us are in related fields, like teaching and print works, but others of us are in unrelated fields like shipping and food delivery. We think our time would be better spent utilizing our artistic talents, and we hope you think so too! Art-supplies alone can be expensive and we want is to be able make enough monthly income to devote ourselves to art-making full-time. So give it a thought, get to know us and our work, consider becoming a patron of the arts like the Duke of Milan who supported Leonardo da Vinci, and contribute to something that makes the world a better, more beautiful place! We even have fun rewards for our patrons like a monthly coloring book contest, so give it try! And to those of you that have already become patrons, we just want to say thank you so much! Every little bit counts, and we hope to continue to make you feel great about your investment in us and in the arts."
