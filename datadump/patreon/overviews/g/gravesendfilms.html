    "summary": "Gravesend Films is producing two 10 week documentary series of classes offered by world renowned activist/scholar Norman Finkelstein at the Brooklyn Public Library named \u003cstrong\u003eThe Idea of Utopia \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eNo Free Speech for Fascists?\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Idea of Utopia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumanity is facing unprecedented crises. Whether it be the prospect of climate catastrophe, massive unemployment and underemployment, or endless war, unless we think in big and innovative ways, a dim future awaits us. However, Bernie Sanders\u2019s candidacy as well as Donald Trump\u2019s victory suggest that Americans are ready for radical change. Although Sanders lost, he came much closer to winning than anyone could have predicted a year ago, and the political Revolution he inspired is bringing more and more people into the streets every day. Meanwhile, Trump was elected even though Wall Street and the billionaire class opposed him, political elites in the Republican and Democratic party opposed him, and the corporate media opposed him. Even if the outcome might be depressing, the fact is, Trump\u2019s was the first truly democratic election in modern American history: it was the people not the Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dum Establishment that decided the winner. The challenge now is to galvanize the American people with a vision of the future that is both practical and sweeping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sociologist Max Weber famously said, \u201cAll historical experience confirms the truth that man would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible.\u201d In this 10-week class, we will explore the possibilities of the impossible by reading Thomas More\u2019s UTOPIA, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky\u2019s anti-utopian NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND. It will not be a lecture class but, instead, will be based on a close, interactive reading and analysis of salient passages in the texts. The class will hopefully walk away with the belief that a better future is possible, but also cautious about solutions that might create more harm than good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.bklynlibrary.org/calendar/norman-finkelstein-idea-u-central-library-brooklyn-031517\"\u003ebklynlibrary.org/calendar/norman-finkelstein-idea-u-central-library-brooklyn-031517\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo Free Speech for Fascists?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"No Free Speech for Fascists?\" is a free ten-week class\n offered as part of BPL\u0027s Library School series taught by Norman \nFinkelstein.\u003cbr\u003e\nFew topics on the political left arouse more passion and trigger more\n discord than free speech. One tradition, tracing back to the 1930s, \nsays, \u201cNo free speech for fascists.\u201d Today, it would also silence \nracists, anti-Semites and Islamophobes, misogynists, lookists, and \nhomophobes.  When protesters at Berkeley prevented a rightwing \nprovocateur from speaking in February of this year, President Trump \nthreatened to cut federal funding of the university.  A second tradition\n traces back to Karl Marx\u2019s credo, De omnibus dubitandum (To doubt \neverything). It opposes any silencing of opinion on the grounds that, on\n the one hand, you can never be certain that you possess truth and, on \nthe other hand, the only way to reach truth is by a \u201cstanding invitation\n to the world\u201d to prove you wrong. The last quoted phrase comes from \nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s classic and unrivaled exposition, ON LIBERTY. This \n10-week class will be devoted to Mill\u2019s essay. It will not be a lecture \nclass but, instead, will be based on a close, interactive reading and \nanalysis of salient passages in Mill\u0027s text, as it simultaneously \nengages current controversies. The instructor, Norman G. Finkelstein, \nhimself got embroiled in a high-profile free speech case exactly a \ndecade ago when he was denied tenure in June 2007. The course promises \nto be a provocative and inspiring occasion, where the heat it generates \nwill, hopefully, be surpassed by the light it sheds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.bklynlibrary.org/calendar/no-free-speech-fascists-b-central-library-balcony-c-030617\"\u003ebklynlibrary.org/calendar/no-free-speech-fascists-b-central-library-balcony-c-030617\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNorman  Finkelstein received his doctorate in political theory in 1988 \nfrom the Princeton University Politics Department. He taught for two \ndecades in the CUNY system, NYU and DePaul University (in Chicago). He \nhas lectured on a broad range of subjects, and has written ten books \nthat have been translated into more than 50 foreign editions. \nFinkelstein\u0027s main fields of research and teaching are political theory,\n international law, and the Israel-Palestine conflict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo contact the video series producer email James Green at gravesendfilms@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e"
