    "summary": "First of all I just want to say thank you for taking the time to check out this page. I really enjoy making videos to help people play their favourite music on guitar and get a lot of satisfaction from the messages you send.\u00a0Your support is what keeps driving me to produce more and more content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the start of 2017 I moved to Australia from England. This has been a new beginning which gave me time to reflect on my life. After coming out of full time work that I didn\u0027t particularly enjoy, I decided to try and earn money doing something I love doing. Helping people learn how to play guitar. I have an older brother who introduced me to a lot of niche music that influenced me a great deal. However, when I was growing up playing guitar, I could never really find the resources out there to play my favourite music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter making some videos for Thee Oh Sees, I could see that there is an audience out there in a similar situation. I will continue to make material free for everyone to view on youtube, and really appreciate you for viewing my videos. To any patrons I would like to say a huge thank you, hopefully we can make a community which enjoys learning our favourite music together and one which helps me to develop better content that is more tailored to your liking. If your taking the consideration to donate money, then I value your opinion as it must come from a good place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
