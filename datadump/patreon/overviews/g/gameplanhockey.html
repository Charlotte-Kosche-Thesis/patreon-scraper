    "summary": "Hi! My name is \u003cstrong\u003eAnders Granberg\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u2019m the developer of \u003cstrong\u003eGame Plan Hockey Manager\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst I want to thank you for taking an interest in this online hockey manager game! What started out as a small hobby project has now grown to a fully featured beta with a living community, and I couldn\u2019t have done it without your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more about the game I recommend reading the \u003cem\u003ecore values\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ekey features\u003c/em\u003e found at the home page of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gameplanhockey.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egameplanhockey.com\u003c/a\u003e. I also recommend reading this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gameplanhockey.com/blog/what-is-game-plan-hockey-manager\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog post\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow down to business. The main goal is now to drop the beta status and launch an official version of the game. In order to do so I need to make the game more stable, improve the server performance and increase the number of game worlds. This would mean that I need to put in more hours and invest in a new hosting environment. \u003cstrong\u003eSo\u00a0I would really appreciate if you would help me make ends meet financially\u003c/strong\u003e. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here on \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat will the money be used for?\u003c/h4\u003eThe money pledged will help to cover running costs such as \u003cstrong\u003esoftware licenses, hosting and hardware maintenance\u003c/strong\u003e. If enough money is pledged it will also allow me to look at a more \u003cstrong\u003ehigh performing hosting option\u003c/strong\u003e to increase server performance and allowing more game worlds. And in the long run, it could allow me to take a couple of \u003cstrong\u003edays off my regular work\u003c/strong\u003e every now and then. If that would be the case I could put in more quality hours into the game and develop more cool features.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/h4\u003eBesides my eternal gratitude and helping the game stay alive, all who support the game will receive a humble token of my appreciation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll who give a monthly pledge will be included in a private community. Members of this community will be acting like a \u003cstrong\u003efocus group to answer special polls\u003c/strong\u003e about features and future development. Last but not least \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027ll also get a cool silver star\u003c/strong\u003e next to your name to let everyone know that you\u0027re supporting the game! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge over $3.50 \u003cstrong\u003eyour account will also be upgraded to an All Star account!\u003c/strong\u003e This will \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e help you win any games but it will allow you to access some extra customisation features in the game. The All Star account is not yet fully developed but more features will be added continuously. As a start you\u0027ll have the possibility to edit your franchise on a regular basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this and for considering supporting the game!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
