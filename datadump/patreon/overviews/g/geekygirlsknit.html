    "summary": "Hiya! We\u0027re C.C. + Dami, the Geeky Girls! We are the Mamma/Daughter team that co-hosts the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://GeekyGirlsKnit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeeky Girls Knit Podcast\u003c/a\u003e. Since August, 2012, we\u0027ve been recording a weekly video podcast for fans of all things knitting \u0026amp; geeky.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA little about us:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eC.C. is the Mamma. She\u0027s a knitting designer (\u003ca href=\"http://JavaPurlDesigns.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJavaPurl Designs\u003c/a\u003e). In her spare time, she enjoys pretty much anything the colour PINK, drinking coffee, reading, knitting, and watching TV and movies (her favourites are Gilmore Girls, Doctor Who, \u0026amp; LOST).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDami is the daughter. She\u0027s 17 years old and just graduated from homeschool high school. She\u0027s an avid fan of British literature and television. She has recently discovered a deep love of musicals especially Les Miserables, Hamilton, The Great Comet of 1812, \u0026amp; Hadestown. She is the sample knitter for most of the designs that C.C. comes up with \u0026amp; has started designing patterns herself.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRuss (C.C.\u0027s husband and Dami\u0027s father) is affectionally known as \"The Hubs\". He occasionally makes an appearance on the podcast. He and C.C. have been married for 19+ years. He just completed his PhD in theology at the University of Edinburgh.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nWhy Patreon? We adore the time we get to spend with you each week. The podcast is one of the most important things in our lives and we\u0027re not sure what we\u0027d do without it. We\u0027ve meet so many lovely people and experienced so many amazing things because of the podcast. But, the podcast is not cheap to produce. We\u0027ve paid for many of the costs out of our own pockets (we are extremely grateful for the donations we have received that have helped some, as well as the donations from the fibre community so that we can share the beautiful products they make with yall). We\u0027d like to make the podcast even better, but that means we need to purchase some things to do that. Most of the items we hope to purchase are technology and electronic equipment that will take the podcast to a higher quality level.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re excited to offer some fun incentives to those who are able to support us in this way. Please know that if you aren\u0027t able to, it\u0027s not a problem. Nothing will change for you. You\u0027ll still receive the podcast every week on iTunes or YouTube. We love each of you, we love bringing the podcast to you, and that will not change! But if you\u0027re able to help, we\u0027d be eternally grateful! If you have any questions about this, please contact us\u00a0\n\u003ca\u003evia email\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Thank you for taking the time to look at our Patreon page! You are amazing! xx"
