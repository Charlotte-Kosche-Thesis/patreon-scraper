    "summary": "Hey everyone, thanks for stopping by my Patreon page. My name is Austin and I create retro gaming playthroughs, live streams and (occasional) reviews on YouTube under the show moniker, \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/austinmackert\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGameplay and Talk\u003c/a\u003e\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor a long time viewers have asked how they can support me, and several in particular have requested me to start a Patreon campaign. For those that requested, here you go!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been creating YouTube videos since 2009 and have been streaming on \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/amackert\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e since early 2015. As much fun as I have creating and streaming video content, it\u0027s a massive time commitment to do what I do on as regular of a basis as I do. Between the practicing required for the games I play, to the actual recording and editing process, to the more menial tasks like dealing with the publishing and social media end of things, it\u0027s a serious time sink from start to finish. The little bit of ad revenue gained from YouTube is a small offset, but I feel like Patreon (a more reliable/consistent source of income) has the possibility to extend on that greatly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are interested in supporting my show monetarily, any amount is greatly appreciated, and as little as a dollar a month will get you some perks including ad-free videos a week in advance as well as your name being featured in my videos. I may even cook up some occasional Patreon-exclusive, vlog-style content just for backers who are interested in that sort of thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCan\u0027t support me monetarily? No problem! My videos will still appear on YouTube as they have, so it will be business as usual.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks again for looking, and I hope to see you on the next video either way!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJkaB4a3fsg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
