    "summary": "GC Live was established in January of 2017 in Gold Coast,\nQLD, to share and help promote the best live music happening on the Gold Coast and surroundings.\nThe aim is to post regular music news, weekly gig guide of only the best music\nhappening in the area, gig reviews, album reviews, and interviews. We have been\nlucky enough to cover some great events so far such as The Gold Coast Music\nAwards, SHAKAFEST, Pete Murray and DANJO. As well as get some amazing\ninterviews with artists such as Grinspoon, Josh Pyke, Pete Murray, Reece Mastin,\nKing Parrot, and Amistat. In covering the music scene on the Gold Coast it is\nhopeful that GC Live can be a part of helping the region grow to be one of the\npremier Live Music Locations in Australia.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHelmed by just a small team of music enthusiasts, all of the\ntime and effort put into running GC Live is done voluntarily. Therefore all\nexpenses associated such as yearly website hosting (WordPress), time spent\nresearching and making weekly gig guide, posting across social media platforms\nFB and Insta, advertising on social media, organising and writing interviews,\norganising and writing reviews, editing and posting on website, ticket entry\nfees to gigs for reviews, equipment such as cameras for photo galleries,\ninternet phone and electricity costs are ALL paid for out of pocket by the\nsmall team at GC Live themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAmongst the team we have been in discussion as to how to keep\nfunding GC Live to ensure we can firstly keep it running for now, but also grow\nGC Live in the future. One idea we had was to use advertising on our website (gclive.me)\nto generate income and this is something we are very much considering in the\nfuture, however due to the current size of GC Live still being in its early\nstages it is hard to attract organisations to advertise with us. Our next\nthought was to start this Patreon page to get our fellow music lovers, fans and\nusers to donate a small amount to help keep us running and growing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are definitely looking to expand and cover more live music\nin the Gold Coast also the surroundings and also eventually cover the Brisbane\nlive music scene just like we do the GC music scene. But without any funding\nother than that of the volunteers unfortunately this will not be possible, and GC\nLive will not be able survive. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are keen to pay a $1 monthly subscription then you\nwill be a part of something great.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe will also try organising something for maybe the first 50\nsubscribers of our Patreon page such as some GC Live merch like stickers, promo\nCDs, GC Live wrist bands etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot to mention you will receive our eternal gratitude! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks so much,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGC Live Team\u003cbr\u003e"
