    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Cameron Porter, the Executive Producer and Host of Guns Explained. We launched Guns Explained in January of this year (2017), and released our first episode on March 9th. We release a new episode every week and focus our efforts on increasing understanding of how guns operate and current firearm laws in the United States. Our goal is to take the fear and the irrationality out of both sides of the firearms debate to make way for a more productive conversation about the role firearms should play in America today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now myself and the rest of the Guns Explained team, Mason White and Nathan Paulsen, are volunteering our time to make Guns Explained happen. Each of us makes a living another way, and we are all still attending school. All three of us would love to be able to do Guns Explained full time, which is our first fundraising goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are committed to making a new episode of Guns Explained each week. However, we can make the series much higher quality, be more interactive with our fans, and even create more content if we are able to dedicate more time and money to the series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. Patreon provides a flexible and user-friendly way for those who wish to contribute to our vision to do so. Patrons can sign up for as little as $1 per month to help keep Guns Explained going and reach more people with this important information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon Is\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is an avenue for you to provide a monthly contribution to Guns Explained. It is a way for you to express that you like the content we are producing and you want us to continue producing it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is also a way for us to give back to you. Through Patreon, we can offer exclusive rewards and attention to our strongest supporters. Simply by becoming a patron, even at the lowest level of $1 per month, you become part of an elite group of participants who can get our attention and impact the direction of the show much more easily than simply our Facebook fans and YouTube subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon Is Not\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is not a contract. You can cancel your contribution at any time and for any reason, and we can close our page at any time or for any reason.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is also not the best place to watch our videos. We recommend watching new episodes on either our Facebook page or our website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you Charging for Your Episodes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely not. We will never charge for access to our weekly episodes, as that would be the opposite of what we\u0027re trying to accomplish. We\u0027re trying to make correct information about firearms more accessible to everyone in the country. We want to make learning about firearms as easy as watching your favorite TV show. We do offer exclusive behind-the-scenes content to supporters, but educational content will always remain free-to-watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do Monthly and Not Per-Video?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon does allow the option to have per-video contributions, but our team discussed it and agreed that monthly fits what we want to do better. First, the minimum contribution Patreon allows is $1, and we release 4 videos each month, which means if we did contributions per video, the minimum contribution would equate to $4 per month, which is much larger than we wanted our minimum contribution to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the higher contribution amounts, monthly makes more sense since most families and many small businesses operate on monthly budgets, and even larger corporations break their annual budgets into quarters and months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat If I Don\u0027t Want to Pay?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat is totally fine. If you support what we\u0027re doing but aren\u0027t comfortable making a contribution, we understand, and simply ask that you continue to view, like, and share our episodes as they continue to come out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Note\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a unique opportunity to have a positive influence on the culture in the United States. Recently I met a friend on the street, and she told me that over the last several months, she went from being angry and firmly anti-gun to being much more empathetic with gun owners. She said that our series has helped make that change happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur entire team wants to continue to make that happen with others around the country. Right now, our reach is much, much smaller than we want it to be, since we are all volunteering our time and money to make the series happen. Funds from supporters like you will enable us to spend the time we really need to expand our social media reach and obtain the level of production quality the show needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCameron Porter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
