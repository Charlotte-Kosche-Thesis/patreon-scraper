Felt making is a long, physical and in some ways very intimate process,\nduring which wool fibres, water and soap are combined to transform into a\nfabric which can be shrunk into tactile forms. As the wool shrinks and dries,\nthe shape is stored in the fibres.This\nidea of the wool \u2018remembering\u2019 adds another layer of meaning, as well as\nlinking my work to a long and ancient lineage of felt making that started at\nthe dawn of human civilization.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.gladyspaulus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Felt-possibilities-collage-2-Gladys-Paulus_zpsu2i1ref1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eEndless possibilties with felt, some examples of my past work.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTextiles and\ntextile art in particular tends to be a feminine domain, and with that I am\nfollowing in the footsteps of many generations of women all over the world, who\nhave cut, stitched, sewn and darned to keep their families clothed, safe and\nprotected.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eHow is felt made?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFelt is a\nunique, non woven textile made from wool fibres. Traditionally, felt is made\nfrom sheep\u2019s wool, but other animal (protein) fibres such as alpaca, camel,\nyak, mohair and angora can also be felted. There are many varieties\nof sheep\u2019s wool (there are 60 different breeds of sheep in the UK alone) and\neach produces a different quality of felt. Different wool breeds are therefore\nmore or less suited to specific projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWool fibres\nare covered with scales, which give wool fabric its unique ability to resist\ndirt, wick water and insulate. When warm water is absorbed into the wool fibres\nthis causes them to swell. Swelling causes the overlapping scales on the\noutside of the fibre to lift and act like little grappling hooks that help work\nthe wool into a dense mesh. Water also causes the crimp, or curl, of the wool\nfibre to lengthen and contract. Both of these actions help the wool fibres\nmesh. Once they are meshed, they do not easily come apart.\nUnlike woven\nfabric, felt does not have a warp and a weft and is equally strong in all\ndirections, meaning that it can be cut, still hold its shape and won\u2019t fray at\nthe edges. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFelting is\nthe earliest known form of textile fabric. It is estimated to be at least 8000\nyears old and the making of felt is accepted to predate woven cloth, which\nplaces its discovery in the Neolithic period. It is believed that the idea of\nfelting wool derived as people observed matted animal hair/wool, and then\nfigured out how to make it themselves. Felt played an important part in the\nlife of early man and was in many ways integral to human survival. In cold,\nNorthern climates, felt provided warmth, while in hotter regions, thick felt\ninsulated people from heat and wind.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.gladyspaulus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ancient-feltmaking-collage_zpsdtlyxsln.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe ancient art of feltmaking.
