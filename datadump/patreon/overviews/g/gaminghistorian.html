    "summary": "\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is Norman and I am the creator of \u0027Gaming Historian,\u0027 a YouTube series about video game history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started when I was looking for documentaries on video game history. I was having a hard time finding a decent selection. That baffled me. History contains the greatest stories ever told, and the video game industry has a ton of interesting ones. I wanted to share these stories with the world, so I created my first episode of \u0027Gaming Historian\u0027 back in 2008. I haven\u0027t stopped since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I graduated with a degree in history, I continued to work on the show part-time while I taught for a few years. Eventually, I moved halfway across the country with my wife and gave up the teaching life. Back in 2015, I was able to save up enough money and work on the show full-time! It can be tough, but I\u0027m very passionate about my work and I want to see it grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAbout The Show\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Gaming Historian\u0027 is all about the history of video games. Some topics I have covered are...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The Life of Satoru Iwata\u003cbr\u003e- The History of LJN\u003cbr\u003e- The Power Glove\u003cbr\u003e- Tengen\u003cbr\u003e- Bleem!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Game Genie\u003cbr\u003e- Super Mario Bros. 2\u003cbr\u003e-.....and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also reviewed books, games, and compared historical video games to actual history. My goal is to make my videos not only entertaining, but also educational.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Gaming Historian\u0027 has been featured on Destructoid, Capcom, Screwattack, Retroware TV, Nintendo Life, and GoNintendo. My work has also been used as a source for Associated Press articles, research papers, magazines, classroom material, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAbout Patreon\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now, \u00a0\u0027Gaming Historian\u0027 has been supported solely by advertisements and PayPal donations on my website. Patreon provides a way for fans to not only support the show, but get cool rewards too! In my opinion, it\u0027s a win-win for both parties.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027d like to be clear about this: \u003cstrong\u003eGaming Historian will continue, regardless of this Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e. I won\u0027t start charging viewers. I won\u0027t stop making videos. This is just a way for fans to show their support and get some nice perks. Your contributions on Patreon will directly help the show and are completely voluntary. Got it? Ok!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love getting a good deal, and that is how I set up this campaign.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI understand that as a consumer, you have a lot of options.
