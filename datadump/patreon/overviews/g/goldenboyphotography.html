I want to show the beauty and splendor that every nook and cranny can offer to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy works have been published in small newspapers, alternative pin-up websites, local businesses, and on products like calendars and post cards.\u00a0 I have done sets featuring locations such as the Anchor Brewery in San Francisco, the Carrizo Plain and McKittrick Tar Seaps in the south valley, the coastal redwoods of the PCH, the high deserts of Nevada, the rolling hills and plains of central TX, and closed off super-fund sites California.\u00a0 This is just the tip of the ice berg of where I want to go and people I want to shoot if I can get a bit more backing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to also follow me on my social media platforms and thank you for the support as I continue this artistic journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram: \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/goldenboyphotographyca/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/goldenboyphotographyca/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/goldenboyphotographyca/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/goldenboyphotographyca/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: \u003ca href=\"http://goldenboyphotography.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttp://goldenboyphotography.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeviantArt: \u003ca href=\"http://goldenboyphotography.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttp://goldenboyphotography.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
