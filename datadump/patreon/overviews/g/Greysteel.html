    "summary": "Hello, and thanks for dropping by Greysteel\u0027s Patreon page! It means a lot to me that you would come by and consider supporting our YouTube channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jonathon Sullivan. I\u0027m an emergency physician, a physiologist, and a strength and conditioning coach. My emergency medicine practice is at a Level I Trauma Center in Detroit, MI. My coaching practice, Greysteel Strength and Conditioning, is in Farmington Michigan, and specializes in physical training with barbells for men and women in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my coaching practice because I had to do something about the effect of unhealthy lifestyle I saw in my patient population in the ER. I started the Greysteel Channel for the same reason.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Greysteel Channel is dedicated to providing people over 50 (and anybody else who\u0027s interested) with information and insight into healthy aging, and especially the use of physical training to stay strong, powerful, mobile, vital and alive during the second half of life. We\u0027re operating on a shoestring, and for the moment Sully is Chief, Cook, and Bottle-Washer, but the emphasis is and will always be on the highest-quality, most up-to-date information for our viewers. We\u0027re going to talk about everything, from the biology of aging to the role of exercise in dementia and heart disease and copd, to the current thinking on statins and screening tests for cancer. Out biggest focus, though, will be on the use of safe, effective, progressive exercise programs to help people improve their strength, health, endurance, balance, resistance to injury and physical performance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m grateful and honored that you would consider supporting my efforts. Thank you for your help. Stay strong, stay healthy, and stay informed!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSully\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
