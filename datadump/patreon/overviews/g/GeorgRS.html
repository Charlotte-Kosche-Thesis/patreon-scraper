I see Patreon for me as a kind of tip jar - you don\u0027t have to give anything and I don\u0027t expect you to. If you do give, know that I appreciate it greatly, but that you get nothing but my gratitude in return. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNothing? Why?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to split my content into paid-for and free, even if the content exclusive to patrons is just the posts here. I know that most other creators have different reward tiers, but that\u0027s something I think I\u0027d prefer to do on a Kickstarter project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI essentially see Patreon not as me being paid for something in return, like merchandise or special access, but as me being tipped by a generous patron because they find value in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Goals?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve not set any goals here because I don\u0027t want to do something, or have to wait to do something, because of the level of support I receive. I want to make my videos the best they can be, regardless of whether they make any money from here or advertisements. Money is essential for things like upgrading equipment, and that\u0027s what I\u0027d use anything given here for, but I don\u0027t think that necessarily leads to better content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I am working on other things, such as an anthology of short stories, I am committed to putting up as many videos as I can without rushing them, and with quality put first in terms of how I make them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclosure?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI put a lot of work into my YouTube channel - I have no other income then what I get from there. I do have other things I work on, such as writing, which will eventually be made available for purchase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Projects?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt some point, and I\u0027m not entirely sure when, I want to try and raise money for a very low-budget movie through crowdfunding. This is something I\u0027ll only do after making quite a bit more headway on YouTube, and plan very thoroughly before officially announcing, however I think it\u0027s important to state my intentions here. If I end up raising the money needed for that project, my work on YouTube will be on hiatus (or more likely there\u0027ll be more time between videos), but I will return to full output as soon as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
