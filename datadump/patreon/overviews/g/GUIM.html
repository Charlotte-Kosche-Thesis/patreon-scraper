After the 20th patron contributes, all future patrons will fall into their specific tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, the first 10 patrons will gain a \"+1 tier\" boost that will stay in effect for the life of this channel (which is hopefully a very, very, very... very long time). This means that you gain all rewards in the tier directly above your level of contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE NOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently in the process of creating a method for ORGANIZING all of this music theory.

This is a channel that is dedicating itself primarily to the instruction of Music Theory. There will be additional features, such as sound design and music I have composed, but for the most part... this is me helping YOU better your musical endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the channel hopes to provide insight for ALL levels of musicians, this channel will primarily focus on those beyond the basics. I find that there is a MASSIVE amount of resources for the absolute basics, but... anything beyond that requires intense digging or, worse, dropping serious coin on a book with the driest text and, really, only 10 useful pages regarding what you\u0027re actually looking into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I want to help everyone as much as possible, so if you have any questions... reach out and ask!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
