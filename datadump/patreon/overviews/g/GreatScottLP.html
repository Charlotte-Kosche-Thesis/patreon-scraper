Many of you may know me as a member of the Zeldathon Team as well!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently following my passion for games and charity as a career with the fantastic non-profit \u003ca href=\"https://tiltify.com/help-hope-live/donate\"\u003eHelp Hope Live\u003c/a\u003e.

I think it\u0027s great that we\u0027re bringing back such an old concept (patronage of the arts). When you become a Patron, you\u0027re saying \"I value what you do\" in a voluntary way. Ads are intrusive, patronage is a voluntary transaction of thanks. I hope this platform allows YouTube creators, Twitch broadcasters, and artists to earn income from their passions for many years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhere your money goes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nYour money goes directly to supporting me with paying my bills, my travel expenses related to Zeldathon, and for the equipment I use to livestream on Twitch. Your voluntary contributions are really helping me be able to deliver a quality livestream while dedicating my life to raising money for charity - Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eGet Rewarded!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kz2wYjz.png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nPlease have a look at my rewards for becoming a Patron!
