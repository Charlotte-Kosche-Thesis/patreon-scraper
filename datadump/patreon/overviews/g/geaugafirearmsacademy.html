    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.geaugafirearmsacademy.com/\"\u003eGeauga Firearms Academy\u003c/a\u003e is a self-defense training academy that was founded by my\nwife, Kim, and myself. As a certified Firearms instructor with over 14 years\nexperience under professional instruction, I wanted a resource I could refer\nstudents to where they could refresh or go over a training topic that I had\ntaught in class. Kim and I decided to put Geauga Firearms Academy on YouTube.\nWe had what we thought were reasonable goals for subscribers and number of\nproduced videos. As it turned out, we crushed our annual goals in just a few\nweeks and double the amount of videos we set out to make! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs our channel developed, it was clear that we had a very\nunique \u201csecret sauce\u201d and that was Kim and a growing female friendly shooting\ncommunity. People loved getting a perspective on a wide range of shooting\ntopics from tactics, gear, and techniques from a male and female perspective.\nKim has since developed into an incredible instructor who has a strong female\nand male following. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat\u2019s the bottom line? Who are we, and what should you expect\nto learn on Geauga Firearms Academy Patreon? We focus on self-defense both with\nweapons (firearms, bladed, and improvised) and unarmed. You will be able to\nleverage my experience with over 14 years with firearms and over 12 years of\nmartial arts in reality-based self-defense, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and executive\nprotection training. Along with that, my working experience in high-risk\nprivate security and experience as an Ohio Armed Peace Officer. I\u2019m an Armorer\nfor Smith \u0026amp; Wesson and the AR15 rifle, and I have instructed multiple build\nclasses. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are new to firearms or an experienced military/LEO,\nthere will be mindset, tactics, and concepts for everyone. Most importantly,\nthey can be applied to your regular concealed carry life. Let\u2019s not forget\nabout the gear. We test and evaluate products, and we only give honest reviews.\nIf we don\u2019t approve it, we won\u2019t say we do\u2026period. The best part is you will\nget all this content in high quality production that we learned in the YouTube\njungle!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
