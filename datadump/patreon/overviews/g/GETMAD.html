Please consider donating monthly and becoming an official GETM.A.D. Supporter.  I\u0027d like to take a few minutes to explain to you why this is important...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always had a passion and a calling to teach and motivate skills and fundamentals. As a young parent raising two daughters along with my wife I was able to channel my passions and help guide my now two young adult daughters to knew heights in Sports and Athletics. I believe fully in the power of positive energy and direct activation based on several methods practiced and proven over several years of work. GET M.A.D., Motivated Activated and Determined is not just a simple acronym with a common theme for those into motivational training but a proven method.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrief and Easy understanding M.A.D. methodology 1 - 2 - 3\u003cbr\u003e1. Motivated - to face ones self, to appreciate the moment, to embrace the task at hand and the process, inspired to work on weaknesses and to fill your holes one brick at a time, to find purpose and the will to use it\u0027s reason, to build the vision and belief in self, to trust that you can reach beyond yourself\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Activated - I call this the \"Spark\". The ability to develop a skill and utilize it in its Zenith. To tap into the edge of ones own abilities, to visualize and trust what the mind had already done. To be fearless and to trust your skills and development practices.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. Determined - Balance is key not the physical but the mental balance. One must understand that having the ability to perform or stay engaged while dealing with the mental paradoxes of competition. Keeping balance between \"angry and determined\" is a skill trained and when utilized creates AWESOME! RESULTS."
