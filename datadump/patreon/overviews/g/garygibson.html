Generally speaking, I\u0027m known for writing space opera and hard SF, and I\u0027ve done it fairly successfully for a number of years now. More details about my writing are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.garygibson.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eat my website\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e...\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set this Patreon up primarily because people email me and ask if there\u0027s going to be a follow-up to Extinction Game and Survival Game. I hate having to tell them that the publisher decided they didn\u0027t want another book in the series. Nonetheless, that third book kept niggling at my mind until I decided to do something about it. In August, I wrote a very fast first draft of a novella (40-50,000 words) intended to wrap up the series.\u00a0Now it needs a thorough edit, including multiple drafts, all of which will take months of work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nature of publishing means it\u0027ll either have to be self-published, or put out by a small press. However, my need to focus on paying work means I don\u0027t have as much time to dedicate to it as I\u0027d like.\u00a0But if my Patreon reaches its minimum goal, I\u0027ll be able to focus on getting it finished much sooner than it might otherwise be. I\u0027ll also be able to focus much more on all my other writing projects, and thereby increase the chances of getting them published in the near future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, I can\u0027t promise a huge amount in the way of rewards - apart from things that might appeal to the writers amongst you, that is! However, there\u0027s every chance I might add new rewards over the coming months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
