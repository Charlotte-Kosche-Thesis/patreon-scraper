    "summary": "Edit 18.01.18 \u003cbr\u003eSince Monday, I have\nbeen helping in the WVS Hicks ITC International Animal Rescue Goa\nclinic, the largest center dealing with homeless animals in this\nregion of India. The clinic is maintained from commercial activities\nand donations, thanks to which it can help street animals and poor\nfamilies. It is a\u00a0humane/NO KILL unit, every dog, cat and whatever goes\nthere is treated, also the center runs chemotherapy for homeless dogs with\ntumors. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nIn WVS Hicks ITC I help in\na hospital for homeless dogs and in part devoted to saving abandoned\nkittens and puppies. On the spot, I became convinced once again how\nmuch needed volunteers with experience are. Especially those willing\nto stay for many weeks. It is also possible that I am the first\ntourist on Goa who spent ower three weeks here without alcohol or drugs.\nHere I am able to help, while developing my knowledge and skills\nneeded to save animals. Over time, the range\nof my duties will increase, as it does every day. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive weeks of volunteering in Nepal made me realize\nthat I am fit for the job, and people like me are needed. I had a lot\nof experience working with animals, but I was not sure if I will bear\nworking in third world regions. Mostly I was\nafraid of wounds infested with maggots, in Europe the season for\nmaggots is short and animals with old undergoing wounds are rare.\nHere is the everyday life, if you have the courage see the pictures.\nFortunately, it turned out that I have nerves to help the dog with an\neye socket full of larvae. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\t\tI\u0027m not here to take pictures or write articles,\n\t\tthis part is only for collecting cash. I will deal with a hard\n\t\tphysical and mental work, often dangerous. Work that no one is\n\t\teager to do, but there\u0027s always more animals than hands on the\n\t\tdeck. I will be cleaning dog cages and dressing up those terrible\n\t\twounds, whatever is necessary. Im talentet to it, during last\n\t\tvoluntary jon I was the main person designated to help World Vets.\n\t\tFor three days I was responsible for picking up dogs from seven\n\t\toperating tables, over 250 sterilization and castration. \n\t\t\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\nplaces that help animals in Asia are many and they are doing\nsurprisingly well but the work is huge. Most\nof these places are reasonably organized and have their own\nveterinarians. Unfortunately, there are thousands of injured and sick\nhomeless animals, and cutting the population is just beginning. Most fundacion are low on\nstuff, especially when it comes to homeless animals care and rescue.\nPeople who are willing to do a full time job, taking the worst are\nirreplaceable when it comes to rescuing animals. Saving pets it\u0027s\nwhat makes me happy, more than anything else. Breaking my boundaries\nmakes my proud. Surely confronting the animals misery and realities\nof places where rabies still kills makes places beautiful like Goa\nfeels like hell. Most people are here for rest and party, somehow not\nseeing abandoned puppys being eaten alive by maggots. I have no\ninterest in resting or partying when i see animals in need.  There\u0027s\nno fun in what i do but a deep satisfaction and sense of purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\nproblem is that all this costs money, and i\ngot money just for few weeks, in a tent.  If you support what i do\nand want me to go on helping animals. You can simply set a monthly\ndonation and if you now someone who would be happy to help me, please\nshow them my patreon project. \n\u003cbr\u003e"
