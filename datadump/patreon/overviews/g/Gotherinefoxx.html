I\u0027m originally from North West Indiana where I originally started on my story lines on both series. Ducky The Dragon is a spin off series started from my Dungeons and Dragons group playing the story line Earth 2.0. I am an artist writer in my twenties looking to get a hand hold in the comic industry. My work is influenced heavily by Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood and Sherri Lewis growing up in the early nineties. I am eager to get the Earth 2.0 story line put into a format for D\u0026amp;D campaigns hoping to launch my self into the likes of D\u0026amp;D greatness. \u003cbr\u003e",
