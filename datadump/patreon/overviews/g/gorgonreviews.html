    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the official Patreon page of Gorgon Reviews (www.gorgonreviews.com), the best Greek Mythology Titled Movie Review page on the Internet.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Gorgon Reviews in October of 2011 and have created over 1500 reviews in that time. Right now we have five reviews a week, all for free, all for current movies in theaters or new to DVD. My reviews are informative, humorous, occasionally ranty, and just fucking amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhy am I looking to use Patreon? Well, I have been reviewing films for 4 and a half years at this point, all on my own dime. I have bought many movie tickets and spent many hours laboring on my writing, perfecting my craft, and watching almost everything I can get my hands on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I was also a Geophysicist. And well, the Oil and Gas industry not only crashed hard, but it is going to be a long time until it recovers. Despite getting laid off almost six months ago, I have tried a few different career avenues and the search has not been going well. Now with unemployment about to run out and our savings dwindling, I am running out of options, with a wife and three kids to support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have turned to Patreon to offer my website, some swag, and some extra services. After all, this is really my dream job, so if I could make it work I will give it a shot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy website will still produce five wonderful reviews a week (or more if goals get reached), all for free, all with the same humor and insight. But here are a few extra things to get your lips wet and appetites started.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePledge Level Gifts: (All levels include what is listed PLUS what comes with previous levels)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(238, 236, 225);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003eLevel 1: $1\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMy personal love and thanks, which can be used for credit at every Pizza Planet restaurant in America.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(238, 236, 225);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003eLevel 2: $5\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eExclusive access to the fan page on my website. At the first tier, you will be able to suggest films for me to review with a bit more gusto than a normal reader.

You will have access to my Movie Cheat Sheets. They will only be made for the 1-2 big releases every week (that I see) and they will be your GO TO GUIDE to get the quick and dirty facts about the film. A very quick plot summary, the biggest actors, 2-4 notable parts (can be good or bad), and important spoilers. Don\u0027t worry, the spoilers will be at the bottom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis way you don\u0027t have to see the movie in question, but you can definitely still talk about it with your friends and coworkers as if you did! I mean, who wants to spend all that money on food and tickets every week, just to stay hip? With these Movie Cheat Sheets, you can now just spend $15 a month and spend your time at home watching whatever the crap you want!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLevel 5: $20\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eAt this point, I risk all of my privacy and will give you my personal cell phone number. You can technically talk to me about whatever, but the point of it is to ask me movie questions when you need an answer. If I am not at work (if I get another job), in a movie (which is also work), or asleep, I will respond to you as soon as I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou might want to know if certain films are good for certain aged kids. If there is a scene at the end of the credits. If you should get X or Y at Red box. Or if a movie has a character die. Or if a movie has a character \u003cem\u003enaked\u003c/em\u003e.

You will be able to help determine future Milestone Reviews for my website (1500-2000 word reviews with tons of pictures, jokes and more of older generally hated pieces of cinema). I only do these every 50 reviews, and they are always a treat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*You\u0027ll be sent an email with a survey form to collect size/shipping information after your pledge.\u003cbr\u003e^Level of sexiness can vary.

We will talk about movies, answer questions, discuss that last month of film and the next month of film. And whatever the heck else you want to talk about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what are you waiting for? You know you want in on all these sexy new goodies \u0026amp; content.
