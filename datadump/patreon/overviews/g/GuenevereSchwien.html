My studio is open to the public through YouTube videos\nchronicling my painting process enabling my friends, family, and followers to\nwitness my masterpieces coming to life. I also live stream from my studio on\nTwitch.tv/GuenevereS\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy current series of paintings are a metaphor for the\nswirling tangle of positive and negative thoughts in our minds. I want the work\nto encourage us all to focus on the positive thoughts, or lights, rather than\nthe darks. I struggle with staying positive at times, and through this series I\nam challenging myself to be a positive example of how you can change your\nthoughts with regular practice and watching what you think. Every piece I\ncreate develops out of my strong work ethic and focus on quality, whether it is\na painting, a video, or something else entirely. Join me in my videos, or live\nin my studio, to witness the many hours I spend on each painting I create. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour support is vital in helping me continue to create new artwork and share the progress of my career with you. In 2016, my career rose to new heights with multiple accolades and accomplishments. One of my tulip paintings was in my first museum show at the Monterey Museum of Art, and I had paintings in three national and international juried shows. In one of these exhibitions, the American Women Artists National Show, my painting won Best Still Life, my most prestigious award of my career. Finally, I have been selected to be a part of a travelling hyper-realist museum show, in which three of my motorcycle paintings will be featured, beginning in March, 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMONTHLY ART SHOWS!!\u003cbr\u003eEach month we have a themed art show so you can join in the creative process.
