I do a good bit of moving around this beautiful country and find myself focusing a bit too much on survival. I would love nothing more than to spend more time: working on projects, settling in these landscapes and meeting more interesting people to photograph!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Friends of mine told me of Patreon and how they help connect those who wish to share and see what others are creating.

The entirety of the book will be filled with photographs and small sections of text, equaling cover to cover, exactly one thousand words. \u003cem\u003eSupport for this project is so important to me\u003c/em\u003e in a few different ways. I believe it to be a series that I would very much like to collaborate with a larger community. I will be asking in the future - on the road - how to represent particular issues and where to go next. I want to collaborate with you and hear your \u0027take\u0027 on long standing political and social issues. Being supported financially with this will directly effect how long I can stay on location and accomplish each page of this ongoing series. Your support will keep me moving to places and to the people who I believe should be introduced on this platform.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
