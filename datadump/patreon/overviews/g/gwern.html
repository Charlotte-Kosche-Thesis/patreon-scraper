I\u2019m just a college student studying for an undergrad in engineering, but I haven\u2019t known anyone, even my professors, to produce this style of work as merely \u201csomething I do for fun in my free time.\u201d Often, people simply don\u2019t write as well as you do and by consequence they are more boring. On that note, please keep writing. I\u2019ve learned a fair amount from your work - from discovering Haskell to using R for statistics work (another good choice, though I\u2019ve again had trouble learning it) and I really think your opinions on computer science and software are dead-on. Tea is worth a mention as well. I went from drinking bagged black tea to oolong bought from Upton. I particularly like the ginseng-covered oolong there, though perhaps only because I enjoy the gimmick of it. Either way, I would never have advanced further into the hobby had I not encountered Upton, which I credit to your article on tea\u2026Oh yeah, and I\u2019ll be sending some BTC your way. I\u2019d like to see more technology and computer science essays ;)\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nfascinating.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nI haven\u2019t met many people who are so obviously much smarter than me. By that I mean that the reasoning skills that the smartest people I\u2019ve seen display are at least around the same as mine. Even if they are not, I can see I could still reach the same level if I worked on it. Then there is you. You seem to have pretty much taught yourself how to think like a scientist from scratch. You know how to analyze old knowledge and see how it all relates. But you take this a step further, producing whole new kinds of knowledge and encouraging further directions in thought. Thanks for the work you\u2019ve done so far. You give me faith in humanity, and I\u2019m not sure how many people notice your exceptional situation but it\u2019s something you should feel proud of. I\u2019m going to continue to study your work and hopefully learn new skills. You have gathered such a solid foundation in one place that I\u2019m confident I can become a better thinker by learning from you. Anyway, great website and I hope you keep writing. Your pal, Anon.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nYOO ORE FOCKEN KEWL\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nGreat thank you for your writing on melatonin. You convinced me to try it (for some reason I thought it was not over-the-counter in my country, but I turned out to be wrong). It was simply the most helpful piece of advice I read in previous 3 months (and I have been actively trying to fight my insomnia all this time). Your concept of \u201clong content\u201d is quite inspiring, made me write a few pieces on my own (after all, if you strive for quality, not quantity and newsworthiness, you can move at a very slow and comfortable pace and finally get somewhere). Your love for typography is also shining through the pages but doesn\u2019t annoy the reader with emptiness, as it often happens with\n\t\u003cem\u003epure\u003c/em\u003e graphic designers/typographers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nYour website is amazing\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nHiya Gwern, Thanks for doing stuff! I\u2019ve read a range of your writings (though not hugely in detail on any one topic) and I find it really interesting. You write lots, you do nice programming things, you listen to Touhou music (one time you\u2019d liked the exact same YouTube videos I had just watched, 2spooky) and do other things which are often enlightening thanks to the extensive research you do. I\u2019ve also found a lot of things through your links and been inspired by some of your writings (e.g.\u00a0recently copying your neat (!Wikipedia) tag for a preprocessor). tl;dr This is a fan letter. Thanks for doings things \u0026amp; writing about them online so much, because it\u2019s interesting and drives me to do \u0026amp; write for myself!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nContent wise, it\u2019s great.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nThank you so much for your work, time, and research: you\u2019ve been instrumental in shaping my views and goals. I\u2019m just a high school senior, but I now know what I would like to do\u2026When I read that you used a Debian system (in passing) I decided to give it a try. I\u2019m no longer a Mac OSX only user\u2026In all of my college essays (yuck!) where they asked you to list influential blogs, etc, I mentioned you. I\u2019m curious as to how some admissions counselor would react. Under any case, I plan to go to graduate school, get a PhD, become a faculty member (in neuroscience) and develop nootropics and euphoriants. Your methods of blinding yourself are invaluable (why doesn\u2019t everyone do this!).\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nnice work you\u2019re doing :)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\njust wanted to let you know that you have been one of the most influential bloggers in my life. Your articles are well-reasoned and thought-out and have succeeded educating me on issues I have never thought to even consider earlier. Moreover I love that the language is comprehensible and not the usual mind-bogglingly complex language used by most researchers in their fields even when you read only the abstract of their work. For the record, I found you a year or two ago on Hacker News. It was probably on the topic of sleep. Also, I have recently started to get more into the rationalist diaspora, where you alongside LessWrong and SSC are the biggest influencers for me.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nGwern rocks my socks off. \u0026lt;3\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nThanks for writing. You are honest and deep, but your perspective always seems to contain some hope. As someone who spends a lot of time looking at the world cynically and shares a lot of your apparent interests, I really appreciate the hopeful, positive part. Your ultimately positive take on subcultures as a way of escaping marginalization, for instance, helped me overcome some of the buried shame I\u2019ve got going on as a pretty marginalized person (in some respects, anyway)\u2026Overall, thanks for writing. Your work is interesting, inspiring and damn impressive. I hope you\u2019re happy and don\u2019t suffer too much.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nYou, Sir, are fucking awesome!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nYou are an awesome person, the world is definitely better off because you\u2019re writing good content, and you\u2019re directly responsible for about $5000 of my lifetime income so far (through your write-up on Modafinil) and likely more through convincing me to talk about the fact that Modafinil exists to other programmers and knowledge works. You\u2019re probably one of the top ten people in my life in terms of how much my belief changes on a topic after hearing their opinion on something.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nHello there, I just wanted to say that as someone interested in privacy and anonymity that your \n\t\u003cem\u003eAnonymity\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEntropy\u003c/em\u003e essay is probably one of the best I have ever read on the subject. It made more things click for me than watching hundreds upon hundreds of hours of lectures on privacy and anonymity online did for me. It really is some of the best and clearest writing on the subject I have ever seen. I had only seen a few episodes of the anime, but that was more than enough for me to get the gist of your example. Very very clear writing. I saw that you had actually updated the page recently, but your updates/modifications are often very minor I\u0027ve found. The piece is so good I feel like a part 2 with a secondary example played out could easily be created.\n...This piece is probably just the best on the subject that exists. I can\u0027t thank you enough for just existing and having the mind that you do, and doing the work you are doing.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nI appreciate your work, Gwern Branwen.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\ni like all the uncommon words you use. and many of the topics you research and write about, and how you write about them, with the many passages from books and quotes from people you reference or include in your essays (i really do like a lot of those). the sometimes endless graphs and quantification i can tolerate. and i like your notes and your travel logs and the little observations you make.
