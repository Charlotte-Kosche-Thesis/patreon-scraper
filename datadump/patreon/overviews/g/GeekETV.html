I played basketball, in every level during my school years as well as in the AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) for ten years! In the midst of playing basketball I also dabbled in Lacrosse, where I was one of the top defensive players. Not only that, but after deciding I wanted to to take a break from a game I grew up playing, I quickly found my place on a boxing team in college and even after leaving the area I continued to box and train for three years. I then moved to Taekwondo, where I studied for about a year until I decided the combat level I was looking for laid in Muay Thai territory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2298364629/v7jm05csiu6zp4v83zfb.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have studied Muay Thai for about three years off and on due to an accident where I was run over by a jeep. Now that I am fully healthy, GeekEWorkouts is a way to motivate myself and others to continue passed adversity! After this accident, I felt I could never get my body back to the way it was, but I decided that shouldn\u0027t be the goal at all!
