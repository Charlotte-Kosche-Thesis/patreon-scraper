This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support what you\u2019re doing: becoming a better grappler!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is Patreon? the concept is that you support a creator financially for the valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s videos and instructionals on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping creators bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work\u003c/h3\u003eEvery day of every week I publish fresh content to\u00a0my YouTube Channel. I also publish content to my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.thegrapplingacademy.com\"\u003ewww.thegrapplingacademy.com\u003c/a\u003e and I also offer my services as a coach and mentor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help me produce this content, you can support me with a monthly contribution from as small as $1 and in exchange, in addition to my undying gratitude, I give you something extra that most other users of my content do not get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest in producing free YouTube training videos for our fantastic Jiu Jitsu community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like providing better content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eI don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. I know what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos that I hope will help you\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003eMy name is Coach Tom,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...I\u0027ve been studying Grappling and Jiu-Jitsu for as long as I can remember. I have been an active coach in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu from as early as 2006. I spend most of every day devoted to furthering the art Brazilian Jiu Jitsu full time - from dusk till dawn! This means studying, teaching and filming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a college graduate with high academic credentials, I continue this commitment to excellence via teaching Jiu-Jitsu to students worldwide, via my YouTube channel. This takes a huge amount of my time, energy and money. Any contribution that you can make, any, is enormously well received!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
