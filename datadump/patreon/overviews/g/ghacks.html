It allows you to support me and the site directly starting with whatever you can spare regularly.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that some cannot support Ghacks this way and that some won\u0027t, but if the rest would just give what they think it is worth to them each month, Ghacks would be there forever regardless of other factors.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe benefit here is that this money is independent of (declining) ad revenue and traffic, and that it allows me to keep on running the site just like before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m not forcing anyone to support the site but if you like what I do and want to support me, then this is an excellent option to make sure the site will be there next year, in five years and twenty years.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I can only do it with your help. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being a part of the site,\n\u003cbr\u003eMartin"
