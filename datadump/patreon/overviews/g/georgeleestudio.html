    "summary": "I am extremely passionate about the phenomena of Place, a geographic socio-ecological stew. I have been making sculpture with communities about Place since 2005 professionally. I primarily build commissioned public sculpture at a large scale, migrating between mediums, based in field anthropological and site research. I also facilitate community design projects, am a place Architect, write about place, and paint large scale wall street art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a Masters Degree in Landscape Architecture from the University of Washington, and Bachelors in Environmental Studies with a focus in Geology and Religion from Vassar College. I worked as a professional landscape architect for 2+ years on complex public projects. My art hand work is self-taught from myriad trade jobs from boatbuilding to trailbuilding to home remodeling while I\u0027ve picked up fine art skills from Pratt Fine Arts Center and trial and error on years of commissions. I\u0027ve been hired for sculpture commissions from many agencies including the City of Seattle and the Museum of Northwest Art, and been paid to speak and consult for the Fulbright Scholars Program and King County about issues of place, art, and out of the box thinking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am experimenting with layering color textures inspired by Georgia O\u0027Keefe flower paintings, and building on site, a large 10\u0027 x 60\u0027 x 10\u0027 sculpture series about the increased tension in relations between humans and nature in our world today. I also am a creative placemaker assisting with the community design process for an improved lakeshore in a very multicultural Seattle neighborhood park. I am looking for new and innovative ways to increase my artistic impact on the world through any means ethical and necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
