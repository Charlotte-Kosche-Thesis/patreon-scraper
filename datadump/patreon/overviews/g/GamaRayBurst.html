I was on track for that in 2016. My series, Pharim War, was selling phenomenally. I got a cover quote from Brandon Sanderson. I was a guest on the podcast Writing Excuses twice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few other series. Nylean Chronicles had a companion bestiary released in 2017, and Goblin Star (Dragons in space. Who doesn\u0027t love that?) is ongoing. I\u0027ve had a couple of short stories (ask my about the unicorn-potato). There are a few other exciting things coming up (psychic dinosaur swords), but I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePutting a book out there is expensive. There\u0027s editing, cover art, advertisement, convention space, and a thousand other small things most people never event think about. Any little bit helps, and plus, you get rewards. Everyone likes rewards, right?\u003cbr\u003e"
