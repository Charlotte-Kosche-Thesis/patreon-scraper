    "summary": "Hi\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027m Gary and I have the YouTube channel called KillerOffRoadHobbyz where I buy, build, bash, test, fix, and review Rc\u0027s for would be buyers to show if the Rc\u0027s you are looking at is worth your hard earned money. I do all of this with 100% honesty and pull no punches. My channel is aimed at saving people money by showing the good value Rc\u0027s over the bad, I myself was tricked when I first got into Rc and from then on I decided to save others the hard learned lessons I went through. I test the fun factor and limits of all the Rc\u0027s I test and get some fun to watch video while I do. I feel I have saved many people a headache of getting a bad egg Rc that other reviewers will say is good because it was sent to them for free. I am unsponsored and hold no loyalty to any companies or corporations, my loyalty lies with my viewers period. To put it in different words I tell it like it is. On my channel I also hold giveaways as well to give back to my viewers to get a Rc to someone who might not have one or may not have the money to buy one themselves. Thank you all very much everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour money will go to helping get better cameras and filming equipment so that I can make better and higher quality content for you and other viewers.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelping get the latest Rc\u0027s to get the word out about them whether good or bad first so people like yourself and others know the truth and if it\u0027s worth you money or not.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo help keep the Rc\u0027s around for a while longer so that I can present a long term reviews on Rc\u0027s that did well in the short term reviews.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo help me help you and others. I am a working class family man with a wife and two small children, and by no means am I rich. I have purchased almost every Rc that has been on my channel since day 1. It is only recently with the raffles I have held where viewers pick a Rc by popular vote and donate to buy the chosen Rc that is raffled off after testing and I have just received my first sponsored Rc from a viewer that I will be sending to him after testing is complete and one count of gearbest.com sending me a $100 Rc to test. Other then those it has all been out of my pocket.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThankful. I am so thankful for all of you that support me whether it be by standing up for me when a troll is bad mouthing me for not giving a Rc they like a good review, or buying a ticket to be in a raffle that is being held, or just simply watching and liking or disliking a video. I am thankful to you all.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e"
