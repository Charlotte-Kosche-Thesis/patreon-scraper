    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Gerhildt. I have two main passions: website development and encouraging compassion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite development is a fun-for-me hobby that I\u0027d like to turn into a career. I\u0027m currently in a Bachelor\u0027s of Science program with SNHU to earn a degree in IT with a concentration in web development. I love coding, I love servers, I love Apache, and as much as other devs might frown upon me, I even love PHP! More than any of those, I love engineering beautiful, functional, accessible websites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy love of compassion comes straight from the heart. I\u0027ve lived without it - experienced abuse, poverty, betrayal, and a vicious self-loathing - and I\u0027ve seen the state the world is in today, so similar. I believe that people who can need to nurture and foster our compassion for ourselves and for our fellows, to help others as much as we can, and to work toward healing the scars of our world. To this end, I\u0027m working on a website that I intend to be collective and collaborative, called Compa.ssion.ist. This site will have articles, courses, and forums for helping one another and growing together in love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to help build interest in my work and also to supplement this whole \"staying alive\" thing I\u0027m expected to do. Any support you can give is appreciated by my whole giant bear heart. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
