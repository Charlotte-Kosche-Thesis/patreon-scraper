    "summary": "Hello, and thanks for taking the time to read about GodisaGeek.com\u0027s Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt may come as a surprise to some of you \u2013 especially given the content we already put out \u2013 but we\u2019re all part-time. But we love what we do, and we want to do more of it, perhaps even one day we can make GodisaGeek our day job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe already run the site on little to no adverts, but your support means we can be self-sustainable for the long-term future. People always tell us how much they like our site and what we\u0027re doing, so we\u0027re asking for help to enable us to go further, be better, and do more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, even a single dollar or pound helps us massively. If everyone who watched, read, or listened to our content gave that much, we\u0027d easily make enough for a couple of full-timers, and maybe more.  But just sharing our content, subscribing to our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/godisageek\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/godisageek/id403714442?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePodcast\u003c/a\u003e helps, as does leaving a comment, even if it\u0027s a silly throwaway one. Please, don\u0027t be the person who thinks \"someone else will do it\", and the reason we\u0027re reaching out to our audience is that we are approaching a level we cannot sustain for the long term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea behind our Patreon, however, is that there are very few entirely independent video game websites out there of our size and stature. Hitting our first target means we can pay freelancers to attend events we can\u0027t, which gives us the chance to inform you, and let you know what\u0027s going on with the biggest (and sometimes smallest) games we\u0027re all dying to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur aim is to thank you for your support with early access, exclusive content, and giveaways. We want to make sure that you - the people who care the most about our site - get the best access. Early, longer podcasts, heads up about internal workings of the industry, early looks at articles and videos we\u0027re going to release publicly, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe in what we\u0027re doing, and we think if you give us a chance, you will too. We want to be the best we can be, and with your help, that\u0027s easily within our reach. People say they want honest reviews, we give you that - and we\u0027re being honest here: we need your help. Nobody wants to see adverts, nobody wants to click away from their favourite site because they couldn\u0027t afford to attend an event for a game they want to read about: you can make sure we never miss a beat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us create fun, original content, that is both what we want to make, and what you want to consume.\u003cbr\u003e"
