    "summary": "What\u0027s going on everybody it\u0027s the Granddadda, Granddad Woolly and you are here on my official Patreon page! For those who may be unfamiliar on who I am, I\u0027m a rising hip hop artist and Youtube creator (a pretty good one if I do say so myself) who specializes in making good music (I got bars) and good videos (that also happen to be entertaining, hilarious and uncensored). I\u0027ve developed this Patreon in the hopes of having my loyal fans and possible new ones directly support me in expanding and growing my brand to make The Granddad that dude (or at least one of them). As some of you may know, I have a great Youtube review show called \"Woolly Reviews\" that has gotten a lot of praise and has built me a loyal audience that is growing more everyday. I also do another great segment called \"CD Case Studies\" and of course I release original music and music videos that are all worth checking out. That being said, I want to expand and grow even more at a rate that I am unable to accomplish on my own. That\u0027s where you all come in. I want to not only have you as Patrons to help me be able to work more extensively on my current content but also give me the ability to create new and exclusive content just for the loyal Patreon community that I want to develop (you deserve it). I also would let you all in behind the scenes to see how I do what I do and of course give you first knowledge of what I have in store next. Just know that whatever support I receive will be appreciated and rewarded and when The Granddad becomes \"That Dude\", and then you can say, \"I was one of the people who helped The Granddad become \"That Dude\"!\" Ok, you can explore the page now, I\u0027m gonna go eat a sammich."
