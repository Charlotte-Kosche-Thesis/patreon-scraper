    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome and thank you for finding your way to my Patreon profile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jon, or as you know me by my online presence, GlobeTrotterAlpha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Canadian, in my thirties, with two main passions in life, Travel and Videography / Photography. Apparently, combining them both works quite well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow did it all begin?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlobeTrotterAlpha came into existence in the fall of 2010. I was browsing Youtube, looking for interesting travel videos (I do that a lot) when I came across a particular Youtube user\u0027s channel who\u0027s travel videos astounded me by their video / audio quality. Most of all, the smoothness of their movement gave me a sense of actually being there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou could say that I had had my \u0027Eureka\u0027 moment. I had found my calling. The world is a big place and I wanted to show places that I loved visiting or would love to visit in the same manner.\u003cbr\u003e...So began my long journey of creating travel videos for the world (and myself) to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003eThe \u0027star of the show\u0027 in my videos is the destination, not me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of today, Globetrotteralpha\u0027s videos have been viewed over 18 million times, with hundreds of thousands of new monthly views and over 65 thousand Youtube subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite + Blog:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://globetrotteralpha.com/\"\u003ehttp://globetrotteralpha.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/GlobeTrotterAlpha\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/GlobeTrotterAlpha\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook :\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GlobeTrotterAlphaTravels/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/GlobeTrotterAlphaTravels\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eInstagram: \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/globetrotteralphatravels\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/globetrotteralphatravel...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlobeTrotterAlpha was and still is a one man show. I myself do all of the planning, filming and editing of the travel video projects. This is one reason why releases of new videos are few and far between. To date (November, 2017) I have had no sponsors to support me financially on these projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to hope that my technical abilities have improved over the years, providing my audience with a more immersive / realistic view of the places I have filmed. This constant desire for improvement has lengthened the planning and editing stages as well as given me a better understanding of the time required to spend filming a location.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring all of these years, my day job and the income it has generated have, for the most part, enabled me to pay the bills AND pursue my passions. However, this past year, changes in my personal life and an increase in financial responsibilities have made the production / creation of travel videos harder and harder. The costs of travel + up-to-date camera equipment only go up and are never-ending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy recent discovery of Patreon, and its invaluable service of enabling creators to gain possible support from those who enjoy their work, have led me to make the decision to become a Patreon creator. Any gracious support by you, my audience, would ease the financial burden of creating future videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the nature of the time frame of the creation process, I am not looking for a monthly financial pledge. However, if you like what you\u0027ve seen so far and would enjoy seeing more of this style of travel videos, a monetary pledge per video by you, would be greatly appreciated as well as helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating these videos and showcasing these destinations to the world. Your support will greatly increase my ability to create more videos, more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for your time, your viewership and...your patreonage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlobeTrotterAlpha\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t done so yet, please go to one of my pages listed above and check out my previous work to get a sense of what you can expect from future videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
