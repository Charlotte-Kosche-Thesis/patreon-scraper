That\u0027s what we\u0027re creating.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently working on a master project based off of the thousands of books I\u0027ve read and hundreds of articles that I and our community have researched and written on personal development over the last three years. I\u0027d like to invite you to join us on our next adventure, summarizing all of that knowledge. Ask questions. Add your own thoughts for consideration.

This all started as my personal blog back in 2015 as a way to give back to the community some of the lessons I\u0027ve learned from raising five kids and serving in leadership roles for the last 20+ years.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat personal development blog has since evolved into a community of people on a shared mission of helping each other grow in our personal and professional lives. Nearly 20,000 strong, our community is scattered throughout various media channels including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Triberr, direct email subscribers, and now have formed official membership groups using Patreon. While I\u0027m still very heavily involved, this community is beginning to take on a life of its own which is truly exciting.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\nPatreon allows us to bring you rewards that we could not otherwise afford to give and offer content we could not otherwise afford to produce. It is also integrated with Discord which allows us to easily grant access to that membership chat and forum. You\u0027ll find content here that you will not find anywhere else in our network.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInvest in yourself and others by becoming a member today. I look forward to talking with you soon!\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Don Smith\n\u003cbr\u003e"
