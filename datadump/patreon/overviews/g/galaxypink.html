I\u0027m still getting the hang of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service for artists, musicians, and other creative types, that lets fans of our projects show their love and support with small, regular contributions, like tips in a tip jar! \u00a0Instead of donating a single large sum to fund one project, like a Kickstarter campaign, fundraising through Patreon lets you contribute a small amount every month to help support all my future projects for as long as you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreat, but who is GalaxyPink?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://galaxypink.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGalaxyPink\u003c/a\u003e is me, Jessica! \u00a0I\u0027ve been doing solo 3D animated and still image CG erotic art projects since 2007, mostly centered around my flagship series, \"Sexual Fantasy Kingdom\". \u00a0The SFK is a usually cheerful fantasy world where magic is as common as sex, and all elves are futanari - that\u0027s Japanese for \"dual form\", but it\u0027s often translated as \"dickgirls\", not transsexuals, just girls who also have dicks - because I think they\u0027re cute, that\u0027s why! \u00a0It\u0027s not all futanari art, but that\u0027s definitely a common recurring theme. \u00a0My projects contain a lot of variety and humor, a highly detailed world, and dozens of characters who are full of life and personality. \u00a0That\u0027s because I pour all my love and attention into everything I create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of other projects penciled into my future, some in new settings, and some expanding even further on the Kingdom of Sexual Fantasies, and now you can help me create them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you raising money with Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve sold my work for years in the United States and Japan, and I\u0027ve had international customers from over 50 countries! \u00a0That probably makes it sound like I\u0027m doing quite well for myself, but in reality I usually only make enough money to barely keep a roof over my head. \u00a0Considering the cost of living in the United States, my yearly income hovers around the U.S. poverty line, and I can\u0027t afford basic medical care, much less any luxuries. \u00a0That being said, I\u0027ve been able to squeak by as a professional artist these past few years, I\u0027m in decent health, and I have simple tastes, so I\u0027m \u003cem\u003eokay\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut times are changing! \u00a0Rampant software piracy of the artwork of small independent artists like me has hurt my sales. \u00a0And paid software releases, even in porn, may be a business model that\u0027s slowly losing relevance. \u00a0As much as I love my work, I admit I\u0027ve been reconsidering recently, whether this line of work is still possible for me. \u00a0I think it is...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you help make Patreon work for me, I can put more time into learning better artistic techniques and programming tricks, I can do the research I need to take my work in new directions like Android apps,\u003cem\u003e and\u003c/em\u003e spend time breaking up my previous multi-scene volumes into individual standalone scenes so you can pick and choose exactly the content you want. \u00a0\u003cem\u003eAnd,\u003c/em\u003e I can start providing more free content, where you only pay if it\u0027s what you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love my work and you want to see more in the future and show me your support, please make a donation. \u00a0Every little bit helps, and even tiny monthly donations can add up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy monthly?\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, some of you may know, Patreon allows creators to set up payments on a monthly basis, or per project. \u00a0So why did I choose the monthly model? \u00a0Simple. \u00a0I can\u0027t post finished projects on Patreon because while they allow adult artists to raise money with Patreon, pornographic content can\u0027t be hosted here, so I wouldn\u0027t be able to use all the features of that model. \u00a0Furthermore, since some of my products take months to finish, I desperately need a more regular flow of income, even if it\u0027s a small amount, to help me get through the times before a new product is released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on moving to a monthly or bi-monthly release schedule of small projects. \u00a0Instead of waiting months or sometimes years for a whole, enormous project full of scenes, I\u0027ll release each scene or part as a small, standalone project as soon as it\u0027s complete, and worry about bundling it up into a complete volume later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to make a monthly contribution and sign up for rewards, you can make a one-time donation directly on my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.galaxypink.com/wordpress/donations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egalaxypink.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for my donation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAw, don\u0027t be like that. \u00a0Mostly? \u00a0You get the satisfaction of helping me continue creating the art that you and I both love! \u00a0I don\u0027t want my Patreon page to be all about creating tons of rewards for contributors, because that could easily take time away from my big projects, the ones you really want to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, I\u0027ll offer what I can to everyone who contributes here, and you\u0027re welcome to make suggestions for bonus content. \u00a0If you donate up to the amounts listed below, you can get the listed rewards, and be a part of my creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can donate a dollar a month, or as much as you want! \u00a0 It\u0027s easy to sign up, and you can cancel any time. \u00a0You can keep your donation anonymous, or proudly announce your love for GalaxyPink to the world! \u00a0Payments are made through Stripe which is super secure, Patreon\u0027s fees are very low so you know most of your donation is going straight to me, and if you\u0027re super generous and super supportive, I\u0027ll give you some cool stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForget about the rewards. \u00a0Donate because you care about supporting an artist you love, and you want to see me create more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so very much!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eGalaxy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
