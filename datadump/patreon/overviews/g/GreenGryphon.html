It doesn\u2019t ask anything of its audience. Hell, it doesn\u2019t even want its audience asking questions. It just says, \u201cThis is the good guy. This is the bad guy. This is the way the world should be, no questions asked.\u201d And what boggles my mind is that 21st century people seem to want it that way. They want their no-friction stories of tepid characters who all get along and stick together against the obvious bad people. The tellers of the tale do not want ambiguity. They do not want people making up their own minds. They want to put a finger in the face of the audience and waggle it around a bit. It\u2019s all propaganda and we\u2019re all blindingly consuming it so that something, anything, can give us a few moments of warm fuzzies in a shitty gray world of gray decisions and moral ambiguities. We ignore the hard conflicts because there are so many easy ones where we can take a side and feel safely righteous in our exuberant patting of our own backs. We express opinions we know have the support of others and secretly, fiercely, guard those opinions that might bring on a mob of holy crusaders. If we take a stand against the easy, popular opinion, we are sure to fall. And we\u2019re all too filled with cowardice for that. So instead, we argue about Doctor Who and Sherlock and comic books and Harry Potter. We attack showrunners and writers and artists when their superficial story choices aren\u2019t those we would have made. We take our battles to the popular culture because we have no stomach for a real fight. We\u2019re all assholes. Every single one of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut at least I\u0027m an entertaining asshole! Give me a dollar now!\u003cbr\u003e"
