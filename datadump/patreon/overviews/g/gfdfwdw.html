    "summary": "Since 2009, I\u0027ve been sharing my love of Disney and special dietary needs options found at the Disney Parks \u0026amp; Resorts with each and every one of you, through my site\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.glutenfreedairyfreewdw.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGluten Free \u0026amp; Dairy Free at WDW\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s always been my goal to keep my website and all of the content I create on it free for everyone. But, as the site has grown, I\u0027ve also seen my expenses to maintain the site grow too. Believe it or not, most people who create content online actually make very little money. Most don\u0027t even generate a lot of advertising revenue, unless you\u0027re getting millions of views.\u00a0So, with that comes this Patreon page. Call it a virtual tip jar, if you will. If you can afford it, and you get enjoyment and use out of my website, podcast, and videos, consider contributing $1 per month. If you feel like the content is worth more to you, or you\u0027d like to help more, you can do that too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of the content you\u0027ll find on my website, podcast, and videos is FREE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eHaving this page doesn\u0027t change anything about the content or your access to content I create. Patreon allows those who wish to contribute to the ongoing creation of content to do so. And, it helps me maintain the website and continue to create new content.\u00a0Thank you for taking a look and for considering supporting the site. I\u0027ll continue to work as hard as possible to bring you as much special diets info as I can. I\u0027m not currently offering rewards because I\u0027m trying to put 100% into the free content that I provide to everyone. But, I\u0027ll be sending patrons updates and news, so you\u0027re always in the know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to each and every one of you, Gluten Free \u0026amp; Dairy Free at WDW has changed my life in so many ways. I couldn\u0027t even have imagined the community and support that I\u0027ve gained when I started the site in 2009. At the time, it was simply an outlet for me to share information that I couldn\u0027t find anywhere else online with others who might need it as much as I did. Now, I can\u0027t imagine not having this amazing community of special diets and Disney fans in my life! My hope is that I can continue to create and share resources with all of you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind out more about the site, podcast, and YouTube channel:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.glutenfreedairyfreewdw.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.glutenfreedairyfreewdw.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSarah Norris\u003cbr\u003e"
