I do commissions as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI simply created this patreon because it seemed like a good place to organize materials and funds. It didn\u0027t demand that I reveal who I was just because I wanted money for something I enjoyed, and nobody\u0027s tried to scam me yet! I also enjoy the community, and if disposable income was a major factor in my life, I would definitely spend more time amongst the many talented artists and creators that populate Patreon\u0027s pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever- I am also a busy individual. Art may be my life, but that means that it is also a primary occupation of my time. What used to be a relaxing activity for me is now the one skill I must practice to oblivion if I want to make a name for myself. As such, I want to make it known that my availability and posting rate may fluctuate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, I don\u0027t think text is a good way for someone who\u0027s selling their art to convince another to invest in them. That, and selling myself as an artist is kind of a difficult thing to do. I prefer to let my work to speak for itself. If it doesn\u0027t appeal to you, that\u0027s alright. If you want to critique or comment on it, by all means, please do. But if it does appeal to you, I would really appreciate it if you helped support my hobby and now deeply ingrained need to make ideas appear on a canvas."
