His photographic nudes - stark, unadorned and unabashedly austere \u2013 reflect a profound respect for the model, or, as Kreimer would say, \u201cthe collaborator;\u201d ensuring that the emotional intensity of every image remains intact, integral and entirely reflective of both Kreimer and the model. Kreimer\u2019s images, stripped away of any distracting adornments, are monumental testimonies and tributes to the power of a singular emotion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eKreimer\u2019s work is in numerous private collections in the cities of Los Angeles, New York, London, Miami, and Lima-Peru.\u003cbr\u003e",
