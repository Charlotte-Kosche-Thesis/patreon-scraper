    "summary": "Hello everybody, my name is Grace. I am an ASMRtist with a passion to not only give relaxation, and many tingles... but to spread words of self love and Compassion to not only others, but ourselves... in hopes I can create a safe place for those who need a support system.\u003cbr\u003eSuffering from crippling anxiety, ASMR holds a special place in my heart. Helping me cope and being the medicine for recovery. For years I have watched these men and women create these wonderful videos and it tugged at my heart to give the same special gift of a feeling back to those who are new to ASMR and have been watching for years.\u003cbr\u003eCreating an online platform has been one of the most humbling experiences in my life. Thousands and thousands of worthy beings reaching out to me, with complete vulnerability to share their life\u0027s story. Some stories have tragedy, yet one thing they all have in common is... they deserve to be told. To share. To inspire. my goal in life is being able to give a support system to those who don\u0027t. To be the change. \u003cbr\u003eI believe by creating this Patreon, I can share my passions, validate, relax, bring many tingles, to show realistic life struggles, and self love to anyone/ everyone who chooses to support this platform. Even if one does not have the ability to join this platform, my Youtube platform is always going to be a constant/ support system for anyone/ everyone. You are strong and worthy always. You are capable of. You are loved, and you are love. If no one has told you they are proud of you today, I am so very proud of you.\u003cbr\u003e"
