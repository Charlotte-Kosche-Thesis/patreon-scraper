Our focus is primarily on comics and superhero media, but with numerous segments produced for the Geekvolution Omnibus, we cover a broad spectrum of geeky culture. Our content is designed to be fun, informative, and also to encourage folks to \u00a0think critically about what they\u0027re watching. Our most viewed and requested series is \u003cem\u003eSuperhero Rewind\u003c/em\u003e, my insane endeavor to produce an in-depth story analysis of every superhero movie ever made.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2009, we\u0027ve striven to engage with our audience and intimately involve everyone in what we do. I\u0027m proud of the community we\u0027ve built and it\u0027s because of their support that we continue to produce so much material on a wide variety of topics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps make it possible for me to continue making this my full time job and to pay for review material and equipment. And your support will also make it possible for us to produce ambitious and costly projects in the future, like narrative web series. We\u0027re currently producing Bat Cap: The 48 Hour Halloween, a sequel to Spawn Year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of exciting things we\u0027d like to do in the future, and we could use your help to make our stuff more awesome than ever before. And to reward anyone willing, I\u0027m going to make our Patreon supporters even more involved in what we do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to donate, may Galactus smile upon you.
