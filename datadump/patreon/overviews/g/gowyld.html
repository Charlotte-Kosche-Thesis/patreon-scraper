    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey! My name is Paul, and 2 years ago I quit my job as a Junior Graphic Designer to move country and do music full time. Here is why:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my own music project a few years ago originally called \u201cThis.\u201d with the intention of making worship music relevant to young adults and people. This was born out of the frustration that I felt that worship music all sounded the same as it was often done in just one style and genre, it then also became about wanting to write songs that challenge people by tackling subjects that a lot of people don\u2019t often talk about within church. With my first EP I got to write a track about Depression, Self harm and self image called \"Holding On\" and it has been one of the best performing tracks on that EP with over 150,000 plays on YouTube and approaching 50,000 plays on Spotify. The idea was to make a track that didn\u2019t hold back on describing everything, and from comments and feedback I\u2019ve had, it\u2019s really impacted some people in a meaningful way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently changed my name to WYLD and signed to a new collective called \u201cThe Amen Collective\u201d. This was set up by the people who run The Good Christian Music Blog to enable artists to collaborate with others and support one another in the music we are posting. We have already seen some of this music come out of collaborations through a Facebook group they manage which has a load of songwriters and producers in and it\u2019s a really exciting time to be making music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow with the name \u201cWYLD\u201d I have started work on a new album called \u201cTestimony\u201d which follows along the lines of what \u2018Holding On\u2019 did. I am approaching this first album with the catch phrase of, \u201cwhat if I made an album that would change/save someones life?\u201d. I\u2019ve gotten real world testimonies from people who have struggled with, Self Image, Depression, Self Harm, Eating Disorders and Pornography Addictions and working with writers who have struggled with some of these things too as to make sure that the songs truly capture what these experiences are like. The end goal with the album is that for anyone struggling with these issues, know that they are not alone in any of it and also to show anyone who isn\u2019t a Christian how God can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a mixture of big tracks and deep topics. Along with the album I want to help young people and young adults be able to talk about God, so I\u2019m creating a clothing brand called \u201cGO WYLD\u201d. The aim with this is to create a christian clothing brand that is in line with current fashion trends but is also affordable worldwide. I am lucky enough to be working with some talented designers to make a range of clothing. I am so passionate about both projects and if you want to be a part of it then I would love for you to pray about it and consider a monthly donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are some perks such as discount on clothing, free music and a Facebook group with direct contact to me and discussion of what is coming next!"
