    "summary": "I\u0027m Graham. I write games, especially games that tell stories. I\u0027ve won awards for what I\u0027ve written. If you search for me online, you\u0027ll find my games \u003cstrong\u003eCthulhu Dark, Disco World, A Taste for Murder \u003c/strong\u003eand many others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the games I love most, people stand up, move around and portray a character. It\u0027s an fun and intense experience, which is half-theatre and half-play. My favourite games include\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI Say A Little Prayer\u003c/strong\u003e, about the 1980s AIDS crisis among gay men in New York, \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Terps\u003c/strong\u003e, about interpreters in Iraq and Afghanistan, and\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe Curse\u003c/strong\u003e, about women in relationships making life-changing decisions. These are beautiful games. They create experiences that nobody will forget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share these games. I want more people to experience them. To do that, I need a space to run them in. Not just a pub basement, but a good theatrical space where people can make noise, move around and tell a story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of all, I want to reach out to new audiences. I want to run \u003cstrong\u003eI Say A Little Prayer\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for groups of gay men. I want to run \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Terps\u003c/strong\u003e for young people. I want to run \u003cstrong\u003eThe Curse\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for groups of women. That\u0027s much easier if I\u0027ve got a friendly, inviting space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve found a perfect space: it\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thenurserytheatre.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Nursery\u003c/a\u003e in London. I\u0027d like to rent that space, once a month, and run games for people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything if you give will help. If I get $10, I can reduce the price for every player by about $2. That\u0027s \u00a31, if you\u0027re British (and bear with me for the currency conversion). If I get $30, I can cut the price for everyone by half. If I get $60, I can run games for free or start a new space. In other words: whatever you contribute can make a real difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love you to play these games. But here\u0027s an important thing: I\u0027m not asking you to buy a ticket. I want you to support me in creating these spaces and helping people to play these games. Like I said: I\u0027d like to reach out to new audiences. I can\u0027t do that if I book out the games in advance. That\u0027s why the reward levels are about supporting people to play, not buying something from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support. I hope we get to play sometime.\u003cbr\u003e"
