It\u0027s comedy, often with a dry satirical edge and usually takes place in a modern setting. It is dialogue-driven, relies frequently on wordplay and surreal silliness, sometimes descends to crudity, and consciously aims to have the readers finish reading with their heads buzzing...but in a good way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy potential as a comedy writer was until April 2015 voiced only by a small group of close friends and relatives; it felt immodest to believe their praise. That fateful April however I won Third Prize in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.3daynovel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea competition for a short novel I frantically wrote in three days\u003c/a\u003e - \u003cem\u003eNo Truck With Fewer\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince there were several hundred entrants, and my fellow shortlistees generally had dizzying educational/life achievements I lack, on tasting that success I started to think I could go further as an author of comedy. I received $100 as my prize, but the real prize was validation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve an optimistic vision set sometime in the future. A human - in-between receiving favours of all flavours from beneficent robots, or alternatively huddling in a trench for cover from laser blasts fired by malevolent robots - sits down and reads one of my stories, making swift and deep progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA friend appears, and curiously asks: \u003cem\u003e\"Hey there, what are you reading?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fan/victim looks up with an strange and slightly twisted grin, and responds: \u003cem\u003e\"I have absolutely no idea.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo mildly allay concerns of my being a total crank/conman/hack, here are some samples of my writing:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gordonshure.com/indian-tablet-computers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIndian Tablet PCs Changed My Life\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gordonshure.com/china-japan-restaurant-revolt/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eChina Bows to Japan After \u0027Restauranteur Revolt\u0027\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gordonshure.com/mongoose-nuptials/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMongoose Nuptials\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me on Patreon helps me pay bills and feed myself and my young family. With a steady, meaningful flow of funds each month doing comedy writing no longer feels like an indulgence of vanity but instead something that at least entertains a few people and might one day entertain a larger audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s more, I\u0027ll feel honour-bound to keep writing for fans who believe in and genuinely enjoy what I do. I\u0027ll be able to uncouple myself somewhat from my day job (which is also writing, but of a kind commercially viable) and more towards creative, comedic writing which would otherwise be rather a crapshoot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who support me will receive chapter previews and samples, progress updates and a general inside view on what\u0027s happening where individual stories both short form and long form are progressing.\u00a0As of September 2015 I\u0027ve a serialized book planned with the prologue already done. Given how my brain works, articles of the kind in the samples linked also crop up time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you join me in helping this and other projects be completed, chapter by chapter, joke by joke, surreal setting by surreal setting?\u003cbr\u003e"
