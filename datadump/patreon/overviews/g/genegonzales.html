    "summary": "I\u2019m Gene Gonzales and welcome to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m an artist with a passion for comic book style art. I have created comics, art for licensing, text book illustration, graphic facilitatation, illustration for corporate training, well you get the idea. Most of the work I do is in a \u201ccomic book\u201d style and it\u2019s been popular. So you might ask, if I\u2019m doing all this, why Patreon. Good question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of the work I have created over the last 20+ years is owned by someone else. Work for hire. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It is what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had some success with my own properties, those that I created myself and those that I have co-created. The problem with creator owned projects is they don\u2019t pay until later. If at all. So they have to be done between the paying projects and there are only so many hours in a day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I am here. I have more than a few comic projects I would like to complete and I am looking for support. And if you choose to support me in this venture you will be on the ground floor of these creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will be sharing artwork I create while designing and working on these projects. And even some of the commissions and commercial work I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo that\u2019s it. Elsewhere on this page you can find out more of what you can expect if you become a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your time and I hope you will join me.\u003cbr\u003e"
