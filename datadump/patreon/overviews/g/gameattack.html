We\u0027re humbled every single day by your love for one another. You have transformed this community into a family. We could not be more excited to grow the brand by starting a new adventure together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is THE Game Attack Patreon - the return of Game Attack VOD content you know and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve been asking for it, so let\u0027s make it happen! Through this Patreon we\u2019re able to bring back the Game Attack shows you all know and love - Edited Gameplays, Tap Dat App, Four Play. BUT it doesn\u2019t stop there - through this Patreon you all can help us to grow our channel and give us the resources it takes to allow us to flex our creative muscles, including experimental shows and being able to make stream highlights! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve simplified our Patreon! We\u0027re going to take this one day, one goal at a time. We\u0027re looking to grow, and our next goal to do that is $8,000 a month. That will allow us to make our next hire (who will it be?!) and produce around 10 pieces of edited content a month (besides regular stream edits and Patron-only shows, of course).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis does NOT mean that streams are going anywhere - we\u0027re doing all this on top of our regular streaming schedule - so if you love the streams we encourage you to support those through superchats, direct donations, and sponsorships!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a major shift happening in the online video space right now. YouTube is shunning creators for not being \"advertiser friendly.\" As a matter of fact over 70% of our videos have been flagged as \"not advertiser friendly\" and to this day most content we post gets flagged and possibly demonetized. This sucks because it forces us to be something we\u2019re not. We want to create the content you want to see even when it isn\u0027t \"advertiser friendly.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why Game Attack changed to a live-only channel! If we had kept making VOD content alone the way we had been, there is no WAY Game Attack would still exist. Your support has kept us growing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we also realize that it\u2019s hard to grow a YouTube channel when all you see is 2 hour archives of streams. That\u2019s why our Patreon is a great way to support us and edited content. We\u2019re now producing DAILY short-form content, whether it be shows like Four Play or edited stream highlights. We\u2019re able to do this because of your support, but we\u2019d like to make even more of the content you\u2019ve been asking for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I get for supporting Game Attack?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, you get US! Also, you get CONTENT, and based on your Patronage you get rewards like exclusive shows, hangouts, and early content. Our Patreon is designed to get you early access based on your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also get peace of mind - knowing that you\u2019re making dreams come true for not just us, but also the staff we\u2019re able to hire through this platform!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u2019re Probably Asking Yourself These Questions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I watch the VOD content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can watch all of this content right here on Patreon. Depending on your tier, you\u0027ll see it on Patreon BEFORE you see it on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Game Attack still be part of the Let\u2019s Play Family on\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://roosterteeth.com/\"\u003eRoosterTeeth.com\u003c/a\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eYes. We have a partnership with RT that requires all of our content appear on RT FIRST. If you want to sign up for FIRST, that\u0027s great! However we are focusing in on this Patreon as our gauge for growth and the sole platform for creating new shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as Let\u0027s Play Family collaborations, honestly the shows created here by YOU on this Patreon will be a much easier outlet for cross-promotional VOD content with other channels - kinda like the Amazing Frog videos or AH VS GA in Driver: San Francisco!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Let\u2019s GO!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you g1s. It\u2019s always humbling to know that you have our backs. Thank you for allowing us to be us, and for being a part of this awesome community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you out there!\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
