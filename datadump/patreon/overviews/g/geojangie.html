    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi Constant Cacher! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Angie, and I\u0027m a lover of geocaching and writing. When my daughter, Sophia, was born, I decided to start blogging and my whole world grew as I began sharing my adventures not only on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/geojangie/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e as I had prior to her birth, but also on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.geocachingjangie.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeoJangie/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoJangie\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/GeoJangie/1vOxwNavpzEJB\"\u003ePeriscope\u003c/a\u003e. So many amazing cachers are out there, but we have so little fresh, quality content for us geocachers to enjoy (we could always have more, right?!)! That\u0027s where I come in - as a hardworking, dedicated cacher (started finding camouflaged Tupperware in 2012) and writer with the goal of providing the world with more unique geocaching-related articles and books.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created an account with Patreon as a means to fund my blog and writing projects, plus help provide awesome rewards for my followers, readers, and advocates. In no way am I going to stop doing what I enjoy, I am only giving those of you who absolutely love my work a chance to support me and receive a few extra special gifts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current goals are:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo continue providing high-quality, family-friendly blog posts each month\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Since beginning my blog, I\u0027ve published 2 to 4 posts a month. My blog does cost money, to keep the domain name and host. At times, materials need to be purchased for DIY posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo write and publish an adult fiction geocaching novel in 2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- I have published a children\u0027s book, \u003cem\u003eSophia Finds a Geocache\u003c/em\u003e, but I\u0027d also like the support to write an adult book. The past year, I\u0027ve been brainstorming and outlining. Now I have to sit down and start writing chapters. My whole life - ever since I could color - I\u0027ve dreamed of writing a book. This is my time. Geocaching is in my inspiration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
