I grew up in the town of Normal, Illinois. (Yes, that is a real place.) I\u0027ve lived and travelled all over the United States, but right now I\u0027m up in Albany, NY working for the New York State legislature. Before that, I lived in New York City for two years working at Oxfam--a global NGO dedicated to eradicating extreme poverty. Most of you probably found me by way of my first video about Donald Trump in which I predicted his ascent to the presidency. Against all odds (or so people said) that prediction proved to be true. Many of you have since asked me for tomorrow\u0027s lottery numbers. I\u0027m going to be greedy and keep those to myself. =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProud ginger. Left handed. Addicted to Spotify.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/d8lx7ingv/Channel_Des.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreat question. The channel is largely centered around American politics, with a strong psychological and philosophical twist, and with a bit of history thrown in there too. Essentially it\u0027s about whatever has captivated my interest in the moment (and often that means videos about Donald Trump). Right now videos tend to be more evergreen in nature, but in the future I plan to expand to more topical content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a more philosophical and idealistic note, the channel is about returning to the enlightenment ideals people held when this nation was founded. Every video I publish aims to respect both sides of the argument, and create a dialogue free from the ad hominem and straw man attacks we all see daily. A republic does not function if people cannot talk to each other, if we cannot discuss ideas and claw our way closer to the truth. My hope is that in however small a way, this channel helps to elevate political dialogue and reduce the rancor currently consuming America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/x1y106qjz/Why_Patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe YouTube channel is growing--quickly. Daily views have doubled over the past couple months to 750-1000 views per day. An extra 100+ subscribers are added every month. Because of that--and because I love making videos--I believe now is the time to dedicate more time and energy into the channel. Launching a Patreon is a step in that direction. No, I won\u0027t be able to quit my day job just yet. But every dollar goes a long way to purchasing new equipment, new software, and freeing up more time to invest into the channel. In short, it means more videos at a higher quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/bkmrsm1sv/How_Often.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHa! I wish I could answer that question. On average, I upload anywhere from 1-4 videos per month. Sometimes I go weeks without posting, but in the future I aim to get on some kind of schedule. If you\u0027re worried about pledging multiple times per month, you can always set a maximum pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s9.postimg.org/l1ckzo8xb/Anything_Else.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0When I first uploaded \"Why Donald Trump is Going to be Our Next President\" two years ago, I never once expected the video to go viral. And I certainly didn\u0027t expect to create two more viral vids in that same year amassing nearly two million views altogether. If you\u0027ve seen my older videos, you know how ecstatic I was to have 50 subscribers. Now the channel has 15,000 subscribers. That is insanity. And all along the way, you have been incredibly supportive. Normally people think of the YouTube comments section as a dark place to avoid at all costs, but hearing your feedback is part of what\u0027s kept me going. So, thank you. I am in your debt."
