I make\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/gamesasliterature\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGames as Lit. 101\u003c/a\u003e, a weekly web series that analyzes video games from a literary perspective. Based on a high school class of my own design, this series aims to educate my viewers not just on literary theory, but what makes interactive media a unique avenue for storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS GAMES AS LIT. 101?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a week, I release a video (usually around 10 minutes) discussing specific narrative concepts of video games. Once a month, I release a much longer literary analysis of a video game, going into depth about the narrative structure and themes of great works of interactive art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR GOALS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, Games as Lit. 101 is just one part of a greater endeavor,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gamesasliterature.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGames as Literature\u003c/a\u003e. In time, we want to create an actual curriculum, a real way for schools to teach kids how to appreciate and interpret video games. We want to spread it into other facets of the medium, like game design and studies about the interaction between video games and culture. In short, we want to improve the understanding and presence of video games in the academic space. And those endeavors start with this series, to garner a level of online presence while teaching viewers about how video games tell stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW YOU CAN HELP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting Games as Lit. 101, you\u0027re saying you like what you see, and you want more. I\u0027ll still be providing my series for free every week, but more support means more time and effort going into research and analysis of each episode, as well as more support for our future endeavors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

We\u0027ll discuss how to determine the game\u0027s playtime. Note that the episode will likely take a long while to make, especially if I\u0027ve not yet played the chosen game. I reserve the right to refuse the suggested game, and negotiate another. Replaces the \"Connoisseur\" tier and includes all others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach year you maintain this patron level, you can choose another analysis for me to do.",
