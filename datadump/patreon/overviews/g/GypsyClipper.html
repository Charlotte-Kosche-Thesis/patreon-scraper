    "summary": "My name is Vicki. I go by Gypsy Clipper on social media. Having lost my home in October 2015 through my own drug dependency and other misfortunes.\u003cbr\u003eI was forced to move into my minivan. I had originally thought my life was over. I left my home state and traveled the country looking for work and shelter. Instead of remaking my life in another state I discovered an amazing community of nomads. It changed my life for the better.\u003cbr\u003e I am no longer the person I had been. I am a totally changed person. Each day is a gift now because I no longer am chasing what I had thought was the American dream. I no longer think I need a 9 to 5 job to\u00a0 be happy. I no longer need the security of a paycheck. I have learned to live on so much less.\u00a0 I would like to share this message.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn\u00a0the\u00a0 past two years I was able to learn the building skills that earned me enough money to buy Lolita. She is\u00a0 a 24 passenger shuttle bus. I am using my skills and my savings to turn her into my tiny home and a mobile workshop. I earn enough money from my carpentry work and dog grooming to support myself and build my bus. But I would like to use the money from my supporters and my other online outlets to help others that have been forced to live in\u00a0 vehicles turn what seems like a daunting challenge into a comfortable life. This money will be used to help me help others."
