I am working towards my goals of not only improving my art to be the best it can be, but also to start a webcomic and begin my journey of vending at cons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eWHAT I DO\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI draw, a lot. I focus primarily on digital art but I also love to play with traditional mediums like watercolour. I also draw a ton of fanart, which you get say in as a patron! I plan on starting to vend at cons in 2019! I\u0027ve also started working on a webcomic\u00a0 I\u0027m calling Succubus Kiss, here you can get exclusive and early access to preliminary designs, concepts and more! Including early access to comic pages when they become available! In addition to all this I make youtube videos every week where I talk about art and do speedpaints!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eHOW YOU CAN HELP\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this patreon for a few reasons, the first and foremost is that I love to create. I love to tell stories and write interesting characters and I want to share that with everyone! But I need support to do that so I can be consistent, and bring you content that I hope you love as much as I enjoy creating it.\u003cbr\u003eThe second is, art is my full-time job, but not everyone who wants to support me can afford commissions or designs. This is why I am offering only three tiers. I want my art and what I do to be accessible, but I still need to support myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eWHAT YOU GET\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy finished works; illustrations, comic pages, ect will always be 100% free to anyone and everyone. Art is something to be shared and putting up a pay wall for someone to enjoy it doesn\u0027t feel right to me.\u00a0The only exception is NSFW drawings, these will be patron-exclusive for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever by pledging you can get access to monthly request streams(discontinued as I work on Succubus Kiss), patron exclusive polls every week to determine which character I draw, discounts on things like commissions and character designs (adoptables), Full-Res images, WIPs and sketches, and more as it becomes available!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, I do what I do because I love it, and if you support me (even if it\u0027s just by following me on social media) I love you too! Even if you can\u0027t pledge just being with me and supporting me means so much. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you. You are appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always keep my current earnings visible, I believe that transparency is important and I want to be an open book for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(229, 224, 236);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(204, 193, 217);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE TO FIND ME\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/GenGaspard\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PsiEidothea\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e (most active)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gen_gaspard/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLfENg00ZqbPvLB7BZfAdtQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
