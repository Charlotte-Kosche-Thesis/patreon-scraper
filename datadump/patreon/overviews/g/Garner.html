During the summer of 2015, inspired by Mr Bean and the Mythbusters, I started making paintings using explosives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the process is still very much one of experimentation, I\u0027ve found that stemless wine glasses and blackcat bottle rockets are the best combination to capture the wonder of chaos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn experimenting with different materials and surfaces I\u0027ve also developed a few other ways to create art that can be fun to look at and try to \u0027see\u0027 things that aren\u0027t there. \u00a0\u0027Paraedolia\u0027 is the technical term for this - if you\u0027ve ever seen Jesus on a piece of toast or a drunk octopus that wants to fight on a wall-mounted coat hanger, you\u0027ve experienced this phenomenon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost commonly, you will see a face. \u00a0Evolutionarily this makes sense, as it\u0027s safer to see a face that isn\u0027t there than to miss a face that IS there. \u00a0This doesn\u0027t mean other things won\u0027t be \u0027seen\u0027 in the chaotic scenes - if you\u0027ve ever seen ANYTHING in the clouds, you know what I mean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I have returned to making space paintings, though they are far more time consuming. I do use many of the same techniques employed by popular street-speed-space-painters on youtube, my process is far more deliberate - allowing for sometimes dozens of very thins coats of paint to reduce any dripping, resulting in an almost photographic quality painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSafety is an absolute priority and I have created temporary blasting chambers, extra fuse, eye \u0026amp; ear protection as well as a breathing filter to deal with a small amount of smoke created in the process and a mask for all of my spray painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*ALL PIECES ARE FOR SALE TO PLEDGES AND NON PLEDGES.
