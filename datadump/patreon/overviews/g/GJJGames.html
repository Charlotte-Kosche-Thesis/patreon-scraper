I loved Civilization (the Avalon Hill version) back in highschool and college, and played tons of card games, board games, and more for most of my formative years. I didn\u0027t play games much after I got married and had kids, until 2014. Now my boys are old enough to play most games and I\u0027ve found that tabletop games are a huge hit in my household. Our collection keeps growing and we keep playing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last few years, I\u0027ve been getting more and more engrossed in the gaming community and started GJJ Games to both showcase \u003ca href=\"http://gjjgames.blogspot.com/p/gjjg-designs.html\"\u003emy own game designs\u003c/a\u003e and review others\u0027 games.
