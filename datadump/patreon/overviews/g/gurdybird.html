    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is GurdyBird, I am a composer, arranger and remix artist in the folktronica genre. You may well have come across my work on Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube or Bandcamp, or in a non-virtual setting such as a UK based steampunk, cabaret or pirate event! I create music that has elements of fun and anarchy, with a twist of gallows humour, and very much with my hurdy-gurdy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I currently do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI really enjoy celebrating characters, costumes and unusual customs, and this is why I like to involve a lot of my friends in my (and Paul Betowski\u0027s) videos, so, one of the big projects would involve providing a brief to my friends, who send me clips of them performing, which I edit, illustrate by hand, scan, work on and edit them into the plot. I also like to perform with these videos on stage at the events I play at, whilst I play the gurdy parts live. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"height: 360px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xV0zqRmh1yo?ecver=2\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have received many comments praising the concepts, the fun and inclusiveness of my videos, and messages of enjoyment at the task from those who submitted footage, some of whom found the process very cathartic during hard times and are enthusiastic at being part of these projects. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot all of the videos feature such an intense working process, we have made a few which still have a number of costumed characters, and have 6 more in planning stages. All of those featured in the videos have donated their time and efforts for free, and we have come a long way since \"Defiant \u0027til Tyburn\", in terms of what effects we can accomplish, and the bond viewers feel with the characters. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"height: 360px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGMpdqFSc78?ecver=2\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your patronage will go towards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI live in Cornwall, which is beautiful, very rich in culture and history, it inspires an enormous of my work, but when winter comes it does get rather quiet on the monetary income front, and I currently make these videos that stream for free with extremely low budgets. In fact, we don\u0027t have any budget at all, but what we do have in vast quantity is a lot of creativity, enthusiasm, and I am fortunate to have a lot of friends who have or can make their own interpretations to express themselves, as well as a keen work ethic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your help, I would love to spend more time making these artistic videos, either pay or reward those I collaborate with, finish the projects I have started planning, obtain the equipment I need to film, and also play the films in venues that don\u0027t have their own projector and screen so I can take this artwork on the road more often. I would be able to learn from Paul about post-production processing and take a lot of the workload off of him as well. Whilst the output may be more frequent, the style will stay, which means whatever format my collaborators on the videos are able to submit in to be included, that is what I use, (although I do request that it be on the best resolution the device can get). I have also co-produced and co-directed a successful multimedia cabaret event here in Penzance, and would very much like to produce and direct another. Should this happen, tickets would also be added to one of the tiers. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"height: 360px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dAQG484Jdfk?ecver=2\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you can expect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I have many projects on the boil at any one time, I have set my account to \n\u003cem\u003emonthly\u003c/em\u003e subscriptions. In return for your generous patronage, As well as hopefully more frequent visual and audio output from myself, I can offer you rewards from downloadable artwork and access to my activity feed where I think we are able to contact each other in comments, you will also get behind-the-scenes and exclusive photos and videos, process footage, up to rewards such as your name on the credits of future GurdyBird videos, signed photographs, downloads and physical CDs and DVDs and original prints depending on which tier you choose. There will also be added items that relate to what I am working on and when I work out how to add them, discounts to merchandise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOther points of interest\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile the videos and music is a constant activity I am working on, I am also a trained illustrator and hand print a lot of artwork, relating to some of the subjects in my videos, for example, Montol, just one of the festivals I volunteer my time and skills to as part of The Cornish Culture Association. I also have digital prints created of some of my artworks and badges also, and have written some stories which I\u0027m hoping to publish as booklets like the chapbooks of the 18th century. Some of the output on the Activity Feed maybe related to these or artwork commissioned by the Cornish Culture Association. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for reading, exploring and hopefully, supporting my work! If you have any questions about anything I might have missed, please do feel free to message me. I am extremely excited to have this opportunity! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheck out my reward packages on the right hand side!\n\u003cbr\u003e"

We\u0027ve come a long way since the music video for \"Defiant \u0027til Tyburn\" in terms of what we can accomplish visually, and we have pretty much doubled the cast number as interest in partaking grew! The third part in the lovingly nicknamed \"NotPoldark Trilogy\" is \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 finished, after 2 years of being pretty much handcrafted. Unfortunately, bereavements and the making process had meant it was put on hold for a bit, and obviously with more participants resulted in more hand-sketched artworks via heavy use of a light box which I could only use in short stints. \u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYPMCnMT5mQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
