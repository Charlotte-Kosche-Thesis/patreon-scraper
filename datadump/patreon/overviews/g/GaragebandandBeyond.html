It was the very first Youtube channel to ever do a \"No EQ NO compression\" microphone demo, so you could actually hear the mic the way you\u0027ve always wanted to.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve done interviews with famous engineers and artists, reviewed guitars, microphones and taught millions of people how to record high quality music at home on Garageband.\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m asking for your support to help continue this project that I started so many years ago. The more you guys help, the more I can make video\u0027s for you. I\u0027ve made it this far basically doing it for free, if you really work the numbers out honestly and that\u0027s tough to maintain after more than half a decade. So please, if you enjoy what I do and you feel like you\u0027d like to help me with this project, become a patron!"
