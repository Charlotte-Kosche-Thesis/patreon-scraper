    "summary": "Hello and Welcome,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Gilly Bean and this is my Patreon page. It\u0027s fantastic to have you here.\u003cbr\u003eLet me share with you why music is such a huge part of my life. Here\u0027s my story:\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing piano since I was 5 years old. As a baby I used to cry a lot; my parents discovered that playing classical music to me would sooth me and make me smile. When I was 4 years old, my Grandfather passed away leaving money in his will for my family to buy a piano. When a beautifully reconditioned Chappell baby grand piano arrived in our home, it was like a beacon for me. My love affair with music began right there and then; I started picking up songs and playing them back after hearing them on the radio, and have never stopped adding to my repertoire to this day. I\u2019m forever grateful for the gift that my Grandpa Cedric left for me and my family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year has seen a monumental shift in the way I feel about how I choose to express myself when I play music. Music truly is the language of the soul. Live streaming, particularly on the platform of Periscope, has allowed me to connect with people all over the world for the past couple of years. Many delightful followers tune in regularly for my Periscope broadcasts, including\u00a0shows like the weekly Mellow Sunday Song Request Scope. I have met many of them in person and I am supported in ways I could never have imagined. The constant flow of kindness is so amazing and I appreciate every single follower so much. Choosing to share my skills in this way has made my life richer than it ever was before. I love being in service through music, connecting, celebrating and comforting people across the globe. It\u0027s also meant that I regained autonomy in my life; I have lost count of the number of sunsets I\u0027ve missed because I have been playing in a bar somewhere and worked until the small hours of the morning for so many years now. With Periscope, I\u0027ve gained more freedom to fully enjoy my life again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write my own material and produce my own music. I am excited about sharing the songs that I have been inspired to create with you; songs that will strike a chord in your heart, lyrically and musically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to fulfil my dreams of playing concerts on beautiful pianos all over the world and bringing musical joy to as many people as possible, healing hearts and minds through all that I can share in music with you. I play at Glastonbury and Wilderness Festival each year, creating lively sing-alongs that everyone enjoys. Being more involved on the festival circuit is another ambition I\u0027m ready to see being fulfilled on a larger scale in 2018 and beyond. I see myself purchasing a big truck with a piano inside so that I can travel all over the world, playing at festivals, and creating meditation events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love music so much. It\u0027s impossible for me to play without the music coming from my heart to yours. It\u0027s like breathing to me. Music creates so much joy and connection between people, It\u0027s a really wonderful thing to be able to bring happiness, peace and clarity to others when I\u0027m playing.\u003cbr\u003eI have been incredibly fortunate to be able to sustain a professional career as a musician for 35 years now. By creating this Patreon page, I am asking for your support to help fulfil my musical dreams and allow my soul to create musically as freely as possible. Thank you for reading my words here, and I\u0027m delighted that you are considering backing me as a Patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLove and Blessings\u003cbr\u003eGillyBean xxx\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
