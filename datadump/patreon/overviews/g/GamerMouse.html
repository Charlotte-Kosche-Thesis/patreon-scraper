    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo, who in the world are you? What\nis this Gamer Mouse?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tJust\na humble game reviewer. I am Tanara Kuranov, your friendly\nneighborhood Gamer Mouse, running the eponymous show, \n\u003cem\u003eGamer\nMouse\u003c/em\u003e,\nover on YouTube since late 2012. I make reviews of obscure little\npieces of gaming, mostly Macintosh games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tYes,\nMacintosh games. It\u0027s a broad subject that has little coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tSince\nstarting the show, it\u0027s gone farther than I thought. I never imagined I\u0027d have a hundred people waiting to see what\u0027s next, much less three\nhundred. I\u0027ve discovered that I absolutely love delving into every\nlittle detail of a game, dissecting what makes it good and what makes\nit bad. I don\u0027t do this for a living, but I would really love it if\nthat were the case.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tIf\nit were, I could share more games, more often, with more people. I\ncould stream as well as record. We could have a grand old time,\nhaving fun with the all too forgotten games of the past.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAren\u0027t\nyou one of those weird furry people?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tYou\u0027ll\nfind that me being a furry won\u0027t affect you very much.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tAs\nfor me being weird, yes. I\u0027m a furry who grew up on Macintosh games\nand was ping-ponged between console manufacturers as I grew up. I\nhave a strange perspective on gaming, and sometimes life in general.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nis it you play, anyways?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tUm...everything?\nSeriously, I don\u0027t really exclude based off of genre or platform.\nThere are some genres I like more than others, but I can find myself\npleasantly surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tThough,\nof course, the Macintosh is my platform of choice, and the more\nobscure or unappreciated the title, the better.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tIf\nyou want an example, I reviewed a Swedish game about getting drunk\nduring Lundakarnevalen:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dT95Sczw1fc\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tOr,\nif you want a more recent example, here\u0027s a Star Trek adventure game\nthat is all kinds of messed up, and I was the one to archive on the\ninternet:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOe60wgFQis\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay,\nsweet. How does this Patreon work?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tWell,\nit works differently for different people. The basics are that you\npledge a certain amount per creation or per month, and, in return for\nsupporting the creator, the Patrons get certain perks.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tIn\nthis case, my content will remain open and free for anyone to see,\nand this is simply a way to support Gamer Mouse. A \u201ctip\u201d for\ncontent, if you will.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tCurrently,\nthis Patreon is \n\u003cem\u003eper\nreview\u003c/em\u003e,\nmeaning the charge is applied every time a new review is created.\nDon\u0027t panic, you can set a monthly limit, in case I\u0027m quick to the\ndraw on a series of reviews. If the show goes full-time, I\u0027ll switch\nthe format to \n\u003cem\u003eper\nmonth\u003c/em\u003e,\nand be able to output content much more quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tNo\nother content, such as Let\u0027s Plays, unboxings, etc, are charged for.\nAll of that is merely incidental side content that comes from the\nreviews!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tIn\nreturn for supporting the show, Patrons get early access to videos,\nthe ability to see what\u0027s coming up, including progress reports and\nbehind-the-scenes shots, the ability to vote on what I do next\noccasionally, and personalized floppy disks or postcards, along with\nanything else I may think of as the show grows.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCool,\ncool. What are you doing with this money, then?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tMy\nmain goal is to be able to pay basic living expenses with the support\nand take the show full time. Making reviews costs money, too.\nTracking down games, getting props, maintaining and purchasing\nequipment like cameras, microphones, or computers. Basically, the\nmore that gets pledged, the more goes into the show.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tIf\nsupport grows, the show can be updated more often, and more expensive\ngames can be tracked down and reviewed. I\u0027m also quite the archivist,\nand make sure that all the games I find are copied and stored for\npreservation. This is part of the mission statement of Gamer Mouse,\nnot only sharing my thoughts on these games with people, but making\nsure these games aren\u0027t lost to the ages. I also hope to be able to\ntravel to conventions, to meet the people that make all of this\npossible.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tThank\nyou for your support, whether or not you decide to donate. I\nappreciate every one of the people who follow me and my content, and\nI realize that none of this would be possible without my fans and\nviewers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tYour\nFriendly Neighborhood Gamer Mouse,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTanara\nKuranov\n\u003cbr\u003e"
