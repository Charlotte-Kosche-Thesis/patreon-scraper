    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Em\u00edl, but online I go by the name \"GreyFawkes\" I am a up and coming Youtuber that wants to entertain the masses for a living :) The medium I have chosen to do this through is gaming, which is something very dear to my heart and that has shaped the person I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I have set up this patreon is twofold. Firstly I want to be able to help my girlfriend, who has given me 1 year to try following my dream, where she will work full time so that I can focus on Youtube 100%. Secondly I want to upgrade my hardware in order to fully realize the vision I have for the channel, I.e. A vlogging camera, tripod and various upgrades for my aging computer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started my channel Greyfawkes Gaming the idea was to focus mainly on League of legends, which I have done for the most part, but there are so many great games out there that I also want to dedicate some time to share with you, my viewers. So the channel will not be limited to that game alone going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to produce at least 3 vidoes a week for my fantastic community and expand the reach of my channel so that I can help youtube grow as a viable career path in my home country of Norway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s about it hehe, I hope you find me worthy of your support. Peace and love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
