    "summary": "First of all, a huge thanks with Bengali sweet yogurt to everyone worldwide for your donations, well-wishes and support! You\u2019ve helped to nurture hundreds of children. It\u2019s thanks to you that we\u2019re ready to expand our offering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for those of you who don\u2019t know about us, in the last nine years, Golden Avatar Foundation has provided free education for kids who need it the most, enriching their lives academically, culturally, and spiritually. We\u2019re a school in the holy town of Nabadwip Dham, India, run by a team of locals and internationals, joined by a desire to nourish those in need.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany pilgrims come through Nabadwip to offer respects at the temples, and hear spiritual discourses. Most aren\u2019t aware of just how hard life can get in the ghettos by the railway tracks. Some children \u2014 as young as eight years old \u2014 have resorted to selling drugs, hard labour and worse, to earn as little as ten Indian rupees a day (around 20 US cents). It\u2019s them whom we\u2019re trying to help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGolden Avatar Foundation currently instructs children from ages 10-16, but we\u2019ve found that the sooner we can show kids alternatives to life in the slums, the better their chances are of rising to meet those opportunities. Even at 10 years of age, their mindsets \u2014 and thus their futures \u2014 are often fixed. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created a new class for younger kids, 6-9 years old. In addition to this, we\u2019re eager to start new classes in creative arts for all the children: painting, sewing, singing, acting and dancing; all based on Bengali traditions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we need your help! All of this unfortunately requires funds, to pay the teachers and buy supplies. An amount of 500 USD per month is required to continue teaching the new batch of youngest kids; 700 USD will accomplish this, and also expand additional creative cultural classes for all 65 children now with Golden Avatar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever you give will go a tremendously long way. Patreon is all about recurring donations, so please pick something that you\u2019re comfortable parting with each month. Plus you\u2019ll get a gift of artwork made by the kids!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Avatar team\u003c/p\u003e"
