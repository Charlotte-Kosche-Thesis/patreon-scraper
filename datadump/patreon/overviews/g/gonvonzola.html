My name is Gon von Zola and I am a singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and videographer from Highgate Village in London. I was born in Leipzig near Berlin and my family is Swedish, German, Estonian, Indian :)\u003cbr\u003eI also have a fondness for old pirate movies and monkeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write at least two songs or lyrics a week. They are mainly diary snapshots about my out-of-the-box life in London, bats, the way I see the world, movies, people who I love, who inspire or annoy me, little things and human nature in general.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have won several awards over the years and I got signed to a publisher quite recently. I run my own DIY label and have released five albums under the name The Budda Cakes. I do most of the work on my own - from writing to recording and producing to making music videos and performing live gigs with a band or solo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a musician with all my heart and I have been writing songs and playing in bands since the age of 12. No idea why I love it so much and can\u0027t live without it - is it because my grampa and my granny\u0027s dad and his dad were musicians?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE KEY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is a personal artistic treasure vault that I am giving you a special key to.

I am interested in your opinions on some of my new songs, lyrics, artwork or videos, and I hope you don\u0027t mind me asking you for your input from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a secretive vault that will be filled with freshly recorded demos of new songs from my phone which I would normally keep for myself. I will show you lyrics in progress. You can take part in my creative process if you want. You can follow my journey as a musician - from the inside.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere will be brand-new things in the box every month, sometimes every week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut be warned!
