My wife and I were discussing what I wanted to do now with the kids grown, and my position with Bank of America was cut in a reorg. I had spent eighteen years at the company, twenty-seven years in my field as a computer/software engineer. We talked about how our friends loved our travel stories. I had this crazy idea of taking those stories and morphing them into fiction. We talked some more, and she convinced me I was not crazy. After some soul-searching, I decided it was time.
