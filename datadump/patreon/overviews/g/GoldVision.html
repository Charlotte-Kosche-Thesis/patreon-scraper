This so-called editor pursued a career in film and video and television and internet and found more value in his work when he applied it directly to his passion for video games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately the culture behind television distribution holds games in taboo, film only recently embracing retro-games. Efforts to improve the cultural value of games is an endeavor, and the ad revenue from the YouTube channel is not yet enough to support the creative works behind it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoldVision is for\u00a0Big Ideas. Strategies. The ideas, motifs and motives of GoldVision videos are coming through in the way the channel is progressing. The channel has goals to improve gaming culture and video culture through comedy and a somewhat informed perspective. If you want to help this channel grow in the time of need, this is the place to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you hate GoldVision\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ethink he should die\u003c/strong\u003e, why not become a patron anyway! For as little as one dollar you can help support what- so far- has been an exhausting and mentally confusing endeavor- furthering GoldVision\u0027s descent into the mind-numbing competitive media landscape which is either systematically destroying values in our society or at least sufficiently distracting everyone until the robots take over all the jobs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds accrued from this Patreon will most certainly be used towards the future of GoldVision, as well as to purchase games and the necessities that surround them as some sort of victorious cycle that can only perpetuate with contributions of viewers like you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
