    "summary": "Hey guys, GSmaniamsmat here, and some of you may know me from YouTube where I create gaming content, tutorials, advice videos, music covers, and do random vlogs. Thank you for even considering to look at this page, as my channels are still rather small, and just having people even consider being a patreon already means a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been on YouTube for about six years now, but not until about a year and a half ago did I really even consider to take it serious, and as a job. I\u0027ve grown to love making videos for the community, whether it be to make you smile, laugh, help you out, or just have some fun. Seeing your comments, connecting with you all, and being able to make your day by expressing myself is why I chose to do YouTube. It may sound really cliche, and something you probably see on every other YouTuber\u0027s Patreon, but I am serious, it\u0027s because of you that we all love doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve branched out quite a bit, starting only from making podcasts for a little forum I was in on Gamespot, The Final Fantasy Fans Union, and making the occasional tutorial for graphic design or video editing. But as I learned more, and got more invested into YouTube I wanted to do music covers, and give people advice, and not until quite recently even make some gaming videos which I thought would never really be successful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, as much as I love doing this, sometimes the YouTube Ad Revenue really doesn\u0027t go that far. Some months you\u0027ll get below your average earnings, and some months you\u0027ll make way more. Several of my friends have suggested Patreon, and I was always skeptical to use it; fearing that my content was never really good enough to even ask for pledges. But recently, I\u0027ve been encouraged, have been making a lot of videos, and with my recent job shutting down and having to let their employees go, I\u0027ve tried to get serious about this and really see where it takes me. This opportunity will allow me to connect and talk with you all more efficiently, show my appreciation and reward those who really want to go the extra mile and pledge, and allow me to make a bit more revenue apart from the YouTube ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are, my Patreon page. If you happen to be one of those awesome supporters of one of my channels on YouTube and made it this far by reading down this post, then you\u0027ll be glad to know that if you pledge to me you\u0027ll also get some rewards! I am still rather new to this whole platform, so I will be adding new rewards when I see fit and think of more. It\u0027s also kind of hard to generalize rewards across all my channels since they are all different, but nonetheless, you\u0027ll see them on the right side of this page. You\u0027ll also see my goals, which will show you where your pledges are going to and how they will help me. I also have some other goals in mind, but don\u0027t want to get ahead of myself yet, so I think these will do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also just want to say before I end this post, you don\u0027t have to pledge. It already means a lot that you\u0027ve read this far, and that you\u0027ve been watching my videos. Ads on YouTube still play me, so as long as you watch my videos (hopefully without AdBlock), or click the ads you\u0027ll still be supporting me! But if you want to really make a difference for me, show your support, and jump on board with me on this journey then go ahead and pledge and I\u0027ll more than appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, this is GSmaniamsmart and I\u0027ll be back sooner than you think, don\u0027t go anywhere! ;)"
