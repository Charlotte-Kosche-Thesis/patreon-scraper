    "summary": "A few years ago I pledged to do 1000 paintings in one year. It was an ambitious undertaking, perhaps a little too ambitious but then you never know until you try do you? Anyways I only did 530 paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year I\u0027m making a different pledge, one that is both less ambitious and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to paint 100 paintings in the next 12 months from August to August.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLess ambitious because it is a much smaller number, but more ambitious because I counted my signs last time and that meant several hundred paintings were pretty much a given since that was my day job. \u003cbr\u003eAlso they were almost all acrylic paintings last time.\u003cbr\u003eThis time most of them will be oil paint which is a little harder and takes longer.\u003cbr\u003e And my style is more realistic than before which also takes longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will include re-paints and finishing previously unfinished work as a new painting since I have a few of those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNone of these paintings have any certainty of selling. Commercial art is done on a commission basis and is in theory a guaranteed sale, but I don\u0027t have or want commissions right now. Instead right now I\u0027m interested in experimentation with new materials, styles, colors, textures and subjects. There will be fantasy art, octopuses, nude figures, portraits, costumes, still lifes, landscapes, and wildlife art.\u003cbr\u003eMy mind is bursting with a bunch of crazy ideas that I want to try, but have no idea if they will work or if anyone will like them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to offer all of this work at a very low price. Most of them will be $50.00. There are several reasons for this, but the chief reason is that I\u0027m hoping to be able to afford to do so because I will be sufficiently pre-funded by way of Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website where you can pledge to support an artist or project that you like on a monthly basis. You can, and I encourage you to, pledge as little as a dollar a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike Kickstarter there is no time limit on Patreon. nor is there necessarily a product to offer at the end. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe reward that I want to offer is to sell my art at a very affordable price in the faith that I will eventually get enough ongoing support to make it feasible to keep doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning this will mean that I am all but giving my work away for free, but I\u0027m offering my trust that it will come back to me in time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you decide, you have been supportive and encouraging to me and my work for years and you have my thanks now and always.\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon because my fans asked me to. \u00a0I have a wonderful group of people who follow my work regularly on Facebook and they wanted a way to help me keep doing what I do.\u00a0Patreon is a wonderfully simple and easy method of doing just that.\u003cbr\u003eWatch me paint, hear some stories, check out some pictures, ask questions, anything you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
