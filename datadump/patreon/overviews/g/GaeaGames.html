The companies I\u0027ve worked for include Onyx Path Publishing, Privateer Press, New Dark Age, and many others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written stories since I was old enough to put pencil to paper and form coherent sentences. I love creating, and the creative process, and giving life to characters, ideas, whole worlds. The open page is an infinite number of possibilities ready to explode into a universe of creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been a gamer since I was 7 years old, and nothing quite scratches the same itch that roleplaying does. I want to keep on creating all kinds of games, especially to fill niches not otherwise covered. If you pledge to me, you\u0027ll help me to keep working with you to create the best games and stories we can imagine together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal right now is go produce at least one short story and/or supplementary game article per month. For example, with \u003cstrong\u003eCity of the Dead\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027d like to release one detailed Location or set of characters, or maybe some new zombie stats (complete with an additional new Aspect or two!) per month. I might also release a short story detailing characters struggling to survive in The City to go with it, or commission a new art piece. A constant stream of new content sounds good to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
