It has an awesome community called the Gummy Fam. The reasoning behind this is Dennis (Owner of the channel and main host) wants people to feel more like a family in the community. Viewers/Fans are not really what this channel is about. There are lots of interactive things from multiplayer games, a Gummies system for a fake currency that can be used, and even taking ideas from the community.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/iepcbb.png\" style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eMy name is Dennis and I am the Admin for Gummytainment. Ever since I was a kid I loved to entertain people and make them laugh with my humor. Making videos and being on camera was always something I did and enjoyed. I have creativity and a very outgoing personality so this kind of stuff brings me great eternal joy. I\u0027m currently 30 years old and really want to do this more than I am right now. I have some cool ideas for the future and Patreon can help a lot with those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/142eudc.png\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eI believe in honesty and always being open with stuff even money. So the money will allow me to work towards my ultimate goal to be able to do creative and entertaining things as a full-time job. My current long-term goal is $800 a month to be able to quick my current job and focus on Gummytainment and making it as amazing and awesome as possible. That money will go to my bills which some of them are only so high because I need certain things to do the channel. My internet speed is fast and\u00a0I have business class internet for much quicker support if issues occur for example. Of course if we make it past that $800 the channel will improve more and way in the future it would be nice to pay people to help out with stuff too. And as for that my plan is to look to the community first. I would love to hire people I already know and love in\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e the Gummy Fam.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
