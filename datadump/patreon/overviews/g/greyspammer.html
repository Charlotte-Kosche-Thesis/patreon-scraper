    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWho am I?\u003c/h1\u003e\nI am the creator of the \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.loverslab.com/topic/37602-trapped-in-rubber-updated-2015-08-02/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTrapped in Rubber\u003c/a\u003e mod, which is a rubber fetish mod for Skyrim. It was created by me in 2014, using a lot of assets from the Skyrim modding community. It focuses on rubber enclosure and BDSM and actually comes with a story (quest mod).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis project is \n\u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e a pipe dream, no pie in the sky. It already exists and a available for download at \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.loverslab.com/topic/37602-trapped-in-rubber-updated-2015-08-02/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLoverslab\u003c/a\u003e. It is free for everyone, and it always will be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat you pay for\u003c/h1\u003e\nBy supporting me on Patreon, you are rewarding me for my work on this project. Right now, I\u0027m not looking to quit my day job. I\u0027ll keep working on the mod in my free time, as a hobby project.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon is basically a tip jar. Something that\u0027ll help to keep me motivated. If I get enough money, I might even commission things for the mod which I cannot do myself. For example, I\u0027m terrible at 3D art work. So I may try to hire someone to create new models or animations for the mod.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI suppose if you\u0027re a backer, I would also be more inclined to take requests from you for the mod. But I\u0027ll be honest with you: My vision for the mod will always trump any monetary contribution made by others.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPayment is monthly. Paying per update could constitute a violation of the Creation Kit license. I have to keep the mod and the Patreon as detached from each other as possible. You do not pay for the mod, or for access to the mod, or for a new version of the mod. You pay me. And I happen to work on the mod. It\u0027s the only legal way to do it, as far as I can see.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eRisks and Work\u003c/h1\u003e\nThe mod is already out, so you do not risk it never seeing the light of day. Worst case scenario: I wrap myself around a tree with my car one day. Then you\u0027ll never see the next version of the mod.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy work style so far has been to avoid micro-updates and instead work on rather large extensions for long periods of time. After those are released, there\u0027s a period of bugfix releases where I put out new versions in rapid succession. Usually, those do not have any new features and instead fix problems with the latest expansion. Once I\u0027m satisfied that most of the bugs have been eliminated, I go to work on a new extension again.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo it\u0027s perfectly normal if you do not see a new version every two weeks. It can take a while until a new release is ready. So if you do not see a new release for months, that doesn\u0027t mean I have stopped working on the mod. If you want to make sure I\u0027m still alive, you can drop me a post in the discussion thread over at Loverslab.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eStatus of the mod\u003c/h1\u003e\nAs I wrote earlier, the mod is already released. But I do not consider it finished. The main story is complete, so you can play a full quest line with about 8 hours of gameplay and over 4400 lines of dialogue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNext on the agenda is an extension of the story (like an add-on) and adding new features. Keep following the \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.loverslab.com/topic/37602-trapped-in-rubber-updated-2015-08-02/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ediscussion thread\u003c/a\u003e over at Loverslab for most recent developments.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the caveat that I may have to revise or remove some of these features later on because problems appear during testing, these are the things that I have already implemented in the current development stage or am reasonably certain I can deliver upon. They will become available to everyone once the new version is ready for release.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe new version will be remade from scratch to account for everything I learned until now. This will - hopefully - make it much more robust and less prone to errors and interference from other mods.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA completely reworked rubber framework. Previously, the rubber suit was a piece of armor and thus, could conflict with other armor. The new system internally treats the rubber suit as a skin, not clothing. That means you should be able to wear any piece of armor of clothing on top of the suit. This doesn\u0027t mean that it will look good, however. Just that it will be possible. Some things will probably look fine. Others, not so much.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe new rubber framework also allows gasmask breathing sounds and rubber squeaking sound. Both can be disabled, if they annoy you. But if you would like your rubber experience to be as complete as possible, you\u0027ll now have some auditory support as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWhile I plan on keeping the original story line, the quests will be more elaborate and fleshed out. This is an ongoing process. At the time of this writing, I had not yet recreated every quest that was part of the original mod. Those I have already finished, however, will be much more detailed. For example, I tried to integrate more rubber outfits for the various quests.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThere\u0027s another new feature which I would like to keep secret for now. I want it to be a surprise. But I think it\u0027s going to be cool.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA whole new set of quests for the additional story (as mentioned above). This is also a work in progress and not yet complete.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFuta support. The new framework detects if your female character has a supported penis from the SOS framework and then replaces it with a rubberized version of that penis while you are wearing a rubber suit. There may also be occasional reactions by other NPCs to the fact that your character is a futa.\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind that this is completely optional! If you\u0027re not into girls with dicks and you do not configure SOS to add a penis to your female character, TIR will never throw any futa content in your face either (if it does, it\u0027ll be a bug, and I\u0027ll fix it). So don\u0027t worry. My mod will simply react to what you already have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhen will the next version be released?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nThis is tough to say. Even professional developers usually just answer this question with: \"When it\u0027s done\". And I\u0027m working on this in my free time. Of which I don\u0027t always have as much as I\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s safe to say that the release isn\u0027t going to happen any time soon. I know I\u0027m probably hurting my chances of getting your money here, but I\u0027ve got to be frank with you: If you choose to pledge to this mod, consider yourself in for the long haul. It may be some time before you see the new version released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eGoals and Rewards\u003c/h1\u003e\nDue to the nature of the project, I don\u0027t have any specific goals. I\u0027ll just keep working on expanding and enhancing the mod. I also cannot really offer you any rewards, other than the fact you that you support the growth of a mod that - hopefully - you\u0027re interested in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd because the license explicitly forbids commercial exploitation, I can\u0027t give you beta access or stuff like that. It would basically be you paying me for (early) access to the mod and that\u0027s not allowed. All I can offer you is the warm, fuzzy feeling that you support the creator of this little rubber fetish mod.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
