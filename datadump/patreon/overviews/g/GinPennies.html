Which is turning out to be harder than I thought...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, you probably know me as ShamelessLiar. So you probably already know that I write novel-length fanfiction for Avatar: the Last Airbender, and my past works include \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6240707/1/His-Majesty-Prefers-Blue\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHis Majesty Prefers Blue\u003c/a\u003e\" and \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10372441/1/Call-Me-Katto\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCall Me Katto\u003c/a\u003e.\" Currently, I\u0027m working on the CMK sequel, \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11161442/1/The-King-s-Pet-or-The-King\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe King\u0027s Pet or The King\u003c/a\u003e\" and a couple of other fan projects. I also do sketches that go along with my stories, which you can find on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shamelessliarkickapow.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on an original fantasy novel featuring my OCs Koa and Hato, who appeared in \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6390871/1/Simple-Misunderstanding\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSimple Misunderstanding\u003c/a\u003e.\" With their people on the brink of war, they must save an unpleasant prince and come to terms with strange powers in order to prevent the demise of their people\u0027s way of life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eErm, hem, I also sometimes write poems. And went to grad school for poetry-writing. I\u0027m actually pretty good at it, you know, when the conditions are right.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAll of my fan-content is available for free and it always will be.\u00a0I didn\u0027t join Patreon to collect ransom for withheld chapters. I just wanted to give people the option to contribute to the creation of a story they\u0027ll enjoy. In return for donating, Patrons will receive chapter updates a few days before they\u0027re posted online, and will also have access to polls, weird poems, original fiction, and doodle request days. Oh boy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, patrons will have my undying gratitude for encouraging me to keep trying to be a \u0027real\u0027 writer. Eventually, I\u0027d like to get an original book published. By donating, you\u0027re telling me that you believe my writing is actually worth money, that it\u0027s something I can devote months to and believe that a publisher will one day pay me for it.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut, srsly, money for fanfiction?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe best thing about fanfiction is that it amuses people, it allows them to escape from their own stresses for a while - and providing that remains the most rewarding part of writing for me. If I could subsist on that, I would. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, I\u0027m a human being who pays rent and buys cat food. I work hard to write these stories and maintain a high level of quality in my fanfiction, and then I make the product available for free. I\u0027d really like to believe that that time and energy is worth something, and while positive feedback and appreciation are, no joke, more valuable to me, the real world continues to run on money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re reading one of my stories and you think \"Wow, this is really entertaining and it makes me feel good to read it\" and you happen to have a job that pays in real money (rather than love) maybe think about donating. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
