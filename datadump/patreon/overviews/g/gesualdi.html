I want to keep making videos which are a bit more planned out than \"lol look at this movie trailer\" and your patronage helps me buy props, camera equipment, software licenses, tickets to conventions, and so much more. You guys honestly make it possible for me to keep making these videos and keep a roof over my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me you get access to some cool perks: including giving sneak peeks, deleted scenes, and extended uncensored cuts of my videos. You also get a cool discord title and once we have enough patrons to make it work, we\u0027ll be doing some exclusive streams and that sort of thing. I want to show my appreciation any way I can, and if you ever have an idea for some patron-exclusive content you\u0027d like to see, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyhow, love you guys. Thanks for keeping the dream going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Vito\u003cbr\u003e"
