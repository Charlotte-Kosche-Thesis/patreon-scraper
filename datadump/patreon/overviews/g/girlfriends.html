If you enjoy Girlfriends and want to help encourage me in this production, please consider making a pledge of support.

Please consider taking this important step to support Girlfriends, so I can continue to be a source of support and encouragement for women today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGirlfriends connects with women about the things that really matter: faith and family, work and relationships. As a writer, speaker, wife and mom, I aim to be a voice of encouragement, humor, and practical support for women in all walks of life. Each week, I interview a new guest and take on topics that include health, fitness, time management, work, homemaking, motherhood, marriage, parenting, and practical spirituality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is in knowing our worth as women that we find joy in family living.
