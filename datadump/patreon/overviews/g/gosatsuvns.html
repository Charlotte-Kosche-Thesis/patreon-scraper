With \n\t\u003cem\u003eSHINRAI\u003c/em\u003e, we were lucky enough to find a composer and a\nproofreader who offered their aid for free, but we might not always be so\nlucky.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003e(Besides, I still wish I could have compensated them for their work.\nAfter all, composing an entire soundtrack and thoroughly checking a 150,000+\nwords story \n\t\u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e rather time-consuming!)\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSpeaking of our composer, he is actually having less \nand less time to compose music nowadays, so we might have to find \nsomeone else for future projects soon.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://gosatsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Patreon_B.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003e(Yeah, that really sucks...)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tUnfortunately, the money we currently earn\nthrough \n\t\u003cem\u003eSHINRAI\u003c/em\u003e isn\u2019t enough to cover the fees (you have to keep factors like $ to \u20ac conversion in mind, taxes or regional adjusted pricing.

Ideally, we would get to a point one day where those\ncould be covered through our sales so that we could fully focus on VN\ndevelopment. Because if there is anything I have learned through working on\n\t\u003cem\u003eSHINRAI\u003c/em\u003e, it\u2019s that creating and sharing stories like this is what I truly want\nto do in life.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, as things stand, we will eventually\nneed to get full-time jobs outside of VN development, which will drastically reduce the time we\ncan spend working on our projects, drag out development even further, and make the need for assistance even greater.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo in order to keep doing what we love, improve our VNs as much as possible, hire new team members, and not take ages to release something, we have decided to join Patreon.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn exchange for supporting us, I will muster the courage to do something which I usually don\u2019t: giving you actual\nwork-in-progress glimpses of our projects.

Time is really the most important factor here. When you have to do X different things on your own, you can only make so much progress on each individual task each day. Just writing a story alone is incredibly time-consuming as it requires a lot of planning (especially if player choices are involved) and huge amounts of research (at least when you\u0027re writing murder mysteries).
