The content is free and I love making it for you, but the production, time and hosting costs are not so free. My work is entirely audience supported and is highly unlikely to find a sponsor given its unpopular focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Please help make the hours spent researching, scheduling, recording, editing and producing more rewarding by becoming a patron!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge whatever you like, whenever you like. \u00a0You\u0027re in total control! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can keep aiming for the best show possible, with more fantastic guests and discussion. \u00a0I can also consider improving the show with various software and equipment upgrades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s no need to worry about your contributions spiralling out of control, as you can set limits, ensuring no surprises! \u00a0I typically release 3 to 4 items a month. \u00a0Regardless, I promise to limit your patronage to 4 items per month, even if I release more. I\u0027m kind like that. So, even if I release 4 podcasts and 2 videos a month - I\u0027ll still only put 4 of them on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also some perks as a small token of my gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge could earn you a mention on the podcast/social media and a personalised thank you card mailed to your door. Where possible, I will also release certain items early, exclusively for patrons! See below for full details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support you can provide means a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStephen Knight\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
