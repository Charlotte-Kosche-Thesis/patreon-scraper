We started \"Flood: The Prequel\" using art assets that came with the program which we are coming to find out is not what will get the game published on Steam. The community that votes on this is saying that we need an artist to make assets that are not stock to RPG Maker but unique to our games. On April 1, 2017 our Program Manager Zach Aars hired an artist,  Joseph T. Toohey to make this happen. We are still a new company and as we build more and more games they will get progressively better and better. The first one is a stepping off point and we hope you enjoy it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,w_620/v1480572455/urav79grihy9zubsrlnl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe following video is a recording of a radio interview we did with our local radio station in Wyoming talking about God Inspired Games and the first big project game we are making called \"The Philistine\".

     "about": "Hello, my name is Paul and I am the CEO and founder of God Inspired Games (GiG). I was in the Air Force for 12 years from 1996 to 2009 with deployments in September 2001 to Uzbekistan for Operation Enduring Freedom and 2006 for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The idea for God Inspired Games came to me while I was still on active duty during a trip to see my parents in 2008. At the time I was contemplating my life\u2019s direction, and asking myself what it is I want to do for the rest of my life and what it is I enjoy most. The answer was simple. I really enjoy playing video games. A connection was made to use this hobby to further God\u2019s Kingdom which became my new mission and the beginning for God Inspired Games.",
