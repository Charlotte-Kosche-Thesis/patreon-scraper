A big fat comic-making machine thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a published cartoonist for the past 15 years, with my weekly comic \"The Last Days of Roland \u0026amp; Cid\" and more recently I\u0027ve started a daily strip called \"Geekthology\". While I\u0027ve always had a passion for creating comic strips, it\u0027s always been a semi hobby, up until NOW! With the help of you and Patreon I\u0027d like to make Geekthology an ongoing daily strip, and perhaps, make a living at it. I know it\u0027s a bit of wishful thinking, but what would this world be without some outrageous wishful thinking, right? Perhaps, \u00a0with this patron powered business model, my lifelong dream could become a reality. I\u0027ll be the first cartoonist on the moon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Geekthology comic strip is my hyper-autobiographical strip that follows a father of two spunky kids as he attempts to find meaning in a geek-powered world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith some financial freedom I\u0027ll be able to focus more time on my craft, and could bring back some characters my Roland \u0026amp; Cid catalog that my previous readers and fans grew to love, like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Golf Course Detective Squad and Flamey, the Fire Safety Rhino.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this isn\u0027t a \"pay this or you won\u0027t get that\" situation. I will continue to make comics whether or not I\u0027m paid for it, but with your contribution I may be able to increase the frequency and the consistency of the strip. Make sure to set a maximum donation amount so you can cap off your donations at a certain amount. If I reach some goals I can do a bit more with my time, for you the fans. I hope to make some Sunday comics, bring back some old Roland \u0026amp; Cid characters and make some more Puppet Mike movies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, in advance, for your support. I look forward to hearing from all of you."
