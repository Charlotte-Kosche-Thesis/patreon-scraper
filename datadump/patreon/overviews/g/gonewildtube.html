Several sites had shut down and the ones that existed were either riddled with annoying ads or barely functional.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of serving the community I had some health issues and took some time off. During this time I entrusted the website and subreddit to an online friend that I had worked with for nearly a decade previously. This turned out to be a mistake as they let the website fall into disarray and spam to permeate the subreddit which even led to me being removed as a mod. Fortunately some decent alternatives arrived around this time so I didn\u0027t worry about rebuilding things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the recent announcement that Eroshare would be closing I have decided to give this another go. Previously I was able to fully fund the website with a minimal amount of non intrusive ads by relying on nearly 15 years of experience in managing adult sites. This time I would like to attempt this with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was able to host high definition amateur adult videos up to an hour long for only $500 per month even with immense bandwidth usage and we can do that again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach supporter here will be helping us to build an amateur adult community that is free for users and contributors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore details will be provided soon and thanks in advance for reading.\u003cbr\u003e"
