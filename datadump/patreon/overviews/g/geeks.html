I\u0027ve always been fascinated by the sort of serious fantasy \u0026amp; science fiction that\u0027s based on a deep understanding of science, history, and philosophy, and that tries to foster imagination, creativity, and social progress. I\u0027m also fascinated by the people who write fantasy \u0026amp; science fiction, and the techniques used to create it. I\u0027ve always thought that there should be a talk show where the world\u0027s best writers and thinkers came together to discuss all the world\u0027s most interesting and important ideas, using fantasy \u0026amp; science fiction as a lens for viewing the world as it is and as it might be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBack in 2010, I founded the \n\u003cem\u003eGeek\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy\u003c/em\u003e podcast along with acclaimed short fiction editor \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.johnjosephadams.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJohn Joseph Adams\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, who continues to be involved as our producer and regular guest. I\u0027ve spent the past five years working around the clock to build the podcast into exactly the sort of show I always wanted to listen to, the sort of show where top authors like \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://geeksguideshow.com/2010/10/06/ggg22-george-r-r-martin/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGeorge R.

We\u0027re often joined by top journalists, filmmakers, comic book writers, video game designers, internet stars, and astronauts -- just about everyone a science fiction fan would want to talk to, well over 100 guests in all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://geeksguidetothegalaxy.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/geeksguideallstars1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nDoing the show eats up enormous amounts of time. Since we discuss so many books on the show, I usually have to read at least one book a week -- and sometimes two or three. John and I have to brainstorm potential guests, reach out to them, and schedule interviews. Then I have to research those guests, catch up on their recent work, read and watch existing interviews with them, and plan out the topics of conversation. I have to record the interviews and then edit them, paring them down to a manageable length and also fixing verbal fumbling and annoying clicks, pops, and background noise. I also have to write up an article about each episode so it can be featured on \u003cstrong\u003eWIRED\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve worked full-time on the podcast, including almost every evening and almost every weekend, for the past five years. The show doesn\u0027t bring in anywhere near enough money to pay even one full-time salary. I\u0027ve kept it going by volunteering my time and digging into my savings. I\u0027ve done this because I badly want a show like this to exist, and I\u0027ve always believed that a show like this could be a big success.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s where you come in. \n\u003cem\u003eGeek\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy\u003c/em\u003e has well over \u003cstrong\u003e10,000 listeners\u003c/strong\u003e, and I get letters all the time from people who love the show and who\u0027ve listened to all \u003cstrong\u003e100+ episodes\u003c/strong\u003e. If just a fraction of those people would sign up to give us $1 or $2 an episode, I could easily make this my full-time job well into the future. One amazing gentleman in France loves the show so much that he\u0027s been giving us \u003cstrong\u003e$50 a month!\u003c/strong\u003e A few dozen super-fans like that could make the show a big financial success all by themselves. Ideally I\u0027d like to grow our funding to the point where I could hire someone to help me with the audio editing work, which would free up time for me to record more interviews and panels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://geeksguidetothegalaxy.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/federationsbar600.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne thing that frustrates me as an author is that the fantasy \u0026amp; science fiction field lacks a reliable channel for publicizing new authors to a mass audience. Publishers are forced to simply publish large numbers of books for very small advances and see if anything clicks. There\u0027s a huge amount of luck involved, and most authors don\u0027t get lucky. I think it would be great if a popular talk show like \n\u003cem\u003eGeek\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy\u003c/em\u003e could serve as a reliable venue for launching new writers into the public consciousness, and I think our association with\u003cstrong\u003e WIRED\u003c/strong\u003e and our ability to land interviews with major media figures gives us a unique opportunity to build the show into exactly that sort of platform. So if that\u0027s something you\u0027d like to see happen, I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, I\u0027ve always been inspired by science fiction authors like \n\u003cstrong\u003eIsaac Asimov\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eDouglas Adams\u003c/strong\u003e who were not only entertaining writers but who also spoke out publicly on important issues like critical thinking and environmental protection. We do the same thing here on \u003cem\u003eGeek\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy\u003c/em\u003e, and if you share our concern for those sorts of issues, I hope that\u0027s another reason you\u0027ll consider supporting us.
