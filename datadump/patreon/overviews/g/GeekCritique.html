With the Retro Studios season complete, and the Other M bonus episode finally finished, it\u0027s time to get started on what I\u0027m doing next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be at least one, and maybe two off-season episodes. The one that\u0027s definitely happening is a retrospective on Sega\u0027s final console, the Dreamcast. The one that MIGHT happen will be some kind of briefer look back on the ups and downs of gaming in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the Dreamcast episode will segue nicely into my next season, which will feature the following episodes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSonic Adventure 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSonic Heroes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Sonic Advance Trilogy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSonic the Hedgehog 2006\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Wrap-Up Episode for other Sonic titles of the era.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd the season\u0027s Patreon-backed bonus episode will most-likely be for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShadow the Hedgehog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eHere\u0027s a brief overview of how (and why) TGC\u0027s Patreon works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 will get you the NEXT week\u0027s episode once the season begins. So when Adventure 2 comes out, you\u0027ll get Heroes a week early, and so on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$3 will get you ALL the completed episodes of a season all at once as soon as I start releasing them on YouTube. This will allow you to binge-watch the season as fast as you\u0027d like, instead of waiting a week between releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5 is the \"TGC Producer\" tier, and gets you access to episodes as they\u0027re actually completed. This may mean that you\u0027ll be able to see episodes weeks or, because these things take a while, even MONTHS in advance! (Seriously, Prime 1 was the first episode I finished in the Retro Studios, and it was here three months before it went up on YouTube!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you might be asking... \u003cstrong\u003eWHY am I releasing content like this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, blame YouTube.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Their algorithms favor quantity and consistency over quality. If you can upload once or even better, twice a week, your rankings shoot WAY up. This change was implemented right around the time I was trying to get started on YouTube, and it completely KILLED anyone who was trying to do anything that took too much time. Animators were hit the hardest, but it hurt any kind of scripted, polished video, and kind of led to the rise of people who work VERY hard on their channels, but not so much on individual videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why, you might notice, most of the people who are still making these long-form analysis videos... were already famous for doing it pre-2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis change made sense for YouTube as a business, but I much preferred the old style, and that\u0027s what I want my series to be. But sad to say, this sort of work no longer fits within YouTube\u0027s system. No matter how much my channel has grown, the only way to get YouTube to promote me to new viewers is to have a period of time where I upload consistently, and the only way for me to DO that and maintain this level of quality is to build a season ahead of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where, I hope, you guys who do enjoy this sort of content come in. TGC survives, or even thrives, on YOUR support, and for that I thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd not to go all Jimmy Wales on you, but if 1/5th of my subscriber base backed me for just a dollar per month, I really could consider this a career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you want to do, I want to \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e for taking the time to watch The Geek Critique."
