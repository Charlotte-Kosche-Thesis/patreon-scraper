So, those folks know where we\u2019re going here.  The guard is a specific frequency that all aircraft and control towers should be monitoring constantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf someone out there is lost, or having an engine failure, or a panic attack, or some other in-flight emergency, they might send a mayday on that channel.  Other pilots or towers in the area will answer back on that channel with instructions or directions to get you back to smooth and level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr, if you\u2019re already crashing and burning, they\u2019ll know where to send the search and rescue people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s what this show, and our organization, is all about  \u2013 a place where you can just tune in and know that you\u2019re going to get help from the community.  Or, maybe you\u2019ll be there to help out a fellow Citizen or Civilian.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes the constant effort of a team of people to do what we do, and it takes some cold hard cash to get it out to everyone.\u00a0 This is our hobby, so we don\u0027t mind spending some money to make it happen.\u00a0 But, if we didn\u0027t have to carry the ball by ourselves, we could carry it a lot farther. You\u0027ve seen and heard our interviews with Chris Roberts, Eric Peterson, Ben Lesnick, Rob Irving and many more with CIG.\u00a0 There will be more.\u00a0 But they could happen more often if our listeners helped us out with covering the week-to-week expenses and chipped in for travel and lodging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love listening to the show as much as we love making it, please consider helping us make it even better.\u00a0 Thanks for listening, and we\u0027ll see you out in the deep black!\u003cbr\u003e"
