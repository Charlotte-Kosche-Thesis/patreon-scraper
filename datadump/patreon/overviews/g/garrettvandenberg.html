    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi and welcome to my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is the platform where I\u0027ll post almost everything I make for the people who support me financially to enjoy, discuss, critique and use in their own content (see below). If you\u0027re one of those people, thank you SO much!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can I expect as a patron?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLittle Projects: I love making music, and on a weekly basis I make a lot more music than can be palatably released in a marketable way. Previously, most of that music has just stayed on my hard drive, but now a lot of that \u003cem\u003eextra\u003c/em\u003e music will show up on here. This is music that I love and want to share with people, but don\u2019t have the time or budget to polish or promote in the same way I would for a larger project. This kind of content includes: acoustic covers, remixes, originals, instrumental arrangements, experimentations with different genres, etc. I\u2019ll release at least one of these types of songs per month to my patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig Projects: These are the bigger, more developed and polished projects that I\u0027m planning to release officially. I have three albums I\u2019m currently working on and planning to release over the next two or three years, and as a patron you\u2019d be directly supporting that journey. As I work on these projects, I\u2019ll release at least one demo per month to my patrons. You can listen to it, give feedback and be a part of the developing process. My patrons will be the ONLY ones with access to these demos, so I really appreciate you respecting that and not sharing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic Library:\u003cbr\u003eThis is something a friend has been encouraging me to do for a long time, and I\u2019m excited to finally put it together. If you\u2019re a fellow content creator and you like the sound of my stuff enough to want to use it in the background of your own material, I\u2019m giving patrons ($15 or more) access to an ever growing library of original music that can be used under the condition that they credit me. This library will continue to be curated each month with new content from my hard drives, as well as instrumental versions of the other songs I release to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgain, thanks for checking this out and keeping up with me. If you\u2019re considering becoming a patron, or already are a patron, seriously \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003ethank you so much\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGarrett"
