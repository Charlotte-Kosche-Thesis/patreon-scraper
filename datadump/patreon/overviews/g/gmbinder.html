    "summary": "Hey there! Thanks for checking out our Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we\u0027re still very early on in the development of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gmbinder.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGM Binder\u003c/a\u003e, we feel that the tool as it exists today is very useful, stable, and secure, so we wanted to get it into the hands of you the users!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRoadmap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOver the coming days / weeks / months we will continue to add new features to the GM Binder. As a bit of a teaser of where we\u0027re going, here is a list of features we anticipate building (in no particular order):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdel\u003ePHB Tables - Right now, general content is formatting pretty well. However, tables for things like abilities, spells, stat blocks, etc are not. This would resolve those issues.\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSection sharing - The ability to share one or more sections of your documents with others.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSharing management - Right now you can share your entire document(s). This will allow you to share the entire document, or only particular sections of a document.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCo-authors - The ability for you to allow others to edit one or more of your documents.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eParty members - Related to sharing, this will give you a way to manage other users who you want to privately share content with.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExternal Links - Currently you can add any external links you wish to your document. The goal of this feature will be to make this significantly easier by giving you a built in menu for searching \u0026amp; selecting pages from external sites ie: D\u0026amp;D Beyond.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdel\u003eAdditional document themes - Right now we support the D\u0026amp;D 5e PHB styles. We\u0027d like to add other book / game styles like the DMG, Pathfinder, etc.\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdel\u003ePrinting - The ability to print your documents.\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMarketplace - This one is pretty far off, but the goal would be the ability for you to generate revenue from the content that you\u0027ve created.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdel\u003eMore mobile friendly - Because this first phase was focused on content creation, and that will typically happen on a desktop, that\u0027s where our focus has been. It is reasonably useful on tablets and phones, but it by no means perfect.\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e* Crossed out items are complete\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Plans \u0026amp; Expenses:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince GM Binder started as a side project of ours, with real expenses for servers and what not, we opted to create this Patreon page to get a better understanding of what people would pay for a tool like GM Binder. We want to be upfront in saying, if there\u0027s value seen in GMB, we\u0027d like to generate revenue at some point. However, for now, until you the audience has proven to us that people actually want it, we\u0027re leaving it open and free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat said, we really appreciate anyone who is willing to be an early user, dealing with the inevitable changes and bugs and what not. Because of this, we\u0027d like to make a commitment to you now: Any patrons who pledges $3 or more per month will receive all future functionality \u0026amp; features, forever.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gmbinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.gmbinder.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
