    "summary": "I\u0027m a jewelry designer who has yet to finish my design degree; I am seeking to share my love of design with you.  I love creating unique pieces that work for you and your family.   All to often jewelry has become a disposable commodity; I\u0027d love to think that I can help change this trend. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollaborative creations can add to an individual or family legacy and serve to preserve memories and endure generations. \u00a0Adornments have been some of the most recycled materials for humans over thousands of years. \u00a0We still consider jewelry as a valuable commodity, but more often than not it is easy to find costume jewelry that is made by the hundreds of thousands intended for the trash heap. \u00a0I\u0027d like to work to change this; while jewelry should be beautiful in the wearer\u0027s eyes it should also serve as an outward symbol of inner values.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus is in CAD and 3D printing; these new tools can serve to create less waste and encourage our global movement of reduce our trash.  This doesn\u0027t mean that you have to sacrifice the use of prescious metals or gems; in fact I encourage you to consider the choice of a material that fits the purpose and budget for your needs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to finish my Jewelry Design degree; this was cut short when I chose to care for a sick loved one who has since passed away. \u00a0My promise was to finish my degree and I hope that with your support that I can get there. \u00a0I want to make a difference in the jewelry community by pulling back the veil of mystery about its true value in individuals\u0027 lives and how it is a part of your fast paced world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
