    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eDisclaimer: I GM a closed group in the Dungeons and Dragons 5e system. This page is for my players to contribute.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for joining my campaign!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s begin with a little about me. \u003cbr\u003e\nMy name\u0027s Jeremy and I\u0027m 32 years old, live in California, and have been playing RPGs for several years now. I have experience in both playing and GMing D\u0026amp;D (3.5, Pathfinder, 4, \u0026amp; 5), Star Wars (Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion, \u0026amp; Force and Destiny), Victoriana, Numenera, World of Darkness, D20 Modern, Shadowrun, and Dark Heresy. I enjoy creating content for players, spinning fantastical stories into being, and seeing the gaming universe come to life for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy the charge to play?\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are a number of reasons, but let\u0027s boil them down to the best ones.\u003cbr\u003e\n1) I looove running in-depth, living campaigns with players so that their character can truly come to life. That\u0027s how I enjoy gaming as a player! It really helps if the player is invested in the game and isn\u0027t going to quit after only a few sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\n2) It weeds out some of the players who would be detrimental to your gaming experience. (Immaturity, rudeness, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\n3) This helps offset the cost of things like the premium Roll20 subscription which makes everything run smoothly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s what you\u0027ll get when gaming with me:\u003cbr\u003e\n1) A GM who comes to each game prepared (10-20 hours/week in prep time).\u003cbr\u003e\n2) Consistency - Short of a national holiday or act of god, we\u0027ll have a play session every week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n3) A fun experience that isn\u0027t rules heavy. While rules are important, my philosophy is that fun \u0026gt; rules.\u003cbr\u003e\n4) Powerful storytelling and action packed content.\u003cbr\u003e\n5) An EPIC Adventure!\u003cbr\u003e"
