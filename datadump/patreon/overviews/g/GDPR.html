I\u0027ve been a broadcast, print, and Web journalist for more than 30 years and a progressive activist and radio junkie for far longer. For the past almost 22 years, I have melded all of that into my passion, my life\u0027s work, my effort to help build a better nation and world:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gdprrevolution99.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGRATEFUL DREAD PUBLIC RADIO\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI founded what we call \u003cstrong\u003eGDPR REVOLUTION99\u003c/strong\u003e in 1996 to provide noncommercial peace-progressive news/talk internet radio for We The People. Working in mainstream and alternative media, it had become clear to me that certain voices and issues were excluded from the mainstream -- and when not excluded, they were maligned and ridiculed. Issues regarding human rights and equality, the environment, peace, the drug war, the widening chasm between the haves and have-nots, the hijacking of government by Wall Street sycophants, the rise of racism and the new Jim Crow... there are plenty of issues. Additionally, I\u0027ve been frustrated that so few are motivated to do the hard work of fighting for positive change. And then there were the arts: So many great talents and ideas were frozen out of the mainstream and so much culture never made it to the masses. So our mission became clear: to present diverse sounds and ideas, voices, and views; to encourage citizen action and to shine a light on activists; and to promote art and artists not getting the attention they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://gdprnashville.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nat-at-sirius-600x450.jpg\" style=\"width: 224px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eFrom day one, we\u0027ve sought to be independent, listener-supported activist media. We started in 1996 as a computer bulletin board service, and before long, I figured out how to turn our creation into internet radio. Using the public radio model (and all too often digging into my own pocket) we created public service netradio that consisted of syndicated and original news/talk programming, activism alerts and reports, POVs not included in mainstream and corporate radio, and bold, eclectic arts programs. And that\u0027s how we\u0027ve operated and hung on for more than two decades. We\u0027ve moved from Baltimore, to New Jersey, to Nashville, and GDPR has traveled with us and continued its mission. Over the years, we\u0027ve earned a base of thousands of loyal listeners, some who became members and contributed to our work. Our listenership continues to grow, but since the crash of 2008, contributions have fallen. I\u0027ve used my own money and stretched dollars beyond reason to try and keep things going, but as the media landscape has grown more dicey over recent years and operating costs have risen (and they continue to rise), my own financial situation has grown more unstable. So I am reaching out to Patreon to keep the dream alive at a time when our work is needed more than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://gdprnashville.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/armact-rosie.jpeg\" style=\"width: 149px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eWe ask you to join the GDPR family by becoming a patron.

We are in dire need of a long-overdue technical upgrade of hardware and software. Carriage fees for a number of our program offerings are on the rise, as are now through-the-roof royalty fees for music. And while I have two volunteer partners who do what they can, the lion\u0027s share of the work of operating a 24/7/365 radio station falls on my shoulders alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we are to continue our work and provide the best product we can in service of our mission, we need more help than ever before -- at a time when the US needs independent, noncorporate media more than ever. Please join me as we work to help move the revolution of the 99 percent forward. If you are a progressive who wants to see a better nation and world and to become part of the solution, we\u0027re on the same side. Help us build and grow and survive as we work together toward fulfilling our collective mission. In the fight for a better day, we\u0027re in this together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your attention, I appreciate your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
