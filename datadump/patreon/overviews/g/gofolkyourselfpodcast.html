    "summary": "We are a team of podcasters that are passionate about creating engaging and hilarious content about American history and folklore. We blend research, comedic improvisation, and deep Wikipedia dives every two weeks to explore some of the most beloved, forgotten, and downright strange topics hidden in the American folk memory.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to touch on every state in America and share some fantastic stories and content across the web. We cover folkloric entities, urban legends, ghost stories, and discussions on the power of belief. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t expect our listeners to contribute to this project because of how off the wall our concept is, and we don\u0027t want to stoop to advertising from other companies since this is a passion project for us. I mean, honestly, do you want to listen to more Audible ads in your podcast rotation? The ads we make up are way better anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to contribute, we have some very specific goals that will allow us to up our audio game and branch out into new topics that will make you laugh. If you like what you hear, and have noticed that there aren\u0027t any other folklore based comedy podcasts online, then your contribution means the world to us and will ensure even more content in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe just want to keep creating content that our listeners enjoy, and having a few extra dollars every month will help keep hosting costs down and give us some new tools to play with and engage our community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I have been a history and folklore nerd for years, and this show serves as an outlet to have some strange (and entertaining) discussions on American legends, urban myths, and local stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe website exists as a space to organize the chaos that goes into managing the show. It also helps with keeping track of everything covered and discussed by myself, Dan (co-host), Ethan (local rural topic expert), Nick (the marketing extraordinaire) and Victor (the sound guy.) Together we hope to tackle each of the fifty states and cover some unique stories and odd fun facts (mostly true.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be posting in an episodic format following a state per episode. Each episode begins with an introduction to the state, sharing some amazing (mostly true) bits of trivia, a curated selection of odd stories, and the main story. \u003cbr\u003eEach main story will then be evaluated by our team in a incredibly scientific method: the Mulder / Scully Scale of Believability. Mulder represents the desire to believe. Scully represents true skepticism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny questions so far? Give us a listen. \u003cbr\u003e",
