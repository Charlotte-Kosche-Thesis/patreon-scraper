    "summary": "Hi person reading this, I\u0027m grayfruit. I make videos on YouTube primarily about a game called Super Smash Bros for Wii U (yes, the lesser version) but also about other games increasingly often lately. (I also stream, with increasing frequency lately)\u003cbr\u003eI started a Patreon because I realized how much time and effort and money I had so far put into this because I essentially viewed it as a hobby, but as more and more subscribers arrive, I think it\u0027s now time to step up the production value a little more.\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I want to be perfectly clear that part of this is just because even with my real life job, I struggle to meet up with the cost of living, but I also plan to use funds to buy better equipment such as an actual professional microphone, better capture equipment, and potentially even a webcam for occasions.\u003cbr\u003eI like doing these videos, and I\u0027m glad people like them. I really don\u0027t want to make it seem like I truly /need/ donations, because I can get by, but if you feel like pledging (even if it\u0027s like, a nickel or whatever) that would help a lot and help me make more, better, sillier videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!"
