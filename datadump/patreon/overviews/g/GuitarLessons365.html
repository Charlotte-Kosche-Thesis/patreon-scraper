    "summary": "Hey guys, I\u0027m Carl Brown and I teach the world how to play the guitar for free on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December of 2009, I posted my very first guitar lessons on YouTube. Since then I have been fortunate enough to develop a very large community of guitarists who subscribe to my guitar lesson channels, while along the way amassing over 1000 free guitar lesson videos (and counting...).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the years have gone by, I have devoted more and more time into my free YouTube lessons, trying to make them the absolute best they can be. That includes using better quality cameras with simultaneous multiple angles, better editing techniques, faster web hosting and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I spend more and more time trying to help as many guitar players around the world to learn to play their favorite songs or better their technique and so forth, I have come to the realization that in order to keep going at this pace, I need some help. That is where you come in! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron of my guitar lessons, you are ensuring that I will be able to continue creating 1000\u0027s more detailed guitar lessons for many years to come. Patreon is a great way to support someone who is doing something to better your life or make it a bit easier. In my case, helping you learn the guitar faster no matter where you are in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your monthly donation, I hope to help more people pick up a guitar and discover all the great guitar based music that is in this world. Hopefully, it will also inspire them to create some of their own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, the fact that you are even reading this means that my lessons have helped you out in some way. I am extremely grateful that you are considering supporting me in this very challenging, time consuming, yet very worthwhile endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You!!\u003cbr\u003eCarl... (Now off to create more lessons....)\u003cbr\u003e"
