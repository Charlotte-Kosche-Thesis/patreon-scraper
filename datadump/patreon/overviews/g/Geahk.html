    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eI make stuff, it\u2019s what I do.\u003c/h4\u003eI\u2019m an explorer of many mediums and I have\n trouble settling down with one art form. I started with illustration \nand comics and moved to model building and sculpture, then to doll \nmaking, and mechanical engineering. That experimentation eventually lead \nme to puppetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/b08a8bb1589c554811ed/9672083/960x720.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is an art that encompasses all others, synthesizes \nall my various interests\u2013drawing, painting, writing, sculpting, carving,\n film making, acting, engineering, lighting, set design, sound, sewing, \nfashion, general crafting and most of all, storytelling\u2013all into one \nplace. Puppet shows are a way for me to contain these interests and \nfocus them.  The result is a blend of aestheticism and technical \npragmatism creating visuals purpose built to convey narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/f16fd8e33a291258d976/34431252/960x960.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePuppetry is a very broad art form. \u003cem\u003eEssentially, any object manipulated by a person could be considered a puppet;\u003c/em\u003e but I\u0027ve always been drawn to challenge, and Marionettes are considered by many to be the most challenging form of puppetry. For me that makes them the most rewarding. But another thing I like about the medium is collaboration with others. I like putting on complex shows with many moving parts requiring many people to work together, like clockwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5b__lQXuL5g\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eI like writing with other writers. Composing settings and environments with teams of talented artists. The marionettes get passed from hand to hand during a show, every puppeteer silently communicating with each other even while speaking lines aloud for the audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/b965133e31c3aa25fd1e/19671946/960x596.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of that collaboration is between me and the audience as well. We can\u0027t see one another during a performance, but I am listening. We use live dialog and sound effects in our shows. I am listening to how the audience reacts to each moment and I am tailoring the pace of the show for a particular audience. It\u0027s a different show every time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/d7443d5593709a4c84a1/6866297/590x849.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a teacher.\u00a0 I run marionette building workshops over periods of weeks with hand-on training for students but there are more students than I can teach. I want to give this art form to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/197656c3d0c5507032fd/35649254/960x1308.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have produced patterns and templates for others to use, so they can skip some of the difficulty and frustration I had while learning this craft. Eventually I want to publish a book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/7a7743cb3e7e8391ed65/35644007/960x621.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also hope to use this platform to help me produce future plays and stories which I have been working on for years, but never had the resources to manifest. I have at least four, future, live theater performances I\u0027ve been working on and a couple of YouTube shows I\u0027ve wanted to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/c4870d12c41d777ae917/29693532/960x595.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/e0ac3ddd71d99fb11283/35644277/960x598.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/0a214e386bdfcbbfdee6/29693529/960x724.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.cmcdn.net/24a089518a79c68fcc2b/6866296/849x646.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you in advance for giving to my Patreon.

For the intervening few years I scrambled and took work on all manner of other projects barely making ends meet.

Those who feared this project was dead will start to see progress again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all goes according to plan, the other projects I will have begun through Patreon will have an effect.

I can start thinking about hiring voice actors and a composer for the score (Nicole Gose--really, a WONDERFUL musician and voice actor whom I have always had in mind for this project) With this relatively modest amount of money coming in, the film can be shot on a better camera which I can afford to rent.
