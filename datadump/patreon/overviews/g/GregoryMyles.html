I believe that even with a small amount of support from a small number of you, I would be able to make YouTube tutorial videos more often and of much higher quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour kind comments and praise on my YouTube channel (and Facebook/Skype for the more determined amongst you...) have really touched me and I am frequently asked if I am going to make more videos and if people can help me to do so. Currently, my biggest obstacles are time and access to good video editing software. I really think that Patreon is a great way to enable viewers to support the channel if they are able to and want to whilst still keeping all of the content completely free and accessible to everybody on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, if anybody would like to help out but feels uncomfortable committing to a monthly pledge then I\u0027d be happy to accept any donations to my PayPal account at the following link: www.paypal.me/GMyles\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for taking the time to come to this page and for watching my videos.
