Our main quest in the Game of Life is to help people get engaged in their daily lives by cutting out the unimportant and focusing on what they love. We\u2019re doing this by sharing how we\u2019re making our life a game and turning our work into play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to thank all of you who have already joined our game, to those who are wondering if they want to participate, here are a few reasons why you might!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe play for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe do all our work for free. We\u2019ll work with you to find your play-zone (the work you\u2019d do for free) and then figure out the hard stuff for you. With our ability to innovate (Josh) and design (Wylie), we\u2019ll create a seamless transition for you from your work-life to your play-life.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eWe can keep doing our work for free only if we get enough partners to sustain our living costs. We call this Social Income. You partner with us based on the amount of value you think we\u2019re giving to the world. We know this might sound impossible, but\u2026\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can play, you can too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRunning a sub-4 minute mile was said to be impossible. Until one day in 1954, Roger Bannister achieved the impossible running a mile in just less than 4 minutes. Since then, hundreds of runners have gone one to run sub-4 minute miles. How can we explain this? Did we get faster? Or were our minds holding us back?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we want to do what Bannister did, but with Social Income. Once we prove to the world it\u2019s possible to do what you love to do for free, then you guys will be able to do it too! So help us, help you, and\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Be a part of Creating Lifework!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLifework is a platform to allow individuals like yourself do what they love and get paid. It\u2019s a platform run off the idea of Social Income and makes it easy to create partnerships between individuals and organizations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike Patreon, but for everyone, not just creators. For example, if I were a chef and wanted to make meals for the homeless, you could partner with me to contribute to covering my cost of living and for the food I\u2019m buying to make these meals to help me do what I love and also be a part of helping feed the homeless, seeing exactly what your contribution is going towards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLifework isn\u2019t just for individual partnerships though. Say a cookware company sees what I\u2019m doing and wants to be a part of it. They can partner with me which would help me tons, and I could then act as a sponsor for their company, using and promoting their products. Creating a two-way partnership where I gain the ability to do what I love for free and they get a sponsor and are attached to a good cause, bring them business.\u003cbr\u003e"
