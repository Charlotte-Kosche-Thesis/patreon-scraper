    "summary": "Thanks for joining me and supporting me on this journey. My name is Kristina Brooke Daniele, but I go by Kristina Brooke.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor most of my adult life, I have helped other writers hone their craft. I have built webzines, blogs, websites, and brands. I\u0027ve taught high school, homeschooled, and led online workshops. And I have done it all while grappling with this unbelievable desire to publish my work. The thing is, despite living, breathing, and craving writing, I also suffer from debilitating perfectionism that keeps me frozen in a stream of \"what ifs!\" So, I edit, revise, edit some more. I reread and think and plan and publish nothing. But I have much to say.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am focused on \"living freely.\" That means that I am no longer hiding my emotions behind societies rules of engagement. I will not stuff my greatness into a small box because the world fears an intelligent, fat, outspoken, angry, Black Woman. I am living. I am evolving, and I won\u0027t settle for anything less than what I deserve! And I want you to do the same. I am making my words public because sometimes, you have to say \"eff you\" to fear and connect with those who understand (or are open to doing so).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy writing will reflect that as well as a few other topics: adoption, rape, abusive mothers, alcoholic fathers, eating disorders, unrequited love, toxic relationships, anxiety, depression, and so much more. Also, I fight for the underdog, especially when they are Black Women and Children. I publish a monthly zine and am trying to carve out time to write my novel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn my professional life, I am a Social Media Opportunist. That means that I create opportunities for brands to engage with their audience by helping them put on their best show online. From creating digital strategies to creating editorial calendars, I am the person behind some of the campaigns that you may have seen from very small businesses. Additionally, I am a tarot reader and idea/focus muse. I provide tarot readings that center on clarifying choices and empowering clients with knowledge and awareness so that they can make the best decisions for themselves\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you are interested in following my journey, reading what I have to say and sharing your thoughts, buckle your seat belts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://gatherthewind.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGather the Wind Zine Website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gatherthewindzine/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gather_the_wind/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
