    "summary": "Hello and thank you for your interest in supporting my brand new podcast, Government Gone Wild! I\u2019m so excited to begin this journey with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, the name Government Gone Wild might be familiar to you. It\u2019s the name of the book I wrote in 2016. This podcast shares the name of my book because it serves as an extension of the ideas I shared in print - that D.C. politicians are taking you for a ride, and it\u2019s up to you to do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who are familiar with my work -- maybe you\u2019ve read my book, or maybe you\u2019ve seen me sparring on tv -- then you know what my style is all about: fast-paced and fiery. I\u2019ll invite plenty of conservatives and libertarians on my show, but I\u2019ll also be hosting plenty of liberals. That\u2019s because debates are more fun and they\u2019re more enlightening. We all become smarter and more well-rounded by hearing both sides of an argument.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I can\u0027t do this alone. I want your support and feedback in developing and growing this podcast. In order to get the message of Government Gone Wild out to as many people as possible, to address important issues and make our voices heard, we need to work together. It\u0027s up to us to hold government accountable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that, I am seeking founding members - patrons and admins - to support the production and distribution of the podcast. Each week I will be booking guests, conducting interviews, writing monologues, editing and pushing podcast episodes to the masses. With your help, we can make an excellent show that cannot be ignored.\u003cbr\u003e"
