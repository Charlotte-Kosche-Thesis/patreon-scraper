Over the past 10 years, GWYA\u2019s co-founder Eugene has assisted in the creation of 18 urban farms, 14 school gardens, and 40+ home gardens, and has planted 400+ fruit trees in cities throughout the U.S. as well as in Jamaica, Haiti and Kenya, where he trained local residents in veganic growing methods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Support Grow Where You Are?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. INCREASING FOOD SECURITY \u0026amp; RESILIENCE for individuals, families and communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the drought in California, we are seeing now more than ever how important it is to national food security to encourage the production of locally grown produce. GWYA also helps individuals and families to improve their personal food sovereignty by inspiring people to plant backyard and community food gardens, and providing them with the training and knowledge to grow abundant food systems. These gardens can drastically increase families\u2019 access to fresh fruits and vegetables in urban food deserts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. VEGAN OUTREACH THROUGH FOOD AND NUTRITION.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaituFoods, focuses on nutrition education and on the creation of delicious, dynamic, and nourishing plant-based meals using fresh produce grown on the farm. Vibrant and flavorful creations prompt meaningful dialogue around vegan food and the reasons for living vegan. Since 2008, MaituFoods has served more than 1,920 vegan school lunches and more than 1,000 vegan meals to families. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird Moon Botanica through a philosophy of \"Nuture Soil. Nuture Soul.\" utilizes traditional medicine to reconnect our bodies to health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. INCREASING AWARENESS \u0026amp; PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF VEGANIC GROWING TECHNIQUES\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the Veganic Agriculture Network lists only 9 veganic farms in the United States. This means that most vegans have no choice but to purchase fruits, vegetables and other foodstuffs grown with the byproducts of animal suffering and slaughter: even organic farms typically utilize animal manures, bloodmeal, bonemeal, and other slaughterhouse offal.\u00a0We need more people practicing and promoting veganic growing methods so we all can have access to truly vegan produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe importance of local, plant-based food production is clear. The UN\u0027s own Environment Program has publicly urged a global shift to a vegan diet \"wherever possible,\" while The Associated Press recently called growing your own food the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_GREECE_RESILIENT_VILLAGES?SITE=AP\u0026amp;SECTION=HOME\u0026amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\u0026amp;CTIME=2015-07-03-08-15-15\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esecret weapon against hunger\u003c/a\u003e.
