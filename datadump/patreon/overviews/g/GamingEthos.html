    "summary": "After coming back from E3 in 2015, I was determined to make strides and changes to a medium that I love and care about. An accumulation of disappointment from games in 2014, the corruption of the PC version of Batman Arkham Knight, the abuse of DLC and microtransactions in AAA games, marketing deception and lies and misinformation of different aspects of gaming from both publishers, developers and gamers alike, fueled a new fiery passion inside of me. It gave me the motivation to stand up and demand better, the courage to say what others won\u0027t. \u00a0It gave me purpose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent hours rewriting the entire format of my channel, brainstorming the content that I would create and means by which to deliver it. In only four short months I began to see a community of fellow gamers who truly enjoyed my content. They too had similar feelings for gaming and that connection began to resonate more and more as time went on. So, here I am today. In only the first month of 2016, I have achieved 20,000 subscribers thanks to all of you. \u00a0While both exciting and humbling, reaching this milestone has had me in deep thought on my place in this community and the mindset by which I see my YouTube channel. Through the support of people like you, I have made some of the best content I never would have imagined me making a year ago. \u00a0Through your dedicated viewership you have motivated me to do my best in all things and to always keep improving even in times that made me proud to be a gamer and the moments where I just wanted to turn off the game and never play again, you guys have been there for me and from the bottom of my heart, I am proud to call each and every one of you allies, friends and even symbols of faith in the medium I love and care so much for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eWhich leads us to where we are today. After months of deep thought, conversations with close friends and youtubers, I have decided to take my youtube to the next level. Before this, I had looked at YouTube as just a hobby that I enjoyed doing, but now I see it as an investment. \u00a0I am at this point on the road where I want to push my limits for the ultimate goal of creating that change I hungered for after going to E3 and I am sure you have all seen and felt it. From the level of quality I bring with my series like \u003cstrong\u003eFlow, Ethos Reviews, Mind The Ethos Analysis, Game Design, Death Of An Industry and Music Videos\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eto the development of my first commercial video game\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLEAP\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0 I am actively taking steps to keep the promise I made to all of you on twitter after the Batman Arkham Knight controversy. It stays on my twitter pinned, until I fulfill the promise I made.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s12.postimg.org/4r6sqvkdp/1_22_2016_4_00_51_PM.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAnd this is where Patreon comes in.

From equipment like a green screen, extra lighting and a brand new camera to experimenting with brand new concepts like bigger skits, interviews, a talk show, actual live studio set, multiple in-depth PC Building Guides and even a possible animated series project, I can create the content you not only want, but deserve. \u00a0These ideas have been but a dream but with your backing, I can turn them into a reality. Most importantly, \u003cstrong\u003ethis brand new quality content would not be exclusive or locked behind a pay wall for my backers\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0It will all be available to everyone, backers and non-backers at the exact same time so that everyone can enjoy the entertainment you and I made possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you are probably wondering if you don\u0027t get exclusive content, what are benefits to being a backer?\u003c/strong\u003e Besides being noted at the end of every single one of my videos for helping make these quality videos projects a reality, you will have some very special perks. As I stated before those who back me will get a more intimate behind the scenes look at my process and the content I am creating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0First, backers will actually be able to \u003cem\u003einfluence \u003c/em\u003ethe upcoming videos that will appear on my channel. I am always working on multiple videos at any given time and being a backer will give you access to not only exclusive polls to determine which videos are produced first, but through the patreon feed, you\u0027ll be able to give feedback on early drafts of the script, give your opinion towards the topic at hand that may even be cited in the said video. \u00a0On top of that, being a backer allows you to directly communicate with me and suggest brand new topics that you would like for me to discuss. \u00a0If chosen, you\u0027ll even be given credit and a shout out in the video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinuing this idea of influencing future projects, my patreon backers will also be given access to an exclusive playlist of all of the songs that I am planning to work with and used for a gaming music video. \u00a0They will also be able to vote on which songs should be used in future music videos as well as the ability make recommendations of songs they would love to see me edit into a video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is really only the surface of what I wish to offer those who back me. \u00a0With your feedback on my Taking A Leap of Faith Video, I will post the official tier based reward system that pushes this idea of giving my backers more personal access and experimentation with collaborations like a\u00a0\u003cem\u003ePC Build Outreach Project\u003c/em\u003e and maybe even creating an \u003cem\u003eactual video game project\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSo there\u0027s my pitch. My plans for the future laid out there for all of you to see. Thanks for at least hearing me out and if you wish to become one of my backers, I thank you. However, even if you don\u0027t wish to back me or don\u0027t have the means to do so, know that it doesn\u0027t make me look at you any other way. I appreciate the interaction and support you have given me by just watching my videos and even liking and commenting on them. \u00a0All of you are the backbone of my channel and it wouldn\u0027t be possible without each and every one of you.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo consider this my leap of faith in showing you how serious I am to bring about change. \u00a0Again, thank you for taking the time to read my entire Patreon and I hope you will consider becoming a backer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLeap Forward My Friends\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
