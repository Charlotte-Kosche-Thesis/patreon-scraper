    "summary": "Welcome to the Garage\u0027s Patreon page you tools!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of the show, you know I\u0027m entering my seventh year of bringing you all the latest news and reviews from the fantasy side of Warhammer by Games Workshop. That\u0027s right, five years of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, and since July of 2015 Warhammer Age of Sigmar twice a month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why run a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis really started because several listeners suggested it. They thought it would be good for the show and after looking into it, there\u0027s potential here to bring the show up to a new level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently the show\u0027s sponsors keep the show running. Their support supplies prizes for our contests and also provides some monetary support and some of the products we cover on the show. This page offers a new way to do things. You the listener can support the show by \"tipping\" per episode. This is really cool because it means that the show gets its support from the people that the show is made for, you the listener. Rest assured, this show always has been and always will be a free podcast, and I appreciate you listening whether you decide to become a patron or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will your support do?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWell, there are three main things I want to be able to do with the show:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, if the show\u0027s primary support becomes the listeners, then they are the ones helping guide the direction of the show. This could help to greatly reduce my dependence on sponsors, even to the point of being able to reduce the number of sponsors and commercials on the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, I\u0027d like to start producing regular segments for YouTube. Of course, this creates a bigger commitment of time and finances, but if the support is there it can happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I\u0027d like to start doing the shows live. So many other shows do it and I think it would be cool to record a show live with listeners and a chat room and all that stuff that goes along with it. I remember tuning in to listen to Podhammer live while it recorded and hearing the \"uncut\" version of the show before it was released to the public a few days later and I have always wanted to do that with Garagehammer. Again, if there\u0027s enough support for this, then it will become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, those aren\u0027t the only things I have rolling around in my head, but they are the big three. In truth, this is just an appeal to the longtime listeners (as well as any noobs) to help me grow the show into something bigger than it\u0027s ever been, you are awesome! Thanks for thinking enough of the show to personally join in and help it grow more than we ever thought it would.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of all, whether you decide to become a patron or not, thank you so much for being a listener, and please accept my sincerest thanks for all of your support every time you download an episode and listen to me share my love of tabletop war gaming (and probably a few of my other fandoms).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
