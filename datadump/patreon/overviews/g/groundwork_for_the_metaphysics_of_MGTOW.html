    "summary": "Throughout history, philosophers have held positions of honor\nas advisers to emperors, presidents, and other powerful and aristocratic men.\nThough today philosophy is considered little more than the intellectual musings\nof select elites, devoid of practical application, such views are but a mere symptom\nof the times, of a consumer driven culture. In truth, the problems that\nphilosophers have grappled with since time immemorial are the same problems\neach one of us grapples with today; ethical conduct, meaning, justice, and\ndeath to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a philosopher. The youTube channel I run is an\nimperative put forward in the 7th book of Plato\u2019s dialogue entitled\nThe Republic \u2013 an imperative that seems to have been forgotten by mainstream academic\nphilosophy. As part of his charge, a philosopher is meant to serve as a guide\nto those seeking answers to life\u2019s toughest questions. This service still exists\nin society but has been broken up among various roles such as psychologist,\nlife coach, linguist, and spiritual leader. However, where each role may serve its\nfunction well, it is only in the philosopher that you find a unity of all these\nfields and more; Philosophy itself being an origin of all these fields; Philosophy\nbeing the origin of culture itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThose who wish to connect with life in a profoundly deep and\npersonal manner ultimately turn to philosophy. Whether you wish to inquire into\nethics, cosmogony, eschatology, art, beauty, virtue, cultural formation, politics,\nhistory, religion, or meaning, you will find yourself engaging with philosophy.\nYet the long debate can be overwhelming to start with due to the sheer\nmagnitude of works and specialized language. It is in helping overcome these\nchallenges that I wish to help you with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo become my patron is to follow in the footsteps of\nAlexander the Great, patron to Aristotle; William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle,\npatron of Thomas Hobbes, and of countless other great and powerful men throughout\nhistory who have seen the value and power of philosophy. It is to practice the\nvirtue of magnanimity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo become my patron is to support that which is the highest\nachievement of the human condition; Philosophy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Marcus\u003cbr\u003e"
