When disaster hit, they left for the stars,\nleaving a magical race of people to defend and cure the mess they\nleft behind.  The Gigans promised to return when the world was\nhealed, causing strong political divisions with the custodial race.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s been over 100 years since the\nGigans have gone, and the island nation of magically endowed people\nare faced with their pressing return.  Plants, animals and insects\nhave since thrived, granting them an enlarged presence on the planet.\n These enlarged and now giant animals, have resulted in \u003cstrong\u003eavianators\u003c/strong\u003e\nwho ride the backs of hawks, and squirrels who are used as pack\nmules.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat will the people on the Island of Geb do?  Will\nthey try to explore the planet, and stop the return of the Gigans? \nWill they prepare it for the return?

After David McRae passed away, Kevin Conner was\nleft with the rights of all aspects of the universe he had created.\nThe dream is to involve readers, families, young fans, as we tell a\nstory of Magical People trying to save the world, and use the money\nthat is raised through sales to donate directly toward education and\nconservation efforts.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat does Non-Profit mean?  Well, it\nmeans we are going to try to help projects, like save the tigers, by\nraising awareness, donating some money from sales, all that good\nstuff!  We want you to participate!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn addition to donating fan artwork\nunder our open ended contracts, you, too, can help name people and\nplaces in the fantasy world of GEB!

In either case, they cannot be your first and last\nname.  We suggest making up a last name suitable for the adventure.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t* We have the right to refuse any\nnames we feel are not keeping with a family friendly atmosphere.\n\u201cBendover\u201d will not be accepted, but \u201cBen\u201d would be.
