Heck yeah, you can! \u00a0Some of the revenue generated here will be used to hire a coder, so we can actually add new features and get things done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we\u0027re proposing here is simple: we would love to help you, the viewer, take money that you either earned or stole, and gave that money to us. \u00a0It\u0027s very straightforward: some of the money that you own, will become money that \u003cstrong\u003ewe \u003c/strong\u003enow own, and in return, we will regularly and consistently provide you with the wonderful, high-quality, well produced videos you\u0027ve grown to know and love, such as the one where I talk about my ass in length for several hours while searching for the Studwells.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would rather not donate to us and instead live your life as a person lacking moral integrity who is loathed by all they encounter, that is your choice and we will completely respect that as you burn in hell for all eternity. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eNon-supporters will still get to eventually see the entire videos we release, but there will be a several day delay before they are released to the public.\u003c/strong\u003e But if you enjoy our videos / podcasts / forums and would like to see more, please consider supporting us, particularly in the form of wealth transfer. \u00a0I don\u0027t want to make any promises I can\u0027t keep, but I\u0027m fairly certain hot women are attracted to Gaming Garbage supporters and they\u0027ll want to do the sex stuff with you a lot except when you\u0027re on the phone because that would be distracting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, help us help you (make your bank account smaller) by supporting our lifelong quest to create a multimedia smorgasbord. Imagine the warm feeling in your heart as you realize you prolonged my inevitable suicide by at least several hours."
