    "summary": "I love so many things: writing and history and recipes and almost everything to do with books. I\u0027m full of bonhomie and love for the universe except... I hate explaining who I am and why I\u0027m in a place. I\u0027d rather tell stories about people and who they are, or analyse culture and history and make sense of why we are here and what we think we\u0027re doing. One of the reasons I\u0027m here is because it\u0027s been suggested to me by so very many people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer and a historian and a bunch of other things. I also have remarkably bad luck in income generation. Whenever I finish a PhD, the bottom falls out of the job market. I have two PhDs and their end-dates coincide precisely with a lack of jobs. I\u0027ve had regular jobs and have a\u00a0 vast array of experience in some rather interesting areas, but I really am a writer and ethnohistorian and teacher. I\u0027m unhappy when I don\u0027t have a novel in progress and am researching and have people to teach and learn from. You\u0027ll see all those things reflected in the perks, as I\u0027ve tried to reflect the desires of my advisers in the perks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of the reason I\u0027m here, then, is because so many people suggested it, and because I had one of those years from hell and the best way to emerge from years from hell is to buckle down and do good work at whatever makes one\u0027s life joyous. Subversive novels and cutting edge research are those things for me. Passing on knowledge and helping people understand, I never forget those. Also chocolate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s more to it than this, of course. It\u0027s not all about me. I used to blog on food history, and write fortnightly articles for BiblioBuffet, and talk about tools for writing and about history on my regular blog. Times have changed. The internet has changed. I write elsewhere and I teach. Not everyone can be in my classes and not everyone can find what I\u0027m writing and, every other day, people ask me questions. Every now and then I have Open Question Time on my blog (like duck season, but for questions) but fans still miss my articles and ideas and so, finally, I have given in and am bringing that side of my life to the public again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t one-sided, therefore. There will be opportunities to suggest topics you want to hear about such as historical food you came across in a book and can\u0027t quite envisage. There will be opportunities to consult with me as a writer, as a historian, as an educator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the complaints about my work is that much of it has drowned in archives, so once a month I will find something very obscure (but fascinating) and restore it to life, just for you. Just to add to the joy, once a month there will be a brand-new essay, also just for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money from\nyour support will go towards my living expenses, developmental stuff and\ntalking with my fans stuff (conventions!), and research materials (which\ninclude some strange things, especially if I\u0027m engaged in food history\nresearch). The idea is to have a more stable income base so that I can do\nbrilliant work in my lonesome garret. (The fact that it is neither lonesome nor\na garret is immaterial.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor me, this Patreon is a wonderful opportunity to match needs. I hope you\nagree \u2013 and become my patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support me, but becoming a patron is too much/too regular/too anything else\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e there are other ways of supporting my work. Buying my books (for yourself,\nfor a friend, for someone you hate) is the best one. I may only get a percentage of what you pay, but I will get the satisfaction of a\ngrowing readership. My ebook can cost less than a cup of coffee, so I\nhaven\u2019t set up a place where you can buy me \u2018cups of coffee\u2019. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like\nto give me money for a cuppa or for anything else as a one-off donation, Paypal\nis both our friends (I track everything I receive through PayPal, so that I can\npay tax, for those who worry about this end of things): \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/GillianPolack\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.me/GillianPolack\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "I have a very specific goal for this summer. The money you give will help me write the novel that I asked readers about earlier in 2017. It\u0027s a contemporary fantasy and the main character is a middle aged female who suffers from chronic illness. The plot will not depend on her being killed, tortured, victimised, or made into someone\u0027s special petal (with them winning for her). This doesn\u0027t mean nasty things won\u0027t happen. It means that she will work out solutions for herself and be the chief protagonist and that yes, she won\u0027t get a miserable ending or even a miserable life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I finish the novel by mid-February (which depends on how much time I can spend on it, which depends on how much money I have for daily expenses, which depends...) then patrons in some categories\u00a0 will receive early drafts of chapters and will have the chance to chat. One of the single biggest problems I\u0027ve discovered in novels that have characters with disabilities is that we don\u0027t share enough information about them, so I will listen to what you have to say and be a part of the conversation and will revise the novel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a page of special acknowledgements for this novel, obviously!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe closer I come to this goal the more basic expenses will be covered. If I get close enough to it then I\u0027ll be able to take some of the time I spend hunting immediate work to pay bills, and use it for creating fiction. How quickly I write varies from novel to novel so I can\u0027t promise a novel in a year, but I can promise to use the money wisely. I will write the best novels I can and (this update to the goal was written after a few months on Patreon) your support will make a big difference to my emotional well-being. Right now, all the money is being saved to give me just a bit more time over summer to write a new novel. \u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "This goal means that I can spend more time working on my new research project. The project is all about the cultural contexts of the narratives we create, and is the natural follow-on from my book \u003cem\u003eHistory and Fiction\u003c/em\u003e. In an ideal world, I\u0027d have two days a week to work on it. This goal gives me a few hours a week, for the world isn\u0027t quite perfect. Right now, I\u0027m doing my research when life permits. Right now, this research is oipening up massive viastas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The cultural contexts of the narratives we create\" sounds theoretical, but it\u0027s anything but. It\u0027s what gives us the background to write and to read. It\u0027s the stuff that brings communities together and tears them apart. Right now, we know quite a bit about some aspects of these things and far less about others. We\u0027re shocked by politics, by violence, by all kinds of things that surround us simply because we don\u0027t understand enough about the stories human beings tell themselves and each other. I wish I could address all of this. What I can do is make it clear how writers and other storytellers create the worlds of their stories and the role the cultural contexts of the stories play in the shape of the tales. It will help.\u003cbr\u003e",
