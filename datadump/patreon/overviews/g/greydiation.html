    "summary": "Hello world! My name is Grey and bicycles have been a core part of my life since 2010. I commute, travel and connect with communities using bikes as a tool for self-empowerment and transportation. Long story short - my life is focused around cycling as a personal, social and environmental practice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduating from university in North Florida in 2017, I set off on a journey from Sweden through Europe and Ireland with everything I owned packed on a bicycle. After surviving a potentially traumatizing crash in October 2016 when I was hit by a car on my bike, I decided I would share my story and raise awareness of bicycling as a mode of transportation. Over the course of seven months on a solo bike tour, I met people all over Europe who were shocked that I, a queer, non-binary womxn, was cycling on my own. I am not the first or last womxn to travel alone on a bicycle. I wanted to know if there were people like me going on adventure cycling tours. When I searched for films or videos about transgender and gender non-conforming cyclists, I couldn\u0027t find any. So I decided that I would create one myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cycling industry has been known to be flooded with sexism and stigmas about who gets to be a \"real\" cyclist. I know there are queer women and gender non-conforming folx who grind gravel and \"shred the patriarchy.\" The world needs an inspiring and accurate representation of the womxn\u0027s adventure cycling community. My voice is their voice, our voice, and I will put my heart and soul into creating a film that shares our vision for bike equity and social equality between all genders and sexes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission to raise awareness of queer, trans* and gender non-conforming cyclists is rooted in a collective movement for social equity and equality. Through the art of visual storytelling, I will bring together a team of passionate cyclists and creators to craft a feature-length documentary focused on exploring the ways in which women, trans* and non-binary folx cultivate community, self-empowerment and social change using bicycles as a mode of transportation to work, travel and connect with people and nature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a queer, non-binary womxn who travels and commutes by bicycle. I believe in the vision of this film because it is my personal experience. This film will be a tool for opening up dialogue about the inequalities in gender, sex, class and race in the cycling industry and dominant social structure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn March 20th, 2018 I will finish my bike tour in Lisbon and move to Brooklyn, NY and begin producing the documentary. In June 2018 I will participate in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wtfbikexplorers.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWTF Bikexplorers Ride Series\u003c/a\u003e and begin documenting the stories of WTF adventure cyclists who are leading radical change in the cycling community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to make this dream a reality, I need your help funding travel expenses, audio equipment and editing software. Please consider becoming a patron and I will share behind-the-scenes footage of the filmmaking process along with special-edition GREYDIATION illustrations and exclusive updates.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also support the project with a one-time donation at\u00a0paypal.me/greydiationdoc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGrey Diation\u00a0\u003cbr\u003egreydiation.com\u003cbr\u003einstagram.com/greydiation"
