    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Gaylerd. I\u2019ve been in the entertainment\nindustry and teaching guitar for over 35 years (as of July 2015). And I\u2019m\nexcited to tell you that with over a million views on my YouTube channel\n(GaylerdGuitar), my fun and exciting song tutorials, guitar lessons and covers\nhave already taught thousands of people how to become the guitar player other\nguys \u003cem\u003ewanna\u003c/em\u003e be. You know, just hearing a really good guitar player can\ncause\u00a0someone to want to learn how to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY MISSON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile my YouTube channel\u0027s mission statement, \"Teaching Guitar, Reaching\nLives\" is simple... my goal is huge. I want to be able to share my gift of music with anyone, anywhere who wants to learn how to play\nguitar... not just those who can afford expensive private lessons. But it costs\na lot of time and money to produce a single tutorial, and I simple need help meeting the financial obligations. That\u0027s why I have turned to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a website that provides an opportunity for\u00a0fans like you to support\nartists like me. In essence, you pledge to donate a small amount for each video\ncreation I release. And since your support will enable me to continue to invest my time into developing and producing FREE videos and in-depth training resources for my GaylerdGuitar YouTube channel, you can be sure I will be grateful for any level of\ngenerosity you are comfortable extending.\u00a0 In return,\nyou\u0027ll receive some cool rewards as my way of saying \"thank you\" for\nyour support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you\u2019ve been blessed financially and would like to help me teach the world\nhow to play guitar, \u003cem\u003eone video at a time\u003c/em\u003e\u2026\n\u003cstrong\u003eplease consider becoming a patron\u003c/strong\u003e.\nTogether we can! But don\u2019t worry, because while I expect to post between 2 to\n4 videos each month, you can put a limit on your support and you can stop\ndonating at any time! So you don\u2019t have to worry about being charged more that\nyou budgeted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut please don\u0027t feel obligated, because regardless of whether you pledge or not, I want to say \u003cem\u003e\"thank you\"\u003c/em\u003e for watching and for sharing\nmy videos!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI appreciate you! - Gaylerd\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
