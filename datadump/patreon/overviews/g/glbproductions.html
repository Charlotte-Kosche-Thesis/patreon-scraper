Over the past four years I have enjoyed getting to know many of you through exchanges in video comments, private messages and on Facebook. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that some of you will consider partnering with me through Patreon, to help me produce the same high quality content more often. At the moment I am only able to produce videos during the parts of the year when I am not teaching at a local polytechnic. Although I love my poly students and my teaching there I would very much like to produce videos on a more regular basis, ideally \u003cstrong\u003eone every two weeks\u003c/strong\u003e.

This is especially true of those who are asking for advice on what microphone/speaker/mixer or amplifier to buy! With more time and resources I will be able to address these queries properly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally I hope to be able to produce more high quality \u003cstrong\u003egear reviews and comparisons\u003c/strong\u003e of different microphones, guitars etc. As I believe in being an independent reviewer, I have to purchase pretty much everything I make videos on. More support from you guys will mean that I am able to release reviews more often!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are pretty much my goals for this account and the YouTube channel going forward.
