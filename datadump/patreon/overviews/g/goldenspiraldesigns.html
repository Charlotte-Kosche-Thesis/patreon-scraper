I\u0027m Caitlin, and this is Golden Spiral Designs. Welcome to my Studio! Thank you for finding my Patreon creator page and coming this far! You must already be an art lover! I love creating art.\u00a0I have been an artist my whole life. Drawing and Painting has been my calling since childhood, and at seven years old, I knew I wanted to be an artist when I grew up. I want to create beautiful things that make people think, and connect us to each other. I find inspiration in many different places, and am constantly seeking more knowledge to incorporate into my art.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eThroughout history patronage of the arts has fed creativity and allowed the most beautiful creations to be realized. I believe the history of art is the history of humanity. And that culture is largely influenced and recorded through art.\u00a0It is because of people like YOU that have helped fill museums and history books! Without YOU, the patron, the Sistine Chapel wouldn\u0027t exist! If this is something you believe in and want to support, this is the place to do it! Joining Golden Spiral Designs on Patreon will allow me to create thought provoking and beautiful art, and contribute to our culture. It will allow me to offer instruction and drop some history as well! And finally, I will be able to continue to do what I love, create more paintings and videos, be an awesome mom, and send my daughter to college!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eMy goal is to share my creative process, and the knowledge and skills that have gotten me where I am. I will be sharing videos of live painting, instruction, and mini art history lessons. I usually release two videos a month, and two live painting sessions/time-lapse. I post my work in progress, and you will get a preview of the finished product BEFORE it goes up for sale!

You can choose how much you would like to contribute and for how long. Different levels of support gain access to different rewards and videos! If you want to go above and beyond to fund an entire piece of art (Oh my goodness, you are amazing), choosing a larger support level will keep me in my studio creating and learning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, That\u0027s the basics. Now is the time to thank you. \u00a0Thank you. I greatly appreciate your financial support. You are allowing the creative culture to grow! You get to be behind the scenes and see how art is made. I know you are a here because you understand the value of art. You get what I am doing here at Golden Spiral Designs, and you think the 100+ hours I put into each painting is worth it.
