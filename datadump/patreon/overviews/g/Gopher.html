However at the end of the day as a job it also has to allow me to make a living for me and my family and that is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube is not the best way to make a living unless you are a super star and worst of all it is very unreliable. Some months are good, some are not so good. So in the end a content creator like myself needs to find alternative ways to keep going. Now there are many such ways and I will be trying them all out, but one way is for my content to be supported directly by you guys. That is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can now support me with a small donation each month if you have the means to do so. But please only do so if you are comfortable with it. You guys support me in many other ways already and this should not be seen as a requirement."
