I am a full-time professional artist, and I have been creating my unique brand of artwork for nearly 25 years now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved drawing animals and creating mythical and fantastic anthropomorphic animal characters. I also have a fascination with the mystical nature of our world, and enjoy creating more esoteric pieces as well. But by far my most favorite subject (personally) is werewolves. I have always been in love with the idea of these cursed creatures of film, folklore, and fantasy, and I indulge my shadow side by drawing my own beastly, snarly version of the werewolf myth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldenwolfen.com/patreon/collage.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use a technique of watercolor and colored pencils to create my works, or I paint detailed acrylic paintings, depending on my mood with the piece. By becoming my Patron, you can see how I create my pieces, go more in-depth into my process, and discover some personal tidbits about myself and my life as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldenwolfen.com/patreon/whypatreon.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI do various shows throughout the year where I sell my art and merchandise from mundane art and gift shows, to Furry conventions, Renaissance festivals, and Comic Cons . I also take commissions for custom artwork, and sell my originals to help bring in money. Additionally I earn a passive income from online sales of prints and merchandise. But it\u0027s hard to be a full-time artist these days, and all of that only keeps my nose above water from month to month. I rely upon Patreon to help bring in additional much needed income. Patreon helps me to be able to keep doing what I am doing, and it\u0027s all thanks to fans and supporters like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now coming up on my 44th birthday, and though I have always been pretty healthy, my age is catching up with me. Health problems are beginning to arise. I need to afford health insurance for myself, and on my current budget that it simply not possible. If I can reach a certain goal on my Patreon, I will be able to use some of that money to get the health insurance I need to help me to live a better, healthier life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I feel that I am a competent artist, but being mostly self-taught I know that I simply do not know enough. I would like to improve my skills, both in how to fully utilize my current mediums, and in my understanding of anatomy, proportions, and especially light. If I get enough support on Patreon, I would be able to take some courses, try new techniques, and dabble in new mediums. All of which I would, of course, share with my wonderful patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldenwolfen.com/patreon/rewards.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you join my exclusive tribe through Patreon, you will get some awesome rewards in return\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccess to my Patron-only Blog:\u003c/strong\u003e I will be posting exclusive looks at works in progress, early looks at new art, thoughts about art and creativity, and interesting tidbits like my favorite art supplies, my work space, and photos from my shows, pictures of my pets.
