Younow has given me the ablity to INSPIRE, ENTERTAIN, EDUCATE and help others ACHIEVE their goals. On this broadcast we have \"The Wall of Success\" On this wall we have written the names down of those who have done something beyond what they felt capable of. With my words of wisdom and knowledge we gave them the tools they needed to go beyond their limitations.

In 2011 I introduced him to Younow back when \u00a0they were still in Beta testing. he told me he really did not feel like it would be for him. I stayed on for a year then left younow to focus full time on Youtube. 5 years later Richard contacted me and told me he became an Ambassador on the site and he was keeping it safe for broadcasters. he then invited me to come back and Join it once more. Best decision of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetty Boosh\u003c/strong\u003e - Would always watch the broadcast and interact constantly with everyone in the community. she one day told everyone that she was sad to say but for several months YouNow had been a distraction and the teachings I talk about clicked with her. she announced on the broadcast that she will peruse a career as a elementary school teacher. She still returns every so often to the broadcast to say hello.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoe (YankeesFan) \u003c/strong\u003e- Had been a smoker for 17 years. Tried to quit once, went for a year and got back in the habit. During one of our broadcasts. He mentioned he wanted to quit. we all held him accountable and had him motivated to stop.

She had gotten a job and with in a week felt like quitting. \u00a0By watching the broadcast daily and seeing people work hard to better them selves and as a result, ACHIEVE their goals, \u00a0it had influenced her to do the same. A couple months later she had revived a raise from work, and held her job for half a year! She was noticed by the management as a \"valuable employee\". Through Skype calls and my money management teachings, she set a goal to go to Chicago for an expensive concert, which she funded all by herself. A couple months later she then achieved another goal of getting the keys to her first apartment. She said \u003cem\u003e\"If\nI never would of come into your broadcast and found what it was like to set\ngoals and achieve them, or want to better myself each and everyday, I\u0027d still\nbe lying around all day doing nothing.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKristinRM22 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e- \u003c/em\u003eKristin was going through a really hard time in life, her parents in the middle of a divorce led to depression. During this time she began watching my daily broadcast which helped her a lot through the constant reinforcement of positivity. Eventually this led to me Skyping with her and giving her an exercise to write down all the things she wanted to do. Going to Paris was one of those things. A bout a month later, An opportunity was presented to her by a family friend. A chance to go to Whales for 7 weeks. It was a big decision, Her parents divorce still in progress, and it meant stepping out of her comfort zone and travel to a far away and new environment. She remembered how I would always encourage people to take action in life and she went for it. While up in Whales, the family decided to travel to Paris for a week! She was able to check one of the things she wanted to do before she dies off her list thanks to the motivation of the Daily broadcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHomeboy - \u003c/strong\u003eA family man, he watched my broadcast daily with his little daughter. He felt inspired and motivated to spread positivity to everyone he met and make a difference in peoples lives as I had done for him. When Texas was hit with Hurricane Harvey he found his opportunity. Though his house was safe and in tack, many others who were less fortunate had taken a lot of damage. Homeboy spend his time helping those victims of the hurricane by clearing out their water logged homes and making food for those who had none. The broadcast had taught him to take action when there are those less fortunate than us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese and many more have benefited from our daily Broadcast on YouNow and YouTube. If you find value in what we have to offer to the world please help and support this cause.
