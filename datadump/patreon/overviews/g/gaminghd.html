    "summary": "We are GamingHD, a Youtube channel dedicated to creating video gaming content that\u0027s both\u00a0entertaining and informative. The main contributors of this channel are Raul Macavei (free999enigma) and Iulian\u00a0Mocanu (Unacomn), both having years of experience in producing video gaming content in an obscure Eastern\u00a0European language they no longer use. The channel has switched to English since March of 2016\u00a0and has been putting out content on almost a daily basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur current line\u00adup of shows covers a wide variety of styles and formats, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Year.Game A Gaming Documentary Series about the evolution of video games from 1967 and to the present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Top 7 A not too serious list show that mostly aims to eschew expectations\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Gaming Culture: A weekly analysis of the various aspects of video games, be it story,\u00a0themes, game design, mechanics, and discussing recent events\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Gaming History: A weekly retrospective of old games. Not really reviews. The aim is\u00a0more to highlight why certain games were important, why they were relevant, why they\u00a0were made, and so one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Indie Dev Life: A show about the life and struggles of indie game developers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022\u00a0Europa Universalis 4 TimeLapse (Discontinued)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Upcoming Games: A rundown of what games will be released in the coming week (Discontinued)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 What are we play in this week?: What are we playing this week is a show that aims to recommend some good games that time may have forgotten (Discontinued)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 And many more\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI highly recommend checking out one of our more obscure shows, analyzing the descent of the\u00a0MMO genre into darkness, for an idea of what actually having time to properly outline a script can\u00a0do for our content.\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFxae_rYuq8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e \u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DFxae_rYuq8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOur aim is to create better and better videos, that delve into the inner workings of the video gaming\u00a0industry, that make people laugh and may actually end up teaching our viewers something new.\u00a0The problem with making content of better quality is that it tends to take a lot of time, which is not\u00a0really something that is sustainable on Youtube in our spare time. To that end, we need your aid.\u00a0By pledging to our Patreon, you will help us create better content. We\u0027ll be able to devote more\u00a0time to creating videos, we\u0027ll be able to afford better equipment and even pay our other\u00a0contributors for their had work. With enough support, we\u0027ll be able to turn this into a full time job\u00a0and create the best content we can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou may be wondering, why support us instead of anyone else making gaming videos on the\u00a0internet? I can\u0027t give you a good answer, mostly because there are a lot of very talented people\u00a0creating content on the internet. We try and give our shows a unique twist and offer different\u00a0perspectives, based on the experience we\u0027ve gained over the years while creating content like this.\u00a0If you like our shows as they are, expect them to get better. If you don\u0027t, we\u0027ll be experimenting\u00a0with new types of shows that you may actually enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e"
