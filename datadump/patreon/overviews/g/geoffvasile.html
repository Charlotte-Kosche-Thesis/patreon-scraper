    "summary": "Hello, internet! I\u0027m the award-nominated creator of the mini-comic Trackrabbit. While my comics have mostly leaned towards fiction over the years, I\u0027ve always had an interest in memoir. Many of my most formative influences made comics that were heavily peppered with their own experience, if not out-right autobiographical. It is in the spirit of cartoonists like Chester Brown, Bob Fingerman, and Julie Doucet that I have started making diary comics. It\u0027s also a good way for me to remain artistically productive while holding down a full-time job in the service industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese comics are about my life, and they are not always pretty. They are a raw portrayal of my efforts to cope with an occasionally soul-crushing job, process my grief for my recently deceased parents, keep making art, and even have sex once in a while, all with mixed results. I can\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019ll always be a likable, relatable protagonist, but I promise to play my own foibles for laughs as often as possible. There will be a lot of stories about hangovers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, there will be at least one free-to-read comic strip a week. Other comics can be unlocked at various rewards tiers, depending, frankly, on how personally compromising the content is. This system may change down the line, and I\u0027m always open to feedback. For now, however, this is the best way for me to reconcile having such confessional work circulating in a public forum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003eWith a little help from my friends and fans, I can keep making these comics. The goal for now is at least three four-panel diary-style comic strips a week. If I can build a large enough following, however, I hope to move onto longer, more ambitious narratives. Along the way, I\u2019ll offer a range of perks for subscribers, including strips that won\u2019t appear anywhere else, a glimpse at sketchbook drawings and preparatory work, zines, and even commissions. I\u2019m a deeply cynical man, but my love for this medium is real and abiding, and I would be honored to share my vision with you, dear reader. Thank you."
