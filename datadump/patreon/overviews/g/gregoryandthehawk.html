Bird and wind and\n other ambient experiences included. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis\n is the closest I can imagine to what I believe is true and fun, and the\n best way to expose these new songs to the light of human \nconsciousness.  Instead of keeping it all in hiding, recording in a \nstudio, and revealing something all at once, I\u0027m asking for your monthly\n pledge to support the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext song release: \u003cem\u003eMy Own Good\u003c/em\u003e (Tuesday, Nov 28, 2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground About My Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been over a year \nsince I started sharing recordings through Patreon. I\u0027ve learned a ton \nabout video editing and have been energized by each new song becoming a \nproject of its own. In May of 2017, I completed the full length outdoor \nalbum I originally set out to make\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e It is called \u003cem\u003eOn The Orange Mountain\u003c/em\u003e and is available exclusively on Patreon.. BUT I loved making the album on this platform so much that I am going to \u003cem\u003ekeep\u003c/em\u003e releasing new songs here with the plan to make a studio album sometime in s/s 2018 (universe willing). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHere are the songs we\u0027ve shared here so far.

Your ongoing \npledge funds travel expenses (like gas for the car, and propane for the\n camp stove, and of course snacks!), and (most importantly) *time* to \ndevote to practice and songwriting.  Your ongoing support means I can \nspend a few days per\n week writing, practicing, and \nediting. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IMPORTANT YOU ARE TO ME! I am so grateful \nto be supported here and I love doing this work with you. so... THANK \nYOU for your subscription. I couldn\u0027t do it alone and I wouldn\u0027t want \nto! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you\n pledge, you will get videos of new songs performed live in the \nwilderness. If you choose the highest level, you will also have access \nto separate quality audio downloads of these performances\n to take with you anywhere, as well as an occasional demo, ringtone, or \nsome exclusive pictures. Thanks so much for listening, and I hope you \nhave fun here! If you have suggestions for rewards or just want to touch\n base, please message me!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
