    "summary": "If you\u0027re a gamer and you like money, keep reading because I\u0027m about to show you a goldmine: the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.g2a.com/r/makemoneywithus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eG2A Goldmine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Honestly, keep in mind that I do make a little cash from this post, I don\u0027t want to mislead you that I\u0027m all nice and friendly, but all the information can still be taken in the same way. Me profiting from this does not change the facts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BsDSZe9.png\" style=\"width: 332px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get into it: So, usually you buy games for say, $60 on Steam. G2A is a company that is able to get those games for super cheap due to their connections and knowledge in the industry. This means that they are able to lower the price to $30-40 a lot of the time and still turn an excellent profit. Happy customer, happy business, no hassle money flowing in for them... Once a company has great prices especially for a market as competitive as CD-keys, the only challenge remaining is to attract customers. Just like any other affiliate program, the G2A Goldmine works by link sharing techniques: everyone gets their own unique customizable link to G2A.com, and when someone signs up under that link, the referrer will receive a tiny bit of commission every time the user purchases something on G2A. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the time, G2A Goldmine gurus promote games via social media and search engine marketing. The trick is: there is no trick. It\u0027s as simple as getting people to register on a website you already use and trust, while making a little bit side income. In fact, some people are making upwards of $500 per month just from people they referred years in advance. They are taking in the benefits of a program such as G2A Goldmine for years. People will always buy video games online, so why not capitalise on it heavily? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be honest, I haven\u0027t even talked about the best part yet. The best part about this program, and how I do it for profits, is (I know this is going to sound bad, but it\u0027s really not) the tiered, pyramidal system put in place. Essentially the way it works: you have tier 1s which are people that you directly referrer to the site via your referral link. If someone in tier 1 purchases a game or anything from the site you\u0027ll receive around 1% commission from it. So if they bought a Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare CD-key you\u0027d receive 1%. Yes, that adds up to a lot if you refer people that buy a lot of games. Yes, that adds up to a lot if you refer a lot of people that buy a lot of games. Simply doing daily things like participating on online forum discussions, Reddit, YouTube comments, making videos or anything of the such can make you a great amount of money. Actually, even popular YouTubers such as PewDiePie have used the method to refer their subscribers for the site for commission. Next is tier two: the people you refer can also refer friends of their own. You make money off that too. This time it\u0027s only 60% as much as you\u0027d make if you referred them yourself, but it\u0027s still 100% more than if you aren\u0027t supposed to receive anything. This is crazy if you think about it. If you manage to refer some workaholic that wants to put in hours and hours and hours into the program, they can make you a killing. All you did in this situation is be the person at the right place at the right time. If you use this method, you are being the right person at the right place at the right time. \"But wait, that\u0027s not all!\" is right, that\u0027s not all. By the way, make sure to \u003ca href=\"https://www.g2a.com/r/termsofservice\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eread their Terms of Service\u003c/a\u003e before promoting links so you don\u0027t do something disallowed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YmMdpe0.png\" style=\"width: 413px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a tier 3 system put in place as well, which gives you 40% of what you\u0027d make from tier 1. Why is this even better? Well.. as you move from the top of the pyramid (you) to the bottom of the pyramid, it gets bigger. It gets a lot bigger. Think about it like the food chain: for every eagle at the top of the food chain there are billions of bacteria at the bottom of the chain. Of course I\u0027m exaggerating, but potentially you could be the one person that refers the billion people and capitalised immensely from it. Why wouldn\u0027t you want that opportunity to be the gaming affiliate kingpin?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo because I\u0027m expecting you to \u003ca href=\"https://www.g2a.com/r/makemoneywithus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eregister today\u003c/a\u003e and start promoting to others, whether you want to promote games on sale or promote the same thing I\u0027m doing...I\u0027ll show you a few methods I\u0027ve personally used to make the best out of this method. I\u0027ll also show what the industry standard is so others can also give you an idea of what works and what doesn\u0027t for making the ultimate passive income source from G2A.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst: like I said, just continue with your ritual internet activities. If you\u0027re a gamer, chances are that you probably visit some sort of gaming communities whether it be Reddit, forums, YouTube video comment sections and even Facebook groups. Wait a second... Can\u0027t I just spam all of these with my link and bring in stack$? Well, the truth is, yes you can. But I wouldn\u0027t recommend it. The way I\u0027d do it if you want to go the spamming route is just to try to get your link into as many people\u0027s browser as possible. Why do that? The G2A site places a cookie upon every visitors computer that lasts for 2 years after visitation. This means that if someone clicked your link now and they really don\u0027t want to register to G2A, that\u0027s ok. If they come back after, say, 8 months, you\u0027ll still get the referral credit when they sign-up. This is a nice twist that they\u0027ve decided to implement that makes G2A Goldmine that much appealing. If you decide to go the spamming route, just find the place with the most visitors at the time and hope that they click your link, and within those two years they will sign up. The best place to do this would be a popular subreddit on peak time of the week: the most people are visiting so you\u0027ll get the maximum amount of visitors. Or you could comment on popular YouTube videos as soon as they\u0027re posted so you can get max exposure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond: promote directly to friends. This isn\u0027t multi-level-marketing, it\u0027s simply a three tiered system. It works better than all other programs like this because the company isn\u0027t lying to you: they can actually afford to pay every affiliate out because of their strict three tier system. It\u0027s pocket change what you\u0027re making off the tier 3s unless you know what you\u0027re doing. This is exactly why explaining to friends is super important: tell your friends how to market G2A to their friends and you\u0027ll be assured that you make money. Why? Well, if you\u0027re showing your friends that it\u0027s possible to make money from gaming, then they\u0027ll want to do it as well. If their tier 2s make money, you\u0027ll make money too. You can see that the best way to get someone to do something for you is by being upfront and personal with them. Don\u0027t ask for a favour. Offer them an opportunity and then get them to sign up on your link. It\u0027s a win win situation: they sign up and make money, they sign up and you make money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird: use your authority. Be creative. I\u0027m sure you and everyone else reading this is an authority in some field. Some people own YouTube channels. Some people are popular on forums or moderate Reddit subreddits. Others simply have a lot of friends. Use your creativity to get sign ups. On forums you can set your signature to a link of your G2A referral link if you post a lot. Think about it: if you have 10,000 posts on a forum that is 10,000 different places where your link is being shown. If you are a video maker you can put the link of G2A in your video descriptions. If you have videos getting 100,000 views a month, that\u0027s 100,000 people viewing your link. Even if only 1000 click on it, it\u0027s a massive number of traffic to a targeted page, meaning profit for you. Everyone clicking your link will want to buy games or make money themselves. Another massive bonus to this program is the duration... \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.g2a.com/r/regulations\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhen someone clicks your link, a cookie gets placed into their browser\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e But wait, what does this mean? This means that every time the user goes back to the G2A website, the aforementioned cookie gets activated and if they sign up they will be under your referral. This is extremely useful as this cookie lasts for 2 years. That\u0027s right, two years from the moment the person clicks your link to the registration date. If someone clicks your link and doesn\u0027t register, but finds a good deal a year after and then registers, you would still get paid just as you would if they registered on the first day. This is the definition of passive income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/U6up1vP.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf even after all of this you haven\u0027t the slightest idea how to promote, it may help you to get official \u003ca href=\"https://www.g2a.com/r/regulations\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eG2A Goldmine Tips\u003c/a\u003e from their own page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t miss this opportunity and \u003ca href=\"https://www.g2a.com/r/makemoneywithus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eregister for G2A Goldmine\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIgnore this:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 g2a goldmine tips\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 g2a goldmine review\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 g2a goldmine legit\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 g2a goldmine earnings\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 g2a payout\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 g2a referral link\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 g2a goldmine reddit\u003cbr\u003e"
