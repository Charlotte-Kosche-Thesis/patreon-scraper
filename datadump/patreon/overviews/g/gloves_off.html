    "summary": "First off I wanna say thanks to my YouTube followers for all of their support! You guys watching my videos and commenting and the positive support has been amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently hit 2000 subscribers, and with so many people following my latest videos with excitement for each new video coming out, I\u0027ve decided I want to try something new - Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a ton of fun playing games and making videos of various game playthroughs, and can continue to do so thanks to the support of my viewers! You can look forward to playthroughs and reviews of classic games, some niche titles, and overall mostly older games for the PC, and NES/SNES consoles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started my YouTube channel I used free software, a crappy headset mic, and talked while I played games, giving a very \"live\" effect to my games. As the channel grew, I was able to pick up better hardware like my new microphone, and actually good editing software. It\u0027s certainly slow going though, and frankly YouTube has made it very difficult for me to even receive the money I earn through YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027d like to provide an option for my followers; you can now support me through Patreon, and in doing so, save yourself from having to watch ads on the YouTubes! Once I have a few supporters on here, I will remove ads from ALL of my videos. I\u0027ve never liked having ads on my channel in the first place, and with Patreon I may be able to support the channel while removing the ads from the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all is of course up to you, the viewers! If you like what I do and want not to see ads any more, consider supporting me here on Patreon! I\u0027ll be looking at different ways to make it fun and interactive as time goes on. And who knows, with your support I may even put out more than one video a month! :P"
