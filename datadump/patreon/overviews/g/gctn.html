    "summary": "Greetings and salutations! I\u2019m Michael T. Hansen. I created, run, and fund the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gctnetwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGreat Commission Transmission Network\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may know me from such podcasts as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fcc.gctnetwork.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFinding Christ In Cinema\u003c/a\u003e and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://secretfirepodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSecret Fire Podcast\u003c/a\u003e. This is my Patreon account where you have the opportunity to become my patron - or patronus! How\u2019s that for a Harry Potter reference? This really is like the Patronage society that ruled the ancient Roman social structure - which, by the way, is a fascinating study, and has echoes throughout the New Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, your grace - as they would say in ancient Rome - will allow me to continue devoting myself to running and funding the GCTNetwork including: producing podcasts, radio shows, videos, and other teaching materials. And, frankly, it will help me to put food on the table and feed my family. Proper nutrition really goes a long way in giving a person the cowboy energy one needs in order to produce content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdded bonus: It will help me to be a patron to my co-hosts, my co-laborers. Of course, one of them \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003emy son\u003c/em\u003e. In return for your support you just might experience a warm, fuzzy feeling in your inner-most heart of hearts. And that is the possibly the greatest benefit to you for your patronage. However, there may be additional perks of being a Patreon supporter. I\u2019m thinking of possible behind the scenes video, Q\u0026amp;A sessions, sneak peeks at new shows and content, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor extra fun I\u0027ve described each level of support using fictitious food, because everyone can relate to food. Any amount that you can commit to each month is very much appreciated and will give each of you - no matter the amount - access to \u003cem\u003eany and all\u003c/em\u003e of those special perks that I mentioned. Why? Because any amount \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e support and will help me to continue doing what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, may the Lord bless you, and keep you; and thank you in advance for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
