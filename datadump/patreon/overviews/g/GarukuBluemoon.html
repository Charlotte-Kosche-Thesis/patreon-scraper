    "summary": "Hello! I am Garuku Bluemoon and go by Gar for short. I am a content creator on YouTube and Twitch, always aiming to brighten the day of my audience. I have and will continue to raise awareness of mental illness as well as offering advice to anyone who approaches me in Discord, using knowledge from my studies in psychology and personal experience with PTSD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the YouTube algorithm changing to now kill gaming channels due to \"violence\" or silence profanity that I and my friends use for the sake of comedy, I\u0027m now at risk of getting my work getting demonetized. This patreon is simply something I can fall back on and will gladly close it should YouTube ever change back to the way it was prior but it isn\u0027t looking likely and I\u0027ve been holding on since the adpocolypse. However, I NEVER want anyone to feel like they need to donate towards me, any money sent my way will go back towards the channel as I hope to continue upgrading my rig and acquire new software to produce higher quality content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point in time I have no planned reward for patrons outside of making more community days where the audience and I can play a game together during streams as I don\u0027t want to exclude portions of the community but I\u0027d still like to personally thank anyone willing to support the channel. I aim to have at least one community stream a week once I move to my new apartment and excited for the freedoms I\u0027ll have so I can spend more time with my community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for watching my content and supporting me. I have never felt so fulfilled knowing there are amazing people like you who enjoy my videos and live streams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
