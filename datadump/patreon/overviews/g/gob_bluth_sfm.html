I have a neat followership, \nbut it\u0027s not the largest, and still growing, so just for that reason I \nwouldn\u0027t want to end up blocking significant parts of what I create for \nnon-patrons. Especially considering that the lengthy animations take a \nlot of time, and if I was to reserve some of them to patrons, that could\n mean even longer time between anything for my regular followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven if one thought of it as that, I\u0027d think that would not be a good \n\u0027business model\u0027. And that\u0027s the one thing I want to be open about right\n away: I do \n\u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e intend on making these animations a business. I \nwork on them because it keeps being fun to make them. There seem to be a\n few generous people out there that would like to support me doing what I\n do, and this platform is meant to provide them with that possibility, \nwhich I\u0027d greatly appreciate. :) But I don\u0027t want anyone expecting to be\n buying additional content or services.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \n Well, that\u0027s about as much of a terrible salesman as I can be on one \nday. If these lengthy sentences haven\u0027t convinced you to not support me \nafter all, I really, really appreciate every one that decides to reward \nme for having created something you enjoyed, and it makes the many hours\n spent seem a lot less wasted when things look down. So - thank you, to \nall of you. :)\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t- \u003cem\u003eGob Bluth SFM\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePS:\u003c/strong\u003e As of October 2016, Patreon asks for adult content to be viewable for Patreons only, so I do have to comply with that.
