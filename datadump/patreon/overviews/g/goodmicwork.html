    "summary": "Hi! \u00a0I\u0027m Greg Morgan, host of GoodMicWork Commentaries. \u00a0Nice to meet you!\u00a0 I am a 40-something Detroit native currently living a relaxed, happy life in San Diego, California. \u00a0I\u0027ve been a fan of wrestling for a long time. \u00a0Like, a REALLY long time. \u00a0Laid eyes on my first wrestling match somewhere around 1978 or 1979 and have been hooked ever since. \u00a0I grew up mostly on WWE and NWA but had the opportunity to watch a lot of AWA programming as well. Wrestling was life for me, and for a while, it was an obsession. \u00a0As a former tape trader and super-smark-crazy-fangirl I have a pretty impressive database of wrestling facts and opinions ricocheting around inside my skull. \u00a0So I decided to start a YouTube channel in 2010 as a way to let them out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel started out as a hobby. \u00a0Infrequent and crap quality.\u00a0 For some reason, I was able to strike a chord with some of you and slowly started to gain an audience.\u00a0 My initial \"rants\" were what got the ball rolling on my popularity but after a couple of years I decided to go a more \"fan friendly/professional\" route as it is a much better representation of who I really am.\u00a0 I\u0027m currently hovering just under 20K subscribers on YouTube and have evolved my videos into consistent weekly content which also doubles as a podcast.\u00a0 Aside from live streams I don\u0027t appear on camera. So my commentary style allows me to tackle an audience from multiple directions by being a hybrid of a YouTube show AND a podcast.\u003cbr\u003eWhile YouTube is my main platform, you can also find my shows on my website\u003cstrong\u003e goodmicworkcommentaries.com\u003c/strong\u003e as well as Itunes and Stitcher Radio. \u00a0 Aside from my weekly commentaries I also upload Q\u0026amp;As, PPV \u0026amp; DVD reviews, This Day in History, and Top 10 videos. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the personal expense I pay for these services, I have set up this Patreon account to help with the costs and the continued success of my commentaries. \u00a0My content will ALWAYS be free. You are under ZERO obligation to support me. \u00a0However, the more patrons I have the more frequently I will be able to produce content....and who knows....maybe with your help I can make this a full-time gig one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I have been creating YouTube videos discussing countless topics on wrestling since 2010. \u00a0It\u0027s safe to say I offer a unique, yet casual perspective on the business without taking myself or the product too seriously. \u00a0I also recently launced a website and made my commentaries available for download in podcast form on my website and Itunes and Stitcher Radio as well. \u00a0My fans are the best, constantly demanding more expansion and content. \u00a0It was all of you that convinced me to expand, and Patreon can help assure my content will always be here. \u00a0I appreciate your support whether you donate or not. You\u0027re all awesome.",
