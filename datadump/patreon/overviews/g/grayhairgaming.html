That\u0027s you crazy, awesome people who watch my content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to take Gray Hair Gaming as far as we, as a community, can take it. This isn\u0027t just about me. It\u0027s about all of my viewers, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patron will not only inspire me to keep putting in the hours necessary to create engaging content you love, but provide in other meaningful ways:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ehelp me buy new games to do more content that you\u0027ll love\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eallow me to upgrade equipment (real studio lights, a better camera so I can record full 1080p with the facecam, a non-squeaky chair, building an ergonomic desk, upgrading my PC)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehelp me provide for my family, since I\u0027m the only income, and do fun things like taking my wife out on the occasional date, paying for my son\u0027s soccer league fees (my daughter isn\u0027t old enough yet, don\u0027t worry we\u0027ll get her in the mix!), and replacing a water heater\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I\u0027d also like to somehow integrate giving to really cool charities as part of this community. I haven\u0027t figured out just how to do this yet, but it\u0027s an idea I\u0027m thinking on.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will never provide Patreon-only content. I know I have viewers out there that would gladly become a Patron, but can\u0027t because of their personal situation. Those same viewers might watch every video I put out, and watch every pre-roll ad. They might be the most loyal community members I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ll never keep content from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got two basic tiers of rewards. The first tier is massively appreciated and is essentially a thank you for creating content you enjoy. The higher level is going above and beyond, and thus, I\u0027ll use your name or username or whatever you prefer in upcoming content (naming heroes after you in Darkest Dungeon or soldiers in XCom 2, as an example).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, thanks for watching, and thanks for being part of one of the best communities on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
