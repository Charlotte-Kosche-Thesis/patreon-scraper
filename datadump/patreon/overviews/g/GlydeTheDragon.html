My dream has always been to become a games developer and to release my own adventure game one day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast few months I have spent creating this:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orPVJ-WWVAQ\u0026amp;t=1s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orPVJ-WWVAQ\u0026amp;t=1s\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project was something that I have started for fun to improve and develop my skills of using Unreal Engine 4. The video got insanely popular on facebook and all the feedback and demand for the Spyro remake was so astounding and motivating, that i have decided to do something I have always dreamed about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to create an original game that will be heavily based and influenced by original Spyro the dragon trilogy. A true classic adventure 3D platformer that we no longer are getting these days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little overview\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGlyde is going to be a current gen 3D adventure game hugely influenced by original Spyro the dragon trilogy. Glyde will feature similar core game play to previously mentioned games, as well as its own twists and original ideas to the certain extent.\u00a0While many things are still to be established and they are in planning stage and a subject to change, here are some features that you can expect to see:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Complete levels to unlock new locations and hub levels.\u003cbr\u003e- World of Geoda (or Geode) being a home to many different species as well as different breeds of dragons that you will be able to encounter.\u003cbr\u003e- Beautiful and colorful levels filled with collectibles and stuff to do and explore.\u003cbr\u003e- Levels where you will have to utilize your jumping, running, gliding and combat skills to reach the end of the level. \u003cbr\u003e- Free flight zones where you will be able to freely control the movement of Glyde in the air\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you be helping with?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe whole purpose of this Patreon, is to give people interested in my project the way to support the development directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing the only person who is working on the game, I must currently do everything by myself, modeling, texturing, animation, rigging, UV mapping, programming, designing and more... All that comes on top of studying at University and working part time to be able to afford bills etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for now, the game is being developed in my free time and i do everything the best to my ability to make as much progress as i can. Financial support of even 1$ a month from 40 people could easily allow me to buy a 40$ worth of assets to use for the game. This would greatly reduce the time of development and improve the overall quality of the demo and the final game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy promise and your understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy promise\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIt is important to mention, that the project is a huge dream of mine, I will do everything to the best of my ability to succeed and finish the project. While i cannot promise the final product to be released, I can promise at least a demo or even multiple demos to be released during this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you need to understand.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBefore you donate anything, there is something very important to mention. Please, remember that this is only me developing this game, it is a incredibly difficult task for a single person, and while i will do what i can to succeed, i cannot guarantee the positive outcome of this project. It might be that the final product will never be released, that i will be forced to stop the project for various reasons etc. Any kind of money that you donate, will be spent on development of the game. However in the event of project failing, I will not be able to refund anyone any amount of money, as the money will be spent on assets etc. You must know that all your donations are purely out of a good will and they are made in support of me and the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFew final words!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFinally, to wrap this up, I would like to thank you for your time and reading everything! Whether you decide to support me and Glyde or not, I really hope that you can join my discord server here to stay updated and be in contact with me directly: \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/ASwm9GU\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/ASwm9GU\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIf you decide to support me as a person , take a look at rewards on the right hand side to see what you can get as a thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHuge thank you again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Martin (Valefor)\u003cbr\u003e"
