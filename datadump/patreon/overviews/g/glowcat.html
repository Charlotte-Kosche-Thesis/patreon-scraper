She falls onto hard times, good adventures, bad relationships and forges strong relationships. She struggles and tries to make it through the searing fires. Brick Port, the anchoring town of the tale, is loosely based off the dichotomy of rural and urban \nPortland, Maine. As the story flows it will encompass most of the world. There is unrest in the reality that Brick Port exists in. The tale is told through a lens of steampunk and anthromorphic \ncharacterization. This comic is full of highly detailed art with a good, gritty, steamy feeling to it.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eBrick Port Dogs\u003c/em\u003e\" is a webcomic with big dreams of becoming a graphic novel. Follow Victoria as she struggles against the tide, is then drawn into an abusive relationship then learns her strength and to discover adventures and meet friends. This story does not follow a typical love story line. Victoria is not perfect. She makes mistakes, she has weak times, she tries to escape, dream up new realities, and go on adventures, all in her own idiosyncratic way. \"\u003cem\u003eBrick Port Dogs\u003c/em\u003e\" is unique in the way it takes inspiration from the real world, Steampunk, Lackadaisy cats, and generally gritty and magical places. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVictoria, nicknamed \"She-Wolf\", is a earnest young artist. She works hard but in the beginning is quickly worn out by pushing against an unseen wall. It\u0027s apparent she\u0027s unknowingly trodden over someone\u0027s line by moving to Brick Port. She\u0027s got all the aspirations the drive and heart, but none of the luck (at least with commerce). She\u0027s strong and bull headed, tempered by being sweet as pie. Which is what lands her in some hot water when those with no conscience come knocking at the door. Victoria was blessed with resilience and tenacity though, and just as her sweet nature allows folks to misuse her, it also brings in a lot of good friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eB.P.D. is Elisabeth\u0027s way of working through some emotional trauma heaped up by living. She\u0027s from a childhood home filled with domestic violence, then a latch-key independent life from the time she was 15. She put herself through college, and found her own way with the help of friends. She\u0027s been in and out of a very abusive personal relationship. Through a lot of self-work and guidance she\u0027s found her inner stability and is now trying to put it down in a creative way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElisabeth is a tattoo artist and sometime freelance artist. She\u0027s... not normal. She insists she\u0027s never going to become a cat lady, but no one really believes that. Top on her list of things to do is backpack in the White Mountains (even though she\u0027s done this many times already). Going deep into the woods is how she finds balance, it works out that it\u0027s also doctor prescribed. She loves her career as a tattooist, and works in Manchester, New Hampshire. Elisabeth did the college thing, and as a result has two BA\u0027s in art and a minor in the same discipline, as well as all the debt from college she can\u0027t pay off. \u00a0She has a few pipe-dreams, no student debt, a master\u0027s degree, a big beautiful glass domed yurt in the woods... She has a physical disability that prevents her from working a \u0027regular\u0027 job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You want to Fund This!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou like visual storytelling. \u003cbr\u003eYou happen to really enjoy the art of Brick Port Dogs.\u003cbr\u003eYou would like to see it updated more often.\u003cbr\u003eYou really enjoy a curvy, imaginative, whimsical story.\u003cbr\u003e You really like the warm fuzzy feeling of helping artists directly in a world that is becoming harder to be an artist in.\u003cbr\u003eYou want to see B.P.D. in higher frequency. \u003cbr\u003eYou know this artist truly appreciates and feels your generosity and will do her best to earn it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the financial support of readers Elisabeth will be able to devote more of her time to the comic. With enough financial support she\u0027d set aside one to two days a week toward the comic. As of now, there is not enough support.
