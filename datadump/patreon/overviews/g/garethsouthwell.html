In my case, if enough people make small gestures of support (which can be as little as around $1 per month - or whatever that is in GB pounds or Euros - see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://xe.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e for current exchange rates),\u00a0I\u0027ll be freed up from mundane, bill-paying work to devote my time to \u003cem\u003eThe Illustrated Book Club\u003c/em\u003e. Money is collected at the end of the month, but the arrangement is flexible - you can cancel or alter your pledge at any time - and there are different levels of support that entitle patrons to exclusive rewards (listed on the right), and you can upgrade/downgrade at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the moment, I\u0027m asking for pledges\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePER\u00a0FINISHED ARTWORK\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- usually, two per book: the finished traditional part (the artwork) and the Photoshopped bit (the design - like the examples above). I charge per work, as opposed to monthly, because\u00a0you only pay for what I upload - if I\u0027m busy with my day job, that might be nothing, so you pay nothing. On the other hand, if I\u0027m very productive, and I upload a lot, you can still cap your pledge at a total number of times you\u0027re comfortable with (once, twice, etc) so that you don\u0027t pay more than you want to. Generally, there are two paid posts per book (both public, for everyone to see), and we cover one or two books per month. However, not all posts are paid posts, and as a patron you\u0027ll get exclusive access to all this free stuff (which non-patrons won\u0027t). If you don\u0027t want to commit to a monthly amount, you can even make a one-off or occaional pledge of support by simply cancelling after one or two months, and you can stop and restart things as often as you like - it\u0027s all flexible, and as everything is done through Paypal, it\u0027s also perfectly safe.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tYou can find out more about me and see more of my work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://garethsouthwell.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0If you have any questions about anything (e.g. about how it works, suggestions for rewards not listed - whatever), then please contact me through this page,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/garethsouthwell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://garethsouthwell.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tGareth Southwell.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
