    "summary": "Garbage Productions began with a comedy\nduo: Ryan LaPlante and Tyler Hewitt. We both love garbage movies, so we got\nsome microphones, brought along a team of our comedian friends, and launched\n\"Garbage Town the Podcast\" in the spring of 2016. Since then we\u0027ve done\nepisodes on more than 50 horrible movies and given you detailed (and bonkers) reviews of each of them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow we\u0027re expanding the Garbage-verse with a second podcast: \"Dumb-Dumbs\n\u0026amp; Dragons\". This show will include two new regular voices: Tom McGee\n(our amazing dungeon master), and Laura Elizabeth (our incredible fourth\nco-host). DD\u0026amp;D will be a show where you join a group of comedians playing\nDungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, most of whom have never played before. It\u0027s an\nirreverent celebration of the glories of roleplaying games and the fantasy\ngenre. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut most importantly... WE COULDN\u0027T DO ANY OF IT WITHOUT YOU AWESOME HUMANS.\nWe\u0027ve had the support of some amazing Garbage Town-ers, and the reactions we\u0027ve\nhad from the D\u0026amp;D community (even in advance of the podcast dropping) has\nbeen fantastic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWHY ARE WE DOING A PATREON?  Because we know you hate ads. Everybody does.\nWe want to keep creating awesome content, and offering it to you without\ncensorship and without dropping a speech about lootcrate in every fifteen\nminutes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, we know that if you like these shows, you\u0027re already a part of our team. So\nwe want to make your involvement even more direct. With our rewards you\u0027ll be\nable to find out more about the shows, more about us, more about our guests, and you\u0027ll\nbe able to help pick the films we review, name the characters and items we find\nin DD\u0026amp;D, and make this whole process more fun for us and (hopefully) for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo come on down to Garbage Town, roll a d20 with DD\u0026amp;D, and welcome to\nGarbage Productions. We\u0027re so glad to have you on board.\u003cbr\u003e"
