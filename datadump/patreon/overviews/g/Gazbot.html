    "summary": "If you can afford it, and if you like my videos and/or my art stuff, then your support will allow me to commit more time to these personal creative endeavors. I will be able to continue to turn down low-paying and/or creatively bankrupt jobs. This will give me more time and enthusiasm for creating things that I actually care about and feel passionately about, which will result in more genuine, better quality and more original work, that other people, (hopefully), will also enjoy. When I get likes, views, and comments, I am encouraged and get charged up to create more, to create better, to put out more content faster. Actual cash donations = the Super Hyper mode of that same concept. Additionally, While I am not charging for my general content, any donation level gains you access to occasional Patreon only bonus content. Whether you choose to donate or not, thanks for looking! I hope you enjoy my videos and other artwork, maybe subscribe, and/or throw me a like or share if you do. I may add more goals and perks as time goes on. If you have any feedback or suggestions how to make my content better or more engaging to you, feel free to share them.\u00a0"
