    "summary": "Hello, my name is\nGeorge Kingsnorth. I am a filmmaker with 30 years experience working\nin television and  video production. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last 15\nyears, I\u0027ve been working with students helping them to create their\nown projects and I\u0027m now the point where I\u0027m starting to work with\nfellow colleagues to develop my own projects. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFans of our work can\npay a monthly payment to help fund the work we share with them\nthrough patriot. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the\ndocumentaries that we recently made was called \u2018Higher Quality of\nDisagreement\u2019, and we showed the film to the target audience and\ngot feedback from them that helped us to reshape the work and develop\nit into something far better. A lot of what I love about working with\nother filmmakers is that we can bounce ideas around and start to see\nopportunities and possibilities that, on our own,  we wouldn\u0027t be\nable to do. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of my career\nhas been as an editor, so I\u0027ve been working with a range of different\nsoftware packages. I can help you with a little issues you may have.\nSo as part of the reward, what I\u0027m offering is that if someone has a\nproblem I can help them through producing a quick video tutorial.\nAnother award is through using Skype I can help to mentor you to help\nyou develop your own ideas and establish where you want to go with\nyour projects. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe live in a world\nthat is constantly wanting us to do more and get less but quite often\nif you are allowed time to develop you can actually generate far\nricher materials. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to do with the films that\nI\u0027m making, is to allow people to to breathe effectively and be more\ncreative.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks for watching\nthis video and I hope that you\u2019ll support us, through Patreon, so\nthat we can achieve our goals which is really to be constantly\nfull-time filmmaking and providing you with rich content for you to\nwatch and enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m passion is storytelling using video and animation. My career spans over 30 years, working in a wide range of areas associated with video production and editing. I\u0027ve also designed and managed courses in further and higher education institutes, teaching over 2,000 students face-to-face, and now have nearly 15,000 on-line students enrolled in my courses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI enjoy challenges, leading me to producing and directing micro budget feature films, numerous short film dramas and documentaries. My students have inspired me to continuously develop my craft in digital filmmaking and 3D digital art. I have helped clients in Georgia, North Carolina, England, Wales and both sides of the Irish boarder to realise projects using video and in print form. I am inquisitive and love discovering something new. Over the last 4 years I have learnt to play the violin, exploring Irish Traditional Music and other genres.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnimation has always fascinated me, every since, as a 4 year old, I walked with my sister and mum to a cinema 4 miles from home to see \u0027Lady and the Tramp\u0027. And over the next semester, I will be teaching 2D and 3D animation in class once more. So what I learn and develop with my students I hope to share here also.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no idea where this will all lead but I am excited in taking my first steps along this new journey. I hope you will join me?\u00a0",
