    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eGamersForLife is a new studio that has not yet been made , but is intended to be a studio company in years to come. Currently a community of game developers and  3d modelists and artists and musicians but we are still growing and need more members. Main Game currently being worked on is Called The Blue Dragon(Survival Games). I will post More Details and gameplay videos and pictures soon, Still in development. I have currently Started Unreal Game Engine and the progress is coming much faster , results will show within the next week ty for patience....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGame on delay-Infinity Realms , which is a MMO style game where you can do anything you want and implant ideas from our community because this game will have more then just one game within it. Such as If you get bored of playing dungeons and pvp matches, or just combat in general so you might want to go party at your house you built or at some random spot you explored in the world. Or if that don\u0027t do well you can go racing or enjoy some cooking mini-games, mining, blacksmithing etc.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen it comes to crafting it wont be just about collecting items and You just watch some boring loading bar as you make it, I want you to have fun in doing it , so if you cook we will actually have a mini-game where you click and drag ingredients you collected into a bowl of soup and have to click and rotate it to stir, in other words something that\u0027s more interactive then some dumb crafting load bar. There will be many more things to add, but this is a very big long term project so It is going to be updated constantly, so if you like custom created Players and multiple forms of gameplay this might be the game for you. We will have arcade games that you can play within the game when added as interactive items in the arcade that you will find in the main cities. Donators  will get a free interactive house item of your choice between the arcade games to add it in your houses that you are building in Infinity Realms, therefore you can play the game from your house and not have to run to the main city.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Right now I\u0027m working on arcade games that you can play within the game when added as interactive items in the arcade that you will find in the main cities. Each game will be $1-$5 to play Until added to Infinity Realms then they will be free, those who buy these games will get a free interactive house item of that game you bought to add it in your houses that you are building in Infinity Realms, therefore you can play the game from your house and not have to run to the main city. If you don\u0027t want to Play IR don\u0027t worry the arcade games I will still keep up for separate downloads , they just will be marked for free and the offer for the free in-game house object will be expired.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
