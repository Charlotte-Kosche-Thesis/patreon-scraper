    "summary": "I\u0027m trying to get free, y\u0027all. What are you up to?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince you\u0027re here (hi! hello! welcome!) I\u0027m hopeful that that\u0027s what you want as well. Because none of us are free until all of us are. One by one I will break the links on the chains binding me. I invite you to join, to watch and learn, to ask questions, to break your own links.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can do this together. We can learn, grow, and get free together. I\u0027m opening up my thoughts and my process here and inviting you to come on this journey with me. It will definitely be messy. It may be painful. But it will be a journey into truth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who the hell am I? My name is Graeme Seabrook and I am a Certified Motherhood Life Coach. I work with those who mother to create lives that work for them. My focus is on those who mother because that label (Mother, Mom, Mama, Mommy) comes with it so many restrictions and assumptions that are, quite literally, killing us. Exhaustion, mental illness, emotional and physical stress, these are all things that those who mother are assumed to be able to handle - it is the price we pay. And the reward is a healthy baby or child. This is supposed to be enough. This is supposed to balance the scales for a lifetime of sacrifice and erasure. Actually - we aren\u0027t even allowed to recognize that scales exist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to talk about the scales and find the balance - you\u0027re in the right place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also the daughter of a biracial woman (Cape Verde and white) and a black man. I am the mother of two biracial children. I reject the myth of white ignorance and fragility when it comes to ending white supremacy. White people were collectively able to colonize, enslave, and torture most of the globe - you can figure out how to stop.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to talk about why multiracial children won\u0027t save the world and what white women need to do to burn down white supremacy - you\u0027re in the right place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a self-care evangelist. The most important relationship we will ever have is the one we have with ourselves. We must know ourselves to understand how to care for ourselves. We all know that \"hurt people, hurt people\" and I firmly believe that healed people can heal people. This isn\u0027t about mani/pedis\u00a0or massages - this is about true, radical self-care that can heal people and communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to talk about self-realization and education and how we can each contribute to the growth of those around us - you\u0027re in the right place.\u00a0"
