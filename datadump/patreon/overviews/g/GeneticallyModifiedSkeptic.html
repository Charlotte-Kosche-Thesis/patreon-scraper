    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, everyone! My name is Drew McCoy (a.k.a. Genetically Modified Skeptic) and I create videos discussing atheism, criticizing alternative medicine, promoting healthy skepticism, and encouraging positive discourse in the skeptic/atheist community. I\u0027m an aspiring activist for the promotion of secularism, critical thinking, science education, and egalitarianism, and am hoping to gain enough momentum on YouTube to launch a career and make a change in the world around me. I come from a family of religious fundamentalists who double as professional purveyors of alternative medicine. Because of this, I feel the need for change in my society every day, and I hope you\u0027ll help me create it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrowdfunding is the surest way to keep my channel alive and running. Eventually, I\u0027d like to produce content full time. Accepting funding through Patreon is the best way for me to reach those goals. Without support on Patreon, my channel will be reduced to a hobby. But with the support of a few followers willing to buy me a cup of coffee or so per week, I\u0027ll be able to keep producing content for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing content is time consuming. Your contributions will allow me to spend more time writing, filming, and editing, and less time at work at a \"real\" job. In addition, much of what you give goes directly toward funding new equipment like cameras, lighting, a tripod, editing software, etc. With enough support from patrons, I\u0027ll be able to consider my video production a job, and accordingly devote enough time to my channel to upload more regularly. Eventually, my supporters on Patreon may allow me to work full time as an activist! At that point, I\u0027d be able to produce new video series, travel out of my area to visit various practitioners of woo, and participate in public speaking engagements.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo anyone willing to support me and my channel, you have my sincerest thanks. You are absolutely awesome! My wife and puppy thank you for helping us keep food on the table, and for allowing me to work to promote skepticism and secularism. I can\u0027t express how much it means to me that you\u0027re willing to support my cause. Again, thank you."
