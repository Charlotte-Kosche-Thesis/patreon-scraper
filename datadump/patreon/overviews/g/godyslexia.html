     "about": "Aspiring to empower \u201cout of the box\u201d learners, I created a degree program that united coursework and research in School Psychology, Special Education, Psychology, and Adult Education. With a full assistantship at the UGA Learning Disability Center in assessment, I pursued a doctorate that focused on life-long issues in learning, the impact of learning difficulties across the lifespan, and comprehensive diagnostic evaluations. In addition, I earned a full assistantship with the National Science Foundation while working towards a Masters degree in Educational Psychology. I often refer to my bachelor\u2019s degree in fine arts as my secret weapon as it brings joy, color, and creativity into my sessions.\u003cbr\u003eI have a deep knowledge base about dyslexia from my extensive training and passion for lifelong learning, but more importantly, from living with dyslexia. Diagnosed in the first grade, I experienced, first hand, the academic hardships, inner struggle and misunderstandings throughout my formal education. I also witnessed prodigious, personal triumphs and compassionate, caring mentors that fueled my ambition. I learned to embrace my dyslexia and came to believe that it is not a disability but an admirable difference. I love to work with and empower others with dyslexia and help them to uncover the genius within. I feel that we speak a common inner language and process in familiar ways, which enables me to connect on a core, heartfelt level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past 15 years, I have conducted teacher training in private and public schools as well as colleges. I have also run two college programs for students with learning disabilities and opened my own private practice, Learning to Learn. At present, I devote most of my time to creating educational materials and working with students on an individualized basis as a \u201cpersonal trainer for the brain.\u201d I don\u2019t have a program, instead a create a unique, multisensory plan for each learner designed to maximize potential and remediate areas of weakness. I love to find the best assistive technology and online resources for my students so they can quickly gain independence. Learning games that ignite joyful learning, compensatory learning strategies, executive functioning coaching, mindful and critical thinking, strengthening of cognitive weaknesses as well as remedial reading, writing and math methods are common aims. I founded \u003ca href=\"http://www.learningtolearn.biz/\"\u003eLearning to Learn\u003c/a\u003e in 1999.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNavigating the internet can be tricky and finding the best tools, methods, professionals and resources for individuals with dyslexia can be frustrating and time-consuming. I\u0027m Dr. Erica Warren and I have recently created a new, free website called Go Dyslexia. The purpose is to empower dyslexic individuals as well as those that live and work with these extraordinary learners. The site is meant to help, therapists, teachers, \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;parents,\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; and students can get advice, strategies, material suggestions and more. Go dyslexia offers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://godyslexia.com/dyslexia-podcasts/\"\u003eFree Video Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e that feature discussions with leading dyslexia experts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://godyslexia.com/dyslexia-webinars/\"\u003eFree Webinars and \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;vlogs\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt;\u003c/a\u003e that present learning strategies, assistive technology reviews/demonstrations, and early literacy assistance.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://godyslexia.com/dyslexia-resources/\"\u003eResource suggestions\u003c/a\u003e include materials that Dr. Warren uses in her own private practice.

Tell us about a new product or method that you would like reviewed. Suggest a dyslexia expert that you would like interviewed. Do you have ideas that would improve my GoDyslexia site?
