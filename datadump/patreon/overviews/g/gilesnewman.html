Completely self-taught, I carve fine art spoons, jewellery and sculptures from naturally fallen, locally foraged timber using just an axe and a knife. I\u0027m passionate about creating art that reflects the beauty of, and is created in harmony with nature whilst exploring the possibilities of what can be achieved using only wind fallen wood and the bare minimum of hand tools.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://gilesnewman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_4086.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(147, 137, 83);\"\u003eHummingbird spoon. Carved by knife from English Oak\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy carvings often take many hundreds of hours over several weeks to create, during which time I have no income. As a result I regularly have to abandon work on a piece in order to earn enough money to deal with day to day costs before I can afford to continue.\u00a0I\u0027ve started this page with the hope of finding more time to focus on creating my art and to take my work to the next level. I also hope that it will give me the time to write a book about my work, about escaping from the 9 to 5 life to follow your dreams and sharing the carving techniques I have developed since I started teaching myself to carve three years ago. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://gilesnewman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_4085.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(147, 137, 83);\"\u003eRaven spoon. Carved by knife from English Oak\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way Patreon works is by putting you directly in touch with artists and their art, supporting their work in a powerful, tangible and practical way in the form of a monthly pledge (which you can cancel or adjust at any time) in return for which you receive rewards as a thank you for your patronage and kind support. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are a range of rewards across a number of different pledge tiers from access to patron-only updates on my work, access to high resolution images and sketches and behind the scenes videos to video tutorials (coming soon, depending on sufficient interest), one-to-one online video chats or carving tutorials, early access to purchase pieces before being publicly available as well as signed prints and signed copies of my book when it\u0027s published. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy my work and are able, please consider making a pledge. From $1.00 per month or whatever you can afford, you will help me to free up the valuable time necessary to take my art to the next level and to create more work to share with you. I am truly grateful for your support and thank you for taking the time to visit my Patreon page.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
