I have no real skills and do not expect you to donate or add anything. This is a social science exercise to see how generous people can be to those defeated by life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would at most post to how you\u0027re helping me and show how your generous contributions has made my life better. Think of this as a very specific charity. You don\u0027t owe me anything and I don\u0027t really want you to give me anything. This is a vain attempt to help me while I try to obtain disability.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live alone in a house that is paid for. My dad moved out after my mother passed and currently pays the bills for his worthless son. I wish to detach myself from that and try to live on my own terms. Being an agoraphobic with intense anxiety and depression issues, it is pretty easy to see how hard it is to get out into the workforce, and while yes there are tons of internet opportunities out there, the internet I work with is severely limited and prone to being down quite often."
