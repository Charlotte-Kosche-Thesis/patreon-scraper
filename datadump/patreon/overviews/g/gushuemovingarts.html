We make dance and run Gushue Moving Arts, a multifaceted creative organization that houses all of our dance related projects, events, performances, writings and ideas. We have created this space for you to get an in depth look at our creative process through our Creative Practice Updates and more importantly to ask you to consider becoming a patron of GMA!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreative Practice Updates will\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0include\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0any documents generated as a result of our creative process...for example...a photo album of a rehearsal, a performance, a collage of content we find inspiring, articles we\u0027ve collect on a certain theme, essays we\u0027ve written about dance and such, notes or videos from rehearsal, video diaries of Charles or Rebecca or dancers talking about our creative work, and really anything we think is interesting and relevant that came from our creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re All Kinds of Artsy!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little more about us, we aren\u0027t just choreographers, teachers, and dancers, we\u2019re all kinds of artsy... we make puppets, build lobster suits, braid challah bread, and write blog posts about Duende and sailing stones. Some of the most important work we do at GMA can\u2019t be performed, package and sold for the price of a ticket, that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not dance. You know, the day to day sort of stuff, the creative process, the rehearsals, time spent sitting and talking, drinking coffee, thinking about dance and figuring out how to put our creative ideas into practice. We put on great shows but with those great shows comes a lot of good dancing left unseen, our \"cutting room floor\" is full of unfinished props, bottom halves of costumes, and lots of kooky dance moves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, are we asking you for money for coffee and broken props?\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, kind of, well think about it this way... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s what we are really asking...\u003c/strong\u003ethat you support us as artists for whatever dollar amount says that you love the arts and you love and support us as artists. That you believe in our potential to make dance, and that dance makes the world a better place. The arts have always survived and thrived because of philanthropic support, being a patron of GMA is an incredibly personal opportunity for you to invest in the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you\u0027re thinking about becoming a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron of GMA you can choose to give whatever dollar amount you want per Creative Practice Update. You can even set a monthly max so that if we become super productive you won\u0027t get charged more than you planned, and you can change your settings at anytime. If you decide that now is not the right time for you to become a patron you can still follow everything we are doing because this content will always be available to all. That\u0027s right the content is free, but the rewards are exclusive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeing a Patron comes with it\u0027s own rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery time Rebecca hears the annual NPR pledge drive she thinks about how sexy it is to donate. So the number 1 reward for pledging our campaign is that it makes you super sexy! But, if for once sex doesn\u0027t sell check out the other \"rewards\" we\u0027ve created for our patrons and if there are any perks or privileges that would entice you to donate let us know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll Patrons...\u003c/strong\u003e get 1-week early access to videos of our work. So if you just cant wait to see that new dance work, consider giving even just $1 a month!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1\u2026 Hey!
