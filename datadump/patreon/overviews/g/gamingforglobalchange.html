All future pledges will be made toward our winter marathon in December.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://gamingforglobalchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GamingforGlobalChangeLogo.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGaming for Global Change is an online community all about inspiring others to become charitable and make an impact in the crises and disasters that face the world today. Through various outreach efforts, our goal is to galvanize the ideals of change into the minds of youth and adults alike. Through building a community passionate about gaming and raising money for charity, we hope to not only show that adolescents and young-adults can have an impact in the world, but to also inspire and empower others to \u201cgame for global change\u201c as well. In our efforts over the last four years, we\u0027ve created a community of nearly 100 people, and nearly raised a cumulative $15,000 for the benefit of various local and global charities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://gamingforglobalchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nintendothon-1395x463.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eA part of our efforts is\u003cstrong\u003e Nintendothon, semi-annual charity marathon events of Nintendo games for the benefit of charity.\u003c/strong\u003e Our first and most recent event in December 2017 raised $2,900 for the benefit of St. Jude, raising extensive awareness for the charity, and seeking to inspire all involved. While Nintendothon was an overwhelming success for a brand new event, we found that our event had grown in size to the point where the cost of putting it on was quite high.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why we created this Patreon page, to help with the growing costs of running our events, as well as to help us upgrade our equipment to make our events even more professional and higher quality than they are today. In becoming a Patron of Gaming for Global Change, you will be supporting our mission of creating the next generation of global changers, and will help us in raising even more funds and awareness for the benefit of charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we host only two events per year, we will only take payment from patrons two times a year: once in June for our summer event hosted in July, and once in November, for our winter event hosted in December. In addition, any remaining funds from each payment that are not spent on marathon or equipment upgrades will be donated to the current charity campaign we are supporting, so you can rest assured that your money will go to impact. The current upcoming payment dates are shown here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSummer 2018 Payment: June 1, 2018\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWinter 2018 Payment: November 1, 2018\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon supporters will help with the following for our next summer Nintendothon in July 2018:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgrades to new webcameras.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFunding webpage expenses and upgrades.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of a soundboard for donations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchases of new games for the event.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of banner or other graphics packages.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of donation incentive items.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFunding a 3DS Capture Card for future events.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate you for giving your time and attention to our Patreon page, and hope you consider becoming a patron! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jared Voight\u003cbr\u003eFounder and Board Chair\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gamingforglobalchange.org\"\u003eGaming for Global Change\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
