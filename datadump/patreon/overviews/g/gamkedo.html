    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eMy mission: make learning fun\u003c/h3\u003e\nAfter several years working as a technical game designer in the game industry I went to grad school to study educational games. I wanted to make learning more enjoyable for difficult, practical subjects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I was a student again I started a game development club in 2010. I based it on one I\u0027d built elsewhere as an undergrad in 2004. The clubs weren\u0027t for my studies. I just wanted to make games with people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilding games is ideal for this\u003c/h3\u003e\nHalfway through the PhD program I realized the main impact I had on learning was by creating these communities for new game developers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://chrisdeleon.com/images/vgdev.jpg?a=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\n\tThis isn\u0027t a class. These are club members on a Friday evening.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEducational games haven\u0027t evolved much. That\u0027s not from lack of people trying. It\u0027s a really tricky design space. They\u0027re still largely either for young kids, niche research, or job training simulations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Meanwhile, hundreds of people were making games in my clubs solving sophisticated technical, design, and coordination challenges. Nobody was doing it for a grade, to get managers off their backs, or because someone else said they should.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n This learning was driven by the real desire to make better games with more realistic car movement, smarter monsters, online play, and so on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eI dropped everything to adapt our pattern for use outside colleges\u003c/h3\u003e\nCollege can be valuable. Unfortunately, it\u0027s also expensive, only several years long, and isn\u0027t available for everyone. Although my clubs can work in college settings, they really shouldn\u0027t need a high tuition paywall, long-term relocation, or taking years off work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n I knew this format could work for more people. That includes people who already finished school, who haven\u0027t gone yet, as well as people who haven\u0027t gone and don\u0027t intend to.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne challenge in making this happen was that at engineering schools several people came in with enough technical experience to lead development. That\u0027s a steep learning curve without a clear introductory curriculum.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOrigin of club training materials\u003c/h3\u003e\nDuring 8 months of my last year in university I volunteered 2 hours every Saturday teaching teenagers introductory game programming at a YWCA homeless shelter. I taught the way I\u0027d learned: beginning with retro remakes and simple coding, increasing complexity a little on each project.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n I had no bigger plans yet, I was just trying to help some people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started documenting and further expanding what I taught there. I tested and refined those techniques in one-on-one training, wrote a textbook on my method, and built video courses to go with the book addressing real questions people asked when we worked through it live.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s now our club\u0027s introductory curriculum. It\u0027s helped many of our members who started with no technical background go on to lead teams in our game development practice club.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eI\u0027m sharing our methods globally\u003c/h3\u003e\nSince then more than 50,000 people have programmed their first game with my free video course. I release new YouTube videos (120+) and podcasts (60+) every other week, all about developer issues and behind-the-scenes project stories to better equip people who\u0027re building their own games. I\u0027ve been speaking at industry conferences (GDC x3, SIEGE x4, DiGRA, and with IndieCade in Los Angeles, NYC, and Paris). I mentor solo and small team game developers around the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGamkedo Club, my third and newest club, is fully online and is independent, with no college affiliation. We\u0027ve completed nearly 30 games \nwith over 60 collaborators in our first year and a half.\nI supplement our introductory curriculum with online office hours, in which I work with members one-on-one through questions they run into.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo help more new developers worldwide I\u0027ve also:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSpoken on game development for a dozen schools, from elementary and high school up through universities (including UC Berkeley, Moorpark College, SAE Institute Geneva, Academy of Art, Westwood College, University of Michigan, and Becker College)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCo-organized nearly 75 workshops and sessions of industry speakers sharing their experiences for IndieCade in Los Angeles and Paris over the past few years\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eKeynoted for Global Game Jam in Hollywood and gave a #ResistJam talk\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDaily signal boosted, encouraged, and connected game developers in a community of over 100,000 on Twitter as @gamkedo\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eVolunteered every week for 6 months helping dozens of individuals and beginner teams stay on track, steering clear of trouble through personalized production and planning feedback\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eIncluded my textbook and example code in the Humble Freedom Bundle, of which 100% of the proceeds went to charities (ACLU, IRC, and Doctor\u0027s Without Borders). Along with dozens of indie games the bundle raised $6.5 million, giving the book to over 200,000 people. More about the book and bundle:\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mbpf_o1ZdSM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNone of those points above pays me anything. Nada. I\u0027m not in this for money. I will continue to do these things if I have zero patrons, as I have been doing for years.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n However, with your help I\u0027ll be able to reach more people with greater frequency and higher quality content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy I\u0027m starting a Patreon\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe purpose of most contract side gigs I do is to help improve the reach and quality of my free offerings, or to keep my personalized support affordable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Nearly all school speaking I do is for free. I\u0027ve avoided business sponsors because I\u0027ve witnessed firsthand teaching at a summer camps how those can derail teaching into a sales pitch for products people don\u0027t need. I left the academic teaching path to help more people learn at lower cost than those types of institutions can accommodate.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s important to me that even when training people privately or in Gamkedo Club I keep rates within reach of people in middle-class circumstances. Professionals in industry have told me I could easily charge significantly more based on my development and teaching experience. I don\u0027t feel right doing that, since often people who need help most are working within limited financial means.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMaking games is for everyone\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe \n\u003ca href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gamkedoclub/why-make-games.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etechniques I teach to make games can be done in as little as a few hours each week\u003c/a\u003e. This way practice can fit sustainably alongside a day job, classes, and social obligations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor some people my approach has been a stepping stone opening up new career options. But much like how most people who play a sport or learn an instrument may never do so professionally, it can still be a valid and enriching part of life for everyone. \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4p7T9O_tqg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI wrote an Extra Credits episode better explaining my case for personal game making\u003c/a\u003e.

It gives us practice regularly overcoming unexpected difficulties. It humbles us to challenge our ideas about what should be done or how by putting them into action.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBuilding something that works instills confidence, and it does so while developing real abilities to back it up. It\u0027s empowering to have skills to create new things straight from your imagination without needing anyone else\u0027s permission.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n It\u0027s also healthy to feel a bond of community by building shared projects, not on account of dependency on one another but instead from understanding how collaborative compromises can help us achieve better results together than we could alone with total control.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGet patron-only rewards\u003c/h3\u003e\nMany of my Patreon goals are in the cumulative community totals to the left. I have milestones to help me double my YouTube and podcast frequency, live stream club meetings, and more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor individual reward tiers:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt as little as $1/month you\u0027ll get behind the scenes posts and patron-only videos sharing how your support is getting more people inro making games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother level will grant you access to weekly videos of our Gamkedo Club meetings. These include all project pitches, progress updates, and industry speakers. This is a great way to follow the community\u0027s growth, or to learn from how we operate. It also includes our training materials.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf\n you\u0027d like to make your own podcasts and YouTube videos, another reward tier will have new videos tutorials from me with tools and tips I\u0027ve learned making mine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHelp someone be part of the club\u003c/h3\u003e\nGamkedo Club is open to the public. \n\u003ca href=\"http://gamkedo.club/register/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnyone can join\u003c/a\u003e. However we do have monthly dues. The rates are comparable to a dojo, or a gym with a fitness trainer. Like those businesses we provide structure to help people grow alongside practicing peers with the benefit of professional guidance to get more out of their time. Doing that right has overhead.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you support our mission and vision, but feel the club isn\u0027t a fit for what you\u0027re seeking, you can still help by sponsoring a new scholarship-like applicant. This makes the club\u0027s full benefits available to a new member at no cost to them, and is intended to help people who otherwise may not be in a position to afford dues on their own.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe rate to cover this is reduced, so that it\u0027s less than it would be for someone to signup directly. I\u0027m partly subsidizing this option from my end, as well. The club\u0027s leadership team will choose from the new member applications on the first of each month based on the number of current patrons at or above this reward level.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://gamkedo.club/application-for-sponsored-membership/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnyone can apply\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026lt;-- the link to share with a friend it may help\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some short stories from sponsored members about how support from Patreon and their time with the club has been beneficial (no names are attributed since we keep private who is supported through sponsorship):\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\"I heard about the club through a friend and knew that I wanted to join, but coming from a low income background and dealing with everyday living expenses made me apply for sponsorship. Since then, I have been able to work directly with other team members and gain valuable experience in doing what I truly love to do - and that\u0027s making games. By adding Gamkedo Club games to my portfolio, I have been able to better improve my applications when applying for game studios, and when the time comes, I would definitely look back to sponsor another member and repay what was given to me.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I\u0027ve struggled with not having a sense of belonging.

Because of your support, aspiring game devs like me learn and grow with an amazing group of people. Not only am I receiving experienced mentorship, but when I go on the forum any time of day or night and ask for advice, members elsewhere in the world reach out with encouragement and pages of information. Club members point me to tutorials that worked for them, discuss options, and provide constructive feedback when I post for critique. Whether you\u0027re a hard-boiled solo developer or an uncertain newcomer, the Gamkedo Club is an amazing source of mentorship, camaraderie, knowledge, and experience. I\u0027m incredibly grateful for my member sponsorship. You might find applying to be the best-spent minutes of your life!
