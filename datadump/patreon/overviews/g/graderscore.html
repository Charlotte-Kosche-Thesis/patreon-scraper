A nerdy educators dream come true!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nGraderScore\u003c/em\u003e is that.\nWe\u2019re taking all the things that kids love from video games, geek fandoms, and pop culture and applying them\nto the classroom. From grading to lessons to behavior management, we are geekifying the class. There\u2019s going to be a whole new meaning to +1 to intellect.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee18/Heartagera/What%20is%20GraderScore%202.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGrader Score is the\nbrain child of Kari Zielke, Zach Denoncour, and Andrew Tyler, three\neducators from Northern New England. Zach and Andrew both work as\ntechnology integrators, showing kids how to use and create new tech. Kari is a\nclassroom teacher with a serious love for science. Together we saw a hole in\neducation in both how its delivered and how we assess children. We combined our\nlove for all things geeky, gaming and tech into a way to keep students engaged.\nThe process is never-ending and we are always tweaking things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee18/Heartagera/What%20is%20GraderScore%203.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe presented the first GraderScore panel at PAXEast in\nMarch of 2017, and we were impressed by the response. The panel was standing\nroom only and we were asked to present again and again, in some cases across\nthe country! So many emails asking, \"When will GraderScore present again?\u201d\n\u201cWhen will you publish?\u201d We did not expect so much of a response. As much as we\nwant to present our idea and publish it, we couldn\u0027t afford it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUntil Patreon. Patreon allows us to make GraderScore happen -\nwith your help. As a donor, you get access to our special donors-only Patreon\nfeed, watch videos early, learn where we will be presenting next and even get\nearly access to our (soon-to-be) published works. And if you\u0027re feeling super\ngenerous, you can even get your name in the credits as a Sponsor. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you! We hope you\u0027ll support gamifying the classroom because\neveryone should enjoy learning.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
