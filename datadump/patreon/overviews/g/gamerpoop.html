I take characters from your favorite games like Skyrim, Mass Effect, Fallout, etc, remix their dialogue into funny skits, memorable quotes and songs. Not only that, I create custom visual scenes to bring the dialogue to life. Your mama is so proud of what I bring to the internet.\u00a0:) Need some reminders of what I\u0027ve made?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWe\u0027ll bang, okay?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eJarl Ballin.

(There\u0027s a TL;DR though, but don\u0027t you dare skip to it.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think I need to do a sales pitch on why GamerPoop is great, right? I\u0027ve been making this show since 2008 and started in Fallout 3. I was learning how to mod PC games and making a variety of quality gaming content, serious and funny. But LA Noire and Oblivion is when the show really started to \"make sense\" to me and it took off. When Balgruuf summoned me to Whiterun and softly told me he was actually a little girl from France, and Shepard asked but at the very same time ordered me to return to the ship, I realized what the people wanted. What the internet wanted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then we\u0027ve been ballin, doing sexy splits, finding fresh chests, becoming manly men, eating lucky charms for dinner, bring home the booty to our families.. it just doesn\u0027t end.. or does it? (this is when super serious music plays and you feel the darkness caving in around you. Feel it? No, jesus that\u0027s not it, that\u0027s Nazeem bear-hugging you from behind.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe greybeards are pleading me \"Don\u0027t stop, it feels so right\" but what\u0027s the problem? Several. YouTube\u0027s changes. Censorship and demonetization. I wish I could pretend youtube cares but how can I when they don\u0027t even bother tell us what part of the video is causing the issue so that we can cut, edit, bleep it? They\u0027re pushing creators to make daily, long videos when not every channel makes content like that. All this does is ravage the area- I mean, GamerPoop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMans1ay3r my love, what can I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest hope is to reach my goal on Patreon so that I can create episodes on a monthly basis without having to worry about what terrible idea YouTube is implementing next. At the moment, I have to start creating more variety content (like I used to) but this would take some time away from working on episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges \u003cstrong\u003etogether\u003c/strong\u003e help reach the goal, so no pledge is too small.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be livestreaming on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/mans1ay3r\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch.tv/mans1ay3r\u003c/a\u003e if you want to make donations there and get a live thank you from me. If you have an Amazon prime account, you can subscribe to me on Twitch for free and that would be a huge contribution to the show as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are small incentives for helping out the show. Working on some new ideas for this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat your contributions will help me do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNo delays if YOU are funding this show\u0027s goal\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork on classic games again like (Oblivion, LA Noire, New Vegas) because I won\u0027t have to worry about the better views newer games bring\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase beats to make some real GamerPoop musics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOfficial Gamerpoop mod WITH quests!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027ve had some of these goals for awhile, and others have already began (merch, behind the scenes) but reaching goal is important for me to really be able to do everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making this show for a long time, I\u0027ll never run out of ideas.. however these latest changes from YouTube are definitely going to kill it if I don\u0027t reach goal. The show takes weeks to make. Imagine going to work for a month, then at the end, your boss doesn\u0027t pay you? That\u0027s what I\u0027m dealing with. There are many forms of entertainment that have cursing, inappropriate comedy, lyrics, visuals, that have zero issues getting advertising and sponsors. YouTube seems to have other goals in mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFun fax: If one percent of my sub count pledged $1 a month, I\u0027d be \u003cstrong\u003eover\u003c/strong\u003e my goal. No pledge is too small, seeeeriously. (Realistically, I\u0027m not asking for 6k people to pledge lol, its just food for thought that \u003cstrong\u003etogether\u003c/strong\u003e, every pledge helps GamerPoop.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
