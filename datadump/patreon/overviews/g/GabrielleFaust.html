My name is Gabrielle Faust. I am a Texas-based author and most well known for my dark fantasy cyberpunk vampire series ETERNAL VIGILANCE. This year I am making the thrilling and equally terrifying decision to go back to being a full-time novelist in order to meet the voracious literary appetites of my readers and their desire for new tales. I need your help to do this! As we all know, it is extraordinarily tough to make  it as a working writer or artist in this day and age. The modern society, while it craves creativity, does not make it easy for artists to support themselves off of their crafts. Your pledge will assist with the expenses associated with the life of a full-time indie author and artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am at work on my first young adult paranormal novel, which I hope to near completion by the end of 2017. In addition, I am at work on a new series of paintings, which I also hope to complete by the end of 2017 with the hopes of securing a full gallery exhibit in early 2018. Lastly, because the first two goals aren\u0027t monumental enough, I am working on the revision of the ETERNAL VIGILANCE screenplay adaptation, pitch deck, and look book with hopes of finding an investor(s) for the film in 2018-2019. Projects in between these two massive undertakings include various artistic creations and poetic ramblings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will show the world that culture and creativity are still a prized key to society and civility in the 21st century. And you can take pride knowing that your generous contribution has brought another epic literary adventure to the hearts and minds of people around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Video for this page coming soon where I will talk more about my life as a writer/artist and how your contributions can help me achieve my goals!**\u003cbr\u003e"
