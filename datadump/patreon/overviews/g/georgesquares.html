He\u0027s been writing fiction on and off for over a decade, but he would like to commit more time to it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where patrons like you can help. If a lot of readers who enjoy his work or commentary contribute just a small amount of income,  monthly updates with sizable content chunks can become a serious endeavor.  By supporting George Squares, not only do you get to ensure that he can keep writing stories, but you can have access to his twine game project updates, patron-sponsored short stories and peeks at his novel project, along with creative input into his fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe wants to thank everybody who is kind enough to support him, and wants to give back fiction to the furry community as often as he can with a serious dedication to his work."
