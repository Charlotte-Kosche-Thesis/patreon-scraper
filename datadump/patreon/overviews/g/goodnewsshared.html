Despite this, more than half the population\nbelieve local charities play an important role in their communities. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eGood News Shared was started in April 2014 to raise\nawareness of the impact charities \u2013 particularly small charities \u2013 are having on\ntheir communities. Since our launch we have featured more than 800 uplifting\ncharitable stories. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery day people come onto our site and they read about\nsomeone or something awesome. Some of our readers share our stories with\nfriends via email and / or social media (\u003cem\u003ewe love you guys!\u003c/em\u003e), and some don\u0027t\n(\u003cem\u003ethat\u2019s OK, we still like you too\u003c/em\u003e). All of our readers are hopefully leaving\nour site feeling happier, more inspired, and more informed about charities.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s clear from the messages we receive that people love having access to\nuplifting charitable stories from around the world.\u202f\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRaising awareness of smaller charities is very important. The\nmost common reason people give for not donating to a local charity is not\nknowing enough about them. Greater awareness of the work and impact of small\ncharities would lead to more people helping, either through volunteering or\ndonating.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Good News Shared\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who contributes to the site does so on a voluntary\nbasis. We do it because we believe in the power of positivity and because we\nknow so many incredible charities who deserve some attention and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGood News Shared has had a great start and we\u0027ve developed a\npassionate\u202freadership. As well as the 800 + incredible, heart-warming stories,\nwe have also produced more than 40 podcast interviews where volunteers share\ntheir story with us in their own words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the past two years we have built up an active community\nof ambassadors, volunteers and readers. At the end of 2016 we launched our first product-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://shop.goodnewsshared.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Moments Journal\u003c/a\u003e, a guided journal that helps people feel more positive and optimistic as they remember the good things that happened in their day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know two things now:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1) Good News Shared should continue for a long time.\u202fPeople\nwant to read about the good stuff and charities need help in raising awareness\nabout their positive contributions to communities. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2) We need to make Good News Shared self-sustaining.\u202fThe\n\"fund Good News Shared\u202fwith savings + freelance work\" plan was fine\nfor the first two years, but it\u0027s not sustainable. Good News Shared deserves to\nbe the priority, rather than being something I fit in around \u2018rent-paying\nwork\u2019. Our writers and other team members deserve to be paid for their work,\nplus this is necessary if Good News Shared is to grow. If Good News Shared\u202fis\ngoing to go on for a long time, it has to be able to support itself.\u202fThe good\nnews is that we don\u0027t need a huge amount each month in order to become\nsustainable.\u202f\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Need to be able to Pay For\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u202fhave\u202fan initial goal of $1,200 / month.\u202fThat money plus\nincome from a store selling ethical, inspirational products (we plan to develop\nthis next year) will be enough to keep\u202fGood News Shared\u202fgoing, indefinitely.\nHere are Good News Shared\u0027s costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Hosting: We need a robust enough hosting plan to support the\nspikes in traffic we sometimes get so we don\u0027t crash during those moments. We\nalso pay for hosting for the Good News Shared podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0MailChimp: The service we use to email our subscribers once\na fortnight. This fee grows as our email list grows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Ongoing web development: We recently re-designed our website\nthanks to the help of an incredible volunteer. We\u0027d like to continue to develop\nour site over time, plus there are a few maintenance costs we need to pay for\nto ensure our site is safe and secure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Social Media: A lot of our new readers find us via social\nmedia. Keeping up with social media would be a 24/7 job if it wasn\u0027t for Edgar,\nan awesome tool we use to schedule many of our posts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Me: I need to continue to eat fruit and vegetables (I\u0027m\nvegetarian!) and pay the rent. I am a pretty low maintenance kind of girl so I\ndon\u0027t need much else! (You can find out a bit more about me here)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Writers: To grow we need regular freelance writers to find,\nresearch and write about inspiring charitable activities around the world. We\ncould keep going with volunteer writers but not only is it fair to pay writers\nfor their work (they need to eat too), it will help us feature more awesome\nstories each week. Currently we share a minimum of five stories each week, with\nthe majority being written by me. With regular freelance writers on board we\nwould be able to double or maybe even triple that amount, and I would have time\nto work on developing the site further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the basics. With these\u202fcovered,\u202fGood News Shared\u202fcan\nsupport itself.\u202fIf we pass the $1,200/month goal, we\u0027ll use additional funds to\nstart expanding. There are other projects we\u0027d love to do (books, calendars,\napps, etc.), and if we can\u202fpass\u202four Patreon goal, we\u0027ll begin to have the means\nto do even more with\u202fGood News Shared.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat our readers say: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cI\u2019ve been on and off your website all day, it\u2019s made a dent\nin my productivity but it\u2019s been a wonderful morning of reading. I think it\u2019s\nfantastic, I often criticize the mainstream news for painting a very dismal\npicture of our world when in fact, as your site shows, the world is full of\nwonderful people with wonderful ideas.\u201d \u003c/em\u003e- B.
