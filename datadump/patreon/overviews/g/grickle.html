I\u0027ve been working in the animation and comics industry for over 20 years now. I\u0027ve worked on video games, tv shows, animated features, and comic books. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to have been nominated for stuff like the \u003ca href=\"http://oscar.go.com/nominees/animated-feature-film/the-boxtrolls\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAcademy Awards\u003c/a\u003e , the \u003ca href=\"http://www.harveyawards.org/previous-awards-nominees/2002-harvey-awards/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHarvey Awards\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.literary-arts.org/what-we-do/oba-home/book-awards/graphic-literature/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e2012 Oregon Book Awards\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Heck, I even managed to win the \u003ca href=\"http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/best-unknown-local-cartoonist/BestOf?oid=2151847\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSFWeekly\u0027s Best Unknown Local Cartoonist in 2004\u003c/a\u003e! I\u0027ve done a lot of things in my career so far and I feel truly lucky to have had the opportunities I\u0027ve had. One of things I\u0027m most proud of is the Grickle Channel I created on Youtube nearly a decade ago. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S THE GRICKLE CHANNEL?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Grickle Channel is my own personal Youtube Channel. It\u0027s where I\u0027ve been creating my own animated shorts for years now. It\u0027s grown a dedicated following ( over 27,000 subscribers) over time and I do my best to create new content whenever I can. But I\u0027m a one man show doing all the art and sound work on my own, so it\u0027s tough. I\u0027d love to commit more time and energy to the channel but to do that it would need to be a more self sustaining financial situation. I\u0027ve tried ads and support buttons but with the way Youtube is structured that results in very little actual return to me. I\u0027m trying to find a way to make the Grickle Channel a bigger more substantial part of my life and continue to create the types of cartoons I\u0027ve been making. Patreon seems like the answer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith financial assistance from you folks I\u0027ll be able to cover costs for time and labor, sound effects databases, software upgrades and more. Patreon subscribers to Grickle are going to get access to an ad-free channel on Vimeo that will have exclusive content not seen on Youtube. The Vimeo channel will also offer early access to NEW cartoons! You\u0027ll see the latest Grickle shorts weeks before anyone else does! \u00a0I\u0027ll be doing a behind-the-scenes email newsletter that will come out quarterly and feature commentary, early conceptual art, \u00a0storyboard images, and more about various Grickle shorts! \u00a0For higher tier Patreon subscribers there\u0027ll be\u00a0 printed postcards \nof art sent to your home announcing new Grickle cartoons and events. There will also be a chance to win original, one-of-a-kind, hand-drawn art done by yours truly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had such a gratifying time making Grickle cartoons and I couldn\u0027t do what I do without the great response and support everyone has given the Grickle Channel over the years! Here\u0027s to hoping that Patreon can help pave a way towards an even better and more prolific decade ahead for the Grickle Channel! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
