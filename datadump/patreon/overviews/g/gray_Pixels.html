You\u0027re great and we\u0027re going to bring you more content than ever before.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGray Pixels is a living documentary series focusing on the history of unlicensed video games, gaming communities, and unorthodox game preservation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of doing focused history pieces on unlicensed games, Gray Pixels will also feature extended gameplay videos and \"let\u0027s plays\" of less common games, both retro and current. The second goal of this channel is to showcase under-appreciated titles and attempt to prove that they are worth playing and maybe even...fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGray Pixels was created by Hadrian M. Rea, formerly of Bitmob, GamesBeat, and the Warp Zone Network. Hadrian has a passion for retro video games and history. This project gives him the chance to combine both into a look at frequently lesser-known facets of the games industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHadrian\u0027s partner Cameron is joining the team in 2016! Cameron runs a similar YouTube series called Kusoge Theater. The two finally decided it was better combine their creative forces than sit in the same house making vaguely similar videos and content separate from each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nArtwork for Gray Pixels was provided by Corey Johnson, the creator of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://artoftheglitch.tumblr.com/post/113188927449/concentric-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArt of the Glitch\u003c/a\u003e.

Years of saying \"eventually I\u0027ll make a YouTube series\" finally turned into \"now is the time.\" With your help, Gray Pixels can turn into something beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e"
