I hope to eventually use the money that you donate to support my own website dedicated strictly to my webcomics and provide you through it bigger and better stuff!  The money would also go to other tools I use in the production of my webcomics, because the creation of them is not just on pen and paper but is put through a series of perfecting processes through my scanner, computer, and a series of programs such as Photoshop Adobe and Manga Studio.  Your donations help me to keep my tools up to date, virus free, and continuously improving.  In the long run, I hope to attend conventions where I can reach the masses on a more personal level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonating:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pick from one of currently three different options to show your support.\u00a0 $1, $3, and $10.\u00a0 More will be offered over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfraid of going over your spending limit?\u00a0 Don\u0027t fret!\u00a0 You can set a maximum number for your donations when you go to sign up!\u00a0 Never worry about spending to much in donations if I post an excess amount of webcomics in a month!\u003cbr\u003e"
