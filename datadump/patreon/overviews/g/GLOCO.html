My name is \u003cstrong\u003eGLOCO\u003c/strong\u003e~ and I\u0027m an aspiring and growing Gaming Channel in YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI post new videos daily and if you\u0027ve watched my videos then you\u0027ll probably agree that I\u0027m one of the craziest Let\u0027s player\u0027s you\u0027ve ever seen. My goal is to entertain a lot of people and to show everyone how awesome the gaming world is. \u00a0Here\u0027s my Youtube Channel for the new people~ :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GLOCOgaming\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/GLOCOgaming\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I have 3000+ Subscribers that I\u0027ve garnered up since my 9 months of doing Youtube. I\u0027m still a small channel but I believe that this channel will grow to be a very awesome community of happy people. My target audiences is everyone who enjoys gaming, but I like to add some \"Anime Flavor\" to my gameplays so that Otakus in general could enjoy my videos.\u003cbr\u003eOw, and I\u0027m a Filipino, Otaku, Parkour practitioner, Medic, Ninja, zombie, and part time sensei~ \u0026gt;:D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon and why do I need your help with it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding campaign program for your favorite content creators. It\u0027s kind of like KickStarter but it doesn\u0027t require a lot of funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s how it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become my Patron, you pledge to give me a certain amount of tip every month in order to help me keep making videos everyday. You\u0027ll also get rewards from me for being a Patron. Yey!\u00a0\uff2f(\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\uff2f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStory time!~ So I graduated as a Nursing student in one of the most prestigous universities here in the Philippines and I was also able to pass my licensure exams. I was supposed to take up Medicine and become a doctor... HOWEVER!! After experiencing being a student nurse and being exposed to the clinical setting, I\u0027ve realized that a life in the Hospital isn\u0027t really the life I imagined. The hospital is generally a sad and stressful place for a lot of people and I don\u0027t like that kind of environment...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO! I decided to disappoint my parents and follow a new path in life! A path that will allow me to make a lot of people happy! A path that I can share with everyone! A Path that I will truly enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut such a path has it\u0027s own risks and hardships which I am experiencing right now. So since my parent\u0027s doesn\u0027t support me anymore and that they are totally against this dream I\u0027m trying to turn to reality, I\u0027m now supporting myself through doing part time jobs like english tutoring and doing online work. BUT, the amount I earn from those jobs is just barely enough to let me survive every month, and to be honest, I don\u0027t think I can keep up with it with the way things are now. While doing work, I have to make a video for my viewers everyday which is a lot of fun for me, but stressful in a way because of the other problems I\u0027m thinking of which is mostly financial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s where you generous, loving, kind-hearted, and beautiful people come in! I want to continue making awesome videos for you guys on a daily basis and I need your financial aid to help me achieve that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with the money:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current sallary in my part time jobs is just enough to pay for food and rent but not enough to help me save up for improving my channel. So I will use most of the money to buy new equipment like a Video Capture Card, Gaming consoles, gaming peripherals, and of course Video games to be featured on my channel (Diz shizz is expensive!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Projects:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eComedy skits\u003c/em\u003e = I\u0027ve done some comedy skits before but I have tons of funny ideas to try out, but I\u0027ll need new equipment for film making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eVideoGame Social Experiments\u003c/em\u003e = now these are the projects I\u0027m really excited to do. I will go out in public and make social experiments about gaming. It\u0027s kinda like what MEGA64 does. I will re-enact some video game elements or scenes in real life and try to get some awesome reaction from the people. I\u0027ll be needing new film making equipment for this in order to film outside. Here\u0027s one I made a few years back:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Sn-w0cDtWro\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/Sn-w0cDtWro\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnime Related stuff \u003c/em\u003e= I\u0027m a huge Anime and Japanese culture enthusiast... Alright fine! I\u0027m an Otaku! and I would love to do some crazy, funny, and random Anime shizz videos for you\u0027re shizz~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharity drives\u003c/em\u003e - Once my channel becomes bigger, I want to give back to the community by doing charity drives. The more people we help, the happier the world is~ :D.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to help GLOCO aside from Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGuys, just by watching and supporting my videos in youtube, you\u0027re already helping me a lot. I wouldn\u0027t even be making these videos if it weren\u0027t for you, my loving viewers~ If you guys are enjoying, then I\u0027m enjoying :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you guys would still like to support me financially but don\u0027t want to pledge or would like to donate more, then you can do so here in my paypal:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/DonateGLOCO\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/DonateGLOCO\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance to everyone who will help me!
