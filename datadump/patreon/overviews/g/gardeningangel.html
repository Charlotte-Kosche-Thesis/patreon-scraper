I\u2019ve been on a roll ever since, \u003c/strong\u003ewriting stories and songs, playing guitars and pianos and percussive pots \u0026amp; pans, laying down my own tracks, making videos and albums and flier art, writing my own bios and doing my own stunts and tattoos and dishes. I also enjoy sewing and other handicrafts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I do a lot on my own, \u003cstrong\u003eb\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eut I don\u2019t do it alone.\u003c/strong\u003e It takes support from my community for me to be able to give art back to my community. So far, I\u2019ve been staying afloat on a slow but steady trickle of income from my small but loyal network of fans. By joining Patreon, I\u2019m hoping to make it easier for people to interact with and support me as a creator, to build a stronger foundation so that I can make bigger things, and to use this platform as a central gathering place for everyone who enjoys my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYour presence and attention is a priceless gift\u003c/strong\u003e. Even if you\u0027re not ready to donate monetarily, I hope that you\u2019ll still get on board by creating your own user account (if you haven\u0027t already- it\u0027s super easy and virtually painless) and following my public posts. Patreon-land is a delightful place. If you walk around a bit you\u0027re sure to meet beautiful people \u0026amp; see beautiful sites. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 You can also help\u00a0by spreading the word, inviting your friends, sharing the page coordinates, posting posts, \u003cstrong\u003eboosting the signal strength and reaching more people like a growing snowball of art-love. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can also toss your pennies in the well-wishing tip jar (also known as PayPal) at gardeningangelband@gmail.com\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Whether you\u0027re boarding with a free pass or buying your ticket,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ethank you \u0026amp; welcome aboard!!!\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0027re heading into our sophomore year here on Patreon, and the 7th year since Gardening Angel sprouted into existence (aww, they grow up so fast). I\u0027m taking a bit of a sabbatical in 2017 but I still need your support, now more than ever, as I continue to cultivate my craft, offline and underground. Some things can only grow in the shadows.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0You can help to keep the lamp burning to light my path as I head out into the wild unknown.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I\u0027m going out to gather bones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
