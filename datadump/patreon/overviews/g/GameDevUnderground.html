    "summary": "Hey there, my name is Tim Ruswick, and I am the founder of a YouTube channel and online community called Game Dev Underground. My goal is to help as many game developers I can make better games, actually finish them, and market them effectively to the masses. And with Underground ELITE - I\u0027m taking that to a whole new level! Check out the deets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gdu-patreon/membershipTiers.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSee, I believe that games can change the world\u003c/strong\u003e, and with your help, I can make sure we have more of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_hwKJdF3KRAy4QIaiCSMgQ\"\u003econtinue to make completely free videos\u003c/a\u003e on subjects ranging from game design, to level design, to marketing, to psychology, and even self improvement. I want to continue to help game developers all over the world with things they didn\u0027t know they needed. And in addition, I want to build the best place online for game developers to connect with each other, help each other, and grow together as a collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is how I plan to support the underground, and I appreciate you being a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gdu-patreon/headlineWhyJoin.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides all the cool stuff right? Besides hanging out with me, access to tons of tools and data on how to build, finish and launch your game...and besides all the cool extra perks I\u0027ve thrown in here, right? For me, the primary benefit isn\u0027t actually all the stuff you get, It\u0027s to surround yourself with other game developers that are ACTIVELY MAKING GAMES.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gdu-patreon/gduBenefitVenn.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of it like this...There are dudes that talk about making games...and there are dudes that actually make them. No matter which one of those you are right now, by joining Underground Elite, you are\u003cstrong\u003e surrounding yourself with tons of other developers that are SUPER SERIOUS about ACTUALLY FINISHING GAMES\u003c/strong\u003e...and that\u0027s awesome. That\u0027s what I love about this. People put their money into what they believe in, yet most \"game developers\" never actually invest in themselves. Well this is an investment in yourself. If you\u0027re a successful developer already, Underground Elite will help you network and grow. If you\u0027re just beginning, it will help you connect with people from around the globe that can help you, promote you, and give you feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to be clear, I\u0027m not telling you I have all the answers. I\u0027m not trying to be some guru with a membership program trying to sell you stuff because you think that will solve all of your problems. It won\u0027t. Nothing but hard work and dedication will. But with ELITE, you won\u0027t be alone. An army of developers will have your back.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eElite isn\u0027t just some random group, it\u0027s a collective of game developers serious about success.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gdu-patreon/headlineWhyPatreon.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could spend my time working with clients, and building games for others. I could talk to new leads every day and try to land new freelance business. I could spend a ton of time paying bills...but all this means is less content and less community. I love this community and I want to dedicate my life to it. Patreon is helping me do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gdu-patreon/gduPatreonTimeSpent.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, if you think about it...Patreon gives me all of the technology I need to run Underground Elite without having to worry about the technology headache, content delivery, and user management.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gdu-patreon/footer.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
