    "summary": "Dear friends \u0026amp; patrons of the arts,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my new home at Patreon. As many of you know, I\u0027m an independent singer/songwriter and recording artist. I\u0027ve already written and recorded nine (9) original albums on my own throughout my indie career to help inspire people and\u00a0help them through the most difficult and formative times in their lives. I\u0027ve met some of the most incredible people at shows and in people\u0027s living rooms at house concerts throughout my travels, and have even shared the stage with some of my heroes. I make music because that\u0027s what I\u0027m meant to do in this lifetime, and I do it for all of you who are listening...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m usually busy making evocative, alternative/pop music and other heartfelt content that I want to continue sharing with you all on a monthly basis, but I need your ongoing support here on Patreon now more than ever before...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 52, 16);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat Patreon is all about\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThink of it as crowdfunding meets monthly membership. You can become a Gregory Douglass patron of the arts and help fund my ongoing creativity on a monthly basis in exchange for early (and exclusive) access to everything new I create. It doesn\u0027t take much to make all of the difference in my creative sustainability\u00a0because there is strength in numbers. Most of my patrons are pledging $1, $5, $10 per month on average \u2013 but your monthly pledge is entirely up to you. That\u0027s only $12, $60, $120 per year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, this might not seem like much, but there\u0027s profound strength in numbers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron support like this has made all of the difference in my career through past crowdfunding campaign efforts in order to release new music, and this is how I must sustain my craft moving forward. So I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a monthly patron yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what patrons might receive from month to month: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew songs \u0026amp; demo recordings\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew music videos\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePatron all-request web concerts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSong lyrics to new songs in the making\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExclusive patron-only content and other fun surprises...\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 52, 16);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat your support is going towards\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003ePatrons help support the ongoing funding of projects like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive From The Chapel:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0This is a \u201crockumentary\u201d film \u0026amp; live album currently in the making.
