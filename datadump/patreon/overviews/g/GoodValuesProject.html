The project is a way for us to learn and to raise funds to support our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a firm believer in getting the basics right and using them as the foundation for being a good human. The way we speak to each other is important ... every single day, the promises we make to each other are important ... every single day, \u00a0putting your supermarket trolley back properly...oh, you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I\u0027m a bit worried that mindfulness and excessive individualism sit a little too closely to each other at times. That self reflection and self awareness aren\u0027t as clearly distinguishable as they could be. That there needs to be one more step after writing a daily gratitude list...have I truthfully treated everyone today in the same way I would want to be treated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way we\u0027ll hear from lots and lots of different individuals and groups sharing their thoughts and experiences and we\u0027ll look at what we can do to make the small changes that really count.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll cover all the things that impact on our every day lives, from the small to the big, from health and social care to the environment and everything inbetween.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLighthearted\u00a0is the word to hold on to. We\u0027re taking a gentle, slow approach with lots of time to learn, think and reflect.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us when you\u0027e ready, there\u0027s no rush.\u003cbr\u003e"
