    "summary": "Thank you so much for\u00a0checking out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://genuflected.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGenuflected\u003c/a\u003e on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a site that allows you to support the artists you love so that we can keep making the content you enjoy.\u00a0I am\u00a0so\u00a0excited to be a part of such a forward thinking company that places value on the art itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit about me:\u00a0From a very young age I couldn\u0027t get enough of the literary world. I was the dork that walked to school with my nose buried in a book.\u00a0I had all the bumps on my path memorized so that I didn\u0027t even have to look up from the page as I walked.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI drove my teachers crazy, always hiding my book at school so I could get a few more pages read. Then\u00a0one day\u00a0I won a writing contest\u00a0and a day with an author. Suddenly\u00a0I realized that maybe I could write stories of my own and other people might want to read them. That got me really\u00a0excited!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then life happened and somehow, along the way, I wandered off the writing path. Things were\u00a0going well for me. I was happily married, had two beautiful children, and was progressing in my career.\u00a0Life was predictable and comfortable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil one day, when a doctor looked me in the eye and told me that my\u00a02-year-old son had leukemia.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we tried to make sense of this new reality, friends and family were calling and texting constantly, seeking updates and offering support. I couldn\u0027t keep up with it all so, at my sister\u0027s suggestion, I started a CaringBridge site where I made \u003ca href=\"http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/cooperdewitt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edaily journal entries \u003c/a\u003e. Every day I would record the progress and setbacks in Cooper\u0027s fight against leukemia. The more I wrote, the more I remembered how much I loved to write.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCooper\u0027s cancer journey continued, and so did my writing. I started to notice that my outlook on life and faith were evolving as a result of our struggles, and I wanted to write\u00a0more\u00a0about it. But Cooper\u0027s CaringBridge site was for the bones of our journey, the basics. I needed a place where I could write about the flesh, the heartache and personal revelations.\u00a0Thus, in May of 2013, \u003ca href=\"http://genuflected.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGenuflected.com \u003c/a\u003ewas born. Suddenly I was back on the path of a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the months since, I have poured my heart out to a growing number of\u00a0readers.\u00a0My dream is that Genuflected.com will continue to grow and touch the lives of more and more people. Our world is so filled with hurt, and\u00a0I want to bring a message of hope. I want to remind people of God\u0027s vast love and\u00a0His awesome ability to shower us with blessings even in times of sorrow - and sometimes especially\u00a0in times of sorrow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that our story and my writing have touched your heart in a way that matters -- that somehow my message has brought value to your life.\u00a0If that is the case, and you\u0027d like to support me in my efforts to\u00a0 bring this message to others, would\u00a0you consider making a monthly pledge to\u00a0Genuflected?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know finances are tight for many people right now, and I don\u0027t want you to stretch your budget on our account. But if you are in a position to pledge even\u00a0$1 a month\u00a0in appreciation of my writing, I would be so grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking time to read what I write. Whether are not you are able to pledge to Genuflected.com, please know that your\u00a0love and support fill my heart with gratitude.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
