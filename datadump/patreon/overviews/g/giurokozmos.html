    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eI found the idea of sunspot stress and correlating stress-soothing melodies in a\u00a0 Sunspot-Distance Date List\u00a0 /on 44 years regularly between family tragedies/ in an 1930s manuscript of my Great Aunt\u00a0 Emma von Ryttoch (a since forgotten writer) who has met the famous sociology writer Karl Mannheim (mentioned in her Diaries that she regularly went to Anatole France\u0027s salon where Proust was a stable guest). /Proust is from their Idealist-Brotherly generation in 1883-1900 with Mannheim, Chagall, Renoir, Mauriac\u00a0 \u00a0according to the (europized) Strauss-Howe model of 1998. Aunt Emma is older- from the Generation of the 60-83 years: Mahler at the beginning in 60,\u00a0 Aunt Emma in 67,\u00a0 Lenin and Proust in 70, 71, Th. Mann in 75, Stalin in 78, Picasso in 81. /\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe has left to the National Library a Diary and some letters\u00a0 about her plan to her sister-in-low, C\u00e9cile Tormay, her publisher.\u00a0 She wanted to write about her ancestors - and she used a 44/45 year distance in the List (between famous assassination cases around her family.)\u00a0 Aunt C\u00e9cile objected against parts of the project (I will show their letters.) She objected against Emma\u0027s approaching her towns\u0027 Rabbi, Rabbi Kexkemetti - in original: Kecskem\u00e9ti fr information about the Bible and Kabbalah.\u003cbr\u003eThe rabbi\u0027s\u00a0nephew\u0027s father-in-law, Professor Karl Mannheim was an expert in Generational Theory (and their\u00a0 reconstructed letters - hinted at in diaries - will be also included why he decided not to use the Sunspot Level Matrix in his texts.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer Uncle\u00a0 (called Daniel Csanyi) wanted to assassinate in 1844 the rebel leader Kossuth (as this was the wish of the Habsburg party: Chancellor Metternich and Szechenyi. (He served 6 years in prison later.) /This generation of 1844-1860 - Adaptive, Sisterly - contains Verlaine, Nietzsche, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Freud, Dreyfuss\u00a0 and Archduke Rudolf Habsburg./\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd 45 years before that, in 1799 her ancestress, a Grand-daughter of General Bercsenyi (from another anti-Habsburg rebellion) has married into the Puysegur family - the Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur was a hypnotiseur( psychologist) who has helped Napol\u00e9on in that year in his Putch to become First Consul. Napoleon has\u00a0 then organized an unsuccessful assassination against himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/That is the Transcendental Brotherly 1788- 1808\u00a0 generation: Rossini Schubert, Heine, Pushkin, Hugo, Delacroix /\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Great-Aunts had known two victims of assassinations in their lifetime: Crown Prince Rudolph of Habsburg (who committed suicide and murdered his lover) in 1889 and Serbian King Alexander (a friend of Proust) who was killed in 1934 on the orders of Hitler. And these are also following each other in 44-45 years (around the Sunspot Minimal Years. The Sun Magnetic Switch restarts after two 22 years half cycles each consisting of 11 years\u0027 Decades.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMusic has a stress-diminishing impact. So\u00a0 we can look at the dates of operas premieres in those low sunspot   dates and find our ancestors - or those Kings\u00a0 who ruled them -  among the viewers.  BTW even if it is just a legend , those Kings had to have an impact on our real non-Kingly ancestors (millions of them).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Of course she was just trying to find structures that regularly repeat themselves and have an impact on stress (and hence hormones) - to be inheritable: hence solar magnetic cycles each 44-45 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(She asked informations from the contemporary rabbis. About heir weekly changing Bible reading melodies - that are paralleling opera melodies where we do find our Kingly protagonists - help in this setup to find weekly changing character shifts)\u003cbr\u003eMannheim opposed the idea (from Tchizhevsky) that birth-year sunspot levels have\u00a0 a psychological impact (since proven by statistics of hospitalizations paralleling the four kinds of spot levels: Zero Year, Upwards Years - a period of 3 ys long - , Maximal Year and Downwards Years - 8 ys\u00a0 long.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRabbi Kexkemetti\u00a0 explained how Kabbalists (like Luria and Ashlag rabbis) have used\u00a0 a psychological\u00a0 Code of 4 Levels: Father - Mother- Brother-Sister /each having 3 spheres on a feeling level/. The parenting metaphors are also having a Body Part version: Eye, Ear, Breast and Back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Talmud we hear first about the\u00a0 conquering of the \"evil instinct\" by moving our eyes like in the stress-relief tool \"EMDR\" today imitating REM (Rapid Eye Movements).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on their birth-years people (in this game our ancestors\u00a0 we find by throwing dice)\u00a0 can belong the Sister (Zero Spot) or Back Years and strive to extra Fathering (Upwards-to-Maximal)\u00a0 or Eye images - or Brother (MAximal Spot) years where they have a Mothering (Downwards-to-Minimal Spots) deficit (hence focus on Breast images - painters in these years may produce more Virgin pictures.).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that in a few years we can produce an app from this History Themed board game plan.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support. Or just enjoy the fun of healing your ancestors by EMDR. I live in an ex-Russian Zone, so we are resilient and work without any kind of retribution anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut to start we must get familiar with the Sunspot Levels - their Yearly Average corresponding Level and the Music Hits of those Sunspot Stress Levels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter showing the basic Crisis years in the first 28 posts, from the 29th we will just focus on the Daily Music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I wrote 3 novels\u00a0 in the last 30 years on ancestral inherited hormonal setups (at sfsalvo.com under the pen name Geo Cosmos). (I wrote movie dialogues and songs too besides working decades as a cartoonist and as a cantor.)\u00a0 Now as a pensioner I am planning a Board Game on this topic of ancestral impacts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the only available English language crowdfunding platform in my Ex-Soviet Zone country. I hope to find people who are interested and who will want to be among those who contribute developing this Board Game (or its Mobile version to be more easily accessible.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have found a\u00a0 plan of such a Board Game based on an ancient Kabbalist method (in manuscripts of my rabbinical ancestors) for finding exactly which ancestor\u00a0 Kings /mythic Pharaon avatars/\u00a0 of ours have tried to help find Adam\u0027s Limbs thrown into the Future and create a\u00a0 Messianic /Jesus/ Avatar\u00a0 embodied by\u00a0 kabbalist Rabbis each\u00a0 \u00a0generation (switching generation each week in he blog).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe method is simple: we know that each 44 years there is a full Sun-Magnetic switch completed. At the Low Sunspot Years we have more assassinations (and more sickness and more depression) than in other years. (Especially\u00a0 compared the Maximal Sunspot Years when less sickness happens according to statistics.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Of course the 4 decades are different - like Spring-Summer, Autumn and Winter in the innovation-related decades of the Karl Mannheim\u00a0 Generational Cycles (adapted to America in the book \" Generations\" by Strauss-Howe (1998). But Kabbalists call these different groupings Father- Mother-Brother-Sister levels in their system (with which they translate the Bible to make it more focused on our inner feelings instead of long past legends.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so for each week we have an item from a\u00a0 Year-List\u00a0 from a different Decade of a Generation /of 22 years the Sun Spot restarting point/ and it corresponds to a Biblical melody (which is differently set up each week.)\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the planned Board Game version we get to another King-and-Opera (and Bible Melody) constellation by throwing dice. The four protagonist kings are: Queen and Empress Elisabeth of Austria (b. 1837) and her ancestor King of Prussia, Frederic the Great (b. 1712) and his ancestress Christina of Sweden (b. 1626)\u00a0 and their ancestor Charles V of Spain (b. 1500).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Board Game version was invented by my Great Aunt, who planned to write a novel about her ancestresses (like Countess Elisabeth Bathory the alleged murderess or\u00a0 Princess Barbara Zapolya who is an ancestress of\u00a0 Kings and Queens of Jagellos, Brandenburgers, Habsburgs, Wasas, Medicis and Romanov-Windsors.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo filter (for the novel) the too many ancestors she chose dice-throwing. It is just a metaphore for real life random impacts that are switching\u00a0 in us the inherited ancestral voices or hormonal setups (maybe related to repetitive, hence date-linked music). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe has asked help from the Rabbi of her town (Oradea/V\u00e1rad in Transsylvania) - called Leopold Kexkemetti - and he asked some assitance from his relative, Karl Mannheim, who initiated the Generational Theory (today represented by Strauss-Howe and their disciples.) And they had some discussions with her editor, C\u00e9cile Tormay, who tried to persuade her to leave out the Jewish topics from her future /never finished/ book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom a few letters and a drama version\u00a0 I have inherited from her I do reconstruct the process in my blog of developing the Board Game about our ancestors\u0027 dialogue with messianic hopefuls.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat went wrong in those centuries? (Why did not the Mashiah arrive in the 1500s, 1600s, 1700s and 1800s ?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I do hope that the result will be entertaining (and eventually less complex than the process of reconstructing the Date List of Mannheim). And I also hope it will be\u00a0 helping young people to get aquainted with history - through the generations of our common ancestors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
