After losing his sister Rachel in a tragic car wreck, Ted Silverman must adopt and raise his nephew Cody Silverman. Through a series of events set up by Divine Appointment, Ted comes to faith in Jesus Christ and devotes his life to serving Him. He is a Children\u0027s Church minister and VBS worker who takes up the mantle of Gospelman to entertain and minister to children. However, after an unexpected house fire rescue while in costume, Ted is shaken to his core. Realizing the stark and terrifying reality of every man, woman, and child\u0027s eternal destiny without Christ, Ted continues as his alter ego Gospelman in the hopes of saving some. The Gospelman webcomic first appeared online in 2010. There are plans for both children\u0027s (age 8-12) and young adult (12-18) series, as well as potentially a college \u0026amp; career age (18+) spin-off series without Gospelman. As Christian comics, the age range does not necessarily indicate any inappropriate, immoral content, but simply that the stories and teachings are more appropriate, better understood and more enjoyable to that age range. However, please be aware that certain Biblical teachings are not appropriate or applicable for all age groups. Kids\u0027 lessons about sharing toys would not be appropriate for adults and neither would Bible-based stories about sexual morality and marital faithfulness be appropriate for children. Gospelman Ministries aims to not only entertain, but to encourage Christians of all ages toward Godly living, loving God and all others, through teaching God\u0027s Word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://atthemastersfeet.the-comic.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://atthemastersfeet.webcomic.ws/files/patreon_files/_atmf_book01_front_cover_small.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://atthemastersfeet.webcomic.ws/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAT THE MASTER\u0027S FEET\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"From the Gospels to novels and comics to cartoons, television, and film, you already know the story of the Christ.

He is asking for donations per month so that he may continue to provide Christian webcomics to his readers, among other Christian media entertainment, just as pastors and missionaries require funding to serve Christ in their churches and on the mission field full-time. Many if not all of his Christian webcomics, such as the Gospelman webcomics for example, will always remain free despite any funding or lack thereof, just as a preacher\u0027s sermon remains free apart from tithing. However, readers who become Patreon donors (Patrons) will be rewarded with extra things such as behind-the-scenes material like sketch book drawings, notes, scripts, and scans of the pencils and inks, as well as desktop backgrounds, blog entries, written Bible studies, and all sorts of other extra exclusive digital content as it comes. And the higher you pledge per comic strip or page, the more rewards you get as a Patron. As we pick up more funding support, more reward tiers will eventually be made available. Please see the right side panel and below for more information about our reward tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding will be payment per month. However, because Will Boyer is still tied down to a full-time job and may not be able to update every month, please know that you will continue to receive behind-the-scenes material, blog updates, etc, and that your funding will be directed towards affording to print the FREE series preview containing the GOSPEL message. These books are passed out at comic conventions and periodically given to children\u0027s homes and churches\u0027 youth ministries. Once funding reaches a certain goal amount per month, Lord willing, Will Boyer plans to create Christian comics and other media full-time, all thanks to the Lord and your allowing Him to use you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr To Make A One-Time Donation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/CartoonistWill\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://Gospelman.webcomic.ws/files/donation_buttons/8-2-paypal-donate-button-high-quality-png-thu.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT REWARDS TIERS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers Creators a tier system of rewards to give to their supporters for donating.

Incorrectly believing he was a Christian since his childhood, he came to understand in 1999 at the age of 14 what it truly meant to be a sinner before a righteous God and that he had never personally repented of his sins or asked the Lord to forgive him. Accepting Christ as Savior permanently changed him from the inside out. At the age of 17 on September 3rd, 2002, the Lord called Will Boyer to serve Him, promising that He would one day make him a missionary. From 2003-2007, Will Boyer trained for the mission field at Piedmont Baptist College, now renamed Piedmont International University. Unsure of what to do next, he enrolled at Forsyth Technical Community College and studied in the Digital Effects and Animation Technology major from 2007 to 2010. While there, he received training not only in 2D and 3D animation, but also in digital special effects for live action film and in video game design. Since then he has been illustrating children\u0027s books, self-publishing his own comics, and working for small-time publishing companies. Unfortunately, finances have slowly forced him to mostly withdraw from art in order to work full-time jobs in customer service and warehouse. In the meanwhile, his Biblical studies continue and he attempts to minister to others whenever possible. Most recently, he has been involved with the Forsyth Prison and Jail Ministry as a part of the Calvary Baptist team. Will Boyer does not know the exact future the Lord has for him, but would love to serve Him with the artistic talents and abilities the Lord has given him. He created Gospelman in 2004 while training at Bible college, has been refining the story and characters for years and would like to create the character\u0027s on-going adventures, as well as spin-off series and video games. He is asking for help to afford the printing of books and, Lord willing, allowing him to create Gospelman and other Christian comics and media full-time one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Ministries may, Lord willing, include children\u0027s ministry in costume as Gospelman, convention appearances and book signings for our line of Christian comics, the purchasing and passing out of free literature such as pocket New Testaments and Gospel tracts and copies of Gospelman Ministries\u0027 Christian comics, preaching, jail and prison ministries as an approved member of a local ministry group, the financial supporting of other missionaries and organizations, the addition of ministry team members, and whatever else the Lord would have my ministry team and I do.\u00a0Lord willing, as the per month support increases, we may add on additional creators and/or ministry workers in the future, as well as give monthly support to a new ministry or missionary, etc.\u00a0Updates of my Christian entertainment and ministry progress, as well as the other ministries, missionaries and organizations we support, will be given in Patreon blog posts, whenever possible.
