Well Steve, let me tell you something. Patreon is a great platform for creators and fans to support each other in doing what they love and enjoy.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re streamers. Sometimes even YouTubers. We love making content, engaging with fans, and just making absolutely no sense while we derp our way through any game we play. And so far, our community seems to love it. We\u0027ve had great support and encouragement since day 1. Some of our more dedicated fans have expressed an interest in making a monthly contribution to help fund our nonsense. Unfortunately, we\u0027re not quite at the Twitch partner level of things. So in the meantime... BAM! Patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere you\u0027ll be able to contribute to us on a regular basis. All funds go directly towards the group and content related shenanigans. Upgrades, planning, props, etc. Anything and everything. We have a few goals up, but I mean... I forget what they are already. It\u0027s fine I\u0027ll remember one time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe would love nothing more to provide for our fans full time, and continue growing as a community. Your contributions and support are what will make that possible, and allow us to share with you our... specialness on a more regular basis. Whether its $2 or half a million (hint hint wink wink), we support every single pledge and thank you for all time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso you get some stuff for it, which is nice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e*Merch shop currently WIP and not yet launched\u003cbr\u003e**Current rewards may not be final, and may be expanded in the future\u003c/em\u003e"
