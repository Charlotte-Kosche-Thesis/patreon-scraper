    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHello.  I\u2019m the YouTuber known as Gremlin 1960.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor over 10 years,\nI\u2019ve making a series of videos based on the brake failure clique seen on movies\nand television shows.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat started as a\nstrange hobby turned into a money making project and it seems I\u2019m not the only\none who enjoys these videos.  It seems a\nlot of people like the videos.  My\nYouTube channel gets a couple of new subscribers every week.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m categorizing the\nvideos as a form of art.  Some people\nlike them, and some people don\u2019t.  Some\npeople categorized the videos as a form of porn but since my videos don\u2019t\ninvolve any nudity or sexual situations (a major dealmaker when recruiting new\nmodels), they\u2019re not really porn in any shape or form.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou noticed that my\nusually feature women in the brake failure fantasy.  That\u2019s because my followers and fans prefer\nwomen over men doing the brake failures. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I pointed out in\nmy disclaimers, the women appearing in the videos are not in danger.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  They\nare only pretending as I film them driving and I film the brake pumping scenes\nwhile the car is stationary.  I have been\ninstructed on how the make the brakes pumping more realistic by removing a\nmajor car cylinder which results in the brake pedal sinking to the floor.  I don\u2019t use that procedure because it\ninvolves messing with the brake system for real and since I\u2019m a terrible\nmechanic and I mainly use the model\u2019s own cars for my videos, I\u2019m not going to\nrisk my safety or theirs.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese videos are made\nfor entertainment purposes only and nothing more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving lost a family\nmember to domestic violence, I don\u2019t condone real life violence in any\nform.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also like to point\nout that the women in the videos are over 21 and that I have them sign release\nforms giving me permission to place and sell their likenesses on the\ninternet.  I also allow them to use\naliases for their personal safety.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow the reason I\u2019m\nusing Patreon is that I need money to get more models to do these videos.  The conservative city I live in makes it more\ndifficult for obtain them so I must drive out of town towards a more liberal\ncity to find models.  The women you see\nin these videos (as well as other like videos made by other brake failure and\npedal pumping fans) are not doing these out of the goodness of their hearts.  They expect to be paid for their time. I\nusually pay about $200.00 for them to do the videos.  I also need the funds to buy the models new\nshoes that are needed for the shoot.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s getting to the\npoint I can no longer use money from my day job paycheck to pay them due to\nother financial obligations.  So I asking\nfor patrons to help me come up with the funds to constantly find new models and\npay my current ones so I can create and post more videos on a regular\nbasis.  \u003cbr\u003e"
