     "about": "First of all, I\u0027m a musical entertainer and love doing it. I DJ at different public and private events, produce and edit music, and compose/create with other artists. It\u0027s my premiere passion, and the primary motivation of my work.  But there\u0027s another thing I\u0027m passionate about: people.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always volunteered my time to various causes whether it\u0027s the Cancer Society, summer camp for kids, or benevolent causes in the community.  I feel that it\u0027s not only a personally rewarding experience, but it\u0027s also a way to connect with your community and make a large scale difference for humanity.  After I finished school, I dreamed of being able to contribute to society in a very practical way that would significantly impact individuals with challenges in their lives, whether disability, financial hardship or the occurence of a traumatic event.  Everyone needs a hand: but I found it difficult to connect with an organization that I felt I identified with in vision, and how to carry it out.  Thankfully, time and experience have exposed me to many great ways of contributing that are non-traditional, and relevant to a rapidly changing environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this is a different approach, but it\u2019s exciting! The world of cryptocurrency has made a way to serve the community without a throttle from figureheads deciding where to appropriate funds and ciphen small amounts for fees and other hidden uses. And the benefit is, that by partnering in this program one has the opportunity to turn their shared rewards into spendable currency anywhere they choose. I\u2019m very pleased to be able to offer this opportunity to people who wish to donate to causes, but hesitate because of uncertainty as to where and how their contribution is being used in the real world.\u003cbr\u003e",
