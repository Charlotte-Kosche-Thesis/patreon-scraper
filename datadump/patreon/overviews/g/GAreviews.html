And of course your help won\u0027t go unnoticed, we have a bunch of rewards for people who donate as low as $1! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition we will also be improving our content for everyone as we reach certain community goals and milestones! With enough funding we plan on making the channel an even better experience for everyone. So rest assured that any dollar you donate to us not only helps us (and gives you some dope perks) but also helps everyone else in the community as well by bringing us closer to completing those milestones!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money that you donate goes straight back into our content, like better equipment, travel expenses, giveaways, etc... Everything that we have already done is because of your continued support. G\u0026amp;A Reviews is working hard to be a better version of ourselves everyday and we hope you\u0027ll join us for the ride!!!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
