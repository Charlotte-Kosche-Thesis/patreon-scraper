    "summary": "I love faith sharing with everyone, which is why I do the Go Live Your Faith podcast. I do it on a regular basis so that I continue to share the Word and what it does to me. I also share what\u0027s happening in my life, because if I am going through something, perhaps someone else is as well. However, running a podcast takes time and money, and while I am happy to do the podcast, I could always use help in funding the hosting for the podcast. Something as simple as a $1 a podcast helps me to fund this podcast for the hosting, and allows me the opportunity to get new equipment to product a better podcast for you. After all, this podcast is created for you to enjoy, and I am privileged to be able to bring it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can set limits on how much you wish to sponsor, also. For example, say you are wanting to sponsor for $5 a podcast, but only want to sponsor on a weekly basis, then set your limit to $25, which allows for those months that have five weeks in them. It\u0027s entirely up to you. I thank you for being here on my Patreon page, and remember: The journey does not end when you accept Jesus into \u00a0your live, it begins. Go Live Your Faith today!"
