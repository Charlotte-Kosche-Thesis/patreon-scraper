    "summary": "Hi, Everyone! This is Cecil Trachenburg from Good Bad Flicks, and welcome to my Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings have changed since I first started my Patreon. Good Bad Flicks is a YouTube show that I\u0027ve been doing for several years now. Originally, it started as a fun little side thing I was doing to introduce obscure movies to some friends. As more people started watching, I began to take it more seriously. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, the show has evolved, and I\u0027ve incorporated more content to it. I\u0027m now covering old, new, mainstream, and obscure movies. Also, since I\u0027m a huge gamer, I\u0027ve been including a good bit of gaming-related content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has been a great help to keep me going, but now I need it more than ever. After losing my freelance job with The Escapist and YouTube\u0027s ad revenue plummeting, its incredibly difficult for a small channel like me to keep going. (more on this in the video above)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027m not going to start charging for content; that\u0027s not what this is about. I\u0027m just putting this here as a sort of virtual tip jar. If you like my content and would like me to be able to continue, throw me a few bucks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not some big league YouTube hotshot...yet. Since this is the case, your support is greatly needed and appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to think that I\u0027ve put out some of my best material in the last few months. It\u0027s an uphill battle getting noticed on YouTube, but I\u0027m slowly getting there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my Good Bad Flicks and Exploring episodes on YouTube. I\u0027m also churning out reviews of movies currently in theaters and VOD.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on more WTF videos, video game recommendations, Good Bad Games, Good Bad TV, and anything else I think you folks will enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve fine tuned the rewards, but I\u0027m always looking for ways to make them more appealing. If you have any ideas, feel free to suggest them to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you for your support. I love making these videos, and this helps me to continue doing so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
