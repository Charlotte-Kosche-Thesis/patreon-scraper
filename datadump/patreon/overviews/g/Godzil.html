    "summary": "Your pledge will support my effort on two of my biggest project:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- The first one, named Project Madeline, which is to reverse-engineering and document the Bandai WonderSwan, and to make a proper hardware, like flash or SD based card, and clone of some of the components using in the original hardware to not have the need to use existing part for building new hardware. With the ultimate goal to make an FPGA clone of the WonderSwan (Color) able to play real cartridge, all of that\u00a0for the preservation of that handled console.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- My second project is a retake on the Oric floppy drive emulator, the Cumulus. The original version, from a different creator, suffered a number of issue that needed to be fixed, and after he stopped working on it, I took the project over and started to work of bug fixing and enhancing it, which is currently a complete revamp of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSupporting me will also allow me to work faster and on more project. I\u0027m not hiding that I may directly sell some of my projects once finished, but I\u0027m not doing that for money, but because working on them cost me a lot of money and a lot of time. On of my goal for both project is to make them as cheap as possible\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour donations will help compensate for my personal expenses related to research and development on my projects, unfortunately, electronic project tend to cost a lot, and you will help me to go work faster on them!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of my design and software are and will be OpenSource, all of them can be found here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/986-studio\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://github.com/986-studio\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eI also post some news on my own blog here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.986-studio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.986-studio.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can found here the current state of the two project:\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.986-studio.com/category/electronic/game-console/wonderswan/wonder-project/wondermadeleine/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eProject Madeleine\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.986-studio.com/category/retro-computing/oric/cumulus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOric Cumulus HW 2\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eI\u0027m going to planning to do approximately one update per month here, but in case I go crazy in updating and post more than that, don\u0027t forget to put cap your pledge if you don\u0027t want to pay too much ;)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
