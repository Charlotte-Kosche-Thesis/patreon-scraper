    "summary": "Hello, Kevin the mailroom boy here. We want to buy more short stories so we can produce a story podcast at least once a month that takes you on an adventure to a time that never was. And furthermore, we want to be able to pay the nice people that keep sending in those stories a better rate than a penny a word. That\u0027s where we need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more you pledge, the more stories we can buy to add to the gallery, and the authors will get paid a better rate. And better rates attract better stories. Our goal is to be able to buy stories at 6 cents per word, which is the current SFWA pro rate threshold and give the narrators an honorarium. As of this launch, we are buying original stories at 1.5 cents per word and reprints at 1 cent per word. Our narrators and production team are not being paid at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGallery of Curiosities is a speculative fiction anthology podcast of the weird, curious, and horrible. We have a strong but not exclusive preference for steampunk themes. Our stories are presented by Osgoode, a character in the tradition of late night TV movie hosts from the days before cable. The show is available for free download through most any podcather. Ebooks issues are available through our website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gallerycurious.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egallerycurious.com\u003c/a\u003e, and print copies are available on Amazon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
