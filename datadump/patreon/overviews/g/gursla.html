    "summary": "I\u2019m an abstract painter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI received a BFA from Washington University, where I studied glass blowing, painting, and printmaking more than 20 years ago. I\u2019ve now decided that it\u2019s time to go back to my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I left school, life\u2019s circumstances took over the direction of my career. I went to work as an assistant photo editor for several magazines, and then for ABCnews online which led me into a career in advertising. At the same time, I started a family and have been raising three amazing kids. What I haven\u2019t been doing is painting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a guttural desire to paint. When I paint, every line, every stroke, every blend of oil paint has a feeling. My work combines self-aware gestures and dream-logic narratives to produce images that are woven, textural and layered like the stories that transcend time and culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learn and work differently than most people; a limitation that has always undermined my success in a traditional workplace. After many, many, years trying to navigate work situations where I struggled to fit in, I\u2019ve decided to change direction and focus on my artistic career. I\u2019ve started teaching art in public school after-school programs and spend the rest of my workday painting in my studio. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art career is moving in a great direction, but it\u2019s a huge challenge. An intrinsic part of being able to make my paintings is having an office (studio) space to work, and it\u2019s expensive. So, I\u2019m hoping that you will consider helping me get my artistic career off the ground through a monthly pledge toward my studio rent. Every level of support is meaningful and appreciated! Check out the perks available in the column to the right to learn about what you will received at each level. Thank you for being a part of my work, and I hope to see you in the studio!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
