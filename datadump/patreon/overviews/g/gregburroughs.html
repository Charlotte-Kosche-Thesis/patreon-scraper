    "summary": "My name is Greg Burroughs. I grew up in the small town of Lebanon, OH and I\u0027ve been lucky enough to get to live my dream of playing music for a living, while also getting to travel all over this country for the better part of the last decade. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking back at all the people I\u0027ve met, the places I\u0027ve seen and the experiences I\u0027ve had, it\u0027s hard to imagine where I would be and the person I would be today without all of that. It\u0027s incredibly humbling and rewarding. That being said it certainly hasn\u0027t always been an easy trail. There\u0027s been plenty of dark times when there didn\u0027t appear to be a light at the end of the tunnel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently been presented with a new light by joining a band out of Southern California, called The Brevet. My desire for a new challenge and even further fulfillment has pushed me to take the leap to begin touring with them and making a move to join their band. This requires me to move my residence to Southern California, where the cost of living will be much greater for me. I will have less freedom over my income sources, and I will be further apart from my family in Ohio and my carefully curated Nashville community I\u0027ve grown comfortable in over the last decade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My hope is that I can again lean on my group of faithful and tireless supporters once again to help pull me through this transition and eventually land in a more comfortable place where I can not only continue to tour and create with The Brevet, but also to write and create music of my own in the style and sound I\u0027ve been honing over my life as a musician. I can\u0027t thank you enough for your time and support. I know how valuable it is to us all and it humbles me greatly that you would even consider subscribing to my page. I want this to be an open forum that we can refine and make better and spread the word on. I encourage your feedback, and I would love for you to help me get the word out and I greatly look forward to where we can go with this journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreg"
