When the coin flip turned out in my favor, I vowed never to look back. I saw a therapist and soon got into exercising and lifting in a huge way. At my heaviest I weighed sixty pounds more than I did when I started lifting, and I loved it. Exercise and lifting weights has been massively empowering for me, and I feel prouder and more comfortable in my body now than I ever have before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I graduated college, I became certified as a personal trainer and have since done my best to help others find the same level of empowerment that I found for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExercise should be about feeling good in your body. Lift more, lift faster, run faster, run further, gain muscle, and above all: move better and have fun. Unfortunately, for so much of the fitness industry, it\u2019s all about losing weight. Get smaller. Lose size. Get weaker. Look better. If that\u2019s your goal, that\u2019s amazing. But the industry as it is tries to force so many people to lose weight rather than focusing on more measurable and meaningful markers of fitness success. In short, exercise should be fun, and we should feel empowered by it rather than drained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere are not many in the fitness industry who preach this message. In fact, most work on body positivity comes from outside the industry, making it hard for these two spheres to interact. I want to bridge that gap. I want to help change the fitness industry and make it more accessible and understandable to outsiders. I want everyone to be able to enjoy fitness.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter three years as a successful trainer, I quit my job because I\u2019m fed up with it. I\u2019m fed up with fitness industry posturing and drama. Instead, I want to change it. I\u2019ll now be going full freelance, which means that \u003cstrong\u003eyour support\u003c/strong\u003e can give me the ability to support myself and spread my message full time. Weekly, I\u0027m writing blog posts about how to get the most out of your fitness. Each day, I\u0027m posting update videos on my Youtube channel and talking over whatever topics I feel like that day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will get a free booklet with a broad overview of my philosophy and a basic workout plan that is customizable to your own needs, as well as access to my Patreon only feed, where I\u2019ll post new articles and resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"936\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/erEbjDelZyrJ4BhaQdQ6E4UhdaboMcLZ3lx2oEAOJ5F46aeFKOEty5CtLOnt6psiwKwS4MAQnFiuwk_fatC8yZssL0cqxCfJWydTA4ysg6qnF8GMwr9hTEi9G-Way4Mb2hC-FgU\" width=\"624\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 backers\u003c/strong\u003e get an updated copy of my first book, The UpLift Method, which lays the groundwork for my fitness philosophy.

You\u2019ll also gain access to a basic nutrition plan tailored to you and designed to help you reach your fitness goals.
