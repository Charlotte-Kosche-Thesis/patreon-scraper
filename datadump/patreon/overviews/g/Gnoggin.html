Lockstin is me being me, I take you to my universe where share thoughts on stuff and things. Gnoggin is the main and fancy series which looks in depth at video game lore and science and develops theories and considers whether fantasy worlds hold any realism. It\u0027s very important work, and 104% a real job KEVIN!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeeky entertainment, often surrounded in a shell of learning is what my channel is all about! And while I am focused on gaming, other topics can rise up too. Like movies, TV, comics, and whatever the heck I want. (or you, because I take suggestions.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have a team?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eYes! Which is why we need all the help we can get! While the Lockstin show is primarily just me and sometimes the help of one other editor, \u003cstrong\u003eGnoggin has a small crew behind it! \u003c/strong\u003eA team of me, 3 occasional writers, about 3 part-time editors, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eand even 1 full-time editor! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s thanks to the \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003ePatreon funding received so far!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u00a0The part time guys are not always working on something all at once, but they help when they can, and I like paying them a good amount for their troubles. As a result though,\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eI\u0027ve been posting some videos at a \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eloss\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, meaning I lose money by making them. And even when I do make a profit, it only comes out to about me making $4 an hour, and that\u0027s before I pay those who helped me with the video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"But then why do you make them this way then?\" you may ask, and the answer is that I\u0027m hoping that someday it will pay off, as I build a relationship with my viewers the channel will grow, and eventually every video will be profitable, (especially with the help of sponsors and patreon). In the meantime though, this is why I am asking for your help through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time goes on, YouTube has been paying out less and less, though it\u0027s not entirely their fault, as the competition rises, the big get bigger and the small, smaller, plus adblock has become more and more prevalent. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eAdblock is actually one of the main reasons Patreon was created\u003c/span\u003e, so that people can support creators they enjoy, while also blocking pesky ads. Ad\u0027s suck, I get it, but it\u0027s what let\u0027s me make all these videos, well that and Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eSo how can I help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs much as I hate asking or even begging for money, your Patreon support is needed, and VERY appreciated! I\u0027m honestly astonished that so many people are willing to pay for the content I make. The first reward tier is something I\u0027ve seen other people on Patreon do, \"AdBlock Forgiveness.\" Essentially at this tier you can use all the AdBlock you want and still be supporting the creators you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are higher tiers as well, but like I said, I hate asking for money, especially so much. Every bit helps, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eeven if you can only give $0.50!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e it all adds up and lets me keep doing what I and my team do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what exactly is the money used for?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eGood question! and since it is your money you deserve the right to know. Patreon money, along with my other revenue streams, get put into paying my bills, and paying my editors and writers first of all. But when there is leftover funding, more often than not, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI put it back into the show! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBut what do I mean by that? Well, upgraded editing and lighting equipment, as well as commissioning artists and animators who are far better than I to spice up the show! As you can imagine though, this is all very expensive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my stretch goals here on Patreon is to be able to hire an editor full time, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWhich I have done now thanks to your help and the channel growing\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! Also\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e I\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e would love to drop most sponsorships\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003ealtogether, but right now they pay to keep the show running. But if I can have enough of your help here on Patreon, I can drop them! which will drastically improve the show I\u0027m sure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eBut what do I get out of it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell my show of which you are a fan of will stay up first of all. But you can also get access to my patron feed at Tier 2, which will include the occasional survey where I can ask you all what you would like to see in the future. Also as a Patreon supporter you can message me on Patreon, which is a much more reliable way to contact me. YouTube comments are too many to read them all now, so Patreon is the way to go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt Tier 3 you will see early video access in your Patreon feed. Sometimes I\u0027ll have videos uploaded a few days or even a week before they become public, so as a Tier 3 supporter you can see the links to these videos, and leave early comments! (you can always be one of the first!) This way I will have to see your YouTube comment on the video, and you can even leave feedback about what you liked or didnt like! I\u0027m still learning, and love some constructive criticism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd at Tier 4 you get a HUGE thank you! as well as your name in the credits, and it doesnt have to be your Patreon username, just shoot me a message of what you want to be credited as and I will happily oblige. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo have I convinced you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf not, I understand,\u00a0I don\u0027t want to force anyone into doing this if they cant or don\u0027t want to. I\u0027m simply here asking for help. All of your support is greatly appreciated, not just here, but also your viewership on YouTube. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
