I am a blogger about games and general geekery over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gamergirlconfessions.blogspot.com/\"\u003eGamer Girl Confessions\u003c/a\u003e.

This podcast documents my pole dancing journey, mixed with a bit of what I do best\u2014geek/nerd out! While focused specifically around pole dancing, there will be mention of fashion, beauty, and geeky and nerdy topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a podcast addict, I haven\u0027t found nearly enough podcasts out there in regard to pole dancing, erotic dancing, pole fitness, stripper life (I\u0027m not a stripper, but I support our sisters who made it okay for us to do this for fun!), etc. I felt that as I was going through my pole journey, I wanted to document it, and share it with others, but combining it with my gaming and geekery things seemed as if it would get lost in the shuffle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy everything about pole dancing. I started September 23, 2016 as a way to find a new hobby, and I gained so much more than that! I enjoy all styles of pole dance\u2014pole fitness, sexy pole, lyrical pole, and I absolutely adore sexy floor/dance work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e_________________________________________________________\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this an effective charity?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is absolutely \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e an effective charity.

Money mainly goes towards podcasting costs (supplies, hosting costs, etc.) and purchasing products to review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than that, this helps to supplement my income and helps to pay off my wonderful school debts earlier than intended, hopefully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill this lead to the production of more content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe content I create is something I do in my free time outside of my day-to-day job.
