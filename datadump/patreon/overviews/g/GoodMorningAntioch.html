    "summary": "So how did we get here? For a time, I found myself working for one of the most-evil corporations in the Galaxy. I won\u2019t say which one,( you know, in case they want to buy the show) But believe me when I say the callous disregard for the rank and file cubicle jockeys was the general norm. I had an opportunity to completely turn on a dime. So, I jumped at it. But I always knew I\u2019d do something with those crazy stories I\u2019d accumulated over the years.\u003cbr\u003eI have always been a science fiction junkie. Some people are Star Wars nerds some are Star Trekkies, I am definitely a lover of both. Growing up, seeing women who looked like me in science fiction was rare. Obviously, Nichelle Nichols from the Original Series comes to mind for most of us, but by the time I was coming up the show wasn\u2019t on the air anymore. In the mid 90\u2019s the standout I can remember was Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan in Star Trek TNG showing up occasionally to give some sage advice, and that is it. Then some years later seeing Angela Bassett in Strange Days, and then again in Supernova, gave me glimpses of something that could be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is for Good Morning Antioch to be exactly the kind of show that I\u2019ve always wanted to be in as an actress, and exactly the kind of show I wished to see growing up. Silly, Nerdy and SciFi heavy.\u00a0 \u00a0And as the Science Fiction landscape is finally starting to regularly include people who look like me, I am excited to be a part of that change. I hope to be the Guinan for some nerdy kid out there who\u2019s looking for that inspiration as we continue to grow this universe for a long time to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I wanted to be on Patreon as a way to connect directly with people who feel the same way and Thank them personally for all the support as we grow this world together!\u00a0"
