    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo you\u0027ve found the GlenSkunk Patreon Page 2.0! Congratulations!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon of Skunky Shenanigans! Here, you can support me in my efforts to create a wide variety of weird and wonderful artworks, ranging from kinky sketches to fantastical landscape paintings, and just about everything in between. This Patreon is primarily here as a tip jar in case you wish to help support me. If you like my work and would like to encourage me to keep at it, this can be handy, even if you can\u0027t pledge too much - every dollar helps out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy make a Patreon at all?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI made this Patreon not as a way to earn an entire living - I have my own career goals after all - but rather as a way of letting you show your appreciation for my artwork however you want. As such, I can afford to be more relaxed about my goals here, as well as getting myself to make more work to amuse everyone with! I want us all to have FUN in this Patreon first and foremost; the money you support me with will be more of a fun added bonus rather than the entire point of the Patreon. At the same time, you won\u0027t ever be obligated or required to pledge to see new work from me; this will be to offer tips, donations or whatever you\u0027d like to call them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will this Patreon support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGood question! I\u0027d like to think that by supporting this Patreon, you\u0027re helping me to create more art and better art, more for everyone to enjoy! More specifically:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll be supporting my special art streaming events, such as the Doodle Fair and seasonal specials, for both you and your friends!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll be supporting my purchase of art materials - art software, brush packs, canvases, paints, pencils, etc. - that will allow me to really explore what I can do, as well as make the best art I possibly can!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll be providing me with ideas and inspiration for my work, allowing me to expand my horizons and do work that you and I can find exciting and stimulating!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll be letting me know that you appreciate the work I do enough to offer up some cash - that can be pretty motivating!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will this Patreon NOT be?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, there are some things that I will never use my Patreon for. I want to ensure that you have the best possible time here, but at the same time I want to ensure that those who are unable to support this Patreon for one reason or another aren\u0027t left completely out in the cold. To that end, here\u0027s a few things that this Patreon will NOT be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis Patreon will NOT act like a paywall or paysite - any work that I post here will also be posted to my other websites freely, so you\u0027re never obliged to pay up to see new work from me.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis Patreon will NOT act as a way of obtaining commissions - by not having a specific commission slot, I ensure that a broad range of people can commission me freely, thus giving me a broader range of ideas to draw too!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
