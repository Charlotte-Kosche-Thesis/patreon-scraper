    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Ghost Lady\u2019s ghosts  \u003cbr\u003e\nthe private collection\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWant to read something really scary? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eStill here? Okay, I\u2019ve come to be known on the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where I\u2019ve lived for the past 26 years, as the \u201cghost lady\u201d. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt started with a slate of guided walking tours. Two out of the three \u201cdown Island towns\u201d were strictly historical, \u201cfun historical\u201d, or so I hoped: \u201cFrom Campmate to Cathouse: The Sacred and Profane Oak Bluffs\u201d; \u201cLife Styles of the Rich and Dead of Vineyard Haven\u201d and, for the third, the straight-forward \u201cGhosts of Edgartown\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest crowds turned out for the ghoulies and ghosties of Edgartown. I quickly threw in the [educational] towel and featured ghosts for all three towns. Along the way, being a writer and a journalist, I lucked into a long-term deal with Down East Books of Camden, Maine. \u201cHaunted Island\u201d was the first work to be published, followed by \u201cThe Ghosts of Boston Town,\u201d then a gossipy, goofy book \u201cVineyard Confidential\u201d that contains a few dark tales including one about two arsonist spirits from the 1890s who may have set fire in 2001 to the manor house in which they\u2019d lived over 100 years before; and finally, \u201cVineyard Supernatural\u201d. In 2014, a 20-year anniversary edition of \u201cHaunted Island\u201d appeared. All these books are still in print and available in Vineyard bookstores and on Amazon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u2019s the eerie part. Once I made a niche of true ghost stories, I started to get haunted myself. You know the law of attraction, right? In this case, I would just as soon these players from the Other Side would leave me alone, but I began to see myself for what I was: A ghost magnet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u2019s a continuing column / blog about my own encounters of the third kind \u2014 or would this be the fourth kind? And hey!, if you\u2019d care to take your laptop outside, build a campfire, and toast some marshmallows as you read, that could \u201cdouble the flavor, double the fun.\u201d (If you remember that old jingle, you\u2019re as old as I am).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, here\u2019s a clip someone once filmed during one of my ghost tours and mounted on Youtube. It\u2019s very dark, as walks along haunted lanes tend to be, but please take a peek so that we\u2019re properly introduced, then get those marshmallows melting while I tell you a whopper. A \u003cem\u003etrue\u003c/em\u003e whopper.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
