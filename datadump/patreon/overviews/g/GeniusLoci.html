Although I cut my teeth with the 3rd edition of a certain famous RPG about delving into Dungeons and slaying Dragons I have fallen in love with the OSR movement and the game of yore. Since 2013 I\u0027ve run the content heavy blog of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://geniuslocigames.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGenius Loci\u003c/a\u003e which typically features a wide array of monsters, magics, classes, races ... and Adventures. I am also the owner and only writer of Genius Loci Games with over 16 well-received products under my belt, one successful kickstarter, and one soon to be released adventure by a major Pathfinder 3pp.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I Doing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort form adventures are that are typically low-level and quick to play (typically a 2-hour session worth of material) adventures that range from 1 to 10 pages in length. Sometimes these adventures feature public domain maps, sometimes creative commons maps and sometimes maps by myself, and on occasion original or stock art. The majority of the short form adventures that I will be doing are for OSR (particularly \u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/product/86546/Swords-and-Wizardry-Complete-Rule-Book\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSwords \u0026amp; Wizardry\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/product/93797/Xplorers-RPG-FREE-No-Art-Version\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eX-Plorers\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/product/148169/White-Star-White-Box-Science-Fiction-Roleplaying-Swords--Wizardry\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhite Star\u003c/a\u003e), \u003ca href=\"https://sentientgames.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/shadowhack.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShadowhack\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/product/144558/Mini-Six-Bare-Bones-Edition\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMini-Six\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/product/153066/Fantasy-AGE-Basic-Rulebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAGE\u003c/a\u003e, and 5e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere the Money Goes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money earned through patreon will go into the same bucket as my indie publishing earning go. That is to say back into the pool to create content, afford artwork, layout for content, and to aid in getting materials (such as source books and OGL licensed products) to help the creation process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal\u003c/strong\u003e ...\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to produce 3 to 5 short form adventures a month and to continue to improve the production and design quality of my adventures as well as better hone my skills as a tabletop game designer."
