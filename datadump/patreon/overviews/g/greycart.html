Our team consists of:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEthan Moody (I go by Moody) - Founder, high level programmer, and PR manager\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBrento Bento - Japanese to English translator\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJesus Mora (goes by RoyalityKnight) - Low level programmer\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGii - Pixel artist\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlejandro Jimenez (goes by Aru) - English to Spanish translator\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brought us to Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eInitially, we were doing all of our development on GitHub which left a lot out in the open. We came to the conclusion that we should own and operate our own private git server. We all agreed that a Patreon for our projects would help with the purchase and upkeep of the hardware necessary to run a server 24/7. Fans of the Megami Tensei series also expressed their gratitude and interest in our first project (SMT Trading Card: Card Summoner) stating that if we had a Patreon, they\u0027d be willing to chip in a little bit per month to see us work on games that had not been translated yet. Ultimately, this was the final nail in the coffin for getting us to go forward with a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service where you can pledge to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support themselves and keep making new stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I end up paying?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou pay once a month. We strive to provide multiple progress updates per month, but if for any reason we don\u0027t have a single thing to show for the month, we will not charge you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe money from Patreon will be going directly into upkeep and maintenance of our private git server as well as the cups of coffee necessary to keep our team members going. Keeping our server up and running 24/7 ensures maximum productivity which means more updates for our patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor just $1 a month, our patrons will receive exclusive updates on any progress made to our projects ranging from minor details to large changes. This patronage also enrolls you into giveaways we\u0027ll be hosting. More information on those will be made available to patrons after their first payment is processed which typically happens at the beginning of the month."
