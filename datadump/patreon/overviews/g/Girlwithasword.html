    "summary": "THANK YOU for joining me here on this incredibly motivating and inspiring platform of sharing! I\u0027m SO exciting to be on this journey with you. Thank you for your time and love an energy - let\u0027s see what magic we can make together! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a fiber artist and professional mess-maker. I\u0027m obsessed, yes, I\u0027ll say it - obsessed! With exploring the beauty, mystery, and science of the intersection of plants/fiber/color/texture. I\u0027ve been a herb shop owner for almost two decades now, and have enjoyed playing with and learning about plants for years. Around 14 years ago I started throwing fiberarts into the mix and it has been a heady explosion of playing ever since then. I\u0027m passionate about supporting local farmers and purchasing local fiber, and using a wide variety of local (and exotic) plants in my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m at a place in my artistic exploration now where I can really feel things popping. I\u0027ve learned enough to know that I have SO MUCH MORE to learn, and I want to go on this journey with YOU. I intend to use this as a platform to help fund research that I will share with YOU. I have also learned through teaching textile arts classes that my students inspire me HUGELY, and are always thinking outside the box, so I am also relishing your questions, suggestions and input as we go on this trip together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a spectacular amount of bad, BAD information on natural dyes on the internet - and a lot of good info. I find it overwhelming, sometimes, frankly, but part of what I want to do is narrow it down. I want this page to be a resource of success for you! Learn from my failures, and my successes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do this! \u003cbr\u003e"
