My name is Eloise and I\u0027m a Melbourne-based illustration and comics artist, writer, poet and generally unemployable art person with a heart of (mainly) gold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect to find on my Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiary comics that are not-quite-diary-comics and are more like poetry. Poetry that is more like a diary and less like a poem. Pithy stories full of untempered emotion and moderate nudity. Things that attempt to cram my many many interests into the same creative basket: collage works that intermingle photos, drawings, poetry, paintings, overheard snippets from strangers, weird things I find on the street. Riverdale fan art. Hopefully stories with an insight into the drudgery of modern life that don\u0027t totally suck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect not to find on my Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny sense of knowing who I am or what I am or what I\u0027m doing with my life.

Your wonderful contributions will help me with the bottom line of my practice\u2014to buy art supplies (expensive) develop photographs (expensive) and print zines (very expensive). You will receive bountiful rewards and also the warm fuzzies that come along with helping an artist to achieve their dreams.
