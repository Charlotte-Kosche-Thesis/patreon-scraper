    "summary": "HERE\u2019S THE DEAL: I write one tabletop or live roleplaying game a month. It will be no bigger than one side of A4 paper (that\u2019s one side of letter paper, for you American types) and I will do all the art, layout and design myself in pen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO ARE YOU?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Grant Howitt. I\u0027ve written games such as Goblin Quest, Unbound, One Last Job, Zombie LARP, and more. I co-wrote the latest edition of Paranoia. Odds are, if you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027ve played at least one of my games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write lots of roleplaying games, but I don\u2019t want to get tied into big ongoing projects that need a lot of art, playtesting, development and design to get into a finished state - I\u0027ve got enough of those on the go as it is. Plus, I like arbitrary creative challenges. To that end: this means I get to keep writing games, and you get to read them, and everyone\u2019s happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, keeping them short means that I won\u2019t run into problems on postage and packaging, which has really caused me some trouble in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT CAN I GET IN EXCHANGE FOR MY CONTRIBUTION?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll be releasing the games for free online, so you get the warm satisfaction of helping get more roleplaying games into the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOWEVER for a low, low fee I will SEND YOU a personally signed copy of each and every one-page roleplaying game I write, which will contain a SECOND PAGE (printed on the back) with Patreon-exclusive, never-digitally-released stuff. Stuff like scenarios, alternative/additional rules, characters, adversaries, short stories, additional artwork, etc. Maybe it\u2019ll be a whole other game! Who knows. We\u2019ll see what happens on any given month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT SORT OF GAME CAN I EXPECT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lookrobot.co.uk/games/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u2019s a link to my games portfolio\u003c/a\u003e, which has downloads for such titles as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGoblin Quest, where you die over and over whilst trying to achieve basic tasks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHavoc Brigade, where you burn down a city trying to sneak into it\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDoctor Magnethands, a drinking/shouting/roleplaying game\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrunken Bear Fighter, where, well, you can probably work out what you do\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne Last Job, where you\u2019re brought back in for a final heist\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWarrior-Poet, where you duel using haiku\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExodus, where you leave home and lose yourself in the process\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRoyal Blood, where you hijack loose magic from the Major Arcana\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy games are, in general: short, punchy, well-written, and exciting. Over the last six years of writing I\u2019ve become more serious and less silly, so expect to see a mix of tones ranging from introspective and heartbreaking to daft and explosive. I\u2019ll always strive to innovate and offer something original or surprising in each game.\u003cbr\u003e"
