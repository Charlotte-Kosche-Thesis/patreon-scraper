    "summary": "Hey there, I\u2019m Luba from the Gymnovosti website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing and translating stuff about gymnastics since 2012, for all sorts of blogs, and in May 2016 I created Gymnovosti.\u003cbr\u003eThe English version of the website brings you updates on gymnastics from Russia and other post-Soviet countries (and a bit from Israel, too) and it also has the gymnastics pronunciation database. The Russian version of the website provides coverage of gymnastics from around the world to gymnerds in Russia who don\u2019t read English.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a huge gymnerd and I want to know ALL THE THINGS about gymnastics and gymnasts and I know that many of you are like that, too. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been translating interviews by Russian-speaking gymnasts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a native Russian speaker, I was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in Russia. I was never a gymnast, but I come from a family of athletes and used to be an athlete as a child, so I am familiar with the Soviet and Russian sports training system. Living abroad and being immersed in another culture gives me a certain perspective that allows me to understand what things about Russian culture might seem weird to foreigners and how to explain them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a PhD student in linguistics and work on the website in my spare time, spending my own money on everything I need to run it. While I intend to continue doing that and don\u2019t expect to profit from the website in any way, your support would help me do many more wonderful things for the gymnastics fans.\u003cbr\u003eSome of the future plans include going to competitions in Russia to cover them and doing interviews with Russian-speaking gymnasts and coaches.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe articles on my website will always be free, but the Patreon supporters will get something else as a thank you.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve got several memoirs by Russian and Soviet gymnasts including Svetlana Khorkina, Larisa Latynina and Nellie Kim. None of them were ever translated to English (and likely won\u2019t be). Every week I will post one chapter from one of the books here, available only to the Patrons. I am currently alternating between\u00a0\u00a0\u003cem\u003eFlick Flacks in High Heels\u003c/em\u003e by Svetlana Khorkina and\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBalance\u003c/em\u003e by Larisa Latynina. Once those are finished, the patrons will be able to vote which memoir will be translated next.\u003cbr\u003e"
