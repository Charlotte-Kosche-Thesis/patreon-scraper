    "summary": "Hello and welcome to Genealogy Journaling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your interest in Genealogy Journaling!\u00a0 Having a group of people interested in the same topic is fantastic and very motivational.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a couple parts to Genealogy Journaling, my hope is you will be interested in one or the other or both and join me on this adventure.\u00a0 My ultimate goal is to help you not only discover your past but be encouraged and motivated to document both your past and your present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Part 1 \u2013 Writing the Past\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began my genealogical adventure on New Years Day 2017 with very little information to go on. Within a short time, I became overwhelmed, frustrated, and confused not to mention broke from registering on all the various sites to obtain information. The frustration was in the fact that not a single person on either side of my family, anywhere in any of the lines wrote down anything. \u003cbr\u003eSome of the research has been easy but all I have in the end are names and dates which is boring if you want to tell a story. That is where my idea of Genealogy Journaling began. We will work through a plethora of ideas to help you tell your families story. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Part 2 \u2013 Writing the Present\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve never been a \u201cjournaler\u201d or a dear diary person. After experiencing the lack of stories and information from my ancestors it became clear to me that no matter what my story is, I need to tell it. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to write down everything I do every day, but I need to document my adventures through life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon I will share videos and blog posts about my adventures, ideas on writing your past and present, and ideas for presenting your stories.\u00a0 There will be contests and challenges throughout the year to help motivate us and reviews of resources.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also a blog and a Facebook group to complement this Patreon site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s get creative in telling our stories for the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has a story; every story needs to be told. \u003cbr\u003e"
