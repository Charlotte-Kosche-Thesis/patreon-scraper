I mostly enjoy making animals, and right now creating art like this is my only source of income. My full-time job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy grandmother taught me to crochet when I was 9 years old, and I was immediately stricken by all of the things you can make from a ball of yarn. I went to college and received a BA in literature, but the entire time I worked on my art on the side and realized that it brought me the most pleasure and fulfillment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, working on commission (making custom items for individuals) and selling items in my Etsy shop is an unreliable form of income and there are months when I barely make any sales at all, making it very hard to continue doing what I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see myself improving every day, and I\u0027m still so excited and passionate about what I do -- I really want the opportunity to continue doing what I love, and knowing that I might have some stable income would free me up to expand my art tremendously and become more adventurous in what I do, hopefully leading to more exciting and interesting work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
