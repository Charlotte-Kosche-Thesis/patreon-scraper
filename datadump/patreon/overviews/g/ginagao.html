    "summary": "Guys, I\u0027m Gina, I\u0027m someone like you and me, I wasn\u0027t born as a writer but I\u0027ve always liked to read and stories have always been a way for me as a means to escape. Because of this, I started writing when I was in high school. I created a personal blog that was somewhat popular in high school, and after college, I branched out into writing for fandoms and for the LGBT community. In recent months I have gained a solid following on Tumblr. I\u0027m 100% grateful for that and will do it for the rest of my life because I finally found something that fulfills me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to get to know me even better or if you simply want to give me a symbolic 1$/month as a \"thank you\" for my content, you can truly help me 100% with this Patreon page. I want to be a leading voice in the LGBT community on Tumblr, and with your help, I can get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want and need the money since writing will be ALL I do in a few months. I am planning on making writing my full-time job. I don\u0027t have any other income source besides that, so it\u0027s in your hands, everyone."
