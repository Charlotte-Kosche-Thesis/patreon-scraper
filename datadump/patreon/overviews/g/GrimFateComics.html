This means the production costs for a page\nranges from $150 to $400+.  That\u2019s quite\nthe range! To stabilize things our color goals specify panels instead of pages, allowing us to mix more\nexpensive and less expensive panels.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut\nif you\u2019d like to see a specific panel in full color and detail sooner rather\nthan later, we have a way for you to make that happen!  During the first week of each month we\u2019ll\nopen up a special panel-coloring drive, first come first serve until ~$300\nworth of panels have been drived. Drive cost is\npaid up-front.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\na general rule of thumb on panel costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nMORE\nEXPENSIVE\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 Backgrounds \u2013 Monsters \u2013 Clothed Char \u2013 Naked Char - \u003cem\u003eCHEAPEST\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\ngenerally results in small panels being 15-30, medium panels 40-60, and large\npanels 60-100+, but sometimes a large panel might be very simple or a small\npanel might be very complex. Extremely small/simple panels are freebees \u2013 if the\nnearby panels are colored they\u2019ll be colored as well.\u003cbr\u003e"
