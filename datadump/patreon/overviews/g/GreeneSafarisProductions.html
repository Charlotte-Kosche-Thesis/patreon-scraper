My dad has traveled the world taking pictures along the way. His travel company was Greene Safaris, and this business is a way to continue on his tradition. I hope my pictures inspire you to travel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dad has around 30,000 slides sitting in his basement. Around 2% of them are excellent, and are worth reproducing. Being in storage for so long has damaged the slides. I\u2019m digitizing them, and cleaning the best one to share with you.  This process takes a while; 3 hours to digitize 40 high resolution scans, and anywhere from 2-16 hrs. to clean and color correct each slide. The high res scans are automated, so I can do other things while it processes them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you like my photos enough to pick some out for yourself.  If you don\u2019t have room on your walls for new art, and you would like me to continue my work a donation would be much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m selling my photos on Pictorem.com. The photos I post here you can purchase for your walls on Pictorem. They focus on wall art which lines up with my goals currently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pictorem.com/profile/Greene.Safaris.Productions.\"\u003ehttps://www.pictorem.com/profile/Greene.Safaris.Pr...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for stopping by.\u003cbr\u003e"
