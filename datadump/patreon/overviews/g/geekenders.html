    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re Geekenders. We\u0027re based in Vancouver, BC and we create dynamic geeky theatre by putting a new spin on pop culture classics that we love. We are dedicated to diversity, casting actors of colour, engaging in finding more spaces for women, and casting LGBT+ actors. We are dedicated to producing shows that will encourage people who haven\u0027t thought to explore theatre before to come out to experience musicals, burlesque shows, and plays. We also have a mentorship program wherein we encourage performers with no experience to work alongside professionals and gain some experience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of our production have included Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical, The Force is Shakin\u0027, How I Met My Mother: A Back to the Future Parody Musical, and Jurassic Parody: The Musical. We release 95% of our productions on youtube in their entirety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have tons of things we\u0027re working on, all the time. And as always, we\u0027re trying to pay artists as much as we can. Our goal is to be the highest-paying semi-professional theatre company in Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the money that goes into funding our shows comes out of our own pockets! Because we try to keep ticket prices low and always make sure our performers get paid, we often lose money even on our very successful shows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you donate to us will go directly towards costumes, sets, rehearsal spaces, SOCAN fees, theatre rentals, and everything that makes theatre a labour of love rather than a viable career move.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much; we have years\u0027 worth of ideas, we just want to be able to make them happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeekenders\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(PS -- if you want to check out our music, we have a Bandcamp page!\u00a0https://geekenders.bandcamp.com/ )\u003cbr\u003e"
