    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eThank you for making independent music possible!\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, Hello! My name is Giselle\u003c/strong\u003e (Grayson) and I\u0027m a singer-songwriter from Austin, TX. I\u2019m an iTunes Top 100 artist, and I\u2019ve toured with some cool people like T.I., Sean Paul, and Young Jeezy. I\u0027ve released two original albums, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFallen Angel \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eis a certified best selling indie album, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSiren\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e debuted at No. 79 on the iTunes Pop Charts. Now I\u0027m working on two new albums and lots of music in between. Having grown up in the industry, I am thrilled that a platform like Patreon has come along. Through this site, you have the ability to directly support your favorite hard-working musicians (hopefully me!), making it easier for them to provide you with more content you love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThink of my Patreon page as a digital tip-jar.\u003c/strong\u003e If you happened to be at your local favorite music venue and I was performing\u2026 would you buy some merch or throw some cash in the tip jar? \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cYES! Of course!\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Cool, I knew you were good people! This is the new 21st century way of doing just that. Donating even just $1 per new video gets you exclusive goodies. Fear not, Patreon is super secure, and you can easily set a monthly budget so you know you won\u0027t tip too much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to me.\u003c/strong\u003e Truly - music is my world! I am a self-sustaining artist, always have been, and by that, I mean anything you get from me is funded by me. The plus side is I have creative control while not giving away 70% of my profits, the drawback is, it can be difficult to save the amount of money it takes to put out an album (my last album cost $12,000 to record and promote), or a beautiful music video. \u003cstrong\u003eYOUR SUPPORT \u003c/strong\u003emeans I have more freedom to bring you content as often as I\u2019ve wanted to all along. I want nothing more than to be able to consistently provide my listeners with new music, videos, and photos. Your contribution, no matter how small, will help me do just that. I will use your donations to improve the quality of all future videos, and help me get them out faster, and to keep recording with some of the best producers in the industry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for stopping by\u003c/strong\u003e, and please check out the different donation levels to see what cool stuff you can get by being my Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eGiselle"
