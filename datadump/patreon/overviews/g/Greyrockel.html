I\u0027m Greyrockel and I make a some animations with dongs in sometimes. If you\u0027re here that means you\u0027ve probably seen my stuff elsewhere, and might be interested in getting higher quality versions of the videos I post elsewhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027m currently still a student doing a lot of odd jobs and freelance work on the side of this artist gig, and that regularly leaves me with less time than I\u0027d like working on animations and doing behind the scenes work for \u0027em. ( Stuff like learning new programs, improving my modelling, rigging, animation skills, and studying what I can do with software that isn\u0027t directly linked to making the animations themselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this is a nice way to get a little bit of cash on the side, so that I can dedicate a bit more time to pornmaking. Which in turn means more and better porn for you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me cover the costs of bandwidth + hosting for the distribution of the files to y\u0027all, as well as covering the video-hosting fees for my animations. The money can also go to covering model commissions and the like from other artists, so that I can focus on the animation part of it all. It\u0027ll also help me host more contests like the Source Pornmaking contest - Summer 16 which I recently organized, in that I can arrange for prizes and additional help. It can even cover voice work for voice actors! ( As a couple of them have approached me, but I feel kind of bad that I can\u0027t pay \u0027em much. )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR: What\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePlain and simple:\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be getting videos that are vastly higher quality than the videos hosted on my tumblr. ( They\u0027re 720p30, plus compressed a bit for streaming. )\u003cbr\u003eAll the video and image tiers on this patreon will provide you with silky-smooth 60-fps animations in your preferred resolution.\u003cbr\u003e( You\u0027ll also be getting all the videos \u0027beneath\u0027 it as well, if you pledge enough to get 1440p videos, you\u0027ll also get the 1080p, 720p and 720p30 videos! )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I\u0027ll be shipping out the images/stills in both 1080p and 2160p, vs the 720p of the images hosted on my tumblr, and other places.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the higher tiers, you can even submit your own projects/scenes to the polls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePer Animation? What if you suddenly make 10 animations in a month, and I can\u0027t pay?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, first up, it\u0027s \u0027per week of content\u0027, not per animation. So no matter how many animations I\u0027d post in a week, it would still be just one charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I post 2 weeks or more, then there\u0027s no charge for week 3/4. \u003cbr\u003e( Aka, if I were to post 4 animations, 1 per week though a month, there would be 2 charges total. )\u003cbr\u003eSo if you pledge, you can set your max pledges per month at 2, if you feel like it, you\u0027d not miss out on anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will all of this work then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThat one\u0027s simple:\u003cbr\u003eWhen I finish up an animation or an image, I\u0027ll go ahead and post it on my tumblr/other places, as well as send out links to all you patrons where you can download the video/image directly. ( The patreon sendout can sometimes lag a couple hours behind my tumblr, as it can often take a couple hours for me to encode the videos into all the different sizes for the tiers. So I tend to do the 720p30 one first, post it on my tumblr, and then wait for the rest to finish up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVoting:\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027ll be a running vote ( votes will carry over from previous months, meaning that a 1 vote/month tier can submit 12 votes in a year. ) that keeps track of some larger projects I have that are in differing phases of production. Any of the projects that get a lead in the vote is one I\u0027ll spend more time on, and I\u0027ll remove it from the poll once it\u0027s done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScene Submission Slots:\u003cbr\u003eFor the tiers that have these, they mean that you can have so many Scenes/Projects in the running vote. You can submit them once you\u0027ve been charged for 1 animation.\u003cbr\u003eEvery month you can withdraw any of your projects, and resubmit a different one, although this means that the votes will be lost.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen one of your projects \u0027wins\u0027 the poll and is done, I\u0027ll remove it, and you\u0027re free to add another one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e( You\u0027re capped by the amount you have, so someone with 2 Scene Submission Slots can have 2 projects running at any one time, as opposed to say +2 per month. )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial Patreon Commission Rebate:\u003cbr\u003eNot much about this right now, I\u0027ll say more about it when/if I get into the swings of doing normal, paid commissions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will be getting a rebate, for example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
