You can tell I\u0027m a writer because I\u0027m poor and I\u0027ll probably be drunk by the time you read this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m best known for my Gallaetha novels on Amazon. The first of which, Hair of the Dog, has a solid 4.5 rating on Amazon and three stars on Goodreads. That\u0027s two stars short of five! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHair of the Dog takes place on the world of Gallaetha, a world maybe two doors down from our own with a lot of the same technology. Unlike our world, Gallaetha has access to magic that has cured disease, hunger, and wiped out resource scarcity. It\u0027s a world that should be a paradise, but it\u0027s still full of humans, and humans are arseholes. As a result, they practice constant war and conflict both to thin out the population and make money for wealthy shareholders and corrupt politicians.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFamiliar stuff, right? I said it was two doors down from our own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories follow the adventures and struggles of the people trying to survive in this world. There\u0027s a wisecracking mercenary trying to do good despite getting paid for being evil; a disgraced soldier with a wicked hangover on the run for a murder he\u0027s almost positive he didn\u0027t commit; a ruthless businessman who will stop at nothing to cure himself of the last terminal disease on Gallaetha; and an ancient monster searching for a family that might never have existed in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this sounds fun, \u003ca href=\"http://myBook.to/gallaetha1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck out the first book here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have noticed that fluffy wordplay and flowery description aren\u0027t really interesting to me. My eyes glaze over when I read that stuff and writing it feels like trying on a pair of pants that don\u0027t fit. A pair of pants that have been pissed in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m saying is: it\u0027s not comfortable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like people, characters, conversation, stories, excitement, action, and cutting away just before a sex scene starts to save myself from embarrassment. I write the way I think, that is to say, simply. I try to write the way that people speak, in a way I hope seems natural to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I do occasionally like to toss a big word in there just to feel clever. Got to make that Creative Writing degree work for me somehow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve steered clear of crowdfunding for years. I can see the value of it. If you\u0027re making a video game, recording an album, or making a movie; crowdfunding can be a fantastic way of getting the equipment you need to get your dreams in motion without relying on a stifling and incestous creative industry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it never made sense for me. I\u0027m a writer. I don\u0027t need fancy equipment or technical know-how. All I need is some notepads, pens, my laptop, and a copy of Scrivener. It seemed unfair of me to ask people for money for something I\u0027d be doing anyway. And after all, I\u0027d always prefer to live or die by the strength of my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the trouble though, even the greatest writer in the world will fail if nobody can read their words. And I\u0027m a long way off from being the greatest writer in the world. As far as talent goes, I\u0027m probably somewhere towards the bottom; between John Connolly and the guy who wrote the Eye of Argon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not even sure who should be most insulted by that analogy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a self-published author and unfortunately, not many of us have made it big. However, I did look over the success stories of some of the few winners and I saw a lot of the same tropes cropping up.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I quit my financial/medical/computer engineering/CEO/idle rich/golden goose farming career and started writing. Wouldn\u0027t you know it, after paying a professional editor, cover designer, buying a thousand dollars worth of advertising, and paying people to yell my book\u0027s name in the street, I became a New York Times bestseller!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I had enough of my day job so I quit to write full time. My wonderful wife/husband kept their career and supported me while I followed my dreams. Wouldn\u0027t you know it, after freeing up my day I was able to write full time. Nobody wanted my first novel, or my second, or my third. But with all day to write more, I eventually wrote a book everyone wanted to read.  I\u0027m now making a living from writing myself and it\u0027s my wife/husband\u0027s turn to quit their job!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027m a marketing expert! I wrote a 50,000 word novel in an hour! This isn\u0027t even my first language! I just used my detailed marketing knowledge to get my book in front of as many eyes as possible and wouldn\u0027t you know it, eventually I found an audience. I just used these 6 mindblowing strategies, number 3 will shock you...\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m jealous of these people, I\u0027m not going to deny it. But I don\u0027t begrudge them their success. If you can afford to buy your way into the bestseller list or you have all the time in the world to write, then more power to you. The world needs stories, as many as it can get. That includes yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately these writers have gifts that I just don\u0027t have. I\u0027m a one man show. I do my own editing, my own cover design, my own marketing. All of this has meant that I take time off from writing to learn skills that don\u0027t come naturally to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a blue collar guy whose day job barely covers his rent, bills, food, and the beer necessary to maintain the work/write cycle. I don\u0027t have wealth, or a partner who can afford to support me, and although I\u0027m trying to learn marketing, it takes time -- time I\u0027d much rather spend actually writing. In fact, I can\u0027t even spell wirds all taht gud.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what I have is drive, passion, what they call sticktoitiveness. I start a project and I work and work and work until it\u0027s done. Even then I\u0027m such a perfectionist that I\u0027ll probably spend months or years in editing until it\u0027s exactly right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think this is a good quality to have as a writer. You definitely need a touch of it even if you are one of those writers blessed with an inherited fortune or a supermodel spouse you can mooch off of. Without this drive, none of us would consider putting words down in the first place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my case, I\u0027ve been writing while working full time for nearly a decade. In that time I\u0027ve produced one novel that I\u0027m happy with. I\u0027m currently drowning in ideas for stories and books, more than I can ever write in one lifetime and with more coming by the day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know, writing a book takes a lot of time and energy. You need to write at least fifty thousand words (although all of my books go over that), then you need to read and re-read those words dozens of times, editing out the mistakes and making it look as professional as you can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven then some mistakes are going to slip through. One person can\u0027t catch everything after all. And by the gods do you catch flak for it when you make a mistake. Check out the comments on every article written about self-publishing if you don\u0027t believe me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat doesn\u0027t even factor in the stuff you have to do outside of writing. I had to learn photoshop to make the covers from my books, which I made as the most wretched kind of amateur. I taught myself HTML to code the e-books myself. I\u0027m learning Wordpress so I can make \u003ca href=\"http://www.matthollandauthor.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea website that looks kind of professional\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m learning digitial marketing so that I can spread the word about my writing and try to connect it to the audience that I know is out there somewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this means taking time out of writing, and being a writer is a lot like being a parent. You neglect your writing and it will die. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, you deal with a lot of lost sleep and way more snot than I\u0027m prepared to talk about in polite company.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter over a decade of doing this every day, I\u0027m starting to burn out. My confidence is waning. The pace of my writing has slowed down. It\u0027s heartbreaking to experience, frankly. My entire life, all I\u0027ve ever wanted to do was write. Nothing else has ever really interested me. And now I\u0027m starting to lose passion for the one thing I love more than anything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m thirty-one now. I\u0027m worried that by the time I hit thirty-two I\u0027ll have given up completely. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a thought that scares me more than that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot even that nightmare I had about the spider apocalypse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not asking for the cash to quit my day job, although that would be amazing. It\u0027s unfair on you, the person reading this. You probably have a day job too, rent and bills to pay, a family to support, a crippling gambling addiction (probably, this is the internet), and dreams of your own you wish you could quit your job to pursue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides, it seems arrogant me to sit here and say \"Help me quit my job!\" on the strength of one novel you probably haven\u0027t even read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I\u0027m asking for here, if you\u0027d be good enough, is a bit of help competing with the big boys. With a little extra cash each month I could hire a professional cover artist to make my books look pretty, a professional editor to catch my many fuck-ups, advertising and marketing to help get the word out, actual printed copies of my books so that people who don\u0027t like e-readers can finally read my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that even the worst book ever written has an audience out there that\u0027s hungry for it. I\u0027m not saying my book is perfect, but it\u0027s a long way away from the worst. I think that there\u0027s an audience out there for it, and the rest of the writing I produce day by day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help me to find and connect with these people, whoever they are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get out of the deal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get to help out a struggling artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHahahahaha, no. Can you imagine if I meant that? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing about me. I work hard. It\u0027s not even just a bullshit line I use to sound cool on my CV, I really mean it. If you\u0027re paying me for my time, I\u0027m willing to go to the mattresses for you. I will scrap for you and work myself to exhaustion to prove that I\u0027m worthy of your faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do for you if you help me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t a charity or a Kickstarter that promises the moon, the stars, and a Megaman re-release for your investment. This is a service. You kick in even a dollar a month and I\u0027ll give you something in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the rewards on the right, there. I\u0027ve written thousands of things I never publish, a dollar lets you see them. So you can judge me on how terrible my first drafts are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone loves those awful singers on the first round of the X-Factor, right? The ones who crash and burn and make utter tits of themselves. At worst, supporting me for a dollar gets you access to the literary version of that feeling of superiority you get when you see some no-hoper get their dreams crushed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt best? You might see something really cool long before the rest of the world does. Imagine being the hipster who gets to say: \"Oh, Matt Holland? *flips scarf* I read his Booker prize winning novel five years ago when it was cool *flips scarf again, adjusts frameless glasses and rides off on a vintage bicycle*\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, best stick with the X-Factor analogy on that one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything above a dollar gets you cooler stuff. From a copy of every book I produce in perpuity (or until this patreon crashes and burns) the chance to name a character or choose the direction of a story, signed books, acknowledgments in every book that I write, free promotion on Twitter. All that\u0027s even before you get to the higher tiers, where you can get me to write and edit stuff for you, stuff that you can take credit for if that\u0027s what you want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes, every reward is concurrent month by month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried to make it so that every supporter gets something back from me and more. You\u0027re taking a risk on me and I promise to live up to it. Even if all you do is throw me a dollar a month, I will do everything I can do to earn that dollar with all the time and resources I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Take a look and decide if it\u0027s something you want to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading this. Even if you don\u0027t feel like kicking in, it\u0027s good to know that someone has at least read to this point and understands where I\u0027m coming from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think ultimately that\u0027s what every writer wants, to be heard, and to be understood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat and alcohol. \u003c/span\u003e"

Frankly, if you\u0027re giving me this much money I\u0027m going to war on your behalf. I won\u0027t rest until you\u0027re satisfied. A bit like how I normally make love.

If you ever see a piece of my writing anywhere near that rag then it\u0027s because someone tricked me into it and I\u0027ll be returning their Patreon money in due course. I won\u0027t even ghost write for The Sun. I\u0027d never be able to live myself afterwards.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI won\u0027t write anything that features child abuse or rape. These are topics that I never touch in any of my writing. Not just because they are huge triggers for me, but because they\u0027re cliche at this point. They\u0027re what lazy, sadistic, or untalented writers use to increase tension when they lack the talent to think of something better. I\u0027d rather write good characters in a solid plot than rely on cheat codes.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m sexually non-typical myself, so I have an open mind for whatever any weird perversion you can name. I\u0027m more than happy to write some erotica for you in whatever genre you like (I\u0027ve ghostwritten plenty of strange things in my time) But I ultimately want to make a career out of writing. So it probably goes without saying that I need to protect my reputation. So while I\u0027m happy to write erotica of almost any stripe, I reserve the right to turn down a writing request because it\u0027s too out there for me. I need to think about what I want my name attached to. But I\u0027m always happy to negotiate and find a compromise! You are, after all, paying me good money.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m not going to do research for you. If you want me to write an essay for you, you\u0027re going to have to do the bulk of the background research yourself. You\u0027re not hiring a neurosurgery expert or a rocket scientist here, you\u0027re hiring a writer. Gimme some data and facts and I\u0027ll put them together in an entertaining way, but I\u0027m not going to be bringing expert level knowledge to the table. \u00a0So no, I\u0027m not going to write your college essays for you. Sorry.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI reserve the right to refuse any project that I think clashes with my personal values.
