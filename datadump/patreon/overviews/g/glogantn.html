I have years of knowledge and the platinum trophies to show for it. I am currently creating a few playthroughs for random games but in the future I am hope to produce more diverse content. That is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to field questions, comments and votes from you guys and create the content that you want to see. I am currently working on some Top Ten ideas and I hope to expand my horizons from there. This is not a dictatorship but rather a partnership so please feel free to jump in with any suggestions that pop up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds that I receive from this community will go directly back into my work. I would like to eventually upgrade my equipment and get a nice screen and lighting setup. All of these things will be made possible by you guys and I want to show my appreciate for that. In the not so distant future, I am also hoping to start doing giveaways but I am not sure exactly how I want to run that. Stay tuned for more information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eGordon (GLOGANTN)\u003cbr\u003e"
