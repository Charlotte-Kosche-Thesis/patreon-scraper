    "summary": "I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eJack Pennington\u003c/strong\u003e, a filmmaker from North Carolina. Thanks for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in film school, when I couldn\u0027t focus on the lecture or had some downtime on set, I\u0027d doodle in my notebook or scribble down ideas for movies. One day, I started compulsively writing one phrase over and over again: \u003cstrong\u003e\"Tell Stories, Change The World\"\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat phrase has become my creative mission. When I graduated film school, I had half a dozen screenplays that I wanted to sell in Hollywood, as well as several entry level job opportunities as a television writer in Los Angeles. But I didn\u0027t pursue that. Instead, I bought a cheap camera and started bringing it to parties and asking people to \"\u003cstrong\u003eTell me a story\u003c/strong\u003e\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that the world is becoming a more divided place every day. And the reason for that division is that we\u0027ve \u003cstrong\u003estopped listening to each other\u0027s stories\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \u003cstrong\u003estory \u003c/strong\u003eis a powerful thing. Sharing a story with a stranger is a way to share yourself with that person. And once you\u0027ve shared a piece of someone else, it becomes much harder to remain divided from them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it\u0027s decided. I\u0027m going to \u003cstrong\u003eTell Stories\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eChange The World\u003c/strong\u003e. And I\u0027m going to do it one short web documentary at a time. With your help, of course. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now producing a series of documentaries for a project I call \"\u003cstrong\u003eTellChange\u003c/strong\u003e\". Each video focuses on a single person doing or explaining something they\u0027re passionate about. I take my time during the interview process while producing these videos, because I want to draw something unique out of each subject. Over the years, I\u0027ve interviewed around\u003cstrong\u003e two hundred different subjects\u003c/strong\u003e, and what I\u0027ve discovered is that every person has something beautiful and unique within them, just waiting for an opportunity to come out. It might be as complex as a personal philosophy or manifesto on life, or as simple as one line of wise advice that needs to be shared. But everyone has it, and I want to reveal it. That\u0027s the core of the \u003cstrong\u003eTellChange \u003c/strong\u003eproject, pulling out that unique thing from every subject. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to TellChange, I produce a weekly podcast called \u003cstrong\u003eNEVER GET LAID\u003c/strong\u003e. This show is more personal, and features conversations between me and my friends about every confusing and frightening aspect of life itself. It\u0027s all of those deep conversations you have with your friends when it\u0027s way too late to be awake and the beer has long since run out. My podcast attempts to pull those conversations out of the darkness of 4am and into the bright light of 6 o\u0027clock on a Monday morning. Sometimes we get gross, sometimes we get juvenile, but always we get real, and my patrons get to be the first to hear it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve worked hard to maintain my independence as a filmmaker. I\u0027ve been offered money to produce documentaries for production companies and large organizations, and I\u0027ve turned it down because I didn\u0027t want my vision to be compromised for cash. I don\u0027t want to be held accountable to somebody else\u0027s corporate mission. I want to be held accountable to \u003cstrong\u003eYOU, my followers. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo back me today and be a part of something great! I tend to produce a TON of content, so I use a monthly model as opposed to charging you every time I make something. It saves you money, and makes life simpler for me. Want to pledge a little? You can get early access to ALL of my content for just $3 a month. Want to pledge a lot? You can get your name on \u003cstrong\u003eNEVER GET LAID\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eTellChange \u003c/strong\u003eas a featured patron or executive producer. But all of my patrons get the satisfaction of supporting a project that actively seeks to connect people and heal a divided world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive me a hand, and let\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003etell stories to change the world\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e"
