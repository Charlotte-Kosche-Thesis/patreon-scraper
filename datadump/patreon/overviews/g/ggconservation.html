    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eGG Lions NPC, is a non profit subsidiary of GG Conservation, whose mission is simply to love, protect and preserve the lions in our care. We offer a safe and healthy environment for our lions to flourish in this beautiful natural habitat, to keep the GG lions protected from harm and yet as close to living in the wild as captivity allows. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStatistics show wild lion populations are at severe risk of extinction due to hunting, poaching, habitat loss and disease. Should this magnificent species ever tragically become extinct, we offer a chance for people to view, observe and witness the lions in a far more natural and appealing habitat, we believe, than a zoo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eOur future vision is to be able to offer this kind of sanctuary to other less fortunate lions, or species in need. As GG continues to grow, so do our ever increasing costs, and this is where we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe are fortunate enough to be able to capture unique footage of the lions so that lion and animal lovers worldwide can catch a glimpse of the lions\u0027 daily lives, behind the scenes activities, the idiosyncrasies which makes each GG lion unique which would otherwise be impossible to witness. Our belief is that the more engaged people are in individual lion, their stories and personalities via our videos - the more likely we are as a human population to care deeply about this amazing species, and in turn, help its future survival for generations to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe\u0027ve set up this Patreon campaign in order to fulfill that dream by offering you, the members of our Pride, intimate looks into our lion\u0027s lives, how we care for them and what it takes to run an organization like GGC. In return for your patronage, you\u0027ll gain access to one of a kind video content seen nowhere else. Each Reward level brings you to a deeper understanding of our lions, staff and how GGC works. At certain reward levels you\u0027ll have access to surveys about what your thoughts are on our organization, and we\u0027d love to get feedback and ideas on how you might think we can do better. GGC is constantly evolving as the conservation community learns more about the health and welfare of lions in captivity, and with your help we\u0027ll be able to implement them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
