Not only will I teach you these techniques and such but I will also have giveaways were I buy double of whatever product I am using and I will give it to a Patreon. I also have connections with a few companies that are willing to allow me to give you discounts on products. These are things I use, such as vitamins, pumps, lubricants, etc. There will be no selling out here! If I ever offer you all a magic solution then my account has been hacked. Any product I test I will give an honest review. These are techniques I have used and that I continue to use on myself.
