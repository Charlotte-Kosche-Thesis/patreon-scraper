I\u0027m also looking to \"reinvent\" my personal streaming as a whole, let me explain...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 200+ Videos on my personal YouTube Channel I started to really love Video editing. I\u2019m no pro but i know more than the average person and will use this to my advantage. Here is my \u201cMaster Plan\u201d. I plan to once a week or twice a month make pre- recorded videos to add as apart of my stream. This would be News Breaks StreamerAds, Story implementations and much more. I also plan to have proper intros and outros. As far as Story I plan to make a Weekly show where GoreGamer must play games in order get his soul back from the Devil. There is much that I would like to add but wish not to disclose details until the time is right and I have everything ready for Launch. I hope that you can be a patron today and help me fulfill my dreams by giving back to you guys with the greatest show in the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is where you come in. By becoming a patron you are not only showing that you support me and the Stream but you also share in my vision that I can produce a show that is unlike any other on twitch. No matter how much the amount it will help me in many ways. With you helping me I would like to help you in return standout in my stream and the outcome with its story. I have recently removed the Tiers in favor for a more voluntary method of donation. Again I thank you for any contributions you give or just by showing up in stream and saying \"hi\"."

     "about": "I first joined Twitch back in 2011 and didn\u0027t start streaming till late 2012. I honestly did start streaming daily till March or April of 2013. After many failed attempts and false starts I started to find my groove being a verity streamer. For personal Reasons I had to stop streaming in April of 2014, this left me devastated to say the least. Since the only thing I was able to do was think about streaming and not stream I continued to revisit these ideas of an overall story for the stream. It\u2019s now just over a year later and I\u2019m finally wanting to fulfilling some of these goals.",
