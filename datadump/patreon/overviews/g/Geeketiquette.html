    "summary": "Hello everybunny! My name is Geeketiquette and welcome to my Patreon. Unlike other YouTube channels and individual content creators, my main focus is to try and raise money for different charities each month. And I can\u0027t make that happen without your help. Whether it be financial support or just being there for moral support, it all means a lot to me and wouldn\u0027t be where I am without you. So please read on for more information as to why I have a Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBe prepared for a lot of reading! Money is a very serious matter and everything in here is important.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I can\u0027t thank you enough for being here and even taking a look at this page from the vast, amazing projects out there. Thank you for considering it and taking an interest in my content. I want to stress that I will not stop working hard, I will not stop making content and I won\u0027t rest on my laurels by this and continue to work hard towards my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeeketiquette\u0027s Patreon FAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eSo, um, never heard of you?\u003c/em\u003e -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAye, in the grande scheme of things on the You of Tubes, I\u0027m tiny, which I\u0027m perfectly fine with that. I\u0027m extremely grateful if even one person gives me the time of day, and I won\u0027t stop sharing my passion with whomever wishes to watch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a plethora of gaming content, predominantly retro gaming. What makes my channel very unique however, is that unlike many gaming channels, I do not swear or curse in my videos. I also subtitle as much of my content as possible (It takes a long time!) for those who are hard of hearing. My approach to commentary is a more relaxed, chilling at a friend\u0027s house kind of feel, sharing my passion for games with the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eIf you\u0027re so small on YouTube, then why make a Patreon? Isn\u0027t this just \u0027e-begging\u0027?\u003c/em\u003e -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it simply, no. I have made this Patreon as something completely OPTIONAL for those who wish to support content creators, just like the donate and subscribe options on Twitch, and the fan-funding option that\u0027s available for some YouTubers. I don\u0027t monetise my videos currently, and I probably won\u0027t unless I absolutely have to, I\u0027m also not with a network (usually you have to monetise to get paid ad revenue) AND the fan-funding is not currently available in the UK, so this is essentially a fancy \u0027YouTube tip jar\u0027. It\u0027s completely optional and I do not expect nor ask anyone to pledge, I\u0027m giving you the option if you wish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eWill I be rewarded for pledging? What will I get?\u003c/em\u003e -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, honestly, I have nothing I could give you other than my absolute gratitude that you consider myself worthy of your time, let alone money. After a lot of thought, I didn\u0027t feel comfortable with the idea of rewarding people for giving more money than they might be comfortable with. If I offered more things on higher tiers, then I would feel like I\u0027m pressuring people into pledging more, I don\u0027t want to do that. I also don\u0027t want to single out people for choosing to support my content via this method. Of course I am eternally grateful of your kindness, you don\u0027t owe me anything and I would owe you so much more, I just don\u0027t know how to convey that! I make content for free, and I chose to do that. I know money is hard to come by, and there\u0027s people out there who work ridiculous hours for very little pay, or can\u0027t even work and barely scrape the barrel, and so my content will always be free and available to everyone whatever their situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eWhere will my money go should I decide to become a Patron? -\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027ll firstly have a place in my heart, and I will be forever grateful as I would be to anyone who wants to support me financially or otherwise. Any moneys will go towards new and to upgrade current equipment, new games, and who knows what else in the future! There are so many things I wish to do such as charity events, live streams and much more! If you do decide to become a Patron, I won\u0027t stop working hard to provide these things myself. However, with your generosity I may get there a tad quicker. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eWhy YouTube/Twitch?\u003c/em\u003e -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has become a fantastic opportunity for your average Joe to share their talents, passions, and achieve many great things for the world. There\u0027s so many reasons why I make YouTube videos, and it\u0027s not for the \u0027fame\u0027, nor money, it\u0027s a platform for me to try and give back to those close to me or other YouTubers, to support others, and my way of saying thanks for all the times I\u0027ve turned to YouTube to help me on my darkest days. And there\u0027s so many more reasons that I could just burst! \u003cbr\u003eShould YouTube or anything kick off, my personal goal is to be able to support my family. Namely, my mum. \u003cbr\u003eShe\u0027s been working her fingers to the bone practically since I was born and due to personal issues on my part, it\u0027s extremely difficult for me to go out into the world and work a \u0027normal\u0027 job. I am prone to panic attacks, suffered with (and still do occasionally) agorophobia, social anxiety and other issues which means that I have become self-employed to work from home. Typing or, being a transcriptionist is a lot of work for very, very little pay which is what myself and my mum currently do for income. She is at retirement age and deserves to relax, and her dream is to draw for the rest of her life. I wouldn\u0027t be where I am today if it wasn\u0027t for my parents\u0027 support, and so I would love the capability of making myself and her dreams come true, by being able to earn a living through our passions and hobbies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube is something that I love doing, gaming has been a huge part of my life since I was 4 years old, and to be able to share that with everyone in my own silly way, is an amazing feeling. It takes a lot of hard work, time and dedication, and I LOVE it! I\u0027m not going to stop and I want to take the opportunity to inspire others to follow their passions and dreams whatever it may be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Still here? -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far and are still considering becoming a Patron, I can\u0027t thank you enough for even thinking about it. I know that parting with any amount of money small or otherwise to a stranger is difficult, and so I can\u0027t emphasise enough that it\u0027s completely optional. Thank you for taking the time to read all this, I know it was a lot! \u003cbr\u003e"
