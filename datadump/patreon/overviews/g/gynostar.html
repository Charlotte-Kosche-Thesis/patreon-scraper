I\u2019m Rebecca, also known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/gynostar\"\u003e@GynoStar,\u003c/a\u003e and I\u2019m asking for your money.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eCritically analyzing the patriarchy,  four panels - or 280 characters - at a time.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\tMy webcomic, \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://gynostar.com\"\u003eThe Adventures of Gyno-Star\u003c/a\u003e,\u201d started in 2010. It\u2019s just your typical average feminist superhero parody comic strip, and updates about once a week. My podcast,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://saucepodcast.com\"\u003eThe Sauce\u003c/a\u003e, debuted in 2017 and is all about analyzing culture and politics through a feminist lens. While drunk.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI also make other stuff which maybe you\u2019ve seen floating around the web. All of my cartooning work, recorded rants and Twitter diatribes are available to enjoy for free online.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTipsy enough to fight the battles you\u2019re too exhausted to deal with.\n\t\u003c/h4\u003e\n\tI believe that cultural progress comes before political progress. To change policy, we have to change the conversation. To change the conversation, we have to have a few drinks because it just makes conversation so much easier, you know? But I\u0027m getting off topic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to play a role in changing the conversation. Sometimes I do that unironically. Sometimes I do it sarcastically. And sometimes I don\u2019t do it at all, and just try to make you laugh and feel reassured that you\u0027re not alone and not delusional. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003e\n\tGive me money\u003c/h4\u003e\n\tSo if you believe that feminist viewpoints are more important now than ever, and you want to support women creators and help amplify their voices, and you think artists should be paid a fair wage for their labor, then hot damn there are tons of amazing people on here you should give money to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd maybe I can be one of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/d17b45278f3164c78c85843d955d63de/tumblr_inline_oou6d2Csmp1rqmy2i_500.png\" style=\"width: 425px;\"\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eFAQ\u003c/h4\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf the comics are free anyway, why should I pay?\u003c/em\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThink of it like donating to your local public radio station; you don\u0027t have to do it. You can still listen for free. But somebody needs to pay for it, and if you\u0027re enjoying it, pledging is just the right thing to do. Plus the programming will be better if the station\u0027s well funded. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre there rewards?\u003c/em\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYes. I believe Patrons should get special rewards not available to all those deadbeat freeloaders consuming free comics. You\u2019re not one of those losers; you\u2019re great and deserve things.  But! I don\u2019t want to create more work for myself, which would mean less time for the art and writing - theoretically the reasons you contributed in the first place. So for now, my rewards are structured to give back as much as I can without sacrificing my regular output. If support increases enough, I hope to add more rewards such as bonus comics, Patron-only merchandise, and custom art.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy do you need my money? Don\u2019t you have a job?\u003c/em\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tLook, not a lot of media outlets are paying big bucks for thoughtful but snarky feminist art. But if lots of people pay little bucks, it adds up. Patreon allows me to make the stuff I want, in my own particular\u2026 idiom. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are you even going to do with this money?\u003c/em\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward formula: more support from Patrons means fewer hours I need to spend making a living at other things, which means more time to make comics (and more bottles of wine). My goal is to have enough Patreon support to work on comics full time and never be too sober.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
