A podcast where Brett and I, Sean, talk about RPG\u0027s and miscellaneous topics of geekery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrett and I did not create the show to make money. We do \u0027ok\u0027, but are far from quitting our day jobs. :-) (BTW, quitting our jobs is not what this is about. Maybe for Sean it is.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started the show because, like you, we love tabletop roleplaying games. We love talking about rpgs - the stories, the rules, the people! they\u0027re all a part of our dialog on the show. If you listen to us you already know this. If you haven\u0027t listened to us, what are you waiting for?! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe keep it light. The recipe is to throw in some humor, maybe an f-bomb, make some verbal jabs at each other, come up with good rpg topics, provide a good chemistry, win over some fans, while promoting the rpg community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we don\u0027t take ourselves too seriously, it is very important to us that our shows actually sound good. That\u0027s why we reach into our shallow pockets to cover the cost of good hosting and audio gear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we bring all this to you for absolutely free! The show will continue to be FREE! However, your contribution will help us get better gear, cover our costs and give even more back to the gaming community! Please consider a modest contribution. We will certainly appreciate it.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/gdL8b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWayne\u003c/a\u003e won\u0027t, but we will!\u003cbr\u003e"

While people in corporate meetings are thinking of deliverables and timelines, we\u2019re thinking about how a half-orc barbarian may influence the decision-making process. On second thought, we better make that a 4th level, human, Bard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften times we find ourselves at lunch talking about role-playing games. The conversation leads to rules, campaigns, plot ideas, character concepts, npc baddies, min maxing players, and much more. Why not share our banter with you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe take pride in our audio quality and don\u0027t take ourselves too serious. We do swear on occasion, but it\u0027s the way we convey our passion for the hobby!\u003cbr\u003e",
