    "summary": "Hey y\u0027all! Allie Gonino here. You may know me from Freeform\u0027s \"The Lying Game\", SundanceTV\u0027s series, \"The Red Road\", \"Girls Guts Glory\", or my various musical endeavors with The Stunners, The Good Mad, and now as a solo artist. I was referred to Patreon by a friend of mine, a musical troubadour by the name of Nate Maingard. (If you aren\u0027t already a patron of his, I highly recommend checking out his beautiful work!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in the power and importance of art to help humans heal. I\u0027ve been dancing, singing, and playing music since the age of seven, and have always most loved performing live. I am so grateful to be able to offer my gifts to the world in the form of music, prose, and visual entertainment. The reason I love the idea of Patreon is that not only does it provide a space for me to be in direct communication with my biggest supporters, it allows me to retain my rights as a creator, both financially and artistically. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve lived in Los Angeles for over 11 years and was signed to two major record labels when I was in the pop girl group, The Stunners. Since breaking my last contract, I have released all music with The Good Mad, and as a solo artist, independently. The most difficult part about being a musical artist in the day of the Internet is that streaming sites pay very little, and fewer and fewer people are buying physical copies of recordings. Since I write all my own music, it\u0027s very important to me to retain my rights, and I believe artists should be fairly compensated for their work. Think about how many times you listen to your favorite songs. If we priced songs for the same as even a cup of coffee or a cigarette, most people would be broke. As a listener, like most people, I mainly stream all the music I listen to, unless it\u0027s an artist I listen to over and over again, in which case, I make sure to buy their full album, or vinyl, and buy tickets to see them live.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am recording my first solo LP, entitled \u003cem\u003eForever Unfinished. \u003c/em\u003eVisit my \"Goals\" section to learn more about it, and how you can bring it to fruition. Also in the goals section, you\u0027ll find I\u0027m directing a music video that I wrote to accompany one of the new songs. I\u0027m very excited to be here on Patreon, and to provide my patrons with exclusive, and first-look/listen content. I look forward to getting to know you all better and hearing your feedback. Let\u0027s grow together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep going,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAllie\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "\"Deserted\" is a short film/music video I wrote and am co-directing with Alexandra Chando. It accompanies a song by the same name, off my new album, \"Forever Unfinished\". \"Deserted\" tells the story of Lupita and Jos\u00e9, a poor, hispanic couple who lost their son, Manny, to war. In the years following Manny\u0027s death, their marriage deteriorates, and they both lose sight of what\u0027s important in life, including their relationship with God and each other. Drugs, infidelity, alcoholism, and violence paint the picture of their dysfunctional relationship in this 10 minute piece. Lupita attempts suicide, as staying a lawful wedded wife to an abuser has become too unbearable. But then, she meets an unlikely spirit who offers a different perspective, and a way out of her misery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have already shot half the film, and are looking to wrap shooting by the end of June. Cameron Duncan, (\u003cem\u003eThe Red Road, Hollowbody, 13 Reasons Why)\u003c/em\u003e, is directing photography, and so far, the footage is stunning. Nick Gomez and Nancy Rodriguez star as Jos\u00e9 and Lupita. We only have one more day to shoot, and then we\u0027ll be on to editing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuy supporting this goal, your money will go towards paying the crew, cast, locations, providing meals on shoot day, and paying the editor. Once the film is completed, I will offer a first-look to the patrons that supported this goal, and our hope is then to get the film featured on a bigger platform, such as the Girl Gaze Project, Nylon, or Teen Vogue. You will also be supporting female eyes and voices in cinema!\u00a0",
