    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Guitar Junkie TV?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGuitar Junkie TV is a YouTube channel that makes guitar\ncover videos. The guitar covers are mainly Japanese rock and Korean pop music.\nThese cover videos are produced and fronted by Lionel Tan since 2013. Guitar\nJunkie TV has been growing steadily and the channel subscribers are increasing\nby the day with 9000 subscribers and more than 100 videos on the channel. The guitar cover videos have\nhelped countless guitarists learn songs through sound and visual. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHey everyone! This is Lionel from Guitar Junkie TV and I am so excited to bring\nyou guys this extension of my YouTube channel to Patreon.  I am the uneducated musician on Guitar Junkie\nTV since 2013 with tons of passion for my craft. All the songs that I perform\non Guitar Junkie TV are learnt by ear and performed in detail.  Growing up without the internet in my teens\nbrought me to learn music the hard way. I relied solely on using my ears to\nlearn songs and through time and persistence have gifted me with a good set of\nears for learning music.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eGuitar Junkie TV has been bringing you detailed cover songs to\nwatch and learn without the need for tabs.  I do all of the learning, recording, filming\nand production at home. Learning and producing a video can sometimes take\ndays/weeks to complete.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhy Pledge To Guitar Junkie TV?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking cover videos\nis a very time consuming and taxing process with family life and a day job to\nbalance. But with your support on Patreon, you will be able to pledge some\nfunds to Guitar Junkie TV for as little as $1 per video. I\u0027ll only be uploading\n2-3 cover videos per month, so that\u0027s potentially no more than $3 per month (Cost\nless than a happy meal at Mcdonalds). You can also set a monthly max so you\nnever go over your budget. (Or you could also go as high as your heart and\nfinances will allow.) If you want to get involved, please click on the\n\"Become A Patron\" button on my page. Having your support will allow\nme to justify more time to make better quality content and videos for you and\nthe rest of the world. Every bit\nhelps and I will be truly grateful for your support.  \u003cbr\u003e"
