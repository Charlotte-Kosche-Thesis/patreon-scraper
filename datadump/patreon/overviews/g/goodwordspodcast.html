This Podcast will likewise be a collaboration, with many people contributing ideas, content, and resources.  Just as good communication requires the active participation of multiple parties, I envision the Good Words Podcast as an ongoing conversation among myself and all the partners I connect with here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cem\u003eWhat benefits do podcast partners receive?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eGWP partners will have early access to all the episodes of the Podcast, as well as additional material such as episode transcripts, downloads of featured Miss Lynn songs, even Good Words Podcast logo buttons.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThanks again for finding out more about the Good Words Podcast!\u00a0 If I didn\u0027t answer your question above, please send me a message at misslynn [at] misslynn.com and I will! \u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
