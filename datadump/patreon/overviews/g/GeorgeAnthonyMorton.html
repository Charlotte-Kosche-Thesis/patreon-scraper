Welcome to my Patreon page. I firmly believe in the transcendent beauty of representational art. Nothing is more rewarding than the slow, thoughtful process of skillfully communicating an enduring image using the medium of oil paint or charcoal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still on the path of perfecting my craft, but would like to share my journey and the truly immeasurable knowledge I am getting every day as a student at the prestigious Florence Academy of Art. I\u0027m so\u00a0grateful to have this opportunity as the first African-American in its history to earn this coveted certificate of achievement, and feel it my duty to pay the education I am being given, forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"When one teaches, two learn.\" Pledge your support, and let\u0027s learn together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.picorator.com/95wEY.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Me\u003cbr\u003eAs the firstborn of 11 children to a 15 year-old drug-addicted mother, I have been formed and informed by life experiences uncommon to an artistic journey. Raised in an unsupervised, impoverished, and drug-infested home environment, I turned to the harsh streets of Kansas City MO, dropped out of school in 7th grade, got caught at 19 selling dope with my mother and grandmother, and served 11 years in federal prison as a first-time offender.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRefusing to accept my incarceration as an impediment, I made a conscious choice to use my years in prison as an opportunity to ensure that I would never return to the ignorance and hopelessness that pervaded my childhood. As I had always found a measure of escape from the streets by sketching on whatever paper was available, I determined to develop my God-given talent for drawing and painting and to expand my mind by voraciously reading books on every subject I could. I was a sponge soaking up knowledge. My growing reputation as a prison portraitist kept me out of trouble and allowed me to spend quiet hours teaching myself to paint from art books and magazines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p442/inawordfab/IMG_6763_zpsl5ojcvu1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward 10 years.  I, a model inmate, gained early supervised release and \u2014determined to make painting my life\u2019s work\u2014 headed to Atlanta GA where the miracles began to unfold. An accomplished artist took me under his wing, a kind group of local painters took an interest in me and raised funds to support my initial studies, and out of hundreds of applicants, I was accepted into the first class of seven students by the New York branch of the Florence Academy of Art.  That is my tale of redemption in a nutshell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p442/inawordfab/FullSizeRender-17_zpsvj9lsqns.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now in my final year at the Academy \u2014earning recognition for my paintings and drawings and being invited to exhibit at preeminent galleries\u2014 I have exhausted my resources. Spending 14-16 hours a day, seven days a week, at FAA completing my studies, I have no remaining hours to devote to a part-time job to cover my tuition, living expenses and art supplies through December.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA colleague directed me to Patreon, so here I am asking for your encouragement and financial support from a 21st century Internet site that was inspired by the Renaissance patronage system that kept Michaelangelo in food, materials and commissions. I am so grateful for the many supporters that have previously contributed to my future and trust that through this page I may reach an even broader group of people who will help send me across the finish line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to be able to give my patrons a front row seat to my student life and artistic process through this platform. Let\u0027s learn together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*If you would like to support me with a one-time donation in an unspecified amount, please visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/georgeanthonymorton\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epaypal.me/georgeanthonymorton\u003c/a\u003e*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for becoming a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"George has overcome many hurdles, is a ray of light to those who know him, and his story is an inspirational one that needs to be told. We first found out about him when his story was mentioned at the Florence Academy Board meeting, as the top teachers in New York were asking for donations to help underwrite his tuition so he could continue studying. We supported him and continue to encourage others to support him, based just on his journey so far. However, we are deeply gratified to see that his work is extraordinary.\"  \u003cbr\u003eLaura Grenning\u003cbr\u003eGrenning Gallery \u003cbr\u003eSag Harbor NY\u003cbr\u003e"
