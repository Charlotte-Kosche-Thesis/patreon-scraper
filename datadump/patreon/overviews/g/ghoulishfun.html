We\u0027re opening up a Patreon to help us produce more content while also helping you get involved in how we produce the show. We won\u0027t pressure you to give more than you\u0027re comfortable with, but we do want to make sure that you feel like you get a lot out of your dollar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you should decide to join our ghoulish ranks, we\u0027ll be rolling out updates to let you know what you\u0027ll get. BE WARNED: Some of our content might include stronger language. We\u0027ll mark pieces like that so that you can decide if it\u0027s appropriate considering how clean we try to run our podcast proper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t heard of us, please check out our website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ghoulish.fun/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGhoulish.Fun\u003c/a\u003e for some information about the hosts, where you can listen to us, and where you can contact us for any questions you might have."
