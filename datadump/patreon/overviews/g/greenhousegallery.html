I had a rock collection with fossils, geodes and more.. I had a \"pet\" black squirrel that lived in our Oak tree, where I collected several acorns and made it a home in a cardboard box and would watch for him, or see if any acorns went missing. I named a cat Tiger that we found in Oklahoma while my brother had a baseball tourney, and asked my parents if we could get it some food to feed it, not keep - just help. I organized a brown bag food drive in 2nd grade and got the entire school involved and raised so much food for the homeless. I was brought onto the auditorium stage we had outside and introduced and commended for organizing something like this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI loved to dance, but my mom took me out of it because of the outfits being too racy for little girls.\u003cbr\u003e\nI wanted to be in gymnastics, but my mom said it was too expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat was right at the cusp of the introduction to \"extracurricular activities\" , which we were encouraged to be in....for health! (and keeps kids out of trouble, they say) As a kid, if someone tells you you\u0027re good at something, of course you want to get better, you strive to be the best!.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom Junior High through Highschool, I was in a Capella, Choir, Band, Dance Squad, Tennis, Volleyball, \u0026amp; Softball. Loved singing, finally tried out for Dance Squad my sophomore year and became the captain my Junior and Senior year, choreographing dances. But, I continued with sports - the coaches were more pushy than dancing coaches - but only to realize in highschool...\"what in the hell am I doing? I\u0027m 5\u00275\"? I\u0027ll never play pro-volleyball and I don\u0027t want to coach\", so I realized that art was what I wanted to do, and it just so happens I was voted \"Most Artistic of my Class\" - I just ever had any push from anyone for art like I did with sports.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0236/7623/files/Lil_CROME_Garden_Fam.png?11914793546173309282\" style=\"width: 371px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eWe never had that push to be more mindful, less waste, care more about the planet and forget about sports. Sure, stay active, sports are great to get the inactive kids in - but I was clearly already an outgoing, curious, and active child - I didn\u0027t really \"need\" sports. My body is a mess from physical strain throughout those years being pushed by athletic coaches, but I did learn how to visualize from my volleyball coach - so that\u0027s a fair trade I suppose :) It\u0027s helped me get here. No regrets, just lessons learned.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m just thankful for moments, like above, as a reminder of at least being introduced to sustainability, before society and corporate america mindset took over. I can\u0027t stress how important we get back to the basics, especially in this day \u0026amp; age of our youth being consumed by garbage on youtube, internet, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBottom line: We need to get back what\u0027s important.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eFast Forward\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0236/7623/files/Intro_Page_CC.png?13413094443641704102\" style=\"width: 176px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0236/7623/files/CC_Logo_Fresh_4.jpg?13413094443641704102\" style=\"width: 64px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0236/7623/files/Crome_sig_2.jpg?13413094443641704102\" style=\"width: 241px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you\u0027ve been following my journey ever since I\u00a0rebranded my first company, Crome Cre8ive\u00a0(a freelance graphic design\u00a0company I began in 2005)\u00a0to just CROME\u00a0(2011/2012) -\u00a0then you are aware of all the bumps, snags, and struggles I\u0027ve had along the way.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tThe companies I began that fizzled simply based on realizing I didn\u0027t have enough capitol to make the vision happen, and maybe you\u0027ve witnessed what I have been able to achieve in the last decade as a one-woman artist, designer, event organizer, creative director, and art gallery/exhibit curator - and a community leader.

From the furniture I created, I also had more leftover scraps - and those turned into exquisite wall decor, and CROMEdecor was born. Then I had itty bitty scraps from decor items that I created into necklace pendants.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tBesides that, I also began urban gardening to help save some money, I began making my own compost from scraps of veggies and fruit from the kitchen, I raised 7 Black Swallowtail butterflies because I had over 20 of their host plants growing, Parsley!
