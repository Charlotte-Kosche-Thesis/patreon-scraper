Sadly, as someone who often covers controversial issues, I see a lot of my videos being demonetised. Due to recent changes, advertisement revenue has gone down overall, making Google AdSense an unreliable source of income.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a great alternative. Your pledges essentially enable me to keep doing what I am doing and, hopefully, become better at it. It is because of my Patrons that I\u0027ve been able to invest more time into my channel. If I\u0027ll ever be able to do this full-time, it will be because of my Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/telEqny.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eA lot of creators have implemented a reward system for their Patrons. This effectively means patrons are given advantages based upon the amount of money they pledged. I want to do something similar without making it look like I am \u0027selling out\u0027. At the end of the day, I want people to pledge because they believe in what I do. It\u0027s why I\u0027ll only take video requests if it\u0027s something I considered covering to begin with. I wouldn\u0027t want it to look like I talk about stuff because I get paid to do so.\u003cbr\u003ePeople who donate $1 or more will be included in the credits at the end of each video. People that donate more than $20 or more will get a special thank you before the credits start rolling.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this will \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be my entire list of Patrons. Instead, I will show the names of Patrons who pledged recently. By \u0027recently\u0027 I mean the people who pledged since my last video. Since Patreon charges you at the end of the month, that means I\u0027ll include the names of Patrons who pledged in the month prior to this one. For example, a video uploaded in April will have credits containing the names of Patrons who pledged in March. If I don\u0027t upload in April I will just include those names in the videos I do in May.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you a new Patron? Make sure you DM me if you want to be included in the credits. That way I\u0027ll know. I need permission to show your name or whatever nickname you choose to go by.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uO8XsTG.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI believe that ideas are more important than the people who communicate them. But if you are really interested in me, then I guess I could say a little more about myself. I am a 21 year old atheist and liberal from the Netherlands. As of right now I only have a high school diploma but \u003cem\u003eI am studying history\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0so hopefully my resume will look a bit better three years from now.\u003cbr\u003eOn my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/NeENdF4Coi\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eI discuss a wide variety of topics. Since you\u0027re here, I assume you\u0027re already familiar with some of my videos. I like talking about politics, the news, religion, culture and anything else I think is relevant or interesting. Hopefully, I can actually start doing more academic stuff in the near future.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lThdyw5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eLike I said, I have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/NeENdF4Coi\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e on which I try to upload videos whenever I have time. In these videos I am opinionated but I do my best to not let that get in the way of my objectivity. Overall, I think it\u0027s not unfair to say I am more \u0027laid back\u0027 than most opinionated YouTubers. I try to see both sides of every story and am an advocate for discussion rather than slamdunk arguments and cheap response videos. I hope that doesn\u0027t make me sound pretentious: What I am getting at with this is that I think it\u0027s time to actually talk to people instead of discussing grievances and frustrations within our own ideological circle jerks.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1tnpInj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eIt\u0027s an online name I picked years ago for a reason I can\u0027t even remember.

If I ever reach a point where I can live off of my channel, I will start being more open about myself. At the moment I can\u0027t do that because it could get me in trouble on job interviews and such. I hope you understand that.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/eMQKcpL.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eMy videos vary in length, although a lot of them are longer than 20 minutes. I will always take my time to explain things and I will do what I think it takes to get my point across. I occasionally update my format - which you are more than welcome to give me feedback on. I have a lot of stuff planned for this year and I am working on a lot of projects. Hopefully you will find them interesting.\u003cbr\u003eAs I said before, I discuss a wide range of topics. Politics, recent events, culture, religion - if I find it interesting or relevant, I\u0027ll try to discuss it to the best of my abilities. In that, I\u0027ll try to be as nuanced and objective as possible, which is not to say I won\u0027t use satire or clearly give away my opinions.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
