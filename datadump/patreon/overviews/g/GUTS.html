The idea for an online feminist magazine came out of Cynthia and Nadine\u2019s shared interest in the feminist concepts and political theories they encountered in school. They wanted to keep talking and learning about these ideas in an accessible and dynamic space\u2014so they built one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether they learned to build a website, drew up a call for submissions, and edited their first issue. They asked graphic designer Jonathan Dyck to make them a logo and illustrate cover images, and threw their first launch party in their backyard in August 2013. Soon enough, fellow Edmontonians Rebecca Blakey and Katie L started writing and editing for the magazine, along with Halifax-based writer and editor Natalie Childs and others. Today the team also includes Brett Cassady Willes and Carmina Ravanera.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://gutsmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_3798.jpg\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur collective of volunteer editors works hard to recruit and select content by new and emerging feminist writers and artists; edit and publish bold, thoughtful, and creative feminist work; and circulate content in new and established audiences. In order to make it work, we put in many hours on our lunch breaks and during our evenings and weekends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love the work we do, and we want to continue to grow.
