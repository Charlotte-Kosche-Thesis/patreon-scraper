Put those two things together and\u00a0\u003cem\u003e*POOF* \u003c/em\u003ethat\u0027s where Game Dave comes in. Game Dave is an online web series about video games. Reviews, narratives, skits, and gaming inspired short films are what you can expect from the show. Just take a look:\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL4TZ5W0pElVaoIU8EzAVH8oYYuooZXnuK\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied video production and I have been creating online video content since 2006. Wow... that seems like forever ago! After experimenting for several years I looked in the mirror and said to myself, \"Hey, you need to shave, also, why haven\u0027t you combined your love of video production with your love of video games?!\" Soon after, I got rid of that mirror and in April of 2013 I launched the Game Dave Channel: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/GameDave\"\u003eWATCH GAME DAVE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU DO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve shared my gaming thoughts and reviewed numerous old and new video games. I don\u0027t just talk about games we\u0027ve all heard of, I\u0027m always looking for games that I never knew about growing up or gaming products that were lost to obscurity. Ever heard of the XaviX Port System? Neither had I... but Jackie Chan was very familiar...\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pu-NtDspHS4\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can probably already tell that I like to show off as much of these games as possible! Some people may prefer short and to-the-point overviews, but when I\u0027m sharing a piece of gaming history with people, I want to give the best experience possible! Along with sharing beloved old school classics, I also produce a series focusing on Japanese import games: FamiCorner. In this series I look at the games and consoles that never made it to North America. Take a look:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvpiexzG8fA\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith each episode of Game Dave, I want you to be a part of the video game journey. My hope is that at the end of that journey we\u0027ve learned something new about these amazing creations or have found a new way to appreciate them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW WILL PATREON HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will give viewers the chance to contribute financially to the production of Game Dave. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DONATE ANY MONEY! Patreon is simply for people who want to see the show grow and want to be a part of that growth. Game Dave will always be available for people to enjoy, even if the only thing in your pockets is lint. Contributing to the show with your viewership, your comments, and your love of gaming is most important. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest investment I\u0027ve made, is my personal time. I have a full time job, a family, and an ant farm that needs constant attention. Game Dave episodes take countless hours to complete with full gameplay capture, scripting, shooting, editing, and special effects. Now don\u0027t get me wrong, I love the work, but it\u0027s exhausting when juggling everything else and I\u0027ve never taken a single professional clown class. Patreon will allow me to pump up my production quality and increase my video release schedule. There are several Milestone Goals that are my way of showing you how your contributions are pushing Game Dave further. If things really do grow, I will pack my bags and leave my full time job. Continuing to grow the gaming community and being part of it is important to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS FOR PATRONS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons who contribute to the show deserve an extra smooch or two, so I\u0027ve put together a few bonuses for those of you that want to help out! Thanks for being a part of this video game journey and here\u0027s hoping the journey will continue!\u003cbr\u003e"
