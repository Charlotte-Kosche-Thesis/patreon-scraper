I tend to take on a lot of projects at work and in my personal life (all on top\nof making time for friends and family), but I definitely try to prioritize\ndoing the things that make me happy; one of those things being cosplay!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eSmall Hooves, Big Projects!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI have so many fun things planned for my Patreon!

I am also not opposed to doing makeup tutorials too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also be getting fansigns, selfie sets, discounts at my print shop, polaroids via mail, and special access to all of my images from the photoshoots that I do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor photoshoots, I am planning to produce content that both accurately portrays the character I am cosplaying and that also shows off some badass costumes I\u0027ve made! That being said, I still want to do fun lingerie themed or lewd shoots as well! I don\u0027t want to be in any kind of box, and I want to make content that a large audience can enjoy (And hopefully learn from!) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also planning to do a \u0027cosplay of the month\u0027, where Patrons can pick from a list of cosplays that I provide, and vote who I\u0027ll dress up as! For that month I will be sending out fansigns and creating gifs as this character, and might even do cute videos as the character if that\u0027s something people would like as well!
