That said, I don\u0027t plan to wait for any of these medical professionals to catch on before I start shining light on this issue and how we can move past it and live the best lives that we possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I don\u0027t consider myself as ever being a full-blown porn addict, there was a span of 5 years in my life (age 20-25) where I was viewing porn 4-5 times per week. Porn seemed to be something that \u003cem\u003e\"everyone\"\u003c/em\u003e was doing and thought to even be a healthy way to explore sexuality. It\u0027s no coincidence that at this point in my life I was very unhappy, unfulfilled, lacked purpose, and lacked an overall zest for life that I had previously had before my porn use. My mind was cloudy and I lived in a perpetual haze of fear. I was the \u003ci style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003edefinition of\u00a0\u003c/i\u003e\u003cem\u003emediocrity\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0at the time, and the scariest part was that I knew that I didn\u0027t care, but I didn\u0027t care that I didn\u0027t care. I felt like I had no control over my life and that I was just here on this Earth to eat, sleep, pay bills, and die. It was easily the lowest point of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I stumbled upon the NoFap forum on Reddit in February of 2015. I read countless stories on how men from all over the world were getting their motivation, drive and energy back. These men were reporting tremendous positive differences in how they felt about themselves and their lives just by changing \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e thing. What were they doing? QUITTING INTERNET PORN USE. I was skeptical at the time, but I have always been interested in ways to improve my life experience, so I figured what the heck, I had nothing to lose. \u003cstrong\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until I began refraining from internet porn use that my life completely shifted and I had a remarkable sense of rebirth; much like the countless success stories on the NoFap forum.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to present\u00a0time, and I am finally sharing my story with the world with the purpose of helping others take back control of their lives just like I did. I combine everything that I have used to get past this bad habit; \u003cem\u003ethe mindsets, insights, experiences, and habits; to help you catalyze your own rebirth and achieve lasting self-transformation in the content I produce.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t watch porn? Great. I applaud you. You will still be able to utilize my strategies, mindsets and rituals for \u003cstrong\u003elasting self-transformation, for the realization of your full potential, and to get the most out of your life.\u003c/strong\u003e I have been reading self-improvement, psychology, and life philosophy books since I was 14 years old. Now at age 29, I have logged thousands of hours learning from incredible people such as James Allen, Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle, Jim Rohn, Earl Nightingale, Jordan Peterson, Bob Rotella, Brian Tracy, Cal Newport, Abraham Hicks, Tony Robbins, Napoleon Hill, David Deida, and too many more to mention. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am confident that you will be able to take some sort of value from my work. If not, no big deal. I wish you all the best in your journey of\u00a0life.
