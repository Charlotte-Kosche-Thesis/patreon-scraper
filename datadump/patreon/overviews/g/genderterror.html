We feature exclusive works done by all manner of LGBTQ people from writing, art, media reviews, as well as various other non-fiction and fiction pieces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy GenderTerror?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQueer horror is an expanding subgenre. While queer horror movies are the biggest area, when it comes to writing, art, comics, and other forms of media, it is small still. GenderTerror as a website allows this genre to expand while giving back to the LGBTQ community that drives it. GenderTerror is ultimately a resource for both mainstream (with reviews, thinkpieces, and so forth) as well as indie (original works) to come together and create the ultimate queer horror experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnlike a lot of places, we pay for exclusive content. The money from Patreon goes directly back into the money. The site owner takes nothing. Every dollar from Patreon goes back into the queer horror community. Artists get paid for their work. Writers get paid for their pieces. Reviewers are paid. We ultimately believe in showing people that they are worth more than exposure. Every Patreon dollar goes back into the website or the community. There is no profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThrough Patreon we hope to be able to create a thriving community, not only in works, but expand to things like weekly comics, a forum, and other community based activities. This is not possible without your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
