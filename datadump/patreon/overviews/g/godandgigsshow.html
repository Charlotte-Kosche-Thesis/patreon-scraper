I\u0027m Allen, an author and musician. In 2015\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://GodandGigs.com\"\u003eI launched a blog\u003c/a\u003e to help musicians and creatives who work in both sacred and secular fields. Not long after,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://godandgigsbook.com\"\u003eI wrote a book\u003c/a\u003e especially for musicians in those areas. Here\u0027s what that first project looked like....(flashback music not included)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GUaOIwahtFs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, our friends and supporters helped us complete that project, and now musicians and creatives all over the place are being encouraged by the book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I realized something as we promoted the book...There\u0027s more to share. And while I enjoy writing and blogging every week at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://GodandGigs.com\"\u003eGodandGigs.com\u003c/a\u003e, it would be even better if we could make a direct connection with you and give you a voice in the discussion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, we want to go a step further and produce a podcast / show in which artists discuss real life, the creative lifestyle and how we can excel in every area of our lives.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Here\u0027s the nitty-gritty details of what this Patreon drive is about:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u0027re producing a \u003cstrong\u003ebi-weekly podcast for artists\u003c/strong\u003e that will include interviews, discussion, and interaction through audience-driven topics and questions.
