    "summary": "Hello and welcome to \u003cstrong\u003eGive Us a Good One\u003c/strong\u003e, the podcast of stories, jokes and bad puns from musicians, artists, filmmakers, comedians and other great people. Let us start out by saying that if you\u0027ve made it to our Patreon, you\u0027re already a hero in our book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had the idea for this podcast floating around in our heads for a year before we started doing it, and holy shit podcasts are a lot of work. They require time, money and recording equipment, and we only have one of those things. Since you\u0027re here, it hopefully means you love listening to the podcast as much as we love making it. That\u0027s pretty cool! We bust ass to make it funny, entertaining, and sound great. We both work full time jobs and play in three bands each (two of those bands we\u0027re in together), so finding the time to consistently make these episodes can be challenging. However, we love this shit, and we hope you love our guests stories, and get into some of the creative work our guests have made. We\u0027re doing our best to have zero ads in the show, which is why this Patreon is sorta important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027d be awesome if you\u0027re compelled to contribute to our podcast, gaining access to the sweet ass incentives, but if you can\u0027t, we get it. We\u0027ve been broke as hell, still sorta are. What\u0027s most important is that you enjoy the show, keep listening, and tell your friends. Thanks for popping in people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove always,\u003cbr\u003eMike \u0026amp; Orville"
