     "about": "I am a YouTube film maker making information films from around Asia, especially\u00a0Thailand\u00a0\u0026amp; other parts of the World.\u003cbr\u003eI live in the UK but try to travel as much as possible to make video blogs with free info and tips, to save\u00a0You time and money. I make the mistakes and share them with you, so you don\u0027t have to. I have tried to keep my channel completely free \u0026amp; it will always be free to anyone and everyone. I have now joined Patreon after advice which is an option for people who would like to thank me for all my hard work and time for filming and editing in the way of a small donation towards my Travel costs. ie: flights, cheap accommodation, boats, buses, camera equipment etc. It all adds up, and\u00a0as now become a little too expensive for me to fund it all by myself on a regular basis.\u00a0I have realised the credit card doesn\u0027t last for ever. When I am away filming, I love showing the people new and exciting places to go to, that you may never have gone to unless you had seen my movies.\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect anyone person to donate who hasn\u0027t got the means to do so, and like I said previously my channel will always be free.\u003cbr\u003eThis is only set up for people who would like to help me fund my next trips a little sooner than me saving up again and waiting for the time when I can afford to go again.\u003cbr\u003eI am very humbled by all the kind comments I have had, and look forward to entertaining you all again on Youtube as soon as funds allow.\u003cbr\u003emy Kindest regards\u003cbr\u003eGeoff Carter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
