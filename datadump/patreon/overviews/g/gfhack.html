    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Gluten Free Hack (aka Carrie J Keplinger) is a mild-mannered freelance writer, editor, graphic designer, artist, musician, and activist\u003c/strong\u003e whose body transforms into a hideous monster at the slight ingestion of the seemingly harmless protein known as gluten. Just kidding -- they actually have Celiac Disease. Their calling and passion is writing, food, tea, travel, and the simple things in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo this end, they have undertaken a journey to share their experiences of these things with their peers, in particular those who have discovered that they, too, can no longer have traditional pizza, donuts, beer, etc.  Over morning tea one day, Carrie turned to the bunnies in the backyard and asked them for their advice.  Their response was an exuberant, \"Hey, this stuff over here is delicious \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e gluten free!\" And so the wild food hunting began.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen The Gluten Free Hack is not busy foraging things or writing, they are usually sleeping.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support The Gluten Free Hack, scroll to the bottom of this page!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you have questions, we\u0027ve a rather thorough Q\u0026amp;A below.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://glutenfreehack.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/quiche.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What exactly do you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: For the purposes of this project I run a\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://glutenfreehack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/glutenfreehack/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, and other social media outlets that keep you apprised of \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003enew recipes, ideas, and tips for delicious gluten free living, as well as how to forage your own food to not only save money, but to offer you flavors you can never get from your grocery market!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 Currently I have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YSIU4UG\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy first book\u003c/a\u003e available on Kindle format, and am looking to eventually publish for print in the future based on demand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How often do you update, or what can we expect?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: As I am a writer for multiple projects and publications, my schedule is not necessarily a normal 9-5 job. Updates can come daily or weekly because of what is going on, where I am (I work from everywhere), and what my current projects are at the time. Generally speaking, though, I like to update the blog at least once a week; social media is updated on a daily basis.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003eMy blog and social media posts cover all sorts of gluten free things!

What are you getting out of this, and what do I get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: This is something I struggled with because I didn\u2019t know how this would work. But having friends like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/girlswithslingshots?ty=h\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDanielle Corsetto\u003c/a\u003e and others who use this product and seeing how it worked for them gave me the impression that not only would this model benefit me, but also my customers and followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith supporters on Patreon, I am better able to see what you want and need and adapt accordingly.  It\u0027s like a lifeline to my audience: the more you support me, the more you are able to get from the experience through direct input and other perks.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving more support at my disposal allows me more time to focus on even more and better content for my readers.  This in turn benefits the consumer.  Instead of simply paying x amount for y product, you have the unique capability of getting more or less what you want for how much you would like it.  \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs quite a bit of my content is already free to the public, you don\u0027t \nhave to pay for anything \u2013 contributing simply gets you more by allowing me to give you more of what I\u0027m passionate about.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e And if you are someone who suffers from Celiac or other health issues associated with gluten, this can be very beneficial!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://glutenfreehack.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pestopasta.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eQ: What are you doing with my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Gluten free things! \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003eYour contributions allow me to try more gluten free products, review more gluten free restaurants and destinations, and buy ingredients to develop new gluten free recipes \u2013 all for YOU!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027ll also be able to invest in equipment for things like videos and podcasting, which I really want to add to the site but haven\u0027t been able to yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How often am I charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: I don\u0027t like the term \"charged\" because I do work with traditional media outlets that I invoice on a monthly basis.  This is completely different as you are determining what to put forth.  \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCurrently I am working with the model of accepting funding per month.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e  This may change in the future based on your feedback.  Please see the next question for my current reasoning on why.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can I change or cancel any time?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe nice thing about Patreon is that there is no commitment for the patrons.  \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are free to change at any time. Because of this, you set your own level of involvement!\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/span\u003e If you want to try out $1 first but decide later on that you really like and benefit from my content, you can up to another level for some of the additional perks.  Furthermore, if you find out later on that they simply aren\u0027t worth it for you any longer or your situation changes, there is nothing keeping you from stopping at any time.  This is unlike a magazine subscription because my content is ultimately free to you whether you support me or not.  Anything you decide to support me with is ultimately because it\u0027s of greater benefit to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nA reminder from the bunnies:\u003c/strong\u003e Please note for your records that Patreon does do its billing at end of month and creators are limited by that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://glutenfreehack.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hush-dandies.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
