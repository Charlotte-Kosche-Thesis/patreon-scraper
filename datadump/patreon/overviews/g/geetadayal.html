    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Geeta. For the past 15 years, I\u0027ve been a professional journalist and critic, focusing on the outer reaches of music and sound. I\u0027ve written for lots of major publications, including \u003cem\u003eThe Guardian\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRolling Stone\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eWired\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSlate\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSpin\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Boston Globe\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eFrieze\u003c/em\u003e, and many more. I\u0027ve written over a thousand articles and reviews on a wide range of subjects, ranging from music and art to neuroscience and robotics.\u00a0I wrote a critically acclaimed book about Brian Eno (Another Green World, published as part of the 33 1/3 series) that Eno raved about, telling me it was the only really great book ever written about his work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnearthing the strange and fascinating history of electronic music -- from the 1940s onwards -- is my specialty.\u00a0I\u0027ve gone out of my way to do in-depth interviews with many composers and musicians. I did the last published interviews with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/06/tod-dockstader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eelectronic music pioneer Tod Dockstader\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.frieze.com/max-mathews/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecomputer music pioneer Max Mathews\u003c/a\u003e before they died. I wrote the longest, most in-depth article that exists about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.frieze.com/conrad-schnitzler/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe late German renegade musician and sound artist Conrad Schnitzler\u003c/a\u003e, did\u00a0the longest interview ever done with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.frieze.com/interview-dieter-moebius/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe late German musician and member of Cluster, Dieter Moebius\u003c/a\u003e, and wrote\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/zeitgeschichten.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea massive article on the late German producer Conny Plank, which was translated into German\u003c/a\u003e. (I\u0027m considered to be an expert on \u0027Krautrock\u0027, for what that\u0027s worth.)\u00a0I pulled several all-nighters to put together\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.frieze.com/robert-ashley-1930-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea gigantic tribute to the composer Robert Ashley\u003c/a\u003e after he died, getting in touch with dozens of famous composers in record time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve interviewed synthesizer inventors, hackers, and famous science fiction authors. I\u0027ve traveled to rural Indiana to watch scientists shoot heavy bass frequencies through cannons in cornfields at midnight. You can read through some of the hundreds of articles I\u0027ve written on a wide variety of subjects\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. The common thread running through all of my best work is that I\u0027ve always taken the path of MOST resistance -- to go several steps further, to dig deeper than what\u0027s readily available. To not just repeat what\u0027s already out there, but to add \u003cem\u003enew\u003c/em\u003e research to the world, and strange new ideas. I\u0027ve sought out dusty boxes in hidden garages in California and secret libraries in Germany to find tapes that no one thought existed.\u00a0Artists, musicians and composers cutting across generations trust me to not get facts wrong.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now I need your help. The current atmosphere in journalism is hostile to those of us who specialize in long, cerebral explorations of the fringes of human endeavor. I\u0027m not interested in writing meaningless clickbait to maximize page views. I write for some very prestigious publications, but the pay per article has tumbled since I started 13 years ago. Word counts have gone down too. I can keep doing quality long-form work, if the readers who really care about this stuff kick in $1, or $3, or $5 or $10 each month. Support smart, creative, thoughtful writing on music. Think of it like buying me a cup of coffee or a new pencil every month. If there are enough of you, I\u0027ll be able to continue doing this. If not, I may have to stop completely, which would be sad for me and sad for music, too. Thank you!"
