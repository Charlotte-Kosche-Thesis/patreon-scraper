    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027d be honoured if you\u0027d patron-ize me. I\u0027m an Eisner and Shuster Award winning comic store owner in Victoria, BC (my day job since 1992) who has been writing, drawing, and self publishing comic books, graphic novels, and records since 1990. I have 167 issues of my comic book series Magic Teeth, 13 records on my record label, three graphic novels, and one full colour, hardcover children\u0027s book (which includes a theme song by Barenaked Ladies\u0027 own Ed Robertson) already out in the world. My non self-published output includes the art for the hardcover \"Victoria Imagined\" book, the hundred page hardcover comic book \"Silence Is A Song I Know All The Words To\" with Shane Koyczan, the multiple-million YouTube viewed video for \"Troll\" with Shane Koyczan,\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/670if6Etx0o\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e The \"Shoulders\" video project with David Suzuki and Shane Koyczan, and the \"Take A Little Time\" animated rock video by Kathryn Calder (of The New Pornographers):\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m listing some of this work to show that I do actually get things finished. I\u0027ve seen all of these projects through to completion and I\u0027m now starting my biggest project to date:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking for funding to allow me to work on my new book about Harvey Kurtzman (the creator of Mad Magazine and the \"Godfather of Underground Comics.\"). Tentatively titled \"My Cartooning Pilgrimage\", it\u0027s not only a biography of my favourite artist (Harvey Kurtzman 1924-1993), it\u0027s also a travelogue of my adventures with my wife to his New York studio, illustrated interviews with his cohorts and disciples, and a detailed account of his and his wife\u0027s unwitting transformation of pop culture from (roughly) 1946-1960. His widow Adele Kurtzman, I\u0027ll argue, told the greatest lie of the 20th Century and we\u0027re all the better off because of it. (It\u0027s an incredible story).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book might be in the area of 120 full-colour pages and may take me another couple of years to finish, but I believe the story needs to be told. Concurrently, I\u0027ll be continuing with my Victoria, BC -centric adventure series Enid Jupiter and Lyra Gotham: The Monster Sisters (six issues have been published so far).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a short video about this project from a local television station: \u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgZ53GsxElo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Magic Teeth Comics went through 70 issues as a zine and (so far) 71 issues as a glossy, full-sized comic book. My new series, however, is called Enid Jupiter and Lyra Gotham: The Monster Sisters. It is the accumulation of all of my various interests and stars my two daughters as architecture students and action/adventurers in an exciting version of Victoria, British Columbia that has been overrun by a bevy of monstrous monsters. It includes true and slightly altered histories, fun-facts, girl power, monsters, mayhem and gorgeous architecture. Three issues have been released so far and I have outlined another dozen that I want to create.",
