On her own, prior to the internet, she was able to climb out of her anxiety to peace and well-being by trial and error.\u003cbr\u003eUsing her professional knowledge of nutrition and personal understanding of prayer and meditation she was able to string together one anxiety free day after another until she couldn\u2019t even remember her last panic attack. With new-found energy and relief from clearing her anxiety she was able to handle major life challenges with much more ease -eventually moving 6,000 miles away to Hawaii over 10 years ago.\u003cbr\u003eOn Maui Gina worked as the nutritionist for an Eating Disorder Intensive Outpatient Center for 8 years using her knowledge and wisdom of the mind-body and spirit to help clients clear their food related anxiety, obsessions and compulsions. Gina currently works as an Anxiety Coach and also teaches Mindful Eating and Nutrition to clients around the world. She considers her work her calling and is fully immersed in living a healthy, mindful and compassionate life.\u003cbr\u003e",
