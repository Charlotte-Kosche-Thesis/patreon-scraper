    "summary": "So recently, there was an idea. An idea that created a fire in my belly and in the belly of my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral folks here in the Great Lakes area decided that rather than have to travel all over the country. We would take the teachings and practices that we have learned over the years and offer them here in a local environment and at a cost that better represents the Midwest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.greatlakesintegral.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Great Lakes Integral\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided that the best way to implement the idea was to create a sort of umbrella organization. Our group is made up of psychotherapists, lawyers, personal coaches, and spiritual leaders who have years of experience in multiple disciplines. We want to offer workshops and events in the great lakes area to people who are interested in personal work and are Integrally informed. The revolutionary part of this is that we are not only offering our practices but taking the initiative to find other effective types of personal work that are out of the\u00a0house so to speak, and making them known through our media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we don\u0027t just want to offer events. Our members want to start creating youtube videos and a podcast to make the signal from here as load as can be!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we come to the crux of the matter. To do all this, we need your patronage. Our ambitions are great but are wallets are fairly empty. Costs for equipment, website maintenance,\u00a0and the like don\u0027t come cheap. The workshops that we are offer are specifically designed to keep prices as low as can be while still allowing or members to make ends meet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur hope is that your patronage can help offset the costs of maintenance so that we can continue to keep our prices low as well as make sure that future content is ad-free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntegral\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntegral theory is a cutting edge philosophy originally started by the American philosopher Ken Wilber. The Integral approach combines several disciplines such psychology, spirituality, and phenomenology (to name just a few) to get a more healthy and balanced view of the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that you can benefit from this work. We want to help anyone and everyone live a more healthy, peaceful, and conscious life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are welcome here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
