I want to do a lot. But alas, it costs money to make this a reality. Not too much initially, but enough to hit the wallet fairly hard (~$25 USD per hour). Hundreds and hundreds of hours have already been paid for, and as much as I try, I do not make enough in\u00a0 revenue from ads to continue paying as much as I should. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to have this project be a full-time job for our one and only programmer and expand the project to include more developers, but, as I said earlier, money is an issue for this to be a thing. If you\u0027d like to help out our cause, or you just enjoy what we offer, that being an image board software, become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll money will first be used to pay our coder Geltas. This is our #1 priority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you an idea of how long development will take with all the tickets on the tracker waiting to be worked on, it would be between 6-18 months before we have an alpha ready for public testing.\u003cbr\u003e"
