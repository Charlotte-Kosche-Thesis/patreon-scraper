    "summary": "Gal Pals Present is an independent production company that aims to produce diverse, character-driven narratives across print and digital platforms. In other words, it\u0027s the label we use for making all our weird gay art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we making?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverkill\u003c/strong\u003e is a\u00a0comedy podcast, a murder mystery, and a love story all wrapped in one vaguely supernatural package. Based on EVP audio recorded by M.A.A.G. (Mothers Against Aliens and Ghosts), this audio drama follows 19-year-old Aya Velasquez as she attempts to solve the mystery of her own death.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSt. Agnes v. the No Good, Very Bad Book \u003c/strong\u003eis a comedic coming-of-age tale across three generations. St. Agnes Catholic Girls School erupts into scandal after three fourth graders are caught reading a book about \u201cS - E - X.\u201d This podcast follows the aftermath as it ravages friendships, careers, and grades K-12.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGal Pals Present was created by me, Lia Hagen, as a platform for publishing my independent projects. I began by creating\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Arms-Roses-Anthology-Queer/dp/1973804476\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDawn With Arms of Roses\u003c/a\u003e, an anthology of queer joy that featured poetry, prose, and visual art from 24 artists in 7 countries. In December 2017, I teamed up with the amazing sound designer Juan Giordano (our token man) and the phenomenal voice actresses Rebecca Rivera and Christina Gayton. Together we became the creative team behind \"Overkill,\" a podcast that has since received over 1800 total downloads. In March, we\u0027ll be releasing \"St Agnes v. the No Good, Very Bad Book,\" a new audio drama that features the original creative team as well as six new voice actresses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasts are one of the most accessible mediums for independent creators, but they still cost money and a LOT of time. If you like what we do and want us to keep doing it, help us out by dropping a few dollars in our digital tip jar! Our long-term goal is to eventually become a sustainably funded web production company, and this Patreon is one of the ways we\u0027re working to get closer to that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking us out. We appreciate your support, regardless of whether or not you can donate."
