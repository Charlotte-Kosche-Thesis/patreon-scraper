    "summary": "My name is Slater G. String. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m a vegan genderqueer performer and makeup artist located in good ol\u2019 Brooklyn, New York! My Instagram account is mostly photos of vegan food that I make or makeup and drag that I do. Over time I noticed that vegan accounts that, at first, had only liked my food photos were also beginning to like my genderfuck makeup posts as well. It was then that I realized that I was giving these people an introduction to gender politics through the food that I make. I was so excited that I found an intersection between my two passions that I felt could translate to a bigger audience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you want to make this show? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFood culture is one of the few things that connects us all as humans regardless of the identities constructed to label and separate us. Food brings people together, and talking about food lends itself to talking about other important issues. We want vegan food to be accessible to everyone, while talking about the issues surrounding food that we eat on a daily basis.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want our audience to be conscious of what they\u2019re putting in their bodies, and the impact they have on individuals and communities surrounding them. The show - in addition to demonstrating the preparation of a low-cost vegan recipe - will feature local Brooklyn artists talking about a broad variety of current issues related to race, gender, sexual orientation, class, nationality, disability and food politics based on their lived experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, but why veganism? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we use the resources that we use to grow livestock for consumption to directly feed humans instead, cutting out the middle man, we can lessen our environmental footprint, fewer humans would face starvation, and animals wouldn\u2019t have to suffer heinous living conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\nVegan food has been branded as classist and time-consuming by mainstream media--it doesn\u2019t have to be. For instance, did you know that many farmers\u2019 markets take EBT? We want to teach you basic skills and techniques to eat healthier on a budget. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, and we\u2019re hungry!\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile we don\u2019t expect viewers to immediately stop eating burgers and drinking milk, we hope we can help you introduce vegan meals as a regular part of your diet. Veganism is not a diet; it\u2019s a way of thinking. We don\u2019t endorse shaming as an educational tactic on our show.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you need money for though??\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe shot our pilot completely out of pocket. The entire crew volunteered their time \u0026amp; worked for free. This was necessary for the first episode, but we will not be working that way moving forward. We believe in fair pay, especially for queer folks who are often taken advantage of in the workplace. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWant to see more?
