And who came roaring out but a pair of crazy-yet-loveable geeks by the names David \u201cMonts\u201d Monteith and Barry \u201cNuge\u201d Nugent. Producing a weekly (well most of the time) podcast celebrating and commenting all aspects of geek life GS is one of the longest running geek related podcasts in the UK. Now in its tenth year the success of the podcast led Barry and Dave to presenting two documentaries for the \u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02cjmmj\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBBC iPlayer channel\u003c/a\u003e at the end of 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF7vMR_B7tI\" width=\"853\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi everyone, this is Barry from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://geeksyndicate.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGeek Syndicate\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off to those of you reading this who listen to our podcast many thanks for sticking with us. This year (providing we don\u0027t go the Smallville route and become arch enemies) marks our 10th anniversary of Podcasting. It is a heck of landmark when you think that when we started we had to explain to people what a podcast was and now look at em! I know for a fact that we would never be in shouting distance of this anniversary without the support of our listeners and readers, so many thanks for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDave and I have always done the podcast for our share love of comics, books, TV and all things geek. When we started the website it was for those same reasons but with one important addition, we wanted to do our bit to put some positivity back into geekdom. Over the years many others have joined us as writers on the GS website or as podcasters on our GS network of podcasts. In the last ten years we have gone from two best friends to an entire family of geeks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://geeksyndicate.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/sam_1311.jpg\" style=\"width: 208px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://geeksyndicate.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/37814_10150217674140092_129453_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 208px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main reason for using Patreon is that we did have a paypal donate button on the website but I\u0027ve been told by a few listeners that it\u0027s much better to handle this through Patreon. So we\u0027ve set up this page for fans of Geek Syndicate who like what we\u0027ve been doing and would like to support the show/website.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs always any contributions will go straight back into the upkeep of Geek Syndicate, no one at GS has taken a penny for themselves. In a perfect world I would love to use some of the cash from contributions to pay a little something per article to anyone who writes for GS. Another area Dave and I have talked about doing (after our iPlayer shows) is a proper youtube GS show hosted by both of us. Unfortunately due to travel costs etc etc it\u0027s never really got off the ground apart from Dave and I doing solo vids. Contributions could make that idea a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m still working out reward levels (some ideas included shoutouts on the show,extra podcasts,youtube vids, bringing back listener of the month,allowing pledgers to suggests topics for the show, digital copy of the GS webcomic) \u00a0so for the time being there will only be one pledge which will be for $1 or more, if you want.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, whether you can offer any support or not thanks for taking the time to read this and listening to podcast or visiting the website!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Barry\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://geeksyndicate.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sog.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
