    "summary": "Maps? Do you like maps? Well, if you do, you\u0027re certainly in for a treat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs two independent, freelance cartographers, we (that\u0027s Dan and Greg!) decided to team up to do what we love (you guessed it, maps!) directly for the people who love them (that\u0027s you, friends!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur aim is to start off by creating 2 map sets every month. 1 every 14 days. Now you may be wondering what we mean when we say \"map sets\", well we mean one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\u003cstrong\u003eModular dungeon tiles\u003c/strong\u003e - 12 small dungeon pieces at a scale of 1\":5\u0027 you can fit together to make your own dungeon\nlayout! Each month will have a different theme as voted by you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\u003cstrong\u003eA larger battlemap\u003c/strong\u003e - a single larger battlemap for you to explore. Also, at 1\" for every 5\u0027, this map can be anywhere up to 18\u201dx22\u201d big! The best part though? \u003cem\u003eWhat it is of is up to you\u003c/em\u003e! Whether you want an old\nhaunted hamlet lost in the forest; a treasure filled cave hidden below a\nwaterfall; a lost crypt filled with scattered bones and cursed treasures; or a\ngoblin\u2019s lair in the centre of a volcano; cast your vote in the monthly poll\nand we\u2019ll make it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\u003cstrong\u003eTown and city maps\u003c/strong\u003e! - Want a detailed city map for\nyour players to explore? Every so often, we\u2019ll produce a detailed city map\ncomplete with hidden gems, dark alleyways and ready for players to dive in and\nexplore!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\u003cstrong\u003eRegional maps!\u003c/strong\u003e - Is your party traveling over vast\nareas? We\u0027ll make regional maps of mighty Kingdoms, warring factions, or entire\ncontinents, complete with cities, landmarks and places of interest, like\nmagical sites, caves, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe decide what maps we\u0027ll\nmake by using a monthly poll, with 4-6 maps or dungeon sets. The map/set with\nthe most votes is made, along with another map, or a set of our own choosing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also very flexible. If something isn\u0027t popular, or you want something else thrown in instead, we\u0027re always open to ideas and more than happy to try new things out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve never done anything like this before, so at first it\u0027ll be just testing the waters and we thank anyone who\u0027s wanting to embark on this journey with us. What an epic adventure it may become!\u003cbr\u003e"
