    "summary": "Who are you?\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unfamiliar with me (and I\u0027m assuming you are, because, let\u0027s face it, why would you you be) I am a scientifically passionate hip hop recording artist and founder of secular creative collective\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wergrandunified\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGrand Unified Theory\u003c/a\u003e. Currently, I have released 5 solo albums as well as 1 collaborative effort with my good friend and partner in rhyme\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://cgats.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eC-Gats\u003c/a\u003e. Today music isn\u0027t the only way I express myself. I\u0027ve always been into Vlogging, and have always wanted to have a regular production of videos containing my thoughts on various subjects and matters. Today I do this through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/greydonsquare/videos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube Streaming\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/greydonsquare\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook Live\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Should I Watch Your Live Streams?\u003cbr\u003eEvery day I pick 3 topics and try to give my honest raw thoughts about them. I\u0027ve covered topics such as the weaponization of family courts to anti-natalism. I try to stream every day, and I have a live chat feed embedded inside the video in which I answer live questions. After about an hour discussion, I record my final thoughts in to an exclusive subscriber-only video. (Hey, blame my Jerry Springer Upbringing) I encourage user discussion, and the Grand Unified community is incredibly engaged and active during livestreams.  I want to bring you insightful discussions, and push the boundaries of thinking at some of the highest levels.  Tune in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Why A Patreon Account?\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I want to produce a better show for you guys. But obviously as you know, that comes with some overhead costs. This would essentially make YOU the patron (I think I used that right) my boss. If I had enough support, I would upgrade to a legit camera, maybe a few lights, a couple of LAV microphones, and that fancy shmasy Xsplit software I\u0027ve been reading so much about. At the very least, you make it so that I can focus on making thought provoking discussion videos for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy major investment in this show will be my time and effort. Doing research, maybe arranging a guest or two, prepping pre and editing post show.\u00a0Until this point, my bandcamp subscription has been the only subscription service I had, but since i\u0027ve been asked about more recently, I figured, why not give it a shot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Patreon\"??\u003cbr\u003eSo as I\u0027m recently learning, Patreon is an established online platform that allows fans to provide regular financial support to creators.  Patreon was created by a musician who needed a easy way for fans to support his band. And dammit, I wish I\u0027d thought of it first!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to support?\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron is fairly straight forward.  Patrons agree to a regular monthly contribution of $5 per month. There is a small processing fee, and i\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be taxed, but your money goes directly towards covering the overhead of my daily vlogcast. Maybe a few upgrades if it ever gets that far. Any time you wish to change or stop your payments you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hopefully this works for all parties interested. The LiveStreams on facebook and youtube stays available to everyone, and those who want to provide financial support can do so - easily, safely and efficiently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about ...?\u003cbr\u003eBandcamp? You can still subscribe to bandcamp. These will both be active concurrently. YouTube advertising? Honestly, screw Youtube\u0027s monetization. The normal return from YouTube ads is between $2 and $5 per thousand views, and the producer only earns anything if their viewers choose to click away from their video and watch the ad.  Most viewers won\u0027t do that, but everyone has to put up with the ad.  This is so not worth it, and with my numbers it wouldn\u0027t bring in nearly enough funding.  Direct sponsoring is perhaps slightly less intrusive, but again depends on much higher view numbers than we get. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Patron you are.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003eSo the \"final thoughts video\" as well as unreleased music I can post here will be available. Ill try to come up with original content for Patrons in the coming months.\u00a0And if, for whatever reason, financial support is not something that you can do right now, just know that I still want you to tune in. Keep watching, enjoy the show, get your some brain food while hanging out with GU.  If you have a suggestion for a topic, just let me know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you value my contribution to art and discussion, and you want it to continue, and you are able to make a financial contribution, then please consider becoming a Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace Peace,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Greydon Square\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Grand Unified Theory\u003c/em\u003e"
