    "summary": "I\u0027m Gemma Files, and for the last twenty-five years I\u0027ve been writing award-winning horror fiction (my latest novel is \u003cem\u003eExperimental Film\u003c/em\u003e, from ChiZine Publications), but my background is in film criticism--I spent nine years writing reviews for Toronto\u0027s (now defunct) \u003cem\u003eeye\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWeekly\u003c/em\u003e, an independent news and culture paper which allowed me to make a small regional name for myself covering genre, cult and weird film of all types, before moving on to teach film history, screenplay writing and TV show development at the (equally now defunct) Toronto Film School. Unfortunately, systemic changes in the industry have since made it all but impossible for me to do the type of critical writing I\u0027m drawn to for money anymore; blame it on the death of dead tree publication, the rise of comment culture, or both. Yet I still find myself drawn to write about things I like and why I like them, which brings us to the point of this Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I first read \u003cem\u003eDance Macabre\u003c/em\u003e, Stephen King\u0027s seminal survey of horror culture--way back in 1981, at the tender age of thirteen--I\u0027ve wanted to put together a book which would encapsulate the full range what this genre means to me; not just provocation and inspiration on a creative and/or consumer level, the itch before the scratch, but a bedrock type of existential comfort, the recognition that there are many, many more people out there than myself who find a home in darkness, a kinship with monsters, and seek always for that numinous moment of epiphany which can apparently only be found at the outer edges of mainstream acceptability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the basic pitch for what I\u0027m trying to do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eDark Comforts \u003c/em\u003ewill be a\u00a0non-fiction book of reviews and articles talking about the pleasure I personally derive from the full spectrum of horror culture: shock, dread, fright, existential awe, black humour, transfigurative ecstasy. In terms of movies, for example, I might talk about specific sub-genres (folk horror, religious horror, international horror of various types including Canadian horror, body horror, feminist horror, thriller/slasher, true crime, Hammer horror, Universal horror, millennial horror), the pleasures of crap (stuff I know objectively is not \u201cgood\u201d but return to again and again, sometimes because I like the tone or components, sometimes for inspiration), my spasms of archivist fever (\u003cem\u003esomebody\u003c/em\u003e needs to own this, just in case!), movies I own but don\u0027t watch/may never watch again and why, etc. But I\u0027d also talk about books, and stories, and music, and art, plus the various mechanisms of horror storytelling, and attempt to answer what outsiders appear to consider the central questions of the genre, ie: \u201cWhy would you [consume] THAT? Why do that to yourself? What do you get out of it?\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reviews and essay articles created with your patronage will all be extremely cross-referential, full of comparison, contrast and patterning aimed at mapping the genre\u0027s inherent symbology and vocabulary, with the eventual compiled manuscript running 100,000+ words in length\u2014not quite a unified field theory of horror, so much, as a look at what appeals to me and why, filtered through the lens of personal experience. Think Clive Barker\u0027s\u00a0\u003cem\u003eA to Z of Horror\u003c/em\u003e more than Kier-La Janisse\u0027s \u003cem\u003eHouse of Psychotic Women\u003c/em\u003e, with\u003cem\u003e Dance Macabre \u003c/em\u003eas the Red Death holding sway over all. My thesis: Most people are scared by something, though not all people are scared by the same things...and in the best horror, \u003cem\u003eboth\u003c/em\u003e these facts are taken into account.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSchedule of goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\nyou commit to giving me $2.00 per month to produce reviews and\nessays, you\u0027ll receive my eternal gratitude, plus direct links to all\nthe reviews and essays I produce per month.

I hope to soon be able to plunge headfirst into this project, as well as keeping up my normal output and schedule of deadlines. Either way, stay scary.\u003cbr\u003e"
