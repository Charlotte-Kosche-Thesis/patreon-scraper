My name is Dustin, and with my partner Nathaniel, we intend to make gaming content you would all want to watch. Every week, we will play games the other is unfamiliar with for your viewing. We will also include games chosen exclusively by our patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will be our primary source of funding this project until we can earn money through advertising. Without some source of funding, the channel will be limited in what we can do. As college students, Nathaniel and I aren\u0027t in a position to regularly purchase games, nor can we freely invest in improving our audio and video equipment or in obtaining new game systems or even VR equipment. If you decide to donate to Game Expansion, all of your donations will be redirected to buying any games we play or to improving the quality of your viewing experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will earn you special rewards! Every Friday is Fan Friday. On these days, we will play a game chosen by our patrons (Saturday will also be reserved for episodes of a fan series, though a new fan series will always start on Friday). If you choose to donate even $1, you will get to submit a game for Fan Friday! We will contact you for your suggestion. Every time we begin a new fan series, we will randomly select a submission from the pool of patron suggestions. If your game is chosen, that\u0027s what we will play! Though there will be a couple of stipulations on this raffle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny game chosen\u00a0will definitely be played for at least 5 episodes. If you guys love the game, and its difficulty isn\u0027t preventing us from completing it, we will definitely try to finish it. Also, for the early months of Game Expansion, we may not be financially capable of playing any game you may suggest. If the game suggested will cost substantially more than Patreon is providing us, and if we are not able to pay the remainder of the game cost without jeopardizing our living expenses, we may have to select a different game than the one chosen. We will announce the name of anyone whose suggested game is chosen in the first episode of its series!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, you guys are what allows us to make content. Without you, this project would only be a hobby that we could entertain as long as we didn\u0027t have expenses. You allow us to expand (heh, expand) Game Expansion for years to come. We cannot thank you enough for your donations, no matter how small.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027ll be a part of our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Dustin and Nathaniel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
