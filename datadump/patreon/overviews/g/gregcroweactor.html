    "summary": "I realized I loved to act at the tender age of 42. Since then I have decided to do whatever I could to make a living as an actor, even knowing the odds that were against me. A little more than two years ago I got laid off from my \"day job\" as a\u00a0product reviewer\u00a0for a tech magazine, and I took that as a sign. While it was nice to have that steady money coming in, it was really nothing more than an obstacle to me giving acting my full attention and effort. So I buckled down and took some classes, found ways to network with casting directors in NY, and did showcases when I was able.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have four co-star TV credits on my resume (for VEEP, Broad City, Difficult People, Jon Glaser Loves Gear), and have been working freelance with an agent to try and get more. But there are the expenses the keep demanding money regularly when my income is still far from regular. I pulled all the money from an IRA that is made of all the 401k\u0027s I had contributed to, but it wasn\u0027t a fortune to start with. Also, there is a huge tax bill from 2015r due to me pulling out so much from it, and I now have regular payments to both state and federal because of it..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to\u00a0sound all gloom and doom, because it\u0027s not. Aside from the TV credits, I have done a fair amount of independent film, including one for the 2015 Baltimore 48-Hour Film Project for which I earn the award for \"Best Actor.\" I just got done with a supporting role on Bo Burnham\u0027s feature film \"The Coolest Girl in the World.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I will be able to concentrate on improving myself as an actor, while continuing to form and reinforce relationships with the people who are used to cast NY\u0027s TV shows and films.\u003cbr\u003e"
