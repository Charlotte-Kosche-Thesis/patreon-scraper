    "summary": "Hey there Patrons, I\u0027m Johnny. I\u0027ve not long ago started running a gaming blog which you can check out at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gbjohnnygaming.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egbjohnnygaming.blogspot.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now though, stick around and we\u0027ll talk about the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst things first, I am a lifelong gamer, my happiest memories are of gaming and whatever else has come or gone in my life it has always been there as an outlet, distraction or support if I needed to get away from my \"real\" life. Then, when everything was fine, I always had a way to kick back and unwind. Over the years games have made me laugh, made me cry, brought me to the brink of controller snapping frustration, told me stories, set me challenges and otherwise taught me about life, the universe and everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why, having been sacked from my crap day job, I have decided at long last to return the favour and give gaming my best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I\u0027LL BE DOING\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn recent years Patreon has been proven fertile ground for commentary, journalism and all other forms of punditry. My immediate goal is to make being a games pundit a viable day job, because I want to get up in the morning and do something that I love without being accountable to any single person or corporate entity for my income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaying so makes me sound like a mercenary but that\u0027s a big thing for me. Between my own admittedly sour experience of work and observations of not just games media, but the media in general I would in no way feel comfortable writing for an established outlet for fear of having things coming in over my head and effecting my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly doing this is something that I have considered for years now, but a crowdfunded model never occurred to me. I had thought of getting my start on YouTube, simply because it seemed like the thing to do if one wanted to be a commentator or journo or whatever we want to call it, but I always felt that I would fall foul of over-saturation to simply be ignored and honestly I\u0027ve always expected the bottom to fall out of the ad-revenue boat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is only recently with bigger name commentators beginning to gravitate to crowd-funded models that I feel it\u0027s viable to get in on the ground floor and make good with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now major articles will be published to the GB Gaming blog Monday or Friday, sometimes both if we have a good week for gaming, with Wednesday serving as a platform for irregular editorial style pieces or announcements to do with scheduling and other matters of housekeeping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarly on there will be sparse reviews due to financial constraints, although if I\u0027m able to acquire any sort of significant following this will be quickly remedied; in the meantime gaps will be filled with retrospectives on games that I\u0027ve played earlier this year, games that I\u0027ve loved in the past or games which I simply think need to be talked about. Doing this means there\u0027ll be a steady stream of content and that readers can come to know me as a commentator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY PLANS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEventually I want to grow GB Gaming in to a recognizable brand, how to do that is largely unclear to me at this point and I suspect a large part of it will happen \u003cstrong\u003esort of\u003c/strong\u003e on the fly, but there are a few relatively short term goals that I have in mind to help with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking Minimum Wage:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003eAs stated above, I want to make this my career. To do that I need a dependable revenue stream for rent, other personal expenses, equipment and of course \u003cstrong\u003egames\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m not very much mistaken, to make the same amount as someone on UK minimum wage based on an assumed 7 hours a day 5 days a week I need somewhere in the area of \u00a3938 monthly pledge which is something like $1400, but to be honest I could probably get by on about $1000 per month, making rent and still have enough to operate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I can get by off it I\u0027m gonna get GB Gaming its own domain, custom layout, graphics, custom everything, ridiculous hydraulics and diamond studded rims. Eh, sorry lost my train of thought there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncorporation and Hiring:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003eIf and when the revenue stream expands to where I can comfortably pay my own way I want to get other people involved in this thang I got goin\u0027 on. The first of these will be a second writer, probably producing content for Tuesday and Thursday slots, though the distribution of work may well get shuffled around so no one\u0027s on too tight a schedule \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0so I don\u0027t have to work Mondays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially they\u0027ll be on an appropriate living wage for their area of residence, but as the brand get\u0027s bigger and bigger (I\u0027m hoping at 2-3 years in) that\u0027ll quickly change.\u00a0In simple terms you\u0027ll start as a suffering artist just getting by doing something you love, but as the cashflow gets thicker and faster your takings will increase appropriately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBreaking onto YouTube:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003eYouTube channels get started every day (and then some) but considering my earlier trepidation about it as an environment if I\u0027m going to do it all I\u0027m damn sure adamant that I\u0027m going to do it right. That said this is probably the most nebulous of all my goals, I want enough money behind me that I\u0027ll be able to purchase and maintain high quality recording/editing software and equipment which will likely include a gaming rig since I\u0027m entirely limited to console coverage at time of writing. (\u003cem\u003eBanished \u003c/em\u003emakes my laptop chug if you can believe such a thing.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to that, it doesn\u0027t really fall in to the plan at any specific point, it\u0027s more something I want to happen at sometime to make me (or us as it may be by that time) more visible to the wider gaming community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what\u0027ll go on the channel, likely cut down video reviews, it\u0027ll probably inherit the Wednesday editorial slot and I\u0027m thinking that each of us will have some kind of playthrough going, probably to be put up on their \"off days\" so everyone\u0027s getting exposure all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMerch:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003eBecause brand recognition y\u0027all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis area more than any is what I want input into. As a community grows around this thing I\u0027d like to listen to what it wants and respond with goodies. Badges, t-shirts, mousepads, device cases, all that good stuff and whatever we can cook up between us besides."
