Let me introduce myself, my name is Ryusuke Gomez. I am a furry artist who does comic illustrations, stand alone illustrations, and have been getting into animation. I\u0027ve been an artist since 2000 and a furry for even longer. Since I was a hatchling, I\u0027ve been wanting to do art professionally, and throughout the years I\u0027ve been practicing and honing my skills to become that. even giving college a shot. I\u0027ve improved immensely since those days. Yet still got a long way to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter going to the art institute to study animation, I found out its all political bullshit to steal your money and crush you\u0027re spirit unless you\u0027re a prodigy, and left to do it on my own. Though I love animation and still have a passion for it, i ended up coming out of it making comics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I offering?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a story teller at heart and my fellow Furries. I come to you, with a dream..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, i been working on comic projects for free all this time. And how things are nowadays, I kinda need to validate my creative output. Aka, dun wanna do it for free no more. Daddy ain\u0027t got no passion in any marketable job, so here is where i am. Eventually I\u0027ll be good enough to get my stuff more out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge to me, I will produce comics to you of the manly nature; sometimes adult, sometimes not. (gotta show the more normal people that I\u0027m still doing art) covering various themes, and genres, but all carrying the same concept. Cute/sexy Furries being crazy/sexy/cool. With some added kinks and/or scenarios, but nothing too out there or weird. I\u0027m mainly focused on the Furries as well as the fantasy and/or sci-fi type including orcs, goblins, satyrs, aliens, and things like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get an idea of what I\u0027m about, here is my FurAffinity page: \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/ryusuke573/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/ryusuke573/\u003c/a\u003e (adult images are hidden from un-registered users)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created several comics throughout the years. including a Skyrim-based comic and its sequel. As well as various one offs, and an older strip series called Smash. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture projects include another sequel to \"Lovers Comfort\", a handful of short one-offs, as well as a MASSIVE sprawling sci-fi epic with aliens, space ships, pirates, robots, abductions, wormhole travel, sentient rubber like armor that reshapes to weapons and/or tools to aid the hero\u0027s, and all that shebangabang~!!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all this sounds interesting to you, than you should totally help support the cause! Not asking for too much. You get all these cool comic projects before anyone else gets to see them for a couple o\u0027 bucks, and not to mention a couple other special goodies and doodles I normally don\u0027t post anywhere. Because of your wonderful contributions, I get an opportunity to live off my work, push myself artistically, improve upon it, and grow to be a true professional!\u003cbr\u003e"
