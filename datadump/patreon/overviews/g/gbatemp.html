    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eYou\u0027re a part of it\u003c/h2\u003eDear GBAtemp members, visitors, lurkers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been working extra hard for the past 6 months to bring to you the best community experience GBAtemp has ever seen in its 15-year long life: a new modern site and forum design, ready right on time for E3 2017! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, we\u0027ve decided to step up our game this year: we finally have a modern-era site design, and our press coverage has been increasingly extensive and exhaustive. We have published hundreds of reviews for all platforms over the past years thanks to our amazing editorial team. We now provide you with fresh news coverage for the entire spectrum of the gaming industry (Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, computer gaming...), and unlike most other sites we still have the rare freedom of being able to openly discuss console hacking and system modifications. This freedom is due to the indepedence we have managed to conserve over all these years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest with you, there\u0027s been several acquisition attempts over the past years. But we\u0027ve never sold you out! We\u0027re still there, working behind the scenes every day to make this community one of the best and largest independent gaming communities on the web. We intend to keep it that way. And in order to make this happen, in order to be able to keep providing you with fresh editorial content, in order to conserve our freedom under any circumstance, we need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support on Patreon, we intend to do great things: just take a moment to read this and see for yourself. If you decide to back us, there will be amazing consequences from both individual and community perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBenefits for the community\u003c/h2\u003eIf you look at the big picture first, here\u0027s what we will be able to do on short and long terms with your support: the key word here is \u0027redistribution\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eThe GBAtemp Bounty will rise again\u003c/strong\u003e: we will periodically organize a grand vote to reward the best project in recent months; and we mean any project - not just homebrew games or applications (hence the new name \u0027GBAtemp Bounty\u0027 as opposed to \u0027GBAtemp Homebrew Bounty\u0027), this includes translations, custom firmwares, hacks, tutorials, in short: anything that qualifies as \u0027project\u0027. The winner will not only receive a special award medal but more importantly a reward directly based on the support we get through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eRaffles for backers\u003c/strong\u003e: all Patreon backers who pledge a minimum of $2/m will be able to enter a raffle taking place four times a year. There won\u0027t be any particular rules for entering, you\u0027ll be part of it if you decide to back us, just post in the raffle threads when they come up. The raffle rewards will come in the form of gaming items: games, accessories, and even consoles if our Patreon backers are generous enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cstrong\u003eA new full-featured modern dark theme\u003c/strong\u003e: we have been hard at work for the past 6 months to bring you a new modern site design, this has meant countless hours of work, but we enjoyed it! So if we get enough support from you guys, we will be at it again and start working on the proper dark theme some of you have always wanted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) \u003cstrong\u003eImproving and increasing our editorial content\u003c/strong\u003e: although we are very proud of what we\u0027ve been able to achieve so far, there is still room for improvement in terms of both quantity and quality. If we receive sufficient support, we may be able to reward our staff with bonuses (be aware that at the moment they do not receive any reward in any form, ad revenue being insufficient for that) which in turn will lead to extra motivation and effort. Furthermore, we will be able to cover travel expenses such as flight tickets, hotel rooms, etc. to be able to attend more major events of the gaming industry: Tokyo Game Show, GDC, hacker conferences, and more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) \u003cstrong\u003eSupport our plans for long term development\u003c/strong\u003e: if we want to remain independent we can\u0027t make it without your help. We have so many ideas but let\u0027s be realistic, many of them require revenue to be viable on the long run. Check out our Patreon goals for some of the exciting ideas we\u0027ve got in store! Did you read them? Okay, that last Patreon goal might be a bit much ;-) But as the saying goes, \"\u003cem\u003eshoot for the moon, even if you miss you\u0027ll land among the stars\u003c/em\u003e\" !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBenefits for you\u003c/h2\u003eIf you decide to back us, you will also get lots of benefits on a personal level:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) The most important of all: you will get the warm and fuzzy feeling that comes with \u003cstrong\u003esupporting your favorite online community\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e(all backers!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) You will\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ebe allowed to enter the quarterly raffle\u003c/strong\u003e and therefore get a chance to win one of the prizes \u003cem\u003e($2+ backers)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) You will be part of a special member group that will have a \u003cstrong\u003eright to vote in the GBAtemp Bounty \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e($2+ backers)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) Your GBAtemp account will go \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely ad-free\u003c/strong\u003e: no more ads, neither on the desktop version nor on the mobile version! \u003cem\u003e($5+ backers)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) You will be allowed to use the new \u003cstrong\u003edark theme\u003c/strong\u003e in its beta version before it goes public, you\u0027ll be able to voice your suggestions, the same will also go for all future new styles and design improvements! \u003cem\u003e($10+ backers)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you are as excited as we are, we can\u0027t wait to begin this new adventure with all of you.\u003cbr\u003eIn the name of the entire GBAtemp team, thank you so much in advance for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCostello\u003cbr\u003e"
