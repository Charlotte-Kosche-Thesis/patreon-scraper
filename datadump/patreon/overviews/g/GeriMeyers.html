    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Geri Meyers, and I\u0027ve dreamed\nof being an author since I first realized in elementary school that\nactual people wrote books. I\u0027ve always had story ideas and characters\nin my head, and it clicked that I could be one of those people, that\nI could share the action, the drama and the romance I envisioned in\nmy mind with other people. Of course, as many of you know, dreams\nsometimes take a back seat to the struggles of living, and I put my\ndream on hold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried my hand at various different\njobs and careers because as many know, writing isn\u0027t a guaranteed\nsource of income, and a person\u0027s got to eat. I\u0027ve tried my hand\nworking fast food, cleaning fish tanks at an exotic fish and pet\nstore, I\u0027ve worked in a college as a peer tutor and in the medical\nfield as both a licensed nursing assistant and physical therapist\nassistant. In 2013 I was injured on the job preventing a\nfalling patient from becoming hurt, and the injury I sustained\ncombined with being an individual with Fibromyalgia has made it\nimpossible for me to return to a work environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe good thing that\u0027s come out of it is\nthat I finally have time to devote to my writing, to do the thing I\nwas always meant to do. I\u0027ve finished my first novel, titled \"The Reckless Prince\", and am devoting time to editing it in order to find an agent, and hopefully a publisher in time, while I work on\nmy other writing projects. I have two other novels in progress, one\nabout half finished, the other a third, and two project ideas in the\nnotes stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write fantasy fiction, it\u0027s been my\npassion since I was a small child. The Reckless Prince is a story of a\nyoung prince who wants to prove himself a worthy heir to\nthe throne. Led by a prophet\u0027s vision to seek a marriage with a\nneighboring princess, he sets out on a mission to abduct her,\ndodging his cousin\u0027s attempts to stop him\nbefore he starts a war between the kingdoms. Most of the side stories on this patreon are currently devoted to that story, but in the future I\u0027m planning to expand, and also to post draft chapters of stories I plan to self publish while I work on finding an agent and publisher for my bigger projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be using this Patreon to help me\npay for monthly expenses like groceries, medical bills, rent and\nutilities while I attempt to sell my manuscript. For those who wish\nto support me, I will be providing side scenes and stories related to\nthe books I\u0027m writing, as well as posting about my experiences as I\nattempt to sell my manuscript. The more support I receive, the more\noften I\u0027ll post updates and stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for taking the time to\nread this and for your patronage. Writing means the world to me, and\nhaving the chance to share it with all of you is an exciting\nopportunity. I hope you enjoy these stories and will venture on this\njourney with me as I reach for my dream to be a published author.\u003cbr\u003e"
