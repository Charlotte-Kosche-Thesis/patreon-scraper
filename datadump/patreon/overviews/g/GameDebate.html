It has grown from a single person\u0027s vision, into one of the biggest and friendliest online communities in the world. I am not elaborating either, it really is incredibly friendly.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe make online tools that regularly save people a lot of money, while also helping people learn too. We educate and simplify the purchase of PC hardware upgrades and games. With your backing we will take this to the next level, creating even more advanced PC hardware gaming performance analysis tools and then on to incredible game development projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\nGARY GYGAX - LEARNING FROM THE MASTER\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese imaginative tools and the core of the design behind our awesome community, comes from my understanding of what people want.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt may come as a surprise for some to hear, that this \u201cunderstanding\u201d derives largely from my decades of tabletop role-playing with friends.\u003cbr\u003eThe role-playing concept all began with a great man called Gary Gygax, creator of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons. And so you could say that GD is just another little gem that became possible thanks to my hero, Gary Gygax.\u003cbr\u003eI love DMing. Simultaneously guiding a group of people, each of whom have their own motives, through an interesting story, that I would deliver to the party on the fly. Pre-planning, second guessing their actions and tweaking rule sets to create a more engaging experience for each person at the table. Very challenging, very rewarding, very fun.\u003cbr\u003e\nNowadays many computer games have \u201cRPG\u201d embedded within their genre category. This is because they have some form of XP and leveling system built in, to help a player understand their progression and relate them to their current gaming achievement.\u00a0While essential, very few push beyond this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us reach our top milestone, so we can open a new game developer studio, to offer a new class of story driven games. Together we will build on these fundamental RPG principles, delivering dynamic narrative throughout our games and put rich role-playing experiences in front of you. Choice and consequence will matter, whether you are playing a sci-fi action game or fantasy realm management title.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\nFUNDING\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGame-Debate has attracted a huge, thriving community, where people share their knowledge and interest in gaming and PC hardware.\u003cbr\u003e\nI pay for website maintenance, hosting and new development with money from advertising. But this approach to funding feels almost out-of-date in today\u0027s online world of adblockers and spammy, irrelevant ads. Advert revenue continues to decrease rapidly, while advertisers ask for more and offer less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I still have tonnes of new ideas to develop!
