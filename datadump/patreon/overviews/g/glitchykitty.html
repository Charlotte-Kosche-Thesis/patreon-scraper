    "summary": "ABOUT ME\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHey y\u2019all!! My name is Shannon and depending on where you got this link from, you may know me for different reasons. I started attending anime and comic book conventions seven years ago and started putting effort and time into my cosplays around four years ago!! Later on during my cosplay journey I got a gig to interview people in my Ness cosplay at Apex 2015, when I discovered and fell in love with Super Smash Bros. Melee and the Smash community.\u003cbr\u003e\nTLDR; I dress up and push buttons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSHAN, WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE???\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m glad you asked, internet friend. Patreon is a platform used by artists, entertainers, musicians, content creators, etc. where followers of those people can pledge a certain amount every month to them to show monetary support, kinda like Twitch subs! In return for however much each patron pledges, they are given many different perks depending on how that artist wants to give back to their patrons and how much the patron pledged!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSHAN. WHY U GOTTA DO THIS?????\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPreface: Please don\u0027t feel like you even have to think about this. I saw a lot of my cosplay friends starting these so I figured I\u2019d try it out. I understand that there are MILLIONS of problems bigger than mine so I\u2019m not expecting much at all. This is for people who love my cosplays so far and have the means to support me even further to see them grow into bigger and better builds. THAT\u2019S ALL. *clears throat*. Anyway\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\nI started to want to get better at craftsmanship way before I even discovered the Smash community. With that said, I realized that cosplay alone is NOT a cheap hobby. Between armor making materials (worbla especially), lots of fabric, other sewing supplies, paints, shoes, contacts, wigs, etc., it gets hard to not be intimidated. On top of that, now that I made amazing friends in the Smash community, I like putting more of my money to traveling to nationals, which I\u2019m finding is making my cosplay progress even more difficult and at some times I feel like I have to quit either cosplaying or playing Melee. I love meeting you guys at tournaments as well as at conventions (which I only go to ones driving distance of New Jersey, I\u2019d love to travel to more one day) so I thought I\u2019d start this up and see where it went WHILE DOING FUN LIL REWARD LEVELS YAY. Thank you all for even just reading this. If you can\u0027t pledge, I\u0027m still grateful you even took the time to check out my page and listen to what I have to say. I appreciate every one of you. I hope to see you soon. \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e"
