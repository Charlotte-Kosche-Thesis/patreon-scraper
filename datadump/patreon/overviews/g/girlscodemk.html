Everyone is welcome and those with more experience can either get together to develop projects or coach beginners.\u003cbr\u003eOur meetings are informal and relaxed. Take it as a space where you can come, have a chat about coding, have wifi and electricity to try out coding, swap tips, ask questions and even play some beginner-friendly online coding games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe study languages and frameworks such as Python, Django, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that you\u0027re asking, yes, men are welcome to attend as well, but since our space is limited we\u0027ll prioritise women. We don\u0027t want men out of the IT industry, we just want more women in it!\u003cbr\u003eWe want to encourage more women to become web developers by sharing the wonderful world of coding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNodeSchool MK\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNodeSchool is our newest workshop to learn more about Javascript and Node.js. The meetup is suitable for all levels and everyone is welcomed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring our workshops, attendees learn how to use the terminal/command line to begin learning Node.js, an open source, a cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node is a great way to get into full-stack JavaScript development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eAt GirlsCode we believe in co-learning.
