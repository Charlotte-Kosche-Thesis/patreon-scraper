Life will rip through your flesh and carve away at you with a relentless barrage capable of changing the face of your world.  Life chiseled away at me\u2026but now I look at my crags and sharp edges as scars that tell a beautiful story\u2026I\u2019m remembering who I was before a Whirlwind touched down in my life...and I\u2019m establishing who I am in the aftermath.\u003cbr\u003eBefore I was a ghost, my name was \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hvyJU1c2nA\"\u003eEmma Kristine\u003c/a\u003e.  I\u2019m gluing my broken back together.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a ghost is to have a lifetime of knowledge but to no longer feel the pain once associated with acquiring it\u2026and then to realize you were never dead\u2026and to start living again, now with your mistakes sharpened by life-lessons into weapons and your weaknesses strengths and your quirks just different languages that can help you relate to others :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps to be a ghost is to be somewhat ninja :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been a lot of places and I\u2019ve done a lot of things!  Life has been an adventure.  From those early years in Eglon, Washington, to the stormy seas of the Bay of Biscay, to nights on an ambulance, fighting fires, or fighting in Japan and Korea... I\u2019ve gotta a lotta stories I want to tell you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow My Puzzle Pieces...should be fun...forgive me I have no editor, cause I\u0027m always writing on the run!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"180\" src=\"https://ghostspeaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cropped-1987-311-157329151-1496855967824-300x180.jpg\" width=\"300\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
