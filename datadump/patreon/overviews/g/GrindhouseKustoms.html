    "summary": "So a couple of things you might be asking, who is this guy and what does he mean by \"Repurposed\" Art...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe, I am just a simple Appalachian who enjoys making creative and unique stuff out of whatever I can find. Coming from a little town (\u003cem\u003eactually legally it\u0027s still considered a village\u003c/em\u003e) that if you blink you would miss it if you drove through, we did not have much in the way of big stores or formal Art education available. So if I wanted something cool to go with my action figures or a picture of a fave hero, I would have to DIY it. So the library became my best friend and I would read whatever How-To (\u003cem\u003ealong with a ton of Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Horror\u003c/em\u003e) I could there and if what I needed was not available, I would wing it....thus making me a Jack of many trades and giving birth to what I call my \"Repurposed\" Art....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I am adult (\u003cem\u003eI am using that term loosely\u003c/em\u003e) with a real job making an survivable wage and having the internet at my fingertips, bringing me access to all the goodies I once did not have available, I still find myself wanting. There are a lot of cool things out there one could scoop off of Amazon or eBay, but sense of satisfaction that mine or someone else\u0027s creativity or hard work went into creating it is not there. There is no cool story of how it came to be or how it was made...to me that\u0027s important. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with that said, you can see a sample or 2 below of some recent works...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii527/VampClutch/Group%20Photo%201.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii527/VampClutch/119_0945.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii527/VampClutch/IMAG0675_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii527/VampClutch/IMAG0555.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii527/VampClutch/vc_group_1a_by_commie_munkey-dahh1rt.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand for giggles here are some straight up pieces of Artwork...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii527/VampClutch/Art.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will focus on some of those items and their whats and hows in future posts...My goal here is to be able to start a new path where I can exchange ideas with others and ideally some of the creativity will help pay for itself...so with a little luck and help from you,\u00a0 I can continue take someone else\u0027s junk and turn it into \nsomething cool, show others how to do it themselves, and if the end results can bring a little joy to someone\n else, everyone wins...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time and support...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
