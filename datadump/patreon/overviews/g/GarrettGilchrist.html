Art shouldn\u0027t be designed by committee. Art should have a unique style and point of view. Art should say something about how the artist perceives the world. If I look back at the art which inspired me in high school, it was uncompromising and unique, and not aimed at a mass audience. That is a spark I would like to capture in my own work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating art and writing films since the late 90s. You might have seen my superheroine film \u003cstrong\u003eShamelessly She-Hulk\u003c/strong\u003e, my work animating lost episodes of \u003cstrong\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/strong\u003e, or my restoration of Richard Williams\u0027 unfinished animated classic \u003cstrong\u003eThe Thief and the Cobbler\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have my own stories to tell, entire worlds for you to enjoy and get lost in. In the past I\u0027ve written fourteen screenplays and one and a half novels.

As an artist in this economy, I never seem to have any money, and chasing the money I need to survive takes up all my time. I\u0027ve always been ambitious, and the big, exciting projects I\u0027m working on deserve my full attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can achieve and create much more, and push the boundaries of what is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise you that every month I\u0027ll be creating and posting exciting new art, stories and content for you to enjoy. I will also continue to restore rare film and video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re a patron, I\u0027ll be showing you the work I\u0027m creating as I\u0027m creating it. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll see it all first\u003c/strong\u003e, and see stuff that no one else gets to see. You\u0027ll be my test audience as well, and your opinions will shape the final product. So talk to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can also send you my original artwork.
