In order to keep the server up and running smoothly, we put a fair bit of currency into ensuring that our site stays up and the bots are hosted. In addition, we regularly dedicate funds to advertising, paying for game servers, as well as hosting various raffles, and pledging to several charitable causes! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile by no means is donating a requirement or a means of progression within the server, every dollar dropped in the pot will contribute towards making the server better in countless ways. You will receive a variety of coloured name roles as a thank you for your contribution (ranging from Bronze to Platinum) as well as the knowledge that you are helping to build a great community for thousands!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe greatly appreciate everyone willing to throw something our way to help us do what keeps us going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d rather donate directly, as a one time thing via Paypal, you can do so \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/gaydayz\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e."
