The characters and ideas are inspired by vivid dreams and night terrors that I sketched and recorded as a child. It is an all-ages series full of unique characters, surreal landscapes, and great adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy dreams have always had a huge impact on my artwork.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is the story about?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short answer is; the story is about a seven year old boy named Nous who discovers another world in his dreams. While there, Nous finds a clue to the whereabouts of his missing father and embarks on a quest to find him. His adventure gets a lot bigger though when he meets the mystical Elementals and learns their plight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the long answer?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eNous\u2019 father Bolen was a great aviator and inventor who\ndiscovered a way to harness an abundant natural energy source to power\nhis plane. This\ncould\u0027ve been a huge technological advancement as natural resources are\nbecoming increasingly scarce. To reveal this discovery he takes a flight for all to see at the annual air\nshow, but is quickly swept away by a dark and mysterious storm. As time passes, Bolen\u2019s discovery is seen as a\nfarce and he is presumed dead, though his family holds on to hope.\nNous begins to have night terrors as he delves deep into the dream\nworld, Reverie. A realm parallel to our own and home to mystical\nbeings who control all of nature. It\u2019s there that he finds clues to\nhis father\u2019s whereabouts.
