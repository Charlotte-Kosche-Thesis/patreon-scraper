You\u2019re preparing for next week\u2019s game and you\u2019ve hit writer\u2019s block. You need a new monster to add a unique twist to your adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve all been there, and we all know how much it sucks. If we have our way you\u2019ll never have to worry about that again.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eA quick stop to the Gorgon Breath Games \u003ca href=\"https://gorgonbreath.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite \u003c/a\u003ewill lead you to a wealth of free, OGL-compatible content including unique monsters, magic items, character options, spells, and one page dungeons. We also create premium, full length adventures for our backers (or for sale \u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10687/Gorgon-Breath-Games\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eat DriveThruRPG\u003c/a\u003e), filled with everything a Game Master might need to get from session\u2019s start to session\u2019s end. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re Jon, Marshall, and Stew, and we\u2019re gamers and writers.

When we reach $150 we\u0027ll be able to work with professional artists more regularly and write role-playing supplements that are longer and richer. When we hit $300, we\u0027ll guarantee either monthly premium releases or longer premium adventures, depending on our Patrons\u0027 preferences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do that though, we need your support. As we reach our current goals, we\u2019ll set new ones - setting our standards higher and higher. As much fun as it is to think of cool monsters and scenarios, turning them into something players and Game Masters can use takes time and money. Writing, editing, art: none of it comes for free. Eventually, we\u2019ll start getting paid for our time on Gorgon Breath, and we\u2019ll pay our artists more - which means better and better free content for everyone and premium content for our backers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, help us make this real."
