Most of my work has been published for the YA audience, including the gig-of-a-lifetime, my YA series starring Lois Lane as a teenager moving to Metropolis and getting her first reporter job (and gabbing online with her mysterious long-distance friend, SmallvilleGuy). My other books include Girl on a Wire, the Girl Over Paris graphic novel (with Ming Doyle and Kate Leth), and Girl in the Shadows from the Cirque American series. And my husband Christopher Rowe and I have a middle grade series that just launched, The Supernormal Sleuthing Service, which is about three children solving mysteries in a hotel for monsters in New York City.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.gwendabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ALEX.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWHY AM I ON PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027m launching this Patreon for two main reasons: 1) a little extra financial support and 2) community building. One of the most formative works in my thinking about the arts as a profession is Lewis Hyde\u0027s The Gift, in which he talks a great deal about the gift economy but also about making a living. I\u0027ve always believed that sharing our processes and connecting with others is valuable, and that giving extra access and stuff to friends and fans is the way to be. I also miss that closer-knit sense of community I used to get back in the days of more regular blogging when I was just a scrappy young writer desperately trying to sell my first book \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003ewriting honestly about that process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, here I am on Patreon, where I hope I can offer you some things of value in exchange for monthly patron pledges at whatever level you can afford. I plan to\u00a0share with you more behind-the-scenes, early peeks and extras about projects I\u0027m working on, writing advice, reading notes, and soon new fiction created just for you. Right now I\u0027m doing daily check-ins on progress toward the draft of a new YA. Once I finish that, I plan to do a monthly short story for patrons. Whee!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will officially be part of my secret agent army. Enter the mission HQ and let\u0027s have some fun together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be revealing the secret to life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(As soon as I figure it out.
