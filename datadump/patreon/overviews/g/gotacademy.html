We\u0027re also expanding to more stories, like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, WestWorld, Dune and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also regularly post\u00a02-3 extra monthly videos for you patrons about politics in the wide sense - history, society, news, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur work is sustained almost exclusively by our patrons with a focus giving you all the reasons to become and stay patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do We Need Your Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not a company, we\u0027re just people with cameras, lightings and mics. We are a niche channel, for people who enjoy deeper dives into popular stories or interesting political and social trends, but still make sure it\u0027s enjoyable. We put in a lot of time, work and thought into making our videos as interesting and as entertaining as we can, and without our patrons that wouldn\u0027t be possible. Since YouTube monetization policy is geared mostly to giant channels with millions of subscribers, we decided that instead of catering to the formless masses, we are doubling down on our niche content to provide an added value for our biggest fans, you patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat Do We Want To Give You Back In Return?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to give you as many reasons possible to become a patron! By being a patron you are not only supporting our work, you are also getting a kind of golden membership. All patrons are part of our exclusive community, which we interact with on a regular basis, and you\u0027ll also get 2-3 monthly extra videos, and with your help that number will keep growing\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for watching our videos!\u00a0You can find our extra content on the left hand side of this page (you might need to scroll down a bit), in the Featured Tags section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGil and the Got Academy team\u003cbr\u003e"
