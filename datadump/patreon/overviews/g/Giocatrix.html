These are also intended as partial \u2018How to Solve Cryptic Crossword\u2019 guides for novices.\u00a0Currently available is a \u003cstrong\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/strong\u003e themed sample (posted as \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Giocatrix 1 - Crow flying north east\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e). Newly posted puzzles (including a forthcoming \u003cstrong\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/strong\u003e themed grid) will be announced on my \u003cstrong\u003e@giocatrix\u003c/strong\u003e Twitter feed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u2018\u003cstrong\u003eAmatrix\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019 puzzles contain\u00a0more risqu\u00e9 and explicitly worded clues (which for some strange reason I seem to write most often when I\u2019m ovulating\u2026) and are\u00a0best suited to open minded adults! Sometimes I\u0027m simultaneously amused and appalled by the depth of my own smuttiness, so I\u0027m still figuring out what level of filth I\u0027m happy to publish! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want a free flavour of these clues there is a 5x5 sample puzzle (posted as \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Amatrix 1 - Call me\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e). Newly posted puzzles will be announced on my \u003cstrong\u003e@ardentamatrix\u003c/strong\u003e Twitter feed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNB\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not intend to cause any offence, nor do I intend to self censor to avoid the myriad list of things people may find offensive. Even if I do avoid safe words, my content is not intended to imply or condone anything other than consensual acts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section needs a serious edit - I\u2019d rather be writing clues than writing about myself - but I find seeing things in public print before they are really ready helps with the necessary mass culling of the editing process! Until then...\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit more about the writer\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePersonally, I particularly enjoy trying to solve difficult puzzles. My favourite setters include Araucaria, Azed, Beelzebub, Enigmatist and Cyclops (who is worth the Private Eye subscription alone).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eApart from my proofreader (who is dyslexic and hates cryptic crosswords!) I don\u2019t have any help running my site - it\u2019s just me - a lone literary crusader, anagramming away in the arse end of the universe, available anytime to pen personalised puzzles and patronise parties (OK, maybe not anytime and it\u2019s a definite no to the parties!).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI discovered cryptic crosswords whilst stuck in bed for almost a year with a mitochondrial-meltingly awful illness. My \u2018work\u2019 output is severely limited (my noggin\u2019s neural network is about as reliable as an everlasting cake candle in a hurricane), but I love to write clues whenever I can. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(I have noticed that Patreon has replaced my finely crafted superscript number font with \u0027sup sup\u0027 - I considered keeping it because it makes me look like a rapper  - but I will be changing that as soon as I have the energy to figure out how to!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor me crosswords and clues are a bit like paintings\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; - deciding when they are finished is a matter of mood as much as anything. So in some regards, I consider all crosswords I publish here as \u2018works in progress\u2019. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf anyone (apart from the squirrel currently looking through my window\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;) is interested in my work, I may add background info, such as alternative clues that I rejected (oh so many rejects!), to my later posts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the unlikely event that you\u2019re still reading at this point, and the more likely event that you have a problem with some of my content (it will get much smuttier later when I start to add the Amatrix crosswords\u2026) please see my post entitled \u201cThe Legal Stuff\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit for the committed crossword nerds\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile in an ideal world I would aspire to Ximean(ish) levels of structure and precision, having a cerebral power supply with the unwavering strength of a Raleigh Denim\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;3\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; dynamo-bike-light-from-the-1970\u2019s, this is a virtual impossibility. So while my work may not be perfect, I hope that my \u201cas long as I had fun writing it and the solver can get to the answer one way or another it\u2019ll ****ing do\u201d approach is still enjoyable enough for other cryptic crossword lovers out there.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn downloadable format terms, some patience may be required on your part! With all the technical aplomb of an aardvark trying to master a unicycle, I\u2019m still figuring out how to publish some of my crosswords in as many web/tech friendly formats as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd yet another bit about the writer\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ME/CFS centred account (\u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/MEMyHealthandI\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epatreon.com/MEMyHealthandI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) is currently as empty as a discarded chocolate\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;4\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; wrapper, and quite frankly, likely to remain as well serviced as a hermit living on Rockall (who the flaps wants to use their 5%-full-brain-battery-charge writing about being ill when they could be making terrible puns that no-one will ever read? Not I!). I aim to be be a prolific writer one day - either when someone finds a cure or invents a mind reading typewriter. Until then\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAddenda\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 Note to self - you do realise you\u2019ve just implied you can paint when you know damn well you can\u2019t\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;5 \u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\n2 Yes, I know I\u2019m flattering myself and it\u2019s probably just looking at it\u2019s own reflection\u003cbr\u003e\n3 You know, the low rent version of the Shopper for people with very short legs and a love of jeans patterned vehicular livery and a femininely bejewelled bouquet of pink flowers on the crossbar\u003cbr\u003e\n4 Adding the name (Montezuma\u2019s Orange and Geranium - now I\u2019m salivating!) would\u2019ve seemed like an entirely cynical attempt to get a free supply\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;6\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; in a post which will be lucky if it\u2019s read by as many people\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;7\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; as the Borrowdale Sheep Counter\u2019s Dictionary \u003cbr\u003e\n5 But that probably won\u2019t stop me occasionally posting some extremely badly drawn \u2018cartoons\u2019 \u003cbr\u003e\n6 If that works I must try the same with Julian Bakery\u2019s Turmeric Coconut Wraps - great, like so many things, with sausages\u2026  \u003cbr\u003e\n7 I\u2019ll be lucky if I get a bumfit\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;8\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\n8 I\u2019d settle\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;9\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; for a tethera-a-dick\u003cbr\u003e\n9 No pun intended\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;10\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\n10 Please stop now!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
