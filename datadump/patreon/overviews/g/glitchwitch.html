    "summary": "Patreon About\u003cbr\u003e\nHi we\u0027re glitchwitch and we appreciate you taking time out of your day to stop by. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA little bit about us: We initiated project #glitchwitch for two reasons. We have always been huge supporters of independent and creative artists, as the music industry has shifted due to the rise of music streaming we saw an opportunity to step in and shift the way new music is discovered and shared by curating a weekly playlist of talented musicians that we want to bring more attention to. Starting our project from this unconventional beginning we discovered even more unconventional ways to share these artists with you. Our roadmap ends with us being a trusted platform without the influence of major labels known for pushing unconventional artists and embracing unconventional methods in tech and digital publishing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShirking major label funding is a decision we ultimately made so we could avoid the pitfalls most music media publications face when promoting artists because of a financial promise thus neglecting artists that can\u0027t afford that luxury. Every artist shared or promoted from glitchwitch has been chosen based solely on merit. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn an effort to be more transparent on all channels regarding pledges and donations we\u0027re gonna be up front about the costs we face existing and distributing content in the way we do! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirstly there\u0027s the website, even though our cornerstone content the \"#glitchwitch\" playlist is hosted off site on streaming services we still have to pay out of pocket for hosting. Currently it\u0027s not breaking the bank but as the site grows and grows so does the cost to keep it up \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNext is our availability on all distribution channels, the #glitchwitch playlist is updated weekly on every popular streaming service. Currently that includes YouTube, Spotify, Deezer, SoundCloud, Apple Music, and Napster. Though most of these are free to publish on some of them are not. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSTAFF! We are a small team, but a team nonetheless. Making sure everyone is compensated fairly in accordance with the amount of time and effort they\u0027ve spent on #glitchwitch. Paying everyone fairly has and always will be a huge priority for us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLastly software, there are the various technical thingamabobs and whatchamacallits that glitchwitch needs to run smoothly without it becoming a tedious chore eating over 100+ hours of work a week. Combining collaboration, publishing, bookmarking, google everything we\u0027ve more than cut time spent doing repetitive tasks to a quarter of where it was when we started. We\u0027ve chosen free software over the pricier stuff when we can but in a few cases due to the newness of what we\u0027re doing that\u0027s not an option.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMonetization\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have made efforts to insure that we aren\u0027t charging for access to our content or charging artists for being featured in any of our content. We are an affiliate of several brands including Apple Music that don\u0027t have any interest in changing the way we\u0027ve committed to doing this. There are a few ads here and there on the website but nothing disruptive or clickbaity. These methods are the standard of most publishing sites today, but the issue we face is a lack of audience that we are circumventing by paying to promote our reviews on social media. When you reach a certain user or consumer base number the site essentially pays for itself, this is the point of sustainability.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUntil we reach that point we appreciate any and all pledges you can make. If you believe in this new way of sharing and promoting music Any amount would be greatly appreciated. We\u0027ve set the base pledge at a dollar because getting a headcount of people supporting this is more important to us than profit. Pledging the base amount gives you acces to playlist archives, merch before it goes public and other goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can\u0027t for various reasons pledge anything we fully understand and ask only that you share our playlist and content if we can gather by your presence here that you enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
