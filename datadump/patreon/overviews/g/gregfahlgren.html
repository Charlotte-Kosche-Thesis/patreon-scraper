My name, as you may have guessed it, is Greg\nFahlgren, and I am, a writer, artist, and all\naround creative person who\u0027s nerd . What I am creating?\nWell, currently I\u2019m writing a 7 book fantasy series entitled THE WAR OF THE\nSEVEN. Secondly, I am learning how\nto illustrate using online courses and tutorials so I can begin creating my own art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, the next question you might ask is what are my\ngoals? Short term, I of course want to get the first book of WAR OF THE SEVEN\npublished and bring the story I have worked on for the last ten years of my life to the world. For my art, I want to continue honing my skills, but I will\nneed to resupply every now and again as well as get more materials as my skills\nimprove. Long term, I want to publish WAR OF THE SEVEN in full, write more\nbooks in that world, continue with my artwork, and possibly enter the comic\nbook industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe final question is of course, why you should\nsupport this page? For one, you will have my eternal gratitude and receive a\nnice, warm, fuzzy feeling inside for helping another human being achieve his\ndreams. If that isn\u2019t enough for you, then I am happy to tell you about the\ncontent you will see on this page. Over the past ten years, I have compiled\nnumerous notes, maps, drawings, and histories concerning the world of WAR OF THE SEVEN.\nThese things are necessary when writing any story and for a fantasy\nnovel, they become one of the most important parts of the work. However, a lot of\nthat World Building doesn\u2019t really make to the pages of any book. Therefore, I\nwill be sharing such material on this page on a continual basis to give\neveryone just a taste of this spanning, massive world that I have created. You\nmight have already noticed numerous uploads already on here, and that is just a\ntaste of what I have in store. Piece by piece, I will be revealing the world of\nWAR OF THE SEVEN. You will get a close up view into my work, my process, and the unique\nand imaginative world that I have spent ten years creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I will be releasing the first book of WAR OF THE SEVEN, THE COMING OF THE SEVEN, scene by scene right here, on this page. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, a new scene will be released. Chapter I, which is already available in its entirety, is FREE for everyone. Beyond that, every scene of COMING OF THE SEVEN will be available for just a $1 a month subscription. I also have a huge deal of World Building content, available for $2 a month, which will give you a special inside look at the world of Palinos, a world that I have been developing for 11 years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, there you have it. If you sign up for this page\ntoday, you will get exclusive access to numerous maps and blogs relating to my\nwork. More and more content will be released as often as I can, revealing more\nof this incredible world that I am so thrilled to finally be able to share.\nThank you all in advance, and let\u2019s make my dream of bringing WAR OF THE SEVEN to the world become a reality.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
