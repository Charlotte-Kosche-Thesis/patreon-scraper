My name is Gayle Skidmore and I am originally from San Diego, CA, though I have been a bit of a vagabond for the last ten years. \u00a0I have toured all over the US and a bit of Europe, and am back and forth between SoCal and Amsterdam these days. \u00a0In the spring of 2017 I will be releasing my 20th independent project/first full-length vinyl album. \u00a0You can hear the first single on my bandcamp page, \u003ca href=\"http://gayleskidmore.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://gayleskidmore.bandcamp.com/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started playing classical piano when I was four years old, and I now play, or at least dabble in, over 20 instruments. \u00a0Having grown up writing songs, I have now written over 2,000 songs, though I\u0027ve kind of lost track. \u00a0One of the main reasons I started this Patreon page is that I have only released around 50 of those songs, and a LOT of my music has gone unheard. \u00a0As an independent artist, I\u0027m free to record and release whatever I would like, so I decided that for those of you who want to hear my B and C sides, and/or hear songs as I write them, I would LOVE to share them with you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with writing, I\u00a0do all of my own artwork, and have been focusing more on honing that craft in the last few years. \u00a0I am working on my 3rd colouring book which will accompany my 20th independent release, but I have also been enjoying creating other pieces. \u00a0I hadn\u0027t really found an outlet until I discovered Patreon, and I love the accountability of creating something new each month. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be using your support to create a new demo, video, and piece of artwork once a month to get my unheard songs/unseen art out into your ears and eyes! \u00a0Thank you for stopping by! I hope you\u0027ll consider being a part of this exclusive group/inner circle. \u00a0This is a great way for us to stay connected as I\u0027m traveling the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eGayle Skidmore"

     "about": "Seven-time San Diego Music Award nominee Gayle Skidmore has written over 2000 songs since she began songwriting at the age of 8. A born songwriter, her natural ability and innate passion for music made her music career unavoidable. Gayle Skidmore won Best Pop in the 2015 San Diego Music awards and best folk song for \"Rag Doll\" in the 2015 Akademia Music Awards.  Her latest album and coloring book, \u201cSleeping Bear,\u201d won Best Pop Album in the 2014 San Diego Music Awards. She won Best Singer-Songwriter in the 2013 San Diego Music Awards, and her song \"Paper Box\" was featured on HBO\u0027s new show \"Looking.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClassically trained on the piano from the age of 4, Gayle Skidmore also plays at least 20 other instruments, including the mountain dulcimer, banjo, folk harp and balalaika. Her attention to detail and involvement in every step of the creative process, from producing her records to creating the artwork for her albums, show that she is completely dedicated to her craft. In August 2013, Gayle released her second full-length album and coloring book, \"Sleeping Bear,\" on Raincoat Records. Mastered by Grammy winner Gavin Lurssen, this album was written entirely by Gayle Skidmore and features a 10 piece string section.  This album followed her first 7\u201d vinyl release, \u201cZombie Heart,\u201d put out by her sponsor, Ninkasi Brewing Co.  In 2014 her cover of \u201cLola\u201d by The Kinks, a collaboration with Brandon O\u2019Connell of Singing Serpent, was placed on a national commercial. She has co-written ads for Facebook, Target and many others.  She was featured on Time Warner Cable\u2019s SoCal Beat and was named one of the San Diego Union Tribune\u2019s Faces to Watch in 2014. Gayle Skidmore just finished tracking her 20th  independent release at Ninkasi Brewing\u0027s studio in Eugene, OR in Fall 2015 with James Book of The Flys, and legendary studio Rancho de la Luna. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGayle Skidmore\u2019s love of whimsy, poetry and magic are evidenced by the sets she creates for her stages, which have included a curtain of origami cranes and a giant octopus holding a teacup.   She has opened for the likes of Jason Mraz, Lisa Loeb, Sean and Sara Watkins of Nickel Creek, Sam Phillips, Grant-Lee Phillips, Coeur d\u2019Pirate, and many others.  She has recorded with such artists as The Softlightes, Bushwalla, Jason Mraz and Tyrone Wells, and branched out into several genres including electronic swing, indie rock, and classical music.  Germany\u2019s most prominent newspaper, the Seuddeutsche Zeitung, named her \u201cDie Schutzpatronin der Gartenzwerge,\u201d the Patron Saint of Garden Dwarves, in an interview promoting her tour of Europe.  She has also toured nationwide in the US, UK, Asia and Europe, and was a Sunset Sessions artist in 2012. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eGayle Skidmore finds endless inspiration in the whirlwind of life. She has never experienced writer\u2019s block, and she is always experimenting with new formats. When she isn\u2019t busy learning a new instrument, singing, painting, or writing lyrics and melodies, she composes parts for her cellist and violinist. She enjoys baking cookies and making origami for her fans.\u003cbr\u003e",
