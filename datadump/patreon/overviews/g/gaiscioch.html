    "summary": "First and foremost I want to thank you personally for even thinking of supporting the Gaiscioch Community. Whatever you decide I am honored that you considered supporting this great community that is dedicated to providing fun and entertainment to gamers worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGaiscioch began as a small band of like minded players who saw others being outcast because of their real life commitments. We couldn\u0027t stand by and watch as our friends and family were exiled because they didn\u0027t spend enough time in a video game. From that moment we began with our singular focus of creating a community of like minded people who possess Honor, Respect, Integrity and Fellowship. We placed memories and smiles above loot and accolades. From this humble beginning in 2001 we have grown to become one of the largest and most successful gaming communities in the MMORPG space.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor more than 15 years, the entire weight of the financial burden laid in my hands. As we grew and took on more activities, the costs of running Gaiscioch increased. Today, Gaiscioch has expanded to produce its own digital magazine focused on the gaming industry from a player\u0027s perspective. In addition it features a full lineup of Livestreams each week spanning MMORPG\u0027s, Indie Games, and the latest and greatest stories found on the PlayStation 4. In game players can enjoy one of our major public community events including the Telara Saga in Rift, the Great Tyrian Adventure in Guild Wars 2, and the Annual Extra Life Charity Event Livestream each fall. These events feature giveaways many of which have been donated or gathered by members of our Public Community Event team.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs can be expected the costs of keeping Gaiscioch alive, well and growing have expanded as we have. It has become painfully obvious, that it is time to put aside my pride and accept help from the community in keeping my passion moving forward. There are some rather expensive tasks in the future as we begin to take on new challenges and with your help we can overcome them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith this I thank you for taking the time to consider supporting us and I am humbled that you shared your day with us. Thank you so much.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBenjamin \"Foghladha\" Foley\u003cbr\u003e\nFounder \u0026amp; Activities Director\u003cbr\u003e\nGaiscioch Social Gaming Community\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.gaiscioch.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.gaiscioch.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eGaiscioch Projects\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaiscioch Community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Gaiscioch community was founded November 11th 2001 in the MMORPG Dark Age of Camelot.
