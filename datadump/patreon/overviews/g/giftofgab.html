    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who may not know who I am, let me give you a brief introduction. I am an MC, a lyricist, a rapper and an artist. I am one-half of the duo \u003cstrong\u003eBlackalicious\u003c/strong\u003e, one-third of the super-group \u003cstrong\u003eThe Mighty Underdogs\u003c/strong\u003e and one-fifth of the world renowned \u003cstrong\u003eQuannum Projects\u003c/strong\u003e Collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a solo artist and I go by the name of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Gift of Gab\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58112feef5e231510efbe91f/58741b74d482e9145181164f/58741bebbebafbc1a49bba6f/1484004620838/gab_06.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the past 2 decades honing my craft through releasing albums, mixtapes, EPs and relentless touring. With 9 full-length albums, 3 EPs, mixtapes and countless guest appearances I have arrived at this moment in time with my new EP, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cRejoice! Rappers Are Rapping Again!!\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 a FREE EP that I have released in anticipation for my currently-untitled fourth solo record which I plan to release next year.\u003cbr\u003eWith this record I have joined forces with \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e to do something that has never been done before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut first things first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5 years ago I underwent surgery for kidney failure. Since then I have been going through dialysis treatments three times per week and am on a wait list for a new kidney. This was something that completely changed my life and made me realize how important every moment we have on this Earth really is.\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, it has been difficult for me to tour as much as I used to and I\u2019ve had to make some adjustments. Being an Independent Artist, touring is one of the major factors in how we make a living and we don\u2019t rely on record sales as much as we rely on ticket sales.\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this I have had to re-think how I earn as an artist. As much as I love touring, it\u2019s just not possible for me to be on the road for months at a time as I once did and so I\u2019ve realized that what\u2019s important is to connect directly with \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 my fans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58112feef5e231510efbe91f/58741b74d482e9145181164f/58741cd4db29d642e281457f/1484004620932/DSC_9105.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve teamed up with Patreon to offer something new and different that is going to be as fun and exciting for me as I hope it is for you.\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon I\u2019m able to offer a monthly subscription service that allows me to connect directly with my fans while at the same time offering up new and exclusive content that will only be available to those who subscribe.\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things I\u2019m doing is giving fans a chance to literally be a part of my new record. Through Patreon you can choose different levels of subscription which offer you the chance to not only get your name in the credits, but actually get your face on the album cover!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd just so you know, this album is going to be limited edition and made available only to subscribers.\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who contributes at a certain level will receive their choice of an autographed vinyl or CD copy of the record along with their name and/or face on it!\u003cbr\u003eWith this monthly subscription service I\u2019m also going to be releasing new material that you\u2019ll only hear through Patreon. This includes new songs, demos, freestyles, remixes and more! In addition I will be releasing one new track from the upcoming album every couple of months. As subscribers you will be the first to hear the new songs all the way up until the album is released in 2018.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also going to be hosting exclusive live video performances and offering subscribers special items such as t-shirts, autographed CDs, phone calls, video chats, behind-the-scenes videos from the studio and on the road as well as a bunch of surprises along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly believe this is an opportunity to make history by revolutionizing the way Independent Artists make their livelihood. No labels \u2013 no middlemen \u2013 just the artist and the fans (and of course Patreon)!\u003cbr\u003eAlso, 10% of all proceeds will be donated directly to the \u003cstrong\u003eNational Kidney Foundation\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank all of my fans who have supported me and my music over the years and continue to do so. Without all of you I couldn\u2019t make any of this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you\u2019ll join me on this journey so that we can explore the possibilities together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace,\u003cbr\u003eThe Gift of Gab\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58112feef5e231510efbe91f/58741b74d482e9145181164f/58741cdd5016e1e3a0045f0a/1484004591387/DSC_9086.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e"
