    "summary": "Hello\u003cstrong\u003e, I am Matthew Chapman,\u003c/strong\u003e and I stumbled upon Patreon very recently after seeing some of the work of other artists who work the artistic fetish market, and who have appeared to have found success through this site. As for myself, I am a Gothic Revivalist, in spirit and ethics, and it is now my lifelong goal to transfigure the world around me to reflect that aesthetic value without necessarily slipping far back into a literal past, to terrible Victorian times where good people prostituted their selves in the streets and were lucky if their next client wasn\u0027t Jack the Ripper. No, it\u0027s much safer to do it online, and in the form of art -- and that is what I am here to provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it I\u0027ve been creating? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome come to me to create fetish art - primarily humans inflating into gigantic fruit. Think, Violet Beaurgarde from Willy Wonka \u0026amp; the Chocolate Factory, but now a whole unleashed tribe of walking, bloating, inflated fruit people on verge of exploding because they dared to test the rules of unsafe consumption. There will be a lot of that here, and who knows how large the concept may expand to? Soon, people will want to become giant blueberries and apples, cherries and pineapples for their weddings, graduations, house-warmings and baby showers. (Someone blue up the baby?) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther work of mine you will find here are ongoing concepts and completed works related to my fascinations with the board game, Clue, and mystery themes from that era (Which era? Generally, 1910 - 40. Early 20th Century) I am working on a mystery book capturing the essence of the game in the form of a prequel that details the history of the game\u0027s victim - Dr. Black. Or is it Mr. Boddy? The victim is different across the pond, but in my story, both are present, and both will eventually be murdered. My eventual goal with this concept is to create a working doll-house that recreates my version of the mansion in its full detailed glory, with the Clue characters and weapons, as a game and showpiece. This will be one of the projects I will be seeking funding for, from you good patrons who wish to join me on this venture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is one alongside my other creations in the works. I also make highly detailed cross-sections of intricate spaces made digitally, 3D models, music played on piano as had been requested; these being among what I am offering for you to experience. The past stuff of which I\u0027ve explored and revisited includes the sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic, including my involvement with an intrepid new computer game in the works, \u003cem\u003eTitanic: Honor and Glory\u003c/em\u003e, which is expected to offer a near-perfect representation of the ship, and its sinking, with a murder mystery plot woven into the story. As well, I expanded on my own telling of the disaster in 2012 for my first solo exhibition, where I created over 80 works translating the story to paintings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to what I look towards next, is to connect my frequent visits to Mexico into art making, combining it with the Gothic theme and narration that my style encompasses. I\u0027ve been to some amazing spots in the past two years I\u0027ve traveled there, including dry forests, homes with inner courtyards and alleys, like mazes. I\u0027ve been to the very colorful city of Guanajuato, and the Huichol populated mountains adjacent to the mining city of Real del Catorce that offer much sanctuary in the country. There\u0027s much I\u0027ve seen there, and wish to incorporate in the work I make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy be my patron and join me? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy giving to me, and acknowledging that you want see more of my work, you will help me refine my abilities, and offer better, more complex works to present to you. I will reward you by allowing you to experience the strange Gothic worlds I want to craft. Most of it comes straight from my imagination and\u00a0 I very much want you to being a part of it. My creations are sometimes spooky, but that can be a very good thing. With so much of the world that can be isolating, and lonely, how good it is to make the effort to transfigure those feelings into how you\u0027d wish to see things, and be surrounded by? That\u0027s what I am aiming to create and for you to partake of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
