    "summary": "Geisha are traditional entertainers of\nJapanese arts and music specializing in dance, singing, and a\nvariety of instruments including hand drum, shoulder drum, shamisen or\nJapanese flute. They train throughout their lives, are very highly\nskilled, and some of the older geisha are even \u201cliving national treasures\u201d,\nthe highest status of artist in Japan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo debut as geisha, girls must learn\nspecific skills, rituals and customs through a rigorous one-year\ntraining under the supervision of older geisha. In the old days, young\ntrainees came into geisha houses as early as four years old, and were fully\nfinancially supported by the geisha house. They were under contract to\nwork for the house until repayment of the debts incurred in the\npurchase of their kimono, accessories and lesson fees. They would\noccasionally have a sponsor or \u201cdanna\u201d that could also help cover their\ndebuting expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever times have changed: these days\ngirls start their training much later, and are obviously free to leave any\ntime they want. Therefore few geisha houses are able to cover training\nexpenses when there is no absolute guarantee that trainees will\ncontinue as adult geisha and repay their debts. Nowadays, there are no longer\nmany affluent individuals sponsoring the arts, and the biggest challenge to raising young aspiring geisha is finding a way to finance their\ntraining in the crucial first year before they are able to work properly\nat banquets and earn their own way. The biggest challenge to geisha houses is how\nto finance the training of young geisha during this crucial time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe sum we are trying to raise to help the\nFukagawa Geisha revive their district is divided into several stages covering\naccommodation and living expenses, and then lesson-related expenses, and kimono\nand accessory expenses, for each geisha. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy supporting this project, you can become\na \u201cdanna\u201d or sponsor of a trainee geisha and follow her progress\nduring the first and crucial year of her training. You will thus be making an\nincredibly generous and valuable contribution to preserving this\nbeautiful tradition. We are very excited about the possibility\nof the traditional \"danna\" role being shared collectively by many people\naround the world who deeply care about geisha culture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eNote\u003c/strong\u003e: The geisha house itself does not get\nany profit whatsoever from listing the trainees on Patreon. Currently the\ngeisha house IS the main sponsor of the trainees, and the geisha mother\npersonally puts enormous amounts of money into training expenses. The geisha\nhouse will continue to fund any shortfall in the monthly amount we are\ntrying to raise here, and will continue to be the largest sponsor of the\ntrainee geisha in the meantime, and probably for a long time to come.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eNote\u003c/strong\u003e: Fukagawa Geisha is a project to help\nthe Fukagawa geisha revive their district and help support the training of\nyoung geisha.The trainees work together with senior geisha from Fukagawa District at banquets.\u003cbr\u003e"
