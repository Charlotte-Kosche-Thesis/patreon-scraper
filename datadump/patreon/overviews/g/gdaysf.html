    "summary": "First and foremost, I just want to start by thanking you for being a G\u0027day SF subscriber, that alone is more than enough, and I appreciate it :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, so here\u0027s the deal with who I am and why I started this Patreon account:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an Aussie who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. I started the weekly G\u0027day SF newsletter because it seemed to be something that would be useful for the Australian community in San Francisco.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time I launched it, there was only a secret Facebook group for Aussies that was obviously impossible for newbies to discover on their own. There was a meetup for the top end of town and not too much else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAustralia has a tremendous quality of life and we\u0027re number 2 on the Human Development Index. I believe with every fibre of my being though, that Australia is suffering a slow and silent slide s we\u0027ve become complacent. We consumer technology but rarely do we create technology that the rest of the world uses. And the future belongs to those who create the technology the world uses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor us to remain competitive, have an amazing quality of life and transition away from pulling rocks out of the ground (not very sustainable and not good for the climate) we need to foster the next generations to learn both the technology itself and the skills to start globally scalable companies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis. Must. Happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor our kids to enjoy long days at the beach, the cricket, and the wonderful lifestyles our parents enjoyed there are several smaller, shifts that need to occur. One of those is Australians going to global creative centres, learning what they can and bringing it back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLondon and New York for finance, Los Angeles and New York for fashion, entertainment and publishing, and, of course, Asia, San Francisco and Silicon Valley for technology and entrepreneurship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been the lucky country but I\u0027d rather we were masters of our fate and captains of our soul. We\u0027ve done well to get this far but right now is an adapt or die moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also need to attract top overseas talent to Australia, have a strong university system\u00a0that doesn\u0027t\u00a0just conduct world-class research but is savvy and supportive about commercializing it, we need to incentivize the creation of a genuine venture capital ecosystem and drive awareness and interest in entrepreneurship and technology in our young people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t pretend I can solve all of that or that it\u0027s an the full list of things that need to happen. Even so, I know we need to foster the Aussies coming here and make it easier for those who follow. That\u0027s the small piece of the puzzle that I can help play a role in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe San Francisco Bay Area is a wonderful place: they love Aussies and we have an amazing work visa just for us, the E-3. Right now, around 4,000 of those visas go unused each year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need the Aussies to keep coming over. The ideal is many\u00a0Aussies come over, learn from the best in the world, and then take their skills and, hopefully, the money they\u0027ve made from big successes, back to Australia with them to help build the ecosystem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why my newsletter exists. I like to think of it as a pre-built distribution system that has a multiplier effect on every other initiative designed to help Aussies in the Bay. I launched the newsletter in July 2017 and since then I\u0027ve since sent 61 editions without missing a single week. Despite earthquakes, travel, illness and just plain being busy at an early stage startup I\u0027ve kept it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027ve funneled subscribers to the Australians in San Francisco Facebook group so it\u0027s grown from 400 to 1,900 members in that time, by far the most popular Facebook group of it\u0027s kind in the Bay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Sydney Ducks and Aussie Tech Meetups have also started since I launched the newsletter and I\u0027ve been able to promote them heavily. Also, the AFL events, like their Grand Final watch party have tripled in attendance and sold out a week early. It\u0027s working, a community is forming, but still, there are 4,000 E3s going unused so we have a long way to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of this writing I have 1,938 subscribers. Running the newsletter takes time. I spend at least 3 hours a week on it and my friends haven\u0027t seen me on a Monday night since it began.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support, here\u0027s where your money will go:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting\u003c/strong\u003e. Without it, the website doesn\u0027t exist. It\u0027s not a lot, but it adds up.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing web development and maintenance. \u003c/strong\u003eThis includes SSL certificate registration, domain registration, using UpWorkers to fix things when they break.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMailchimp\u003c/strong\u003e. Once we cross 2,000 subscribers we have to start paying.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFreelancers for content\u003c/strong\u003e. Using UpWorkers on the cheap to create content. I made these infographics\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gdaysf.com/e3-visa\"\u003eto help explain the E3 visa to US employers\u003c/a\u003e so that prospective employees have a better likelihood of getting employed. I also use an UpWorker to refresh parts of the newsletter, like events and jobs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe.\u003c/strong\u003e I need to continue to eat things and wear things and turn lights on as I write emails and create content. I\u0027m a guy with no kids in an SF share accommodation in the Sunset though, so needs are minimal.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo how much do I need? Not much, really. I worked out that just to cover basic costs is $174 per month. That doesn\u0027t cover my time or freelancers to create new content, that\u0027s just to keep the lights on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I\u0027m able to sell an ad at the top of the newsletter but I\u0027d rather make it ad free (or rather, just put the Patreon ad there). To properly get freelancers to make the infographics in a time effective way would mean $1,000 each. I did the last two for $100 each but it took me about 40-50 hours, mostly over the two weeks of summer vacation (cheaper = more time managing folks in India).\u003ca href=\"https://gdaysf.com/e3-visa\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ideal ask is $5 a month. Then I\u0027d need 35 people out of 1,938 to participate, which would rock. Each dollar above that helps me create resources that make it easier for people to come here and get up and running. What I could create with more money:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore content and infographics on things like getting an SSN, how taxes work, getting a driver\u0027s license, how to find accommodation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo profiles on Aussies who made it over to the Bay and what their life is like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRe-design the website to make it easier to list jobs that are E-3 friendly and jobs by Aussies founded companies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHold some events and meetups to increase the subscriber base and help new folks meet people in the Bay (although Sydney Ducks are doing some good things here).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can give, then that would be awesome. Either way, please subscribe and enjoy :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Chris"
