    "summary": "I\u2019m just a girl from a small town in New Jersey with big dreams of living out my life doing what I love.... Most of what I\u2019ve learned about music was from my mother who was a music engineer in the late 80s. Since I was young music has been my escape from my reality of not being able to communicate comfortably with people without terrible anxiety. I play bass, drums, guitar, and piano. I write, sing, and produce. And right now I have been working on a music project which I will be releasing in the summer. Seven songs showing all my talents and what I can do with universal sound. I bartend in the city, but recently to some positive events I have been busy modeling on the side as well as being attentive to getting my music project out. \u00a0With that being said I\u2019ve been so busy lately with my music project that it\u2019s getting more and more difficult to work at night. Since I now always start my days either in the studio, practicing my craft, or working on my songs. This project will be an inside look of my life, my talents, and a song biography of how I found myself through my art. So if you wanna come with me on this journey, to see, hear, and feel what I do when I connect myself beyond the galaxy and into the conciseness of sound, then be my guest."

     "description": "Musicians are always looking for more and more ways to satisfy their tastes for the craft of creating and manipulating sound. I have a mixtape I have been working on which will be released in August, in which I have written, arranged, and played the instruments on as well as singing. The process of this is fun but also very time consuming, but it\u2019s my gift to others who enjoy music as much as I do. The more work I get done on this project the more about the songs I will put out. Take a look at what stimulates my passion for music, a look inside my studio sessions, photo shoots, some basic music theory knowledge, history, pictures,and everything outside the box of music itself. Make sure to check out for posts every Thursday \ud83d\ude07. For whoever would like to join me on my on my musical journey I thank you \ud83d\udc9c.",
