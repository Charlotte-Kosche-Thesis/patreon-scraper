We do as much as we can in the time we have around our work schedules but we really don\u2019t feel like we can really improve, and expand our abilities chugging along on weekends and a few hours after work. It doesn\u0027t leave a lot of time for alternative fund raising either. With patrons backing us we would greatly reduce or eliminate the major financial issues and stress and free up valuable time to work on the projects that we have been trying to get off the ground.
