    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eJenn and Dakota are a real life married couple, but more importantly they happen to be best friends who share a love for \u003cdel\u003eall\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0most things geeky. Whether that be a new film coming out, a television series they\u0027re enamored with, or the game they\u0027re currently preoccupied by, whose to say? Well, they are, because they regularly discuss their thoughts on everything they\u0027re captivated by on their YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCBwciIqOoHwIx_uXtYTSEbA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Geekritique Show\u003c/a\u003e...\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eWe\u0027ll stop talking in the third person now. Makes it sound like we paid someone to say nice things about us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of our channel\u0027s output includes \u003cstrong\u003egeek news discussions, reaction videos, and informative pop culture videos\u003c/strong\u003e for you to freely devour and enjoy, but we also like to take you on 360\u00b0 VR adventures. Over the past year that we\u0027ve begun our channel, we\u0027ve had a lot of fun, and every new subscriber is honestly just as surprising to us as our very first. Thank you all for enjoying our content. We have no plans of slowing down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in, dear Patrons. We doubt we\u0027ll ever be in a position where we can live off the money we see slowly trickling in from YouTube, and the little we do see isn\u0027t the reason we\u0027re putting these videos out there in the first place. It\u0027s for you guys. You\u0027re the ones consuming it, and we feel that\u0027s so much more important to us than a few bucks. That\u0027s not to say we don\u0027t put the bucks to good use, however. In fact, every dollar is a chance for us to devote less of our time working meaningless, monotonous jobs so that we can get back to doing what we really love - which is entertaining our audience and informing them about what\u0027s going on in the ever changing world of geek culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel obliged to give us anything!\u003c/strong\u003e Your likes, comments, views, and subs are more than we could ever have truly wished for. But if you feel you want to contribute to our creative process, this is an outlet for you to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATRON BENEFITS:\u003cbr\u003e-Early access to all patrons on \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e videos.\u003c/strong\u003e Some videos, such as trailer reactions, are more time-sensitive, but on occasion we do release things here early for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Shoutouts to our new patrons.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-By becoming a patron you also have a chance every single video to get an on-screen shoutout!\u003c/strong\u003e Here\u0027s how it works: picture a hat in which you can reach in and randomly select a name from. By pledging a single dollar per month, you have a chance of seeing your name or handle pulled out of that hat! With a 5 dollar pledge you double your chances of getting your shoutout, and with a 10 dollar pledge you triple those odds. Of course, with a donation of 20 or more, you\u0027ll essentially have four tickets with your name on it in that proverbial hat. These will be randomly generated each video, so keep checking back as long as you\u0027re supporting us! Heck, there\u0027s a chance you could pledge only the one dollar and hypothetically get picked every video. Stranger things have happened!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so, so very much,\u003cbr\u003eJenn and Dakota\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
