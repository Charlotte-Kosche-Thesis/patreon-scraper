    "summary": "Hello! I am an indie artist/game developer focused on creating new and interesting otome games that break the visual novel mold. Visual novels are great! But aside from a few titles with added themes and mechanics, the genre seems a bit stale to me, and so I\u0027m here to try and inject new possibilities into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron of any dollar amount will get you regularly scheduled news and expanded Work in Progress Wednesday content. Increasing the pledge will net you more goodies, like monthly sketch files. It can also give you beta or early access to my first game demo, \"Come on Inn: First Stay\", which is a brief visual novel style demo of a management/simulator game. The demo will have a couple of concepts, both obvious and subtle, that will be present in the full game, but the primary function is to complete a project as proof of my drive and productivity. In it, you play as an innkeeper who needs to make a good impression on three new guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for this Patreon page is to assist me in earning funds to use towards expanded and more complex games. I can make art, and I\u0027m learning Ren\u0027py and C++, but I\u0027m only one person. An expanded, full version of \"Come on Inn\" will require more art assets and programming know-how, and I would love to be able to hire help. I also can\u0027t compose music to save my life. This Patreon is here to earn funds from interested people while also building a relationship with them. Both the demo and full version of \"Come on Inn\" will be free to play, so donating to my Patreon and buying related merchandise will help me out a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t pledge anything right now? That\u0027s ok! Following me also shows support, especially if you give me a few likes or retweets/reblogs here and there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow Starlight Forge Productions here:\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: @starforgeprod\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: @starlightforgeproductions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy personal social media is here:\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: @glitchikinns\u003cbr\u003eInstagram: @glitchikinnsart\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: @glitchikinnsblog\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestions, comments?
