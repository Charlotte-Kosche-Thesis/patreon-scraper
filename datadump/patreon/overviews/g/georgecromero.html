Effects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of a life spent pursuing the enlightenment of my inner creative and alter ego, I\u0027ve heard and faced it all.\u00a0 I\u0027ve sat in conference rooms while being told to let the \"business people\" handle the business so I could focus solely on the creative.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been on sets where those same \"business people\" tried to control via committee.\u00a0 I\u0027ve faced rumors and assumptions based solely on my lineage and been told time and time again by people both close and not-so-close to me that I just didn\u0027t understand the business of the business.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe development of my inner creative has been a journey, to say the least; and one that I would not trade a single step in exchange for any rapid advancement or other promises.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of a lifetime of being told that I \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ecouldn\u0027t\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0do things about which I\u0027ve dreamt, I dedicated a large portion of my journey to the betterment of my own inner businessman in lock-step with the pursuit of my inner creative\u0027s enlightenment.\u00a0 I\u0027ve spent time traveling this beautiful country on the backs of vehicles ranging from freight trains to airplanes and everything in between; worked every shitty job a human can work and breathed the rarified air of a man who founded and successfully ran Western Pennsylvania\u0027s first and only commercial and film production studio in history, developing creative campaigns for Fortune 500 companies, producing and directing more than 125 commercials for global markets, writing business and marketing plans for companies ranging from tech startups to independent studios and even the odd bio-tech company with a lot of success and I\u0027ve produced and/or directed almost 25 films to date with many more in the works.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Rant\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQuite simply put, I\u0027ve amassed a lifetime of knowledge about the entertainment industry, the steps necessary to produce an idea from a simple thought to a piece of intellectual property with tremendous value to potential investors, the friends and colleagues in the industry to achieve every aspect of production from script-to-screen and have worked with every camera and editing system to have been introduced since I edited my first feature at the age of 18 on an old Steenbeck (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steenbeck).\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steenbeck).\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent years learning the craft of screenwriting only to have met my mentor, Warren Lewis, who told me to stop overthinking it and focus on writing well because I would eventually write fast.\u00a0 Since then and after years of calling him my mentor and friend, I can now turn out a screenplay in less than a month.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent some amazing time with my personal hero of cinematography, Mr. Shane Hurlbut A.S.C. and every time I\u0027ve been lucky enough to get even 15 minutes of his time, I\u0027ve amassed volumes of knowledge that has taken my lifetime of camera operation and cinematography to a whole new level.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had the privilege of working with some of the most amazing actors working in the industry today and, as a result, have learned to work with talent in ways that can\u0027t be taught in any film school, in my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s It All Been About?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEasy.\u00a0 Knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Knowledge...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e...if you can\u0027t pass it along.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI Create So That I Can Breathe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWithout the ability to create... to get it out of my head... to get it out of my heart... the volume is just too damn loud.\u00a0 This page is about what I create for these purposes.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI Mentor So That I Can Live With Myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWithout the ability to pass along what I\u0027ve learned about how this business works, how to create \u003cem\u003efor the business\u003c/em\u003e, how to work within the changing parameters of the business, how to prepare and pitch my content and ultimately how to produce, direct and deliver what I promise to myself and to my investors, amassing knowledge has little to no point.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is also about my willingness to pass this knowledge along.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrganization to the Madness\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI receive anywhere from 15-35 script, story and synopsis pitches per week.\u00a0 I receive as many, if not more, messages across social media asking for help and guidance.\u00a0 Up until recently, I\u0027ve dedicated a lot of time to trying to answer and help as many people as I can and I\u0027ve received a lot of thank you letters.\u00a0 Sadly, without forsaking my own projects, love, family and business 100% and dedicating my time solely to helping people because I have a passion for helping those who truly show a passion for this world, there are some folks and requests that have either slipped through the cracks or that I have simply not been able to address.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a large reason I\u0027ve decided to channel all of those requests through a Patreon effort.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is that I really do wish I could help everyone who asks.\u00a0 The harder truth is that I can\u0027t... at least not while still having to earn a living to keep the lights on and milk in the refrigerator.\u00a0 That\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided to centralize those efforts along with my own private blog and private access to projects I\u0027m either currently working on or working to develop.\u00a0 There is a bigger picture for my life goals and my hope is that by centralizing my efforts through Patreon that I can not only help as many people as I can handle at once or one-on-one, but also that I can earn enough money on a regular basis to pursue the larger picture.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you have read this far and if you haven\u0027t, I hope you at least watched my video all the way through and if you have done one, either or both of these things, I hope you understand the true sincerity with which I\u0027m pursuing this and take the time to scroll through the different subscription rewards I\u0027m offering and get on board.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT TERMS FOR PATRONS\u003cbr\u003eNon-Disclosure Agreement For All Documents Shared with Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s important for me to put this here as I truly hope all who choose to become patrons of mine will see the value in the tiers for which they are paying good money to enjoy.\u00a0 Therefore, I\u0027d like it to be known that all patrons will fall under a mutually agreed upon and understood \u003cstrong\u003eNon-Disclosure Agreement\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0with me upon pledging their commitment to a tier.\u00a0 I will be sharing a lot of information with you all through this endeavor and I am sure that you would not necessarily want to provide a lot of that information to folks who are unwilling to make the same commitment you all are, have and continue to make as part of this quest.\u00a0 In the event that any information is disseminated to non-patrons of this guided quest, I will reserve the right to terminate\u00a0 your ongoing commitment and make available your slot to another who will see the value in what we are all trying to accomplish with this Patreon endeavor.\u00a0 Additionally, in the event that highly sensitive information is to be sent privately to any member of any tier of this endeavor, I reserve the right to present you, individually, with a much more detailed and \u003cstrong\u003emutual \u003c/strong\u003enon-disclosure agreement.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
