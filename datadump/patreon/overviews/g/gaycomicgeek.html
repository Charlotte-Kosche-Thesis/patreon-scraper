    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a geek my whole life. It\u0027s been a tough ride. When I came out and told everyone I was gay, well that just made things worse. Gay Geeks are ignored a lot in the gay culture. With the exception of Micheal from Queer as Folk, most media has ignored us through the years. In my videos, I talk about aspects of the gay culture that most people are afraid to talk about. Whether it be mainstream or gay comic books (have you seen Class Comics lately), action figures (Masters of the Universe Classic figures are still as ultra gay as ever) or hell, even porn, nothing is off limits.\u003cbr\u003eI was recently fired from my job of 10 years because I made videos and I had a website that catered to my interests. It wasn\u0027t fair.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than go back into a field that doesn\u0027t want me, I want to do what I love most. And that\u0027s to make videos and talk about anything and everything in my world of geeks and anything gay related.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf each of my audience can just give like $1.00 a month, I won\u0027t go homeless. You could be a part of those that help keep me doing what I do best. I make close to one video a day. It can be on anything geeky related, or anything that comes to my mind. Even if you can\u0027t pledge any money, you can help by spreading my videos. Spreading the word of what I am and what I\u0027m doing could help. I depend on all of you. I\u0027ve been doing these videos for years for all of you because I care what you all have to say. If you pledge $1.00 a month, that\u0027s like $0.03 a video over the whole month. If you become a Cosmic Enforcer, you would need to elect to give me your address or send it to me. This is so that I can send you a letter. Otherwise I cannot send anything to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife is great. It can be hard on certain days, but other days, it can be pretty damn awesome."

The straight geeks seem to get all the attention. So I\u0027m here to help our voices be heard. I make a lot of YouTube videos on comic books, toy reviews, gay related stuff and sometimes I do talk about my life as a cosplaying comic book superhero. Costuming is way of life and I\u0027m embraced completely! It can be tough being a geek. But it\u0027s also one of the best things on the planet that I would never trade for anything in the world!",
