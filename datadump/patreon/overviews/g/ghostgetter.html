My work is hard and long hours are important along with the right research to make things right. The way radio should be. Passion is my specialty and humor makes it that much better. Corporate radio insists on telling the world the way things should be done and what they think you should hear. There is no passion. Just a job and a money maker. Impaling your ears with endless ads and edited music and talk to make you wanna go back to your mp3 player. Them days are over. I appreciate everything you put into it with me and the support you give. I thank you for believing in me and my work.

I have a radio show and running an online station as well. I have our of wack humor which comes out in my characters and do pretty much what I want with out corporate radio control. I have a love for music but radio today takes that away with advertising and forcing you to hear what they want you to hear. I do radio the way it was ment to be. With passion.
