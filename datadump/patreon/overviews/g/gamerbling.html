Many of these are made by start-up companies with big dreams and small marketing budgets, and Gamer Bling hopes to help them become big successes.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe also blogs on what it\u0027s like to be an insider in the game industry as well as whatever randomness catches his interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince he hates lots of ads, Gamer Bling is keeping his site ad-free. Even though folks have offered to pay to advertise on his site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, with this choice Gamer Bling faces a dilemma. On the one hand, he loves doing this blog. On the other hand, Expansions #1 and #2 are approaching their college years, and the Gamer Bling Official Companion would prefer Yours Truly to spend his free time doing boring layout work that earns actual spendable money (not fake stuff like the aforementioned Campaign Coins). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus Gamer Bling hopes that he can \u003cdel\u003ecommit a double homicide\u003c/del\u003e kill two imaginary birds with one virtual stone and earn extra tuition moneys by writing this blog! Your generous donations will upgrade the website (Gamer Bling is a mere hack with HTML), as well as rework his logo and create a couple of award badges for really cool excessories that deserve the extra recognition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, your generous support will fund necessary hardware and software allowing Gamer Bling to move into podcasts and/or videos, if his Basket of Adorables so demands. The remainder of the income makes the Gamer Bling Official Companion happy so he can continue being a review curmudgeon. And gain weight, because the Gamer Bling Official Companion is a great cook. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering becoming a patron of the \u003cdel\u003earts\u003c/del\u003e \u003cdel\u003ehacks\u003c/del\u003e bling.\u003cbr\u003e"
