    "summary": "Hey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to check out my Patreon! First off, if you\u0027re here then chances are you watch my videos, and I just want to say I\u0027m extremely appreciative of that alone, but if you do feel like it\u0027d be worthwhile to contribute to the channel further, then you\u0027ve come to the right place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Billy Geiger, and what is a \"Geigerdome\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince a young age I have been very interested in all forms of media, from music to radio shows to podcasts to video games. The dream is to be able to consistently entertain large numbers of people; I consider myself a creative person, and much of the art I crank out is genre fiction with a social, political, or philosophical racing stripe painted over it for extra fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write, I make music, I record podcasts, and much more. I\u0027m all over the place, and frankly, I am in no mood to stop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my friends--the cool cats who make the Geigerdome more than a one-man show--I plan, direct, and when necessary act in multiple different series, to share an artistic perspective on a number of topics, using a versatile range of methods. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you\u0027ll be directly supporting the creation of all future multimedia offerings and ensuring that we can continue to create content of the highest possible quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho else is a member of the Geigerdome?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Geigerdome is \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003ea solo project, and receives regular contributions from a wide range of multi-talented individuals (my friends) to ensure that the audience isn\u0027t always staring at me and me alone--although, since isolation is itself often a central theme of a lot of my works, it is not uncommon to see me spend an entire video \"alone\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will the Money I give you be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands, the priorities go like this: bills, dome members, art, food. By becoming a patron, you ensure that I will be able to give the content I create more of my time, and this in turn means everyone who likes my work receives more offerings at a higher quality, possibly even with greater frequency. Everyone wins!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have any other forms of income?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFull disclosure, while I know I\u0027m not quite there just yet, the goal of this page is to \u003cem\u003eeventually \u003c/em\u003ebecome the only source of income--but for the time being, it is not. I spend the lion\u0027s share of the time not spent working on my channel to finding any bearable form of work\u00a0available in the small, old-money town of under 6,000 I call home. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil that happens, my only current sources of income are through Patreon and whatever I get from odd jobs I do for friends and family at dirt cheap rates. I will probably (as in definitely) make a video updating everyone who follows my channel if my employment status changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos will you put out each month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, there are \"videos\" and there are \"offerings\"; more on the difference between the two in the section after this one. I\u0027ll be aiming to produce two pieces of content worthy of the \"offering\" title each month. I want to aim for two offerings due to the average length of such videos, currently clocking in anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes per video, meaning you\u0027ll be getting around 20-60 minutes worth of content every month. That isn\u0027t a guarantee of two a month, nor does it mean that you\u0027ll get \u003cem\u003eonly \u003c/em\u003etwo videos in a given month. Additionally, if a video doesn\u0027t meet my criteria for being an \"offering\", I don\u0027t charge my patrons, period. Vlogs, minor videos, channel updates, and the like will never be treated as patron-sponsored uploads, and I will never charge for these kinds of videos--I never really liked the idea of paying someone just to tell you what the weather\u0027s like where they live, so I couldn\u0027t do that to all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportant Notice to Patrons, or \"what makes something an offering?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \ndonation type \u003cstrong\u003eis set\u00a0\u003cem\u003eby offering\u003c/em\u003e and\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eby month\u003c/strong\u003e, which means that if you sign up to give me 1 dollar per offering, and I release 3 videos that could meet the \"offering\" criteria, you\u0027ll be donating\n 3 dollars that month. If you\u0027d like to limit the total amount of money you contribute \neach month, you can do so when first setting up your payment; the amount can also be adjusted fairly easily after the fact if you feel that you accidentally gave me too much, as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may \noccasionally put out shorter videos, and again:\u003cstrong\u003e you will not be charged\u003c/strong\u003e for these; you will only be charged for my longer, higher-quality stuff. The shorter form stuff is for fun. If I work on a given project for a total amount of time longer than 12 hours, it is considered an offering (regardless of video length) and I charge for it. As mentioned above, vlogs are not offerings. Updates are not offerings either. So even if one of those otherwise meets the criteria to be an offering, it is not an offering and you \u003cem\u003ewill not be charged\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll conclude this about section by thanking you once again for your interest in The Geigerdome\u0027s work. Obviously we\u0027d all love if you decided you like the stuff enough to help us build a budget, but even if you aren\u0027t quite enough of a Dome fanatic to fuel the final products, we are more than glad to have everyone who appreciates our work as fans--after all, no viewers, no audience, and without an audience to interpret it, art loses its meaning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money helps keep the lights on, and helps us make investments which aim to facilitate and improve the overall quality of production. This is vital to the success of our operation, and we hope you will join us for the long road ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a more personal level, what I really love is the appreciation I receive from the people who enjoy my stuff. Whether there are 2 or 2 billion of you, the love and support I receive in DMs and comment sections is what makes everything I do seem worth it. You guys are awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the channel. :D \u003cbr\u003e"
