I\u2019ve been covering video games for almost 3 years: creating articles, reviews, lists, podcasts, let\u2019s plays, and various videos. I\u0027ve written for several websites (such as\u00a0\nGame Mob and\u00a0Bit Cultures) and have done blogging of my own. Currently, my writing can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nerdmuch.com/author/jangarc/\"\u003eNerd Much\u003c/a\u003e and I just launched my own video series on Nerd Much\u0027s website/YouTube channel . \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve also co-created and maintained a YouTube channel called\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/bitbybit\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Bit By Bit\u003c/a\u003e. For a year and half we created podcasts, game reviews, vlogs, favorites videos, and unboxings resulting in over 85 videos. That project came to an end but my passion for YouTube has remained. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd so, I have my own channel!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT MY CHANNEL\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-NOFGOsVn78\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eGameonysus is a channel that reflects what I\u0027m most passionate about when it comes to gaming.

For me, Gameonysus means \u201cgod of gaming,\u201d which reflects my overall goal. This isn\u2019t to say I want to be the greatest gamer in the universe; rather, I want my gaming experiences and the content I create to \n\u003cem\u003ebe \u003c/em\u003ea universe: expansive, beautiful, curiosity driven, and awe inspiring.
