    "summary": "Howdy! My name is Michael\nManaghan, I am a college student in Montana, trying his best to make videos.\nNot a whole lot of people know \u201cWhy\u201d I started YouTube, and I wanted to share\nthat with you guys. A sort of origin story if you like, The Tale of good guy\nMike!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEver since I was a kid I\nhave been obsessed with making people laugh. Whether it was telling jokes,\ndoing silly drawings, or making videos, my day was always made better by making\nother peoples days better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy freshman year\nof College, I went to a very expensive private school, because they offered me\na track scholarship. When I got there, I immediately didn\u2019t fit in. While\nalmost everyone there had lots of money, I was a poor kid, and no one wanted to\nhang out with the poor kid.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI tried to keep my head up,\nbut I had no friends, I was away from my family, gaining lots of debt, and I\nfelt so alone. I fell into depression and a lot of things started to slip. That\nwas when I discovered YouTube. Watching YouTube gave me a little bit of joy\neveryday which was just enough to keep my head above water.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the end of the\nYear, I transferred to a new college, joined a new track team, and rekindled\nold friendships and started to hit my stride. Feeling happy again, that was\nwhen I decided to give back to the support system that had helped me through so\nmuch. So I became Good Guy Mike and started my channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be the\nfirst one to tell you, my old videos were ROUGH! I love my channel and would\nnever change it for the world, but seriously, I don\u2019t know why people watched me\nback then. But I kept going and getting better and better, growing and growing,\nand the channel is still growing and getting better all the time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, being a college student, I don\u0027t have enough free time to both work and do YouTube. I hope to someday do YouTube as a job, not so that i can never grow up, but so I can help people the way YouTube helped me! That is why if I am going to keep putting out videos I am going to need financial support from you, the Good Guys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hate to ask, you guys know that, but you don\u0027t have to give a huge amount, every little bit adds up! Please consider donating, it would help me out more than you will ever know!"
