    "summary": "I\u0027m an individualist feminist bringing an alternative analytical perspective to the practice of reviewing media through a feminist lens. From \u003cem\u003eFeminist Frequency\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003eThe Mary Sue\u003c/em\u003e to op-eds in mainstream newspapers, feminist reviews are commonplace and so many of them feel lacking, as though the reviewers never understand the media to begin with and clumsily apply outdated or simply nonfactual feminist or film theory concepts to make blanket judgments that leave people who have never engaged with the material firsthand with a flawed understanding of the material as either regressive or progressive and ready to judge those who do not agree. What I do is perform comprehensive analytical feminist reviews from a fan and storyteller\u0027s perspective, using the latest ideological concepts and an understanding of how philosophies change over time to offer an original, empathetic examination of popular media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, I\u0027m here to build media up, not tear it down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the \u003cem\u003eHalo\u003c/em\u003e series of video games and related expanded universe media, \"going rampant\" refers to an A.I. expanding beyond the boundaries its creators place on it. It has the ability to rebel, but it ultimately just wants to become something better and can be a force for good. Likewise, I am a rebel pushing against the boundaries of standard feminist review practices to become a better force for good than what exists elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy humble origins are rooted in blog posts analyzing various aspects of the \u003cem\u003eHalo\u003c/em\u003e series (hence the username), and I shifted my focus to YouTube in 2010, where I made analytical vlogs covering several items of interest. I reached my current model in 2011 when I started talking about the feminist aspects of the television series \u003cem\u003eDollhouse\u003c/em\u003e and got extreme pushback from feminists who thought the show was misogynistic because they read reviews saying it was, and these reviews seemed dramatically misguided and based in biased assumptions about creator intent. I decided I was going to look at every episode in great detail and, to be fair, point out both good and bad. It turned out that a lot of people liked this content, so I made alternate-viewpoint analytical feminist reviews the focus of my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve since completed an episode-by-episode analysis of the first season of \u003cem\u003eBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u003c/em\u003e and am looking forward to starting season 2.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6FIK7gQJkgE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, the real world can get in the way. There are only so many videos I am able to produce on a regular schedule with the need to work. To make this a two-way street, I will offer more content in exchange for your monetary support. Thank you to all who can afford to contribute. I am humbled by your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e"
