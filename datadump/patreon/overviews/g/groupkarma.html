I have been privileged to work with many\ngreat writers, producers and musicians including Ned Ginsburg, Lesley Gore,  Garius Hill, Bobby McFerrin and Chieli\nMinucci.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter a long hiatus with a lot of life\ncircumstances \u201cgetting in the way,\u201d I am finally making music again with some\nof my original Group Karma ensemble members, and planning to write and record\nagain. I am approaching performing and interpreting jazz and the lyrical song\nfrom an entirely new perspective. My time \u201cwoodshedding\u201d my voice and\nperformance chops finds me emerging as a wholly different kind of butterfly. It\nis exciting, and I admit, a little scary to look at the music world anew. The\ntrial balloon performances I have put out there have been so incredibly well received, though, that I know I am on the right track!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYour help is SO CRITICAL and SO APPRECIATED in\nhelping me get back on my musical feet and build momentum. Expenses include paying\nband members, rehearsal studios, travel to and from gigs, out of pocket\nexpenses, marketing and recordings. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe short term goal is to do a home studio\nrecording within the next six weeks to put online for club and venue owners.\nThe longer term goal is to do a record-quality professional recording, with\narrangers, producers and guest side people which would get underway by or\nbefore the end of 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMore goals to follow as we hit the first\nmarks!\u003cbr\u003e"
