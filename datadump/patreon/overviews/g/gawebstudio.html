    "summary": "Hi all\u00a0!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout me :\u003c/h3\u003e\nGaweb Studio is actually a 33 years old married french guy trying to create fun H games and trying to live out of it to feed his small family. I\u0027ve been on Patreon for more than 2 years now and I\u0027ve achieved quite a lot thanks to this community. I still have a lot more planned and hope you\u0027ll enjoy my creations.\u00a0I usually lurk on H game forums under the nickname Daedolon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGames I\u0027m working on :\u003c/h3\u003e\n(Click on the image for an introduction to the game features)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/glassix-8673582\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/glassix-8673582\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l7yK48F.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGames I\u0027ve completed thanks to my patrons support :\u003c/h3\u003e\n(Click on the image for an introduction to the game features)\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/vampire-revenge-8673439\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/vampire-revenge-8673439\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/vampire-revenge-8673439\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rgx4M3V.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy support me :\u003c/h3\u003e\nAn important thing to note is that my games usually focus more on fun features rather than a carefully crafted story. This gave birth to Glassix in which you follow a simple story but with a lot of liberty of actions and many events. My next game, Lust Complex, also focus on apartment management (Introduction to come soon). I prefer to let you know now because for some of you, a perfect story is the most interesting part of a H-game meaning you might want to look elsewhere. But if you\u0027re looking for actual things to do in games and not just clicking CTRL (or Space) the whole way then just pick a different choice to get a different ending, like many visual novels do, then you\u0027re at the right place !\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother important side to note here is that unlike many other Patreon creators here, I have a stable life. I love my family, we currently live in China, have a small 1 year old boy, have a small apartment and are all happy together. No health problem. No money problem (even though some more would be helpful since we\u0027d like to expand our small family ahah :p). I\u0027m saying all this, as well as my age, to let you know that my situation is stable and I\u0027ve enough maturity to understand that a Patreon campaign is not just a way to grab easy money. It\u0027s actually a professional business and creators have to fulfill their end of the deal. By pledging to me, you\u0027ll be supporting me and my family and you can be sure that I\u0027ll deliver my end of the bargain : I\u0027ll complete all the games I started and won\u0027t cancel my campaign half way like it unluckily happened for some other creators.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout my campaign :\u003c/h3\u003e\nMy campaign is set on monthly payment so I don\u0027t have to worry about how I\u0027ll pay my rent and food. It does not mean I\u0027m slacking off. You can expect a monthly release for at least 1 game and sometimes more. The upfront payment is enabled on my campaign, which means you\u0027ll have to pay directly when you pledge and you\u0027ll have access directly to all the content without delay. If you pledge at the end of the month, you might want to cancel your pledge once processed to avoid being charged again when the new month begins.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain, all of this is possible thanks to my patrons so I won\u0027t say it enough :\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks you all for your patience and support !\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
