But you might already know that. What you probably don\u0027t know is that the entire comic is going to be 13 chapters long with an explosive ending (we can\u0027t wait) AND we are wanting to get at least 4 one-shot side comics featuring characters\u0027 backstory released as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever writing, drawing and managing a project like this takes a lot of time, sweat, blood and sanity.

Patreon works kinda like an on-going kickstarter or funding website. Here you can pledge an amount of your choosing per month and get super cool rewards, all while supporting us and GREY! Think of it as a tip, or a ticket to cool benefits! GREY will always remain free, but pledging to us on Patreon helps support us and pay for things like website fees and printing. With your help we can devote more time to GREY and get a bunch of our plans off the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCool, but what rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you get our undying love, seriously, but also cool rewards. The lowest levels give you weekly early updates of the comic and access to our livestreams. At higher levels you can get access to exclusive artwork by Alex, exclusive writing and notes from Danae, personalized art and at higher levels see yourself in the comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven at a $1 a month you will get access to milestone rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this all adding up to?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to make an amazing comic for you, complete with side comics and (possibly maybe) a sequel once its all done. We also want to give back to you guys and create an awesome community around this comic about evil people. With your support we can make GREY everything we want it to be and more, while rewarding our readers cause they are the best"
