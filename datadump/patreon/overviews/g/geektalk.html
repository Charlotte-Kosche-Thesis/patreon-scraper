I do a monthly podcast with some awesome people. One of the goals is to be able to do live shows at conventions. Toy reviews is one of the main backbones of what Geek Talk is, but it\u0027s growing into gaming and streaming. With the love of gaming a growing pastime, sharing game reviews and Let\u0027s Plays is a way to reach out to new people and new friends. With your help, I\u0027ll be upgrading my hardware to support better gaming experience, better editing equipment and better recording soft and hardware. I want to make the viewing\u00a0experience so much more enjoyable for all."
