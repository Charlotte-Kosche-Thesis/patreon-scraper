    "summary": "Hello! My name\u0027s Garrett. Welcome to my Patreon page! Since you\u0027re here, it\u0027s likely that you already know that I develop games, and you\u0027re probably considering supporting me. In that case, awesome! If you don\u0027t, then you may click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gmrgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e to view my website.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://orig07.deviantart.net/2f3d/f/2015/250/c/f/why_by_gmr516-d98sf4y.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the price of a small bag of M\u0026amp;M\u0027s ($0.99), you can help me create awesome games for everyone to enjoy, including you! These games could be\u00a0fan games, such as\u00a0spin\u00a0offs\u00a0of\u00a0Undertale and other great games, or they could be completely new ideas! They don\u0027t even have to be games. Sometimes I make cool new programs for everyone to enjoy.\u00a0 Patrons will be able to give input into what exactly I should create, and influence new games and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig06.deviantart.net/ba18/f/2015/250/5/7/get_by_gmr516-d98sf5v.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you donate enough, you\u0027ll be able to put special secrets into them, create your own cheat codes, exclusive high definition wallpapers, references in-game to you (such as\u00a0graffiti\u00a0on walls, hidden names, secret invisible buttons with messages) and more, such as helping design parts of the game or designing your own level/character! The possibilities for these rewards are virtually endless. Once I have more Patrons, I will discuss with them what rewards should entail.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig08.deviantart.net/e9e6/f/2015/250/7/7/paid__by_gmr516-d98setc.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, every month, Patreon will charge you however much you decided to donate. So say you decide to give me one dollar ($1). Every month, one dollar will leave your bank account. This money will go completely towards making excellent games, programs and the accessories needed to make said games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig05.deviantart.net/741a/f/2015/250/6/9/soundgood_by_gmr516-d98seml.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnything helps, no matter how small. I\u00a0appreciate\u00a0every and all donations. If this really just isn\u0027t your thing, no worries. Thanks for taking the time to visit my page anyway. Check out the games I\u0027ve already made! And again, If you\u0027d like to visit my website, to see examples of my work and projects,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.gmrgames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e[just click on this shiny orange link]\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA huge thank you to everyone who supports me!\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e"
