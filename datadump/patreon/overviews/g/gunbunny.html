    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWhat is it?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGunbunny is a platform style RPG, in the MetroidVania genre, which focuses on the storyline and character development of starship engineer Aurora Juno, and follows her difficult journey into heroism. While she is the focus of the story, you will also have the opportunity to play in the storyline of both her allies and her enemies.\u003cbr\u003eOur story begins as she abandons her military career in favor of more peaceful pursuits working on an interstellar cruise ship; however, she will soon find that neither is a viable solution to her problems, as she is pursued by Rebro, a vengeful robotic space pirate who seeks to capture her power for his own purposes.\u003cbr\u003eMarooned on a dangerous planet with many different environments, she must gather the scattered survivors of her wrecked ship and attempt a call for rescue, as she is hunted by Rebro and his minions. She will battle pirates, level bosses, nature, and herself, as she struggles to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith her for the journey is her AI assistant and power management utility, CAM. His job, besides acting as a voice for her conscience, is to manage her power flow and manifest it into tools, weapons, and shields which she will use to solve puzzles and fight battles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of gameplay features power management. Much like magic points in an RPG, you can only hold so much and they regenerate very slowly. Therefore you will decide how to allocate your energy flow, into any combination of Attack, Defense, and Regeneration stats. Different parts of the game require different settings, and allow different players to adapt Aurora\u2019s abilities to reflect their play style for aggression, stamina, or problem-solving. In addition, tools and weapons can be charged up using energy, to temporarily extend their range or increase their effectiveness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBattles won, puzzles solved, and ground covered is rewarded in experience points, which can be spent at workshops to upgrade tools, weapons, and stats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHow about the Sex Appeal?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThis may come as a surprise to those familiar with my work, but this project is *NOT* going to be pure sex. It is just a natural part of how the story has evolved since I began writing it. In fact, it is safe to say that at this point it will pretty much be \"Rated R\" throughout. It has everything from love scenes to bitter fights to death to all-out epic character conflicts and battles. And what it doesn\u0027t need, to make it good, is porn. Don\u0027t worry though, it will have sex, plenty of fan service, and the characters will not be cardboard cutouts; they all have their own mature agendas, vices, and skeletons in their closets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not looking to build a massive over-the-top Hollywood blockbuster. The art and design will be simple and clean, but the storytelling and functionality will be where it stands out from other games. I have already spent a LONG time perfecting the controls so that it works smoothly and is fun to navigate the worlds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what you see, please help the project out and pledge. Every little bit helps! I don\u0027t keep anything I earn here; it all goes to freelancers who are helping me out.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat is the production schedule?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThis is a spare-time project for me, so it\u0027s a few hours here, a weekend there. I have been working on it for 2 years now just by myself, with occasional help from freelancers. Now, thankfully, I have found a great code assistant, Julien, who has helped me out a lot and will continue to do so. I\u0027ve learned a lot from him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can browse through the videos and see tangible results. There is no slacking here, it\u0027s a lot of hard work. A lot harder than I thought it would be first starting out, and a tremendous learning curve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point, I really can\u0027t say when it will be 100% ready. The reason for this Patreon, is to provide development support funds to pay helpers to do things that I do not have the time or skills to do myself. So far I have used it for art, music, code, game assets, etc. Patreon has been a tremendous help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe final goal for this Patreon project is to make a game demo-- a tutorial map and a full playable level with stages of RPG \"town\" noncombat interaction and storytelling, action combat, and puzzle platform gameplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, the code and content is 100% ready for building the tutorial map to 100% completion, and probably 65% towards full demo content needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch1\u003eMeet the Team\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tBhDm3x.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YEyHuxD.png\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/tBhDm3x.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
