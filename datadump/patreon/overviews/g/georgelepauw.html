    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m George Lepauw. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon to fulfill my deep-seated desire to be a classical musician for the 21st century. While the art form is not new, there are so many new ways to share this music and tradition that need to be used to expand its audience. What is most exciting to me is working with other artists and creative people, and leveraging old and new technologies in order to bring a multidisciplinary approach to a tradition which has been isolating itself from contemporary trends for decades. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to join and support me here to follow all the twists and turns of my creative journey, which requires time and resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its launch in 2016, the support I have received via this Patreon page has already helped me record Bach\u2019s massive Well-Tempered Clavier, which I hope to release in mid-autumn 2018 (there is still some mixing and mastering to complete). I cannot thank all of my supporters enough for their help and participation in my creative endeavors such as this one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I am trying to create creative momentum, and the Bach Album is just a start. As it is nearly completed and will be released sometime in the next months, I am already beginning the early process of preparing the next recordings and films, of Beethoven\u2019s Sonatas, and of some original compositions I am beginning to work on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support makes these projects possible, which is why I hope you will consider joining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, patronage in the 21st century has become more powerful and democratic than ever, allowing anyone, even with a very small contribution, to make an impact, and that is an important development for the freedom of the artist, and the participation of more people in creative projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, this type of project does not fit into a traditional mold, and a typical record label would not be able to support this and allow me the freedom to create something out of the ordinary.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird, these are projects which will take some time to come to fruition. Without support, I could not dedicate myself to this long-term recording and film works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to bring you with me in an unparalleled journey through music, art, and the creative process. You will be able to learn about my process as a musician, and see how I think about, and feel, this music, with all the stories it evokes and inspires, as I prepare for, and then make, this series of albums. You will have behind the scenes insights into the art but also the business of being a classical musician in the 21st century, seeing how I launch this kind of project and bring it to the public, with all its promise, and perils.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your critical financial help, these projects will be much more than just another box set on a shelf, but rather a lively and novel way to showcase great music, providing uncommon insight into the minds and hearts of these composers and the artists involved on this journey, myself included. It is also important to me that Patreon helps me grow my community of friends and fans, of which I truly hope you will be a part. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTHANK YOU!!!\u003c/em\u003e"

Named \u201cChicagoan of the Year (2012) for Classical Music\u201d (Chicago Tribune), George represents the ideal 21st century musician, intensely focused on his art and wholly engaged with the world. In 2009 he and colleagues gave the World Premiere performance of a newly-discovered long-lost piano trio of Beethoven\u2019s to great acclaim, followed by a highly-praised first recording. In addition to his performance career (as soloist and chamber musician), George is the Founder and President of the International Beethoven Project (IBP), a non-profit organization focused on innovation in the arts with which he has organized multi-disciplinary festivals, educational programs, and annual \u201cBeethoven Birthday Bashes\u201d since 2008. Between 2016 and 2018, George was also Executive Director of the Chicago International Movies \u0026amp; Music Festival (CIMMfest). George, who grew up in Paris, began piano studies at the age of three with A\u00efda Barenboim (mother of Daniel Barenboim), and furthered his studies with Brigitte Engerer, Vladimir Krainev, Rena Shereshevskaya, Ursula Oppens, and Earl Wild, among others. He has degrees from Georgetown University (BA in Literature/History), and from Northwestern University (MM in Piano Performance). George is a frequent speaker and guest teacher at universities as well as on radio and television. He recently recorded Bach\u2019s Well-Tempered Clavier, and hosts a podcast, Through The Stage Door.
