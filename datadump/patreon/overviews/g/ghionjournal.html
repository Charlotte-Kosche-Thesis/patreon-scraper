    "summary": "Ghion Journal, and affiliated Ghion Cast, is an audacious dream being\n turned into reality. After my plunge into the abyss, injustice is no \nlonger a theory; I see now that injustice is a pernicious germ that \ninfects humanity without regard to the labels we append to one another. \nAs a student of Mass Communications with an MBA in Marketing from Johns \nHopkins, I know full well the awesome power that the media has to affect\n change. Sadly, the inverse is also true, when Mass Media is owned by a \nfew who have a vested interest in fracturing humanity, the few can then \nunleash media as a weapon of mass confusion and use the airwaves to \nincite hatred between brothers and sisters and fellow victims in the \nstruggle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is precisely what is taking place, the moneyed few have deployed vacuous personalities to fracture the citizenry into islands of grievance and resentment. Politicians, pundits, and stars\u2014duplicitous demagogues through and through\u2014have been weaponized to fracture us and keep us in a state of perpetual stasis and hostility. The sensationalism, outrage, and rancor all have a purpose; as long as we are distracted by emotions, it prevents us from realizing the source of injustice and the root of our collective anger. What I am alluding to is not about politics, this is about logic, the endless labels and isms we identify with are nothing more than means of nullifying the power that \u201cwe the people\u201d have inherent within all of us. And it is this self-nullification that the powerful count on in order to perpetuate their power at the cost of our God given right to pursue freedom and happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGhion Journal is a community based publication, the writers are of the people because we are with the people. The writers, from the founder to guest contributors, do not pontificate behind ivory towers. We cast our lot with the masses across America and throughout the world. In order to maintain editorial independence from the elites, who dictate media coverage through corporate contributions, we have decided to forgo advertisement revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will not take a red cent from corporations, this will enable the current writers and those to come in the future to speak truth to power without fear financial repercussions. We actually take it one step further, based on Teodrose Fikre\u2019s experience with Foco Cafe (\u003ca href=\"https://ghionjournal.com/foco-cafe-a-business-case-for-kindness/\"\u003eread Business Case for Kindness\u003c/a\u003e), we have decided to power the entire Ghion Journal venture through the kindness and support of our readers and audience. In order to keep up with overhead, compensate the writers, procure resources that will enable us to do more documentaries and focus on people who are making a difference and expand the reach out Ghion Journal, we are asking you to support and contribute the best way you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I\u2019m asking you, the readers, to empower Ghion Journal and take a \njourney along with \u201cus\u201d. I say us because where I am a one at this \nmoment who is in charge of the writing, the pod cast, the research, and \nwebsite administration, in due time my hope is to add others to the team\n who share my aspirations of connecting the citizenry and focusing on \nour common humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContribute as you are able and help \nempower us and give birth to the aspirations and mission I outlined \nherein. Be our second, enough of giving endless streams of money to \npoliticians and duplicitous movements whose job is to splinter us, \nempower Ghion Journal to speak against those who speak against our \ncommon humanity. #Be2nd"

     "about": "I made a decision when I launched Ghion Journal that I would forgo ad sponsor money and instead depend on the support of the readers. To be honest, it does not take much these days in terms of capital to start a media company. We all have technology at our hands that empowers us to be media in our own right. This is not to say that starting a media company is easy; in order to draw and maintain the interest of an audience in the age of instant gratification and pervasive information, original content has to be produced and published on a daily basis. One has to have a love of labor to become an independent journalist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I do feel a bit frustrated at times, though this temporary feeling of angst is quickly put into perspective given my journey over the past two years (\u003ca href=\"https://ghionjournal.com/my-love-and-legacy/\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e), it\u2019s because independent writers and journalists like me are often overlooked not because of the quality of work but because we lack the cache that comes with working or writing for one of the mainstream media outlets. There is a disconnect that I try to understand; how can so many be so upset with the state of mainstream media yet they keep going to the source of their scorn in order to read and share the pure drivel that outlets like CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News keeps pushing as news?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been told many a time that I should write for the Huffington Post or the New York Times. There was a time in the past where I actually pursued this path. But I realized that working and writing for someone else comes with a string attached and that this string is actually a handcuff. Moreover, I\u2019ve come to realize that when a news source accepts a penny from corporate sponsors, it ceases to be a news source and instead becomes an infomercial portal. This is why I refuse to accept a red cent from companies or chase sponsors; the minute I accept the paychecks from others is when others have influence over what I write and can dictate my quest to speak truth to power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019m putting all my chips on the people. If one is true to a purpose and purposes to do good works, the rewards will come. The reward I\u2019m seeking is not money for I\u2019ve chased plenty of that before and never found happiness. What I hope to accomplish is to make a dent in the lies which are pervasive and being continually peddled by the status quo and their paid shills in the mainstream media. It is my hope to bring on more writers in the coming months and to pay them using a profit sharing model. Beyond that, my aim is to establish Ghion Journal as a news source that can act as a counterweight to the corporate mouthpieces that are proliferating in the broken \u201cfourth estate\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis audacious dream is only possible with you, the reader. Political consultants always tell politicians \u201cdon\u2019t forget the ask\u201d when they conclude a speech with what they want people to do. I know this because I actually laid out a path to run for Congress in 2014 with a former Obama field director. That was before I realized how bankrupt our politics is and gained enough wisdom to avoid DC like the Ebola virus that it is. But I will conclude this with the ask after all. I ask you to continue sharing what you read on Ghion Journal and to get your network of friends and relatives to check out the Ghion Journal. If you are able, contribute to Ghion Journal through the \u201cdonate\u201d button above. And lastly, use this site to interact with other readers using the comment section below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis audacious venture would not have been possible if it was not for the \u201csecond\u201d who believed in me. By second, I mean someone who came along and believed in my potential and pushed me to start the Ghion Journal. But in this life, the \u201csecond person\u201d is infinite; endless numbers of people can push us forward in this journey called life. It is my hope that you become the \u201csecond\u201d to the Ghion Journal and the writers who are a part of the Ghion collective. In the process, I hope you get other \u201cseconds\u201d to join.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis after all is how change happens, an idea is started by one, inspired by the second, and soon enough a movement starts where it was non-existent before the \u201csecond\u201d. See the picture above, the lighter that is sparking waiting to catch fire? \u201cSeconds\u201d are the ones who will get it lit. The same way the elites have been bleeding the world using media as their most potent weapon to enslave people is the same way media can be used to spread a message of love and unity to reverse injustice. This is the audacity of Ghion. \u003cem\u003e#GhionAudacity \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
