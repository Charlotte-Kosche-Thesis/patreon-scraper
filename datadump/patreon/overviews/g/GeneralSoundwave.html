    "summary": "Hey all. I appreciate you folks taking the time to stop by and see what I\u0027m about and what I\u0027m up to.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Vincenzo Donatelli, descendant of Renaissance artist, Donato di Niccol\u00f2 di Betto Bardi, whom you may know as\u00a0Donatello. I have been working in the video game industry for almost 10 years now and during that time, I have worked on a Transformers 3 PC game, Dragon Ball GT Transformations for Gameboy Advance, Starship Troopers iOS, as well as 25 other games. One of these games, \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OtakuBrawlers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOtaku Brawlers: A Hero Within\u003c/a\u003e,\" is currently in production. I am looking to redeem the bloodline of my family and continue to cut stone, as he did, yet in digital form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a digital painting that I did about 4 years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig12.deviantart.net/1068/f/2015/063/a/5/rachel_by_generalsoundwave-d8kekx2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 10 years ago I had started a company called Archangel Guardian Studios, DBA. and it failed. I also co-started Indestructible Cannon, LLC. with my business partner, however, that also failed. Company number 3 was called Pro-Cards Printing service, which is kinda around. In this business I act as a broker for printing high-volume business cards and flyers. I do between 3 to 5 clients a year, but for the most part, business is stagnant. I am on companies number 4 and 5 right now with Digital Stonecutters, DBA. and YHWH Games and both businesses are slow with those as well. I am completely aware that 9 of 10 businesses fail, so I decided to create 10 businesses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig04.deviantart.net/a2de/f/2011/215/2/8/tf3_dom__vis__op_n_starscream_by_generalsoundwave-d444cc8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whats my hang up? It comes down to a few things. First off, its like this; I can make the best cheeseburger in the world, but if no one knows where I create this delicious master-piece, how can I sell them? McDonald\u0027s clearly doesn\u0027t have the best and far from it. But EVERYONE knows who they are. This is exactly my issue. No matter how hard I work on my portfolio, art companies and people who actually have budgets just don\u0027t know I exist. I also have a difficult time trusting programmers. I am blessed to have found two very good ones. But right now, I am just simply lacking funds to get products out. Sales is just not my bag and I know I\u0027m taking a huge risk even with Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig10.deviantart.net/70a8/f/2011/131/c/4/bruce_lee_vs__chuck_norris_by_generalsoundwave-d3g3nh0.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am looking to make a jump in my career... to become stable. Not only that, I want to create works of art in order to bring the Hebrew Scriptures to life. As you can tell from my portfolio, I have an articulate eye for detail and when you read my writings, you will notice that the same goes for them as well. The church still operates from the dark-ages and quite frankly, it\u0027s dead Jim. Thank God for His Resurrection Love and other options.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig15.deviantart.net/a090/f/2011/213/9/a/the_second_invasion_1_of_4_by_generalsoundwave-d42eb8l.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen your pet is sick, do you go to a mechanic? When your car breaks down, do you go to a brain-surgeon? Well if the off-chance that your mechanic is a part-time vet and the surgeon is a certified BMW mechanic, then sure. But nothing in this life, especially God, should be treated as \"part-time.\" When your heart is sick, try talking to a Hebrew who knows God. He may present to you perspectives you were completely unaware of, as you will find from getting to know me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig03.deviantart.net/91db/f/2011/223/9/3/sagiten_epic_charge_by_generalsoundwave-d467nhn.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I\u0027m hurting for publicity and larger budgets, so,\u00a0I joined Patreon."

     "description": "When I do my research for the Father, I write in Hebrew a LOT. I am learning the language by myself, mostly from studying sources from the Blue Letter Bible (www.BlueLetterBible.com). What I really need to do is learn how to create fonts so that I can create the original Hebrew-Chaldaee pictograph called Hebrew Word Pictures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you look below, someone drew the characters for those word-pictures, which are located in the far-right column. \u003cbr\u003eThese are rasterized images and not fonts. I will need to create them in Font format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/BiKOaHF4G4LcC032j*BEU9U443hPrqu0KR-7P0CgatcaSq2ZlF0ZWcX2P-yf9UhxAhqCyczigLCPCKQ3u22-iKck75eYLHc6/AHAC_JEM_9_1500_jpg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do I need them? When I go and teach, I speak about the Hebrew language often, because that is the original language of the Hebrew Scriptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, one of the names of God is El:\u00a0\u05d0\u05dc\u003cbr\u003eIn Hebrew, we read from right to left, opposed to English, which is left to right. \u003cbr\u003eThe first letter is called Aleph (\u05d0) and the second is called Lahmed (\u05dc). The Hebrew Word pictures for the Aleph is the Bulls Head, which also means \"strength\" and the Lahmed is the Shepherd\u0027s Staff. So the name of God is \"The Mighty Shepherd.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLikewise, the name for heart is Leyv:\u00a0\u05dc\u05d1\u003cbr\u003eThe Lahmed (\u003cstrong\u003e\u05dc\u003c/strong\u003e)\u00a0again is the Shepherd\u0027s Staff, and the Bet (\u003cstrong\u003e\u05d1\u003c/strong\u003e)\u00a0is the \"House\" or \"Tent.\"\u003cbr\u003eSo the Hebrew Word Pictures for the Heart is: \"The Shepherd\u0027s House.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why God requires a clean heart, it\u0027s because in order for you to love Him with all of yours, it must be clean for Him to live there. That is what forgiveness is about! But that is a lesson for another time :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny help would be greatly appreciated.",
