     "about": "I\u0027m a composer, I write concert music. My style has a strong base in classical music with various modern influences. In the last few years I\u0027ve been working on getting my works performed and recorded by professional musicians from all over the world. These works vary in instrumentation, piano solo, chamber music and full orchestra. One of my favourite projects is a collection of Christmas pieces I composed based on traditional songs, which have been recorded by excellent musicians in the last year and my goal is to make a CD for the Holiday season. I\u0027d like to get more of my music performed, especially my orchestral works and recorded. I also work for VSL (Vienna Symphonic Library) making professional demos for them, VSL is a company that specializes in virtual sounds. About my training, I\u0027m a pianist with excellent abilities as a performer, in the past I\u0027ve given numerous concerts, and played for all types of circumstances and in various styles. I studied music in Montreal at McGill University in which I have a degree in Composition and a Masters in Performance from the University of Montreal. \u00a0",

If I can get your help for 2/3rd of this amount, that would be incredibly helpful! My goal would be $500/month or until the raised amount is reached, which would be $2000 USD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe raised money would go to produce this piece.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeXwhFUcqW0\"\u003eNine Variations on an Original Romantic Theme for cello and piano by Guy Bacos\u003c/a\u003e This is a virtual version which I programmed myself with samples though computer programming.
