    "summary": "Grounders Souce is the most popular source for \u003cem\u003eThe 100\u003c/em\u003e, a post-apocalyptic drama that airs on the CW network. Thousands of visitors visit the\u003ca href=\"http://grounderssource.com/\"\u003e website \u003c/a\u003eon an hourly basis, as they seek the latest information, photos, and other things about the show. In addition to that, Grounders Source has recently launched its official nonprofit,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/hopeandbattlescars\"\u003eThe Hope And Battle Scars Campaign\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ethat benefits people with disabilities around the globe.\u00a0 \u00a0In honor of Eliza Taylor, Grounders Source also launched its second official nonprofit, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Brave Princess Project\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e which will aide Ms. Taylor\u0027s nonprofit school,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kohtaoforkids.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKoh Tao Primary\u003c/a\u003e in Thailand.\u00a0 Information about the project can be found on grounderssource.com, and direct donations can be made on the Gofundme page at\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gofundme.com/our-gift-to-eliza\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOur Gift To Eliza\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://grounderssource.com/gallery/albums/userpics/10001/6~108.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike other news sites, Grounders Source is run by one hard-working and very efficient writer, instead of a beehive of writers. That is one of the many-faceted reasons of what makes the site so unique, personal, and solid.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile all of this wonderful and awesome, it does have its costs. Which is a necessary implement to run the site and provide all of the extras that people want to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaying out of pocket to run the site does not always meet the criteria and attention that it needs and deserves. This is solely crucial as the website gets more popular and people could hack into it, which is something that we all do not want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is what will be covered and what \u003cem\u003eThe 100\u003c/em\u003e fandom will get when you make a pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWebsite Upkeep\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e: This will cover the costs of running the site, such as the hosting platform, the anti-theft and anti-hacking software, the layouts, SEO, and everything else that will keep Grounders Source smooth and fluid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003ePhotography\u003c/span\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is another very important aspect as people want to see photos of the cast from events, cons, and from the series. Grounders Source wants to have the very best of the very best because that is what is to be expected and people want a reliable, credible platform. What that means is that HQ photos from agencies such as Getty and the CW. It can cost up to hundreds of dollars for just a few of them, but Grounders SourceI gives the of the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eContests\u003c/span\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003e Grounders Sources hosts contests and giveaways 2-3 times a year for thanking the supporters and love. In addition, I think we are the only site in the world that can provide this. This is the lower end of the pledges as this will cover prizes. Prizes can include \u003cem\u003eThe 100\u003c/em\u003e books, shirts, original artwork, autos from the cast, and etc. I do not want to get into elaborate detail about this as I want people to be surprised at it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eTravel and media coverage:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e This is a big one but well worth it. Traveling to conventions, (IE SDCC) to cover the latest news, getting press, and professional photography is a must. Funds will cover airfare, hotel accommodations, equipment insurance, convention admission, and more. This will be a higher pledge, but definitely a great thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eSoftware and computer issues\u003c/span\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e This is mainly covered in the website upkeep, but in case that something was to happened (and it did, earlier this year), extra funding will take care of it. Most of the time, I can fix it without costs, as I have computer knowledge, but the few times you can\u0027t. This will be the lower end of the pledges, like the contests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is basically it as far as coverage. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the outline of all of the cool things that will happen in honor of your love and support. \u00a0After all, Grounders Source would not have been the success it is today without the help of the fans and creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e Special Goal Marks:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll are monthly contributions and in USD.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$100: \u003c/strong\u003eThis will cover the upkeep of the site and contests, and you\u0027ll also get your name as a sponsor on the site. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$500\u003c/strong\u003e: \u00a0HQ photography coverage from agencies and site sponsorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e $1000: \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eTravel costs, including organizing meetups at conventions, a chance for me to ask your questions at panels, and all of the other things that incorporates the media spectrum. \u00a0This will also include meeting me at the cons, which is always a fun thing. \u00a0Also, site sponsorship. \u263a\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be smaller pledges as well.
