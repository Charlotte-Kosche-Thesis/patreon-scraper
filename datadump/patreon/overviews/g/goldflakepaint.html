In the years since we started, this little online magazine has grown from a bedroom-writing project to a small team of individuals spread across the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe post (mostly new) music every day, aiming to give whatever platform we can to artists, bands, and record labels that we believe can make a small difference to the people willing to listen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt means a lot for us to be able to do this without resorting to click-bait articles/splashing adverts all over the site, which also means it\u0027s very difficult to make any kind of income from the site as it currently stands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help us move forward to the next level, via a small donation each month, we would appreciate that very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!",
