Over the years we have come across some amazing artists and we will show their works to you as often as we can. These videos are up for all to see because we are trying to promote these artists to everyone and we don\u0027t think it would be fair to make people pay to see them in our opinions.\u003cbr\u003eOver the next year there will be videos, discussions and teasers for Anthrothia as we progress through the development stages and launch into an actual world open for all to play. A lot of these sneak peeks will be for Patrons only of course, some will be for all to see, but we got to have some content that will make our Patrons mouths water for more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://funkyimg.com/i/2GTU1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Anthrothia?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnthrothia will be an Open World, MMORPG which will have new innovations in world that have not been tried before. We promise a new style User Interface(UI) that not only gives the player more information and easier access but will not clutter your play screen so you can enjoy the game itself. We have a new pet system we have worked on for the last year perfecting, as well as what we like to call the Triple trident in game play. So much exciting things that will be fun for everyone to experience as we show you the World of Anthrothia unfold. We will even discuss and ask for our Patrons views on our marketing plan as well as a new card game in world....Oh we didn\u0027t mention that part? Hmmmm wonder what other news we haven\u0027t mentioned yet...... read on and become a Patron and you will soon find out\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://funkyimg.com/i/2GTU2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the videos we make to promote 3D artists are free for everyone to see, the idea is to promote these artists and get as many people out there a chance to see them. The Patron support we get for each video will help us get programs needed to make Anthrothia a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Already we have been able to purchase Wondershare for better quality videos for you to enjoy and been able to purchase Inkarnate Pro which will act as our Map platform for Anthrothia. We can\u0027t say how much this support is appreciated, although these purchases are small they are vital to the Game World and each supporter gives us renewed confidence in what we are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon provides a valuable service to small developers like us, where users like you can show their support and journey with us as we launch Anthrothia. At the moment we are starting our Patreon page with only three tiers of support, but we have plans to expand this in the future. We have ideas for cool higher level rewards that we are looking forward to sharing with you. For now we will start small and see where it goes.\u003c/div\u003e"
