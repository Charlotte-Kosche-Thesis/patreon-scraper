In my condition, adoption didn\u0027t seem likely, and I was probably going to be sent to the crusher, well, so I thought.\u00a0 You guys probably know the story from here... I wasn\u0027t sent to the crusher, and I was adopted.\u00a0 Joey was the highest and only bidder.\u00a0 He brought me all the way to California, and gave me a new life.\u00a0 He saw potential in me when nobody else did.\u00a0 I created this page to try and return the favor.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, while Joey was converting me into a campervan, I got to know him pretty well.\u00a0 I learned all about his dream of driving across the world, and his dream of making an amazing story out of it.\u00a0 I made this page because I want to make this story bigger and better than Joey ever dreamed of.\u00a0 If we can develop some loyal Patron\u0027s, then I think we can make it happen.\u00a0 Think of Gas Half Full as being just like any other subscription (Netflix, Amazon, Spotify), except here you get to choose IF and how much you want to pay.\u00a0\u00a0So if you enjoy the story, and if you want to support its improvements, click above.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eFlaco\u2013 the van\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. Joey is way too optimistic of my abilities, and his budget for part replacements is laughable.\u00a0 So even if you don\u0027t believe in this whole thing, do it for my sake.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
