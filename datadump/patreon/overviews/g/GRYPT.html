    "summary": "GRYPT is an unholy trinity hailing from the Shores of Hell, Los Angeles. Since the band\u2019s inception in 2013, we have released 2 EPs and 2 singles (now collected as THY FLESH CONSUMED) as well as cover songs and mixtapes. We have also played shows and collaborated on indie video games while clawing a niche with our abstract, creepy sound. We\u2019ve won the interest of people with tarnished souls and impeccable taste, people such as yourself.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough it pains us to disassemble the illusion of glamour, GRYPT are not the heirs and heiress to royal empires that artists in position of power typically are. Frankly, we\u2019ve faced numerous daunting financial and residential obstacles. It is by some unusual miracle that we have been able to give you the songs, shows and interactive fiction we have thus far. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTragically, artists without financial backing are artists whose ideas rarely come to fruition. When necessities such as gas money or time off from work are major concerns, studio time and promotional services can feel like an unreachable fantasy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was where we found ourselves stuck six months ago. In the face of many imposing enemies, GRYPT was nearing a point of throwing in the proverbial towel. We were approached by producer Billy Burke, whom we had known previously through his work as part of SCVM. He invited us to visit at Seahorse Sound Studios in downtown LA for a session of discussion and general chillage. Billy told us about how he\u2019d been following our efforts as GRYPT for the couple years we had been active. He wanted to help develop our sound to create a full length album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe opportunity to make tracks representing a more focused, provocative version of GRYPT ignited the spark that relit the fire beneath our then lukewarm cauldron. Inspired by the injustice of an entropic, callous universe, we began writing and recording with fervor. GRYPT is now three tracks deep into what could become a full length album, tentatively titled THE SHORES OF HELL. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help us \nmove forward with the production of THE SHORES OF HELL. Please give this\n important release a shot at the future it deserves with your \ncontribution of $6.66 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe intend to show our \nappreciation in a number of ways. As a member of the official GRYPT \npatreonship, you will be privy to our \nexclusive serial horror story. Each month, you will receive the next \nchapter in a macabre and terrifying original tale written and narrated \nby Romie Romak with score and sound design from GRYPT. We hope to evoke \nthe creepy fun of long forgotten horror comic books and audio-drama \nserials. The first chapter is uploaded and available on our \u003ca href=\"https://grypt.bandcamp.com/album/tales-from-a-glass-crypt-vol-2-the-blob-stares-back\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e. \nHowever, only members will be getting the rest.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould you wish\n to make a larger donation, we have high fashion Tote Bags and GRYPT \nSatanic Madonna t-shirts as well as other spookysexycool memorabilia to sweeten \nthe deal.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that these songs can set a grim but enjoyable\n tone for memories you will one day look back on with fondness and \nterror. THE SHORES OF HELL might become an important piece in the \nsoundtrack to your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe greatly appreciate your support and promise to make you proud. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours ghoully, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRYPT \u003cbr\u003eRomie Romak, Taylor Shechet, Myrrh Ka Ba\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2318\u003c/strong\u003e"
