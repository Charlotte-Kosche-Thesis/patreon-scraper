As I\u0027ve grown as a person and a writer, my ideas have gotten increasingly weird and warped, and people tell me they actually like them. So I\u0027ve taken it upon myself to share these weird, warped ideas as widely as I can manage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me with this quest of mine. With enough patrons, I hope to one day be able to make a living at writing. Long before that happens, the money I earn will help me reduce the amount of time I have to spend working other jobs that keep me away from writing, and will allow me to invest in equipment to improve my audio production setup. Better microphones and editing software and associated equipment will allow me to make the best audio books I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to me, and even if you can\u0027t afford provide any patronage, thank you very much for taking the time to stop in here and read this. If you CAN pledge money towards my cause, you\u0027ve helped me make the world a weirder place. That is absolutely priceless.\u003cbr\u003e"
