Sadly, wealthy aristocratic patrons are a bit harder to find nowadays. Fortunately, Patreon allows anyone, from aristocrat to plebeian, to support creators whose work they enjoy by making small, monthly pledges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u00a0So why are you using Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been running Good Tickle Brain since 2013, and have recently started working full-time on it.
