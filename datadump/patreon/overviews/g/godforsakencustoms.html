    "summary": "We are Chris and Emma, the face of Godforsaken Customs. We have just recently moved to Canada on a 2 year work permit to try and live out our dreams, we have gotten rid of everything we knew and owned to start over again on this side of the Planet. Youtube has been a driving factor in us actually getting to Canada and having people to support us when we got here, it is also a passion of ours to share our perspective of the world through videos. Our ultimate end goal would be to stay in Canada, buy a plot of Land somewhere and build ourselves a small timber frame dwelling to live in, land prices just made that impossible for us where we were in the UK. As you may know Youtube is not paying like it used to and making videos is a lot of work and the equipment does not come cheap, I have yet to find a camera or laptop that can handle the daily abuse of video making and editing. This is making Youtubing hard for many of us, especially spending hours editing every day to make less than an hours pay. We are looking at ways to find income, if we could make that from videos then all the better, it is something we do and love, who wouldn\u0027t want to get paid for something they enjoy? If only that was the case! Because of our situation we need a steady income of some description. At the rate its going at some point in the very near future we will have to get back to employment and the videos will suffer as a consequence but we are willing to do what we have to do to make this work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day we would like to see Canada, by heading out in the truck and exploring, that would be the ultimate ambition to drive all over and share it with our fans, maybe one day we can make that dream come true. We have been told by some of our fans that they are vicariously living through us which to us is both a huge honour and a responsibility to provide decent content for these viewers, and we do our best to keep up with it all. We also like to promote smaller musicians and regularly have music features on the channel and are looking for original music all the time. We are by no means e-beggars and we are not expecting anything from anyone but any donation would be of great help to us and the channel, this was suggested to us by several fans so here it is!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is just a brief description of us and what we do, please come and get to know us better on our Youtube page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJpqu8-xdEyrWK9AT1JTRAQ\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJpqu8-xdEyrWK9AT...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust a final thank you to all our friends, subscribers, and supporters who have made the efforts worth while and who have been a huge part in our amazing journey so far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHuge love, Chris and Emma, Godforsaken Customs"
