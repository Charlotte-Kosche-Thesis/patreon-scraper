    "summary": "Hi!  My name is Gregory, but you can call me Greg, if you\u0027d like, and I\u0027m a musician!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figure it\u0027d be best to tell you a little about me before we proceed any further:  I\u0027ve been playing guitar since I was around 13, and taught myself various other instruments since then.  I\u0027ve played all over the country with different groups, and I\u0027m completely self taught, with the exception of a few weeklong camps in my teenage years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn July of 2013, I lost my job at a construction company, and have been unemployed ever since.\u00a0 To top it all off, I had no way to get around to where I needed to go.\u00a0 Thanks to the support of my friends and family, I have a roof over my head and food in my stomach, and now have another vehicle I can drive.\u00a0 Only problem?\u00a0 Finding a job is harder than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I was forced to take it to the streets.\u00a0 Literally.\u00a0 I grabbed my guitar, some poster board, and a marker and headed to Downtown Augusta.\u00a0 Broad Street, to be exact.\u00a0 I garnered a reputation as\u00a0\"The Downtown Minstrel\", and I play on those streets as often as I can.\u00a0 The money is paltry, but it\u0027s enough to keep gas in the car.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, I had an idea:\u00a0 Why not bring my Downtown Minstrel character to the internet?\u00a0 Thus, here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to release a new cover of a song every Monday and Friday.\u00a0 Why Monday and Friday?\u00a0 Mondays have become so dreaded in our work-driven society, so why not have some music to start off your work week?\u00a0 And of course, I\u0027d love to be the music that helps start your weekend off right!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn keeping with the busker mentality, my videos will not be of incredible quality.\u00a0 In my experience, some of the most beautiful things I\u0027ve seen and heard were not in the prettiest packages.\u00a0 Also, I don\u0027t have a computer of my own, so I do everything from my iPhone 4S.\u00a0 Recording, uploading, promoting, it all happens from my phone.\u00a0 With your support, I should be able to upgrade my recording equipment so I can give you higher quality videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading this, and I\u0027d love to have you as a Patron!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
