    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.gamebanshee.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGameBanshee.com\u003c/a\u003e is a website destination that\u0027s dedicated to role-playing games on both modern and classic platforms.  For the past 17 years, we have chronicled news about their development and reception across more than 60,000 news articles, conducted over 200 interviews with industry veterans and visionaries, published hundreds of previews and reviews, maintained a database of virtually every RPG and RPG hybrid created since the late 1970s, and created more than 100 dedicated \"subsites\" that are chock-full of content ranging from annotated walkthroughs to searchable databases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe absolutely love role-playing games, and it\u0027s this passion that has kept us fueled for the\u00a0better part of the last two decades\u00a0in ensuring that such information is at your fingertips while also doing what we can to help preserve what we feel is the greatest video game genre to have ever been conceived.  We\u0027ve spent tens of thousands of man-hours creating this content since early 2000, and look forward to being able to say the same about the next 17 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating all of this content and maintaining a website like GameBanshee costs much more than man-hours, however.  We do what we can to compensate the people who contribute much of the content that our readers consume, the video games and periodic hardware upgrades to play them is not cheap, and our server fees have only increased since the website\u0027s inception.  We also have a number of projects that have been on the \"back burner\" in recent years as we have not had the financial freedom to bring them to fruition. \u00a0We have other plans that we would like to pursue in order to grow the site and increase the quality of our content even further, but have not been able to achieve a level of income stability that would allow us to take them beyond the planning stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the increase in costs across the board to maintain a website like ours, Internet advertising revenue continues to decline and is less-than-reliable when making decisions about GameBanshee\u0027s long-term future.  That\u0027s where Patreon comes in.  With Patreon, supporters who appreciate the content we\u0027re creating can help contribute to the website\u0027s success and growth.  Every single contribution will enable us to expand our coverage capabilities and pursue additional projects, while also solidifying our presence on the web for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever spent time on GameBanshee catching up on the latest RPG news, tapping into an interesting interview, referencing a walkthrough, checking out our take on a particular game, or simply browsing our database of RPGs to strengthen your knowledge of role-playing history, please consider becoming a patron. \u00a0We are absolutely indebted to the community who has brought us this far, and to each and every person who chooses to become a patron. \u00a0Thanks for taking the time to check out our Patreon page, and for your consideration in becoming a registered patron!\u003cbr\u003e"
