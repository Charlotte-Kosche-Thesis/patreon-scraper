    "summary": "Greetings friends. Our group is a official searching squad, created in 2016 by Yuri Gonchar and Mikhail Semenov. A group of enthusiasts began their journey in 2009. Interested in the search for missing soldiers in the territory of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region, and later in more remote areas of the country, our group began its practical and theoretical studies of places of fierce battles between Soviet soldiers and German invaders. As our activities became established, it became clear that further growth in the effectiveness of our group is possible only with the creation of an exploratory detachment and conducting its activities jointly with the Youth House of St. Petersburg. In 2016 our group acquired the name, and with it the same name detachment named after them. Yuriy Gagarin, the Soviet test pilot, the first cosmonaut. The name is due to several criteria. The main ones are speed, quality and constant increase in efficiency. Our main activity is the search for missing soldiers. The WW2\u00a0 left an indelible mark on the destinies of the peoples of the world. The Soviet land was especially damaged. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are still missing. Our goal is to do everything possible to reduce these figures. Return our defenders from oblivion. In many families, great-grandfathers, grandfathers, and even fathers and husbands are still waiting. Over the years of our activity, our group has discovered and exhumed more than 200 soldiers and officers of the Red Army. Not a few families learned about the fate of their heroes. The second important goal of our detachment is the sanctification of the activities of our and other search groups. In 2010 the channel Yuri Gagarin was created. Over the years of development, he has attracted a lot of attention. We carefully reflected our activities, creating colorful videos describing the search work. Our channel grew and grew stronger, gathering a large army of subscribers and viewers. We believe that people should remember the price of our fragile peace. For this we make our videos. Our group is in complete self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, the status of searching squad does not imply government procurement. Of course, we will not quit even if it becomes very difficult. But we will be very grateful to people who are impressed by our activities, which, like us, believes that the war is not over until the last soldier is buried."
