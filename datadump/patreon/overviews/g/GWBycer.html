I\u0027ve been published several times on Gamasutra and have been building a reputation for providing quality, informative pieces.  In late 2012 I took a step forward and opened \n\u003ca href=\"http://game-wisdom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGame-Wisdom\u003c/a\u003e: A site dedicated to critically examining game design and the industry. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFocusing on quality analysis of games and well thought out pieces about the industry. Throughout 2013, I\u0027ve had a chance to talk to a number of developers such as Jon Schafer, Chris Hecker and more. We do this via our weekly podcast where we talk about design, current news in the industry and if we have a designer on the cast, their latest or upcoming title. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat makes our podcasts unique is the fact that we talk critically about game development and the industry with people making video games; something that no one else is doing right now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom the beginning I wanted Game-Wisdom to be a source of quality writing and realizing how much they distract from the tone of the site, I made the site ad free. Since then I\u0027ve been working daily to keep new content on the site and find new guests for the podcast. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have expanded in recent months to doing live presentations relating to game design and the industry for libraries and community centers to help spread the word and talk to the wider audience about the industry.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eYouTube:\u003c/h2\u003e\nSince late 2015, we have been growing with more video-based content on\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/c/game-wisdom\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhILNl59m2w\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u00a0This includes streams of a variety of games, live interviews with developers and my popular vlog series: A Critical Thought. The Critical Thoughts are daily topics relating to all manner of game design, with many pitched by the fans. We have managed to hit over 2K subscribers and are continuing to grow. The next goal is to go for 10k subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will pledges be going towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am hoping that with Patreon, I can secure monthly funding to help keep the site going and allow me to focus full time on making Game-Wisdom the best that it can be.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goals are designed to add more content all around, and allow me to support myself and my household.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGoal Structure:\u003c/h2\u003eEach goal is designed to add new content for Game-Wisdom, the Streams and the YouTube channel. I am willing to listen to the fans and patrons for future goals and the content that gets unlocked will also allow patrons to vote for a let\u0027s play or examination for the following month.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith each new goal we unlock, means more content for everyone to vote on and enjoy. As we continue to go up in terms of funding, it will also afford me the ability to upgrade my setup for higher quality content as time goes on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGame-Wisdom Live:\u003c/h2\u003eEach week, we hold a live show where myself and video game producer Robert Leach and I talk about game design and industry topics on the YouTube channel. For right now, the show is going to be Sundays at 3:00 est and they\u0027re open to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDiscord Channel:\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe newest feature for patrons is the Game-Wisdom private discord channel. It\u0027s where people interested in talking about game design and the industry are welcomed. Moving forward, anyone can join via this link:\u00a0https://discord.gg/MFdkhMz. The basic membership just grants you access to the discord; you must donate to the patreon to get voting privileges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eVip Status:\u003c/h2\u003e\nMy standard reward tier for the Patreon is VIP status. For anyone who donates $5 or more, you will gain access to additional private sections of the Game-Wisdom discord channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVIPs will now also get first access to the recording of any live discussions we do on Game Design: For right now those would be the live Perceptive Podcasts and Game-Wisdom Live show. Not only that, but they will get access to an ad-free version\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSaturday Night Grab Bag:\u003c/h2\u003e\nEvery Saturday night, I stream three random games from my backlog as voted on by the fans and patrons. This is a way of playing a game that I wouldn\u0027t normally look at, and provide some extra variety. How it works is that on Sunday, I make a spreadsheet available for everyone to vote on a game they would like to see me play. On Wednesday, I take the voted games and show them to the supporters who then cast the deciding vote.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at my Patreon page.
