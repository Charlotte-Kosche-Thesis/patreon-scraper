I like that song!\" \u00a0(Yeah, our fans are people of little words.) \u00a0And for me, that is quite possibly the best feeling in the world. \u00a0I like feeling that feeling. \u00a0More than anything. \u00a0So I\u0027m gonna write more songs. \u00a0I hope to write thousands of excellent, engaging, catchy, and clever songs over my lifetime. \u00a0By pledging to support me on Patreon, you become a very important part of that process. \u00a0In fact, and I\u0027m not certain of the legalities of this, but, in my mind, you become my boss, my muse, my reason for existing, and, as demonstrated before, my drug dealer. \u00a0The drug you\u0027re dealing is that electric, tingling, wonderful feeling I get every time I write a new song. \u00a0So, if you\u0027d like to deal drugs without any significant legal ramifications, please consider supporting my attempt to write so many songs that I become akin to the Simpsons. \u00a0You know, every time \u00a0another songwriter tries to write something original, I\u0027ll be there, with a song already about that idea, subject, topic or joke.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and please support those folk that have supported me in the past. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrey\u0027s Anatomy \u00a0 \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNight Attack \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nightattack.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://nightattack.tv/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEyevis: \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUWEQuGdas\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUWEQuGdas\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and for the blogs go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.getsetgomusic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.getsetgomusic.com\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
