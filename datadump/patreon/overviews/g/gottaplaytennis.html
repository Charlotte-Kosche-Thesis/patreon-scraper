    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eTennis is as much an art form as it is a sport.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMore than sheer athleticism, beyond instantaneous decision-making, and at the limits of mental and physical toughness, creativity of thought is paramount in this fascinating activity played\u00a0almost non-stop\u00a0all over the globe. Even better however is the ability for kids, parents, teens, and sometimes grandparents to participate, share and grow as players enjoying the health and competitive joy tennis brings at their local park or club.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal since 2009 has been to freely provide insights, comments, and lessons-learned from my own game, my on-court instruction, and my evaluation of the professional game. I have done so through my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.gottaplaytennis.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.gottaplaytennis.net\u003c/a\u003e and podcast on iTunes at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/gotta-play-tennis/id310096949?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGotta Play Tennis\u003c/a\u003e (now at over 100 episodes). In addition to my experience with on-court instruction for over 30 years with kids and adults, I draw on both my intellectual resources and historical perspectives to deliver content that is timely, to-the-point, and helpful to a broad range of listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn order for me to maintain and grow as a content provider, the reality of cost in time, hosting fees, equipment, workshops, and more play a role in what is possible. This is where I need your help.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy future goals include more podcasts, interviews, expanded website(s) and video quick tips that can help all ages of players and potential players alike. Without your assistance, this extension of my current capabilities will not be possible.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, consider being a patron of Gotta Play Tennis. I look forward to new and wonderful things as we\u2013together\u2013move forward in bigger and better ways."
