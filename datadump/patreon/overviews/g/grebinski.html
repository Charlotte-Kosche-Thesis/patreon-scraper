I work with queer bodies and contested architectures, whether I am making the images myself or appropriating them.\u00a0I recycle these images to reaffirm and redefine their meanings. I protect these images, experiences that may have never happened, through this constant inquiry.

Since I moved to Pittsburgh last year, he became one of my first city friends, and also one of the first to be a practicing artist, and really one of the few people who kept the conversation going.  He\u2019s a professor after all, and I\u2019ve also discovered that he\u2019s an archeologist and archivist as well. If One Won\u2019t then Another Will is a considerable display of this kind of work, but also it\u2019s one where what\u2019s uncovered isn\u2019t simply documented, it\u2019s also given reverence, resonance, and a place to be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://stephengrebinski.com/images/aug8show-91.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHe collects images, and is a keen student of their history and the manifold implications that lies within those narratives.  He loves to mull through the jetsam of his neighborhood, grabbing pleasing scraps and bits of information both physical and ephemeral from the decomposing lots around his home.  He also scours his own history to create compositions that bring back things which have vanished back to contemporaneity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe queer body is multifaceted, and so is architecture.  What happens when these forms intersect and are allowed to move in-between one another.  When we compare the male nude, an image already powerful with meaning from antiquity to present day we have enough information, but what if it\u2019s not the David?  What if it\u2019s just some somebody living out a fantasy for spare change (or perhaps nothing but the thrill) in the 60s-70s just before AIDS, before coming out, before the sure but inevitable acceptance of their love.  What of those bodies.  And what of the beautiful homes of the rich and powerful, now barren and anesthetized with the exceptional celebrity home.  While these things are not powerless on their own, through the rhizomes and visual channeling they communicate.  A dream like world where the wish can be fulfilled, where there is real promise of power and agency.  Wherein the image and their beauty will not fade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://stephengrebinski.com/images/aug8show-8.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBut also what of the detritus?  What of the actual trash left behind when wealth decides to move elsewhere.  \u003cem\u003eThe wreckage of abandoned homes and former bathhouses are also places where there was once the captivating magic of home life, the syncopation of bodies. \u003c/em\u003e The home is a liminal space where many things can be made, and from this ruin Grebinski constructs tender collages, elegiac to desires once profound, now lost on others as merely nostalgia for simpler, times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet we still seek the next thing; the next mode which is fashionable, outstanding, ideal in our perceptions of bodies and and the places where they lay, and much like the relics of our past we don\u2019t have a complete access to them.  No matter how meditative or scientific the research, there is still the unknown.  We can feel the past resonate, but we can\u2019t possibly begin to know it all.  \u003cem\u003eThere is only so much we can divine when so much of the information is inaccessible.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf One Won\u2019t Then Another Will transcends all of the fixtures of it\u2019s subject matter to seek to find an archae to the  desire, abandonment, and change that permeates all of these images, but it does not reveal it.  Through all this juxtaposition, video performances, and hundreds of artifacts both photographic and found, we catch this moment of the unknowable, of something sought out but beyond our reach.  We can observe and hypothesize, but we can\u2019t ever know.  However, once we\u2019re there, the process starts all over again, and in this consideration we are able to see our own desires reflected against the frame.  It\u2019s honestly an amazing place to find yourself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Val Krizanek\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
