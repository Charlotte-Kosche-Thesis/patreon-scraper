This channel showcases my intense passion for creating entertaining content around video games (retro and modern), movies (of all kinds), and a ton of other nerdy things that I can\u0027t list here because this paragraph would go on for all time. I invite you to check out my channel trailer to get an idea of the type of content you\u0027ll find. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhat is the goal of this patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this patreon is simple: to give viewers who enjoy my videos a way to support the channel more directly, allowing me to improve the quality of my content over time, and helping me work towards the goal of replacing my current day job with full time\u00a0content creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhy start a patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a full time content creator requires hard work, dedication, consistency, and an irrational appetite for success. But it also requires a sustainable, stable source of income, especially when raising a family. And ad revenue on YouTube has become one of the most unstable sources of revenue available to creators. Between false copyright claims from big companies holding back revenue, and content unnecessarily being deemed \"non-advertiser friendly,\" hours and hours of work can be uploaded only to result in no monetization,\u00a0for over a month at times, so fan support has\u00a0never been more important. Success also requires a growing channel to gradually improve the quality of the content provided, and for the time being, any patreon donations I receive will be redirected right back into the channel. Which takes me to the next section...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhat will I do with donations?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pride myself as being as transparent as possible with my viewers and aim to use patreon donations to upgrade several aspects of the channel.\u00a0Over time, I\u0027d like to\u00a0do small upgrades such as a better lighting system (currently using a cheap Wal-Mart LED lamp that gets way too hot), microphone accessories such as a pop filter, extendable mount, and shock absorber to drastically improve audio quality. More long term goals involve upgrading the computer I use to edit my videos. Eventually, I\u0027d like to upgrade the workstation to a proper desktop built for video editing, resulting in faster rendering times, and content delivered on a more frequent basis. I also use footage from many new games and movies released in glorious 4K Ultra HD, along with some high end emulators such as Dolphin and PCSX2 that can internally render older games in 4K. But my capture card is limited to 1080p, forcing me to downgrade captured footage. With so many great releases this year coming up, I would love to bring the GamerThumbTV community footage that is as crystal clear as it can possibly be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at this page! I\u0027ve structured the reward tiers in a fun way where patrons in any tier can feel like they\u0027re helping the channel directly. The rewards are always subject to change and will only get better in time, so any feedback is always appreciated. If you choose to support the channel and join the GamerThumbTV brotherhood, that\u0027s excellent and I appreciate you more than words can describe! If you choose not to support the channel financially, I hope you continue watching the free content I pour so much love into and share it with your friends. Patreon is just one way to support the channel and by simply watching, you\u0027re still helping me take huge steps towards my ultimate goal!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
