We are a podcast that produces an episode weekly and we would like to also tranisition to video content on a more regular basis as well. As a small company, all the support that you bring in goes directly to the content creation and us being able to afford the month to month production of our content. With the increase in money we are looking at having a more steady stream of games and scientific analysis that we find lacking in video game journalism. Now obviously we understand that these are at the heart video games; however we like science and find excuses to make science applicable in our day to day activities, this of course includes video games.\u00a0"
