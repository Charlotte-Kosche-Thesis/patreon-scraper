    "summary": "When my family plays Pictionary, it comes up every time how terrible I was at it when I was kid, because I focused too much on detail. By the time everybody else had drawn a person, I would\u0027ve drawn a hand. \u00a0And then my team would lose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve since recovered from this handicap and am now much better at Pictionary, although not a champion. \u00a0Nor am I the greatest artist. I\u0027m just a person who has a better grip than I used to about the importance of getting your art to function as a delivery vehicle for a concept and/or message.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScott McCloud defines a comic as \"juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or produce an aesthetic response in the viewer.\" \u00a0I\u0027ve taken lots of art classes, an aesthetics philosophy course in college, and even been paid (temporarily) to work as an artist, but it\u0027s only now that I\u0027ve really started contemplating the specific art of comics and exploring what I can do within it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then the election happened, and I found myself furious. I went through the stages of grief, hit \"anger,\" and held onto that one while proceeding through the rest. I wanted to find a productive way to express that anger, and to play out the conversations that were going on in my head in case they resonated with anybody else. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s where\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.giantif.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGiant If\u003c/a\u003e came from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \"big if\" is an unlikely but necessary condition. Like you might say \"If-- and this is a big if-- your great grandmother comes along to Carlsbad Caverns, then I promise to pack a picnic basket.\" \u00a0If that\u0027s a \"big if,\" then America emerging from a Trump presidency without some enormous scars seems like a \u003cem\u003egiant\u003c/em\u003e if to me. That, and I feel like \"giant if\" eloquently expressed both the tremendous uncertainty of how we\u0027re all feeling right now, and my own personal difficulty with decision-making. So I went ahead and bought the domain. I\u0027m committed. Not like buying a domain name is a huge commitment, but hey-- it\u0027s something. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to keep doing this comic, for as long as there are things to express and/or make fun of, and realistically it\u0027s hard to imagine running out of such things. \u00a0But I have expenses. I need to get dental surgery, for example, and my insurance doesn\u0027t cover most of it. \u00a0I\u0027m not in danger of imminent financial ruin, but a few bucks from a few people would really help. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like what you see, consider chipping in. \u00a0If you don\u0027t, no worries-- I won\u0027t come to your home and force you to look at my comics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks."
