    "summary": "Making videos on YouTube is a tricky business. Often the most watched gaming videos (and those most promoted by YouTube itself) contain the bare minimum amount of information or effort. Five 3 minute videos are better than one 15 minute video in YouTube\u0027s eyes as it means more ad revenue for them. Even better are ten easily-made 15 minute videos for a let\u0027s play series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst they are undoubtedly entertaining and popular, they aren\u0027t the type of videos I want to make. I\u0027d much rather upload one 15 minute video which goes in depth on a subject and really explains it, then answer questions/respond to comments, than the alternatives above. Because of that it\u0027s very unlikely I\u0027ll ever be making videos full time. However if you\u0027re the kind of person who likes to see gaming  (and other) videos that have a lot of testing, research and thought put into them you can show your support via this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating to me here will allow you to actively contribute to my entire video making process on a regular basis. This will mostly help me fund better equipment which will make videos better for you, in addition to allowing the more in depth videos to even be possible. You\u0027ll be continually aiding my efforts to improve myself and my videos and I will be eternally grateful for that."

Well donating this amount via Patreon officially absolves you of any guilt from running AdBlock on my videos and you can feel happy in the knowledge that you\u0027re supporting the creation of more of them. If every single person that subscribed to me on YouTube donated this amount I could make videos full time very easily, but whilst that\u0027s still a bit of a pipe dream, giving this amount also puts me one step closer. You\u0027ll have done your bit and gone that extra step. Thank you so much! This also gives you access to my Patreon page where I\u0027ll post a variety of updates every so often and is a place you can interact with me on a more personal level.

If you do then you\u0027ll get a video every month but I want it to be as accessible as possible too, meaning that if you desire you can not claim previous rewards to shoot for something higher. For example, if you choose to donate $10 every month, instead of getting me to play your track on stream every month for 3 months, you can forgo that reward and receive this reward after 3 months of donations. You\u0027ve donated $30 in total so you should be eligible to have this reward in my eyes. As another example, donate $5 every month, don\u0027t ask me 5 questions each time, and every 2 months you can claim the $10 reward, every 4 months you can claim the $20 reward, or every 6 months you can claim the $30 reward. Or just drop $30 in one month and nothing afterwards if you\u0027re the instant gratification type. Whatever way you want to do it I\u0027m happy with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost of the rewards have been set as they are to ensure I\u0027m not inundated with too many requests and to reflect the amount of time each reward will take me. I\u0027d love to do all of the above for everyone for free, but the amount of time any one person has just doesn\u0027t allow it. The free content I post to YouTube will continue to be my main focus and will in no way be affected by this. If I feel my regular videos are suffering as a result of this I\u0027ll either add a limit to them or just remove them altogether. These should not be seen as me providing a service - I\u0027m not selling anything here. These are simply bonuses that I feel you should be entitled to if you\u0027re kind enough to go that extra mile and support me, and if I can provide some help to improve your racing or track making along the way then even better. If you have any ideas for new rewards that you\u0027d like to see you\u0027re welcome to let me know :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, thank you so much for even reading this far. If I ever make one of these videos for you (or the track video) then you will have donated a not insignificant amount of money to me and for that I am eternally grateful. Not because of the monetary value, but because it means you think my content is worth it and that I\u0027m doing a good job. Be sure to let me know the moment I\u0027m not! Thanks again for the support - whether it\u0027s $1, $100, or just commenting/liking/sharing my videos, I really do appreciate all of it.",
