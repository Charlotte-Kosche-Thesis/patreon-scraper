    "summary": "Greetings to all you wonderful Patrons of music and art! \u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Gord Oaks\u003c/strong\u003e. Welcome to this Patreon Page, and \u003cstrong\u003eThank You So Much\u003c/strong\u003e for coming here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you can directly accompany me in releasing a second original solo album, and beyond! How does this work, and why is your subscription important? Please see below. Becoming a patron through this site will give you access to the original new music I have been recording and \u003cstrong\u003eexclusively releasing here\u003c/strong\u003e. Just find the button on this page that says \"Become a Patron\" or one that says \"Your Reward\", and click it to set up the parameters of patronage that feels right for you. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0As a patron you will get access to listening to and/or downloading each song as it is completed and offered (posted) to the community of registered patrons, along with the stories of their creation and associated photos that I have taken along the journey. Once the \"Shine Bright\" series of songs are fulfilled and offered to you, I will plan to release further new songs, re-mixes, and more of my previously unreleased catalogue of original songs and compositions. (My released catalogue can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cdbaby.com/cd/gordoaks)\"\u003ehttp://cdbaby.com/cd/gordoaks)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0If some folks who have signed on mid-stream feel the impetus to donate for all the previous content here, please let me know and we can work something out.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e? A subscription site which is a revolutionary new format in music and art patronage. An artist gets paid for the art they make as they put in the work and offer it to supporters/patrons. As I have it set up, the amount that a patron signs up to invest in me will only be moved from your card/bank account when I post a song/creation to my patron community. Actually, it happens on the first of the month. If I don\u0027t post a creation during the previous month, no financial transaction occurs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE INITIAL GOAL:\u003c/strong\u003e  $500 per creation/song to give a living wage value - which is based on the\u00a0 time and effort that has gone into creating, recording, mixing, producing and posting these songs. This could look like 500 people spending $1 per creation, or 25 people investing in me for $20/creation, 50 people offering $10/creation, or 100 people spending $5/per creation. Recording a ten song studio album, in a lower budget kind of way, usually runs at about $10,000 just for the studio time. This makes each song worth about $1,000 to break even, before mastering, graphics and printing. I have recorded and edited the new tracks using a home studio and plan to only release them digitally, without printing and pressing cd\u0027s, so I felt that I could offer these song at half price, $500.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0(It is important to note that this platform runs in US currency.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW MANY CREATIONS PER MONTH?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m aiming for 2-4 songs to be released per month (generally it will be 3) as I am able to connect with internet as I travel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIS THIS AN ONGOING COMMITMENT? \u003c/strong\u003e Yes! But you are in control of that, and you are in control of the parameters of your ongoing investment. It is for as long as you want it to be, until I am able to enter a monastic training, or until I run out of creations for you (whichever comes first). I am releasing these songs as a way to both offer what I haven\u0027t offered, and to keep me going as I pilgrimage to monasteries to look deeply into and apply for monastic training. I hope that this music, poetry and the photographs will inspire and serve you well, taking you on a heartfelt musical journey so that you\u0027ll find spiritual nourishment and inspiration with each creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCAN I PUT A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH I SPEND PER MONTH?\u003c/strong\u003e YES. You are in full control. This means that you can set the ceiling for your total per month expenditure, regardless of your reward level, so you will never go over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e It makes sustainable financial\n sense right now to have 500, or 2000 people investing $1, $5, $10 or more per creation than to invest in a stand alone CD project, and then hope to recover the investment later. The online access lets me do this wherever I am, while being away from other work-for-income settings. It provides a steadied, ongoing income for the work I\u0027ve done and allows me to release the rest of my unreleased original catalogue of songs and creations directly to those who want to support/invest in my art/music/spiritual work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS A \"CREATION\"?\u003c/strong\u003e  Initially, I will focus on original downloadable songs, but further in the future it may be original contemplative poetry, or a joint venture on a children\u0027s storybook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHINK OF YOURSELF AS BEING A DIRECT PATRON OF THE ARTIST, EACH CREATION BEING WORTH SOMETHING, (OR PERHAPS EVEN LIKE ONLINE BUSKING!) \u003c/strong\u003e - Drop some bills into my guitar case for each song/creation I offer you, to empower my ability to release this next set of songs to you.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Shine Bright\" (the working title of the new album):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In 2017, before departing home, I recorded most of the parts for an intimate acoustic set of original works. I am working on some of the songs as I go; fixing up, editing, mixing and doing basic mastering. (At this stage it is a self- recorded and self-produced set of songs.) After that, if I have not yet found a monastic training, I will release other songs of more stylistic diversity and experimentation which I had been intending to release as singles with a unique view into the variety of song writing and composing genres I\u0027ve worked with in this musical life. Songs of the journey or new poems may naturally take form as we go, to add to the list of creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE DEADLINE:\u003c/strong\u003e The push for doing this is partly to make sure I am able to offer my unrecorded/unreleased music into the community in the nearest future possible. Since early 2015 I have been visiting, and applying to enter a first year of training at monasteries in Canada, the USA (and 2017 in Sri Lanka). I feel called to enter a monastic training if encouraging conditions for it emerge. The monasteries I\u0027m visiting are places of quietude, wisdom teaching, focused spiritual practice, meditation and community life. Personal music being played into the space is not an expression that is conducive to these settings, which are set aside for engaging with practices of attentiveness, mindfulness, non-distraction, cultivating presence, calming the busy heart-mind, stilling, and listening for the \"Sound of Silence.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg style=\"width: 232px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg style=\"width: 219px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother way to support my musical work is to purchase the \"Love Uprising\" CD through email and e-transfer. I will then send you a copy from the last 180 remaining CD\u0027s in the first printing.

There are further links there to my band, rEvolve. We have 3 albums of great music to purchase where I am co-writer/co-arranger, drummer/percussionist, and harmony vocalist. \u003ca href=\"https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/revolve32\"\u003ehttps://store.cdbaby.com/cd/revolve32\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY BACKSTORY AND THE BENEFITS OF PATRONS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Music has been with me since the beginning, and having more sincerely taken on the vocation of being a musician since 2001, my main work has been the accompaniment of singer-songwriters, music creation, performance, and recording. Over the years, I have offered my musical gifts in service and support to \nmany others in their amazing projects (which I love and cherish and \nhave taken as a main vocational strength). I have also been taking on other work, including practicing as a Shiatsu Acupressure Therapist, Qi Gong workshop facilitator, co-facilitating cultural workshops in schools, and more. Since 2013, it has increasingly made sense for me to begin to base my artistic efforts around recording my own musical works and poetry. It has been my intention and endeavour to offer high quality, sensitive songwriting and musicianship to make a sustainable living through music.This Patreon platform will allow me to offer such service at the present time, more directly person to person, artist to listener, with people who care about what I am up to and the music I\u0027ve created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, I was able to record and release my first professional solo album, called \"Love Uprising\". I released it both on hard copy CD and digitally through \u003ca href=\"http://cdbaby.com/cd/gordoaks\"\u003ehttp://cdbaby.com/cd/gordoaks\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA second set of songs have been readied for creating a second solo album, and here\u0027s where Patreon and you (a community of direct supporters/patrons) comes in. With the support of current patrons, I have been releasing this \"album\" as a set of singles, one song at a time. This format is intimate in it\u0027s sound, production and storytelling. Releasing musical creations to you through this Patreon platform allows each song to be offered with reflections on where the song came from, the context story behind the song, and it very importantly allows a direct income stream to happen in nearly real time as I do the creative and logistical work of releasing them to my Patron supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Recording has costs, takes focus, planning \u0026amp; implementation skill, rental of recording equipment or studio time, and a dedicated space of time in a quiet place. Writing music also takes significant time to contemplate life experiences, emotions, a specific theme, and listening quietly \u0026amp; closely enough to hear the song emerge from the silence for interpretation into manifest form. From the artistic space to recorded product, the completion and releasing of these new songs/recordings/poems bring a fulfillment, a letting go and release to me, and I know they will deeply serve those who hear them.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e  \"Love Uprising\" felt like a life\u0027s work documentation of songs that I had written over a period of 15 years. It was a huge undertaking for me. I have felt very proud of the detailed energy I was able to dedicate to the professionalism and heart of that recording. It took a lot of time and very concentrated preparation, detailed listening, mental/emotional exertion and patience. It was the quality of focus time available, the support of key people, and the $12,000 of funding that came in which allowed for this to happen successfully, without debt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe may consider this current format as a practice of trust and generosity, or as an exchange of gifts/talents/resources/product for those who feel the value in supporting those of us who kindle the musical muse as vocation, for those who value the kind of folk-pop-rock-intimate-heart musical expression I conjure, and who want to honour the particular movement of spirit which I am dedicated to listening to in my life. I know that the words and music that The Muse and this Heart  bring to me, through dream time and waking state, is of deep service and of transformative value to others. People have been telling me their experiences of inspiration, emotional resonance, and healing in what I create and how I interact with the world. This shows me that it is important to bring these songs and new recordings together in order for people to have access to these original works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Patreon is an excellent and safe automated way you can offer an ongoing monthly or per-creation amount. At this time I am making use of the per-creation option. Please browse the Rewards section on this page for further details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Great Gratitude for your interest, support and investment in this endeavour,\u003cbr\u003eGord Oaks"
