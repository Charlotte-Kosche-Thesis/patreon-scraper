    "summary": "Patreon lets you donate however much you want, be it a dollar a month, two dollars, or anything above. Even if you wanted to only donate less than a dollar a month, because every penny counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kevin, \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003eAKA\u003c/a\u003e GoldenBlackHawk on nearly everything out there; I\u0027ve been creating videos since I was about 15 years old, in 2011. I dreamed about joining a group of content-creating friends that called themselves \"The Creatures\", and 3 years later I did. At 18 years old, I moved out of my home I was born and raised in in Seattle, and began calling Denver home. Now at 20, I\u0027m moving around quite often.\u003cbr\u003eAnd though I did accomplish my \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003ebiggest goal\u003c/a\u003e, and seen my channel grow exponentially over the years, my consistency with keeping videos frequent and on a regular schedule isn\u0027t what it used to be. \u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027ve decided to come to Patreon, as a new way that you as fans, viewers and Patrons can support me in the new chapter of my \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003elife in\u003c/a\u003e Colorado, by \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003epledging\u003c/a\u003e any amount of \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003emoney to\u003c/a\u003e me for creating content! However, creating content is my job already, so why dangle the treat on a string in front of me? Well the \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003epledges\u003c/a\u003e aren\u0027t just for when I create content regularly. That\u0027s something I\u0027ll do regardless, because I love doing it. The \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003epledges\u003c/a\u003e are a way for you guys to directly support me every month and help me afford things like \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003efurniture\u003c/a\u003e, a computer for my home (not just the office!), a bed, better sound and \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003erecording equipment\u003c/a\u003e and most importantly, to help me keep the \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003eroof\u003c/a\u003e over my buddy Hox the cat and I\u0027s heads!\u00a0Patreon also allows for a more organized way for me to communicate with you \u003ca class=\"FAtxtL\"\u003ethrough the\u003c/a\u003e activity wall, so if I\u0027m not doing something right, or someone has a suggestion for me, you can let me know in a relatively direct way!"
