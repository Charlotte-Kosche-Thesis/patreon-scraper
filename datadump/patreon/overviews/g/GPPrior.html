I\u0027ve written quite a lot of fanfiction under the handle GaPJaxie, most of which you can still find\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/user/GaPJaxie\"\u003eonline\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve written modules for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/exalted/\"\u003eExalted\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shadowruntabletop.com/\"\u003eShadowrun\u003c/a\u003e, and D\u0026amp;D Pathfinder. I\u0027ve even written story and plot content for the live-action event\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dystopiarisinglarp.com/\"\u003eDystopia Rising\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote my first novel five years ago -- a fun little psychological piece about a young woman struggling with depression and drug addiction. It was pretty good! And that left me in a bind. I\u0027m doing pretty well as far as silly amateur writers go. My modules have gotten a lot of praise and I\u0027m critically recognized in most of the fandoms I\u0027m in. But a novel could be publishable. \u003cem\u003eSerious\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0writing. Did I really want to quit my day job and launch into writing full time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I found my answer: no. Because I don\u0027t want to hit the New York Time\u0027s best seller list. I just want to write things people enjoy, and know that they enjoy them, and have a good relationship with my readers and fans. Patreon lets me do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, I\u0027m here to write and have fun. And if you want to commission a custom story, read some great original content,\u00a0or just support the free content I already have online, this is the place to do it. Story commissions are available only in limited quantity, but your story will get the same love and care I\u0027ve given all my work. It\u0027s what I\u0027m here for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonated money isn\u0027t for spending on rent and food. That\u0027s what I have a day job for. 100% of donated money goes to making my stories better. That means custom cover art, physical print copies, and advertising or \"boosted posts\" on Facebook and Google.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support of my readers is what makes this hobby valuable to me. It\u0027s what makes it all worthwhile! So thank you. Really, thank you."
