I\u0027ve been sewing for over 5 years now, have been cosplaying for 3, and have become very passionate about what I do! I cosplay because I simply love the craftsmanship, problem solving, and creativity that comes with it, and plus I have made several friends and even best friends through the art of cosplay, and I strive to stay an active member of this wonderful community. Cosplay has not only become a hobby for me, but has become something that I hope to turn into a career as it\u0027s something I love to do and could never see my life without.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0With each of my completely from scratch cosplays costing anywhere from 300$-2000$, becoming a patron would allow me to create more cosplays, more content, and most importantly, would allow me to bring more of our favorite characters to life. As some of you may know, cosplay is very, VERY pricey, and Patreon will help me be able to support this hobby, but please, PLEASE, do not see this as me trying to make my already free content not free, because I will still continue to post regular content on Instagram, Facebook, Cosplay Amino, and soon Youtube, so don\u0027t worry! I don\u0027t like the idea of hiding every aspect of what I do behind a pay wall since I believe that can become very unfair to those who don\u0027t have the money to support cosplayers and artists without sacrificing their own well being, so please keep in mind that what I post here will be fairly minimal. But to still reward my patrons for supporting what I do, I will still try to make special videos giving insight as to how each of my cosplays are made, and will also give my patron\u0027s a chance to choose which prints and downloadable patterns they would like me to create for my cosplay shop which I\u0027m working on now! Thank you so much to those who already support me in what I do now, and to those who will continue to support me in the future! Stay crafty my friends. B^)\u003c/div\u003e"
