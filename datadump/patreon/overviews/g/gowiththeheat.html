    "summary": "We\u0027re just three pals who really love pastels, fast cars, living large and solving a crime or two. Since we started podcasting, we\u0027ve found the most amazing fans. They\u0027ve supported us as we\u0027ve launched a podcast without having any real knowledge on what we\u0027re doing. Its the most amazing group of people on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over a year we\u0027ve been breaking down an episode at a time of the greatest show from the 80\u0027s - the cultural phenomenon that was Miami Vice. Every week we host an podcast going through each and every episode. In each episode we cover the glitz, glamour, guest stars and the best music from the 80\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have no plans to change our main show. We\u0027ll keep publishing a show a week all about Miami Vice for free on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet, we have so, so many plans for the future. Miami Vice was just the beginning. The 80\u0027s was full of so many amazing shows and the greatest action movies ever. Since we are doing an episode at a time with Vice, we know the show will eventually come to an end. But we\u0027re not going to stop podcasting! Once we\u0027ve covered every episode of Miami Vice, we\u0027ll be moving onto a new show and giving it all the same love we\u0027ve given Vice. Some ideas we\u0027ve had so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e21 Jump Street\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCrime Story\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlien Nation\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe A-Team\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWe also have plans to do spin-off, short run podcasts. We\u0027d love to do a short show about the amazing new JCVD show coming to Amazon, Jean-Claude Van Johnson. Short run Expendables podcast? You got it. Arnie\u0027s latest movie? Yup. JCVD\u0027s newest workout system? Just try and stop us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to do this, we\u0027ll need to buy some more equipment, subscribe to new services and dedicate more time. What we would like is to have our fans support us and invest in the future of Go With The Heat and your humble podcasters."
