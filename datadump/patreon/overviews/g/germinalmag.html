    "summary": "In the aftermath of the 2016 election, many of us were feeling hurt, confused, and fearful for the state of the US and the future. Today\u2019s youth are far from immune to this pain or ignorant of the work ahead, and millennials might be feeling this with a particular force knowing that our generation will be held responsible for cleaning this mess up in a few short years. It may seem overwhelming or impossible to know where to start right now, but a publication like this aims to provide a foundation of unity among our community of children, teenagers, and young adults who all hold the same values and goals of equality and justice among everyone with whom we share this country. We may not all be writers, or experts in political science or economics, but we all live in this world and thus are MORE than qualified to have thoughts, feelings, and ideas on how to make it better for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGerminal began with three primary purposes: (1) to provide an outlet for us youngsters (namely those aged 14-30) who are trying to make sense of what\u2019s happening, who have the energy and motivation to play an active role in creating a future we can be proud of, and have a lot to say right now; (2) to become a resource for all of us in need of exposure to points of view besides our own and seeking comfort and solidarity with one another; and (3), to exist as an exercise in the kind of media that will not continue the damage done by what we\u2019ve seen on TV and online in the last year; to practice writing that is not exclusive or condescending, not destructive or aggressive, but plain and simple expression of thoughts that help you make sense of this and may help others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we published our website and first round of work in February 2017, Germinal has continued to grow with these missions in mind, and become point of international connection for young people across the world who care about the future we will all share, who care about listening to each other and working together, regardless of political affiliation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so proud of where we are, but we know this could go far if we have the right resources.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a great community of people who support artists, writers, and publications like this one, and that\u0027s why we decided to join. In an effort to create a platform for the thoughts and ideas of our generation that will reach those outside our own political party bubble, we hope Germinal\u0027s audience will reach readers all over, from every background--and so far, it has! Even though the magazine is still in its very early stages, the website has been viewed by people in over 50 different countries and published creative, insightful work from three continents (so far), and we hope this potentially global outreach will result in more diverse works from young people all around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out our page and continuing to support journalism, the arts, the media, and the millions of creative, thoughtful people who make it their job to promote these forms of expression!\u003cbr\u003e"
