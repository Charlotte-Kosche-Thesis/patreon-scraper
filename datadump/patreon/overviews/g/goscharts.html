It means so much to me that you like my work and I want to make more for you guys. Right now I\u0027m putting up a patreon just for my art. I have a ton of story ideas I want to do, but until they are more fleshed out, this patreon for be just for supporting all my artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE BE WARNED THERE IS NOT SAFE FOR WORK STUFF HERE!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a pretty big platform for supporting artists, musicians, and creators. One day, I would like to make art and comics my full time job, but as of now I have to pay my bills with an everyday job. Patreon, in my belief, would allow me to achieve that goal, or at least help me go towards it. This doesn\u0027t mean that my work will be pay to see, or that I will stop posting on websites. It just means that some behind the scene things, and a few \u003cem\u003eextra \u003c/em\u003ethings will be available for people who support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what happens if I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will get a few things, depending on tiers of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst thing that everyone gets, is my thanks. Thank you so much. It means more than anything that you\u0027re willing to support my work. To show it, I plan on doing a few things, from posting up supports names on any youtube videos that I create, behind the scenes sketches and drafts of stories or artwork. Possible PSD file downloads. I want to do patreon only live streams when I get enough patreons. I have a lot of plans and ideas, but right now I can only offer the basics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat stories are you working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current story I\u0027m working on right now is my \"Unicorn Boyfriend\"(Working Title). A monster boyfriend kind of story, you follow the lives of Shamira and Nessa, two sisters in an odd other world who find themselves the object of a Unicorn Prince\u0027s affection. This story, done in a more traditional Manga style, is a slice of life kind of story. Filled with drama, comedy and romance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have already seen my other works for \"Wendigo\" (Working Title) and \"Tribes\". These are stories I still plan on writing and illustrating, but \"Unicorn Boyfriend\" had a more set story that I\u0027ve been able to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Closing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain thank you so much for time and coming to see my patreon. Even if you can\u0027t support my work now, thank you! Being a fan of my art means the world to me. And if you\u0027d like maybe you can help me by just sharing this, or letting people know about me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, thank you so much for watching me and see you guys again, soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
