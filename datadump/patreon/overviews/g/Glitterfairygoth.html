My name is Heather, and I am the person behind GiltterFairyGoth. I have been fairly active on social media for the past several years. In those years I have really improved my skill levels in editing,\u00a0makeup, modeling, prop making, and styling, but my skills and ideas\u00a0are starting to outgrow my shoestring budget. I have a day job that pays the bills and puts food on the table, so 100% of the money pledged to me will go directly back into creating more content.\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XYdaFo5.jpg\" style=\"width: 349px;\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/kCplDAGXRUo0SzNB3\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is a brief overview of what your money would be going towards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew latex\u003c/strong\u003e- This is probably what you\u0027re most interested in, right? It is what most of you started following me for. While I am learning to make my own, I also want to continue to support the makers and artists that I have been buying from for years. Their designs are incredible, and while I may eventually be passable, I will never surpass their skill, and if I am making my own sets, I\u0027m not sure I will have time to make more than a couple new pieces a month.\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ss3D828.jpg\" style=\"width: 352px;\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/EoARmQp1jaLUPcRs1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/31hCZCk.jpg\" style=\"width: 485px;\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSet design\u003c/strong\u003e- Right now we are using bed sheets and blank swaths of fabric to block the heinous sights of my cluttered ass garage. But that is honestly getting overdone. If you scroll through 2015-16, almost all of my pictures look the same-straight solid colored backdrops.\u00a0I kind of hate it! I plan on spending $75-100 on more basic designs, and +$100 on more elaborate, month long sets. This will also help me buy new lighting, rigs for my backdrops to hang from the ceiling, and allow me to buy more uh, photogenic furniture for the rest of my house, which is full of mismatched  hand-me-downs right now. This also would include me renting out interesting hotel rooms, houses, and driving to locations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/te9clpK.jpg\" style=\"width: 484px;\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWigs and accessories\u003c/strong\u003e- A decent lace front wig is $60+ and I hate using the same wig too often, because it makes all of my pictures, well, they look the same honestly. Long wigs, short wigs, curly and straight, in every color in the rainbow! Not to mention headbands, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, hairclips, glasses, sunglasses, normie clothes to mix up in with the latex for variation. LUBE, to make the latex shiny. Seriously, the brand we use is $50 per bottle, and it lasts us through six or seven shoots. And don\u0027t even get me started on how expensive shoes are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/D9O0bOX.jpg\" style=\"width: 682px;\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProps\u003c/strong\u003e- Wings, devils  horns, tails, whips, crops, giant lollipops, toy laser guns, crowns, bouquets, fans to blow my skirt up a certain way, mirrors for me to actually see wtf I am doing while Derek is taking the pictures, staffs, Christmas trees, giant stuffed animals, faux wrapped presents, etc. You get the picture-there is a lot of stuff that goes into this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jUiSzGv.png\" style=\"width: 499px;\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/IZtNkpCwqtwW4b2X2\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMakeup\u003c/strong\u003e-Look, I am a natural beauty.

New props, new latex, new shoes, new wigs, new backdrop (that shit is surprisingly expensive), shit if I can manage it, I\u0027ll either make an extensive set to interact with, or convince a friend to help me make one. Please note I have several hard nopes. If you are concerned about my willingness to do what you want, email me before you pledge this.",

     "description": "Ive really been getting into pole fitness in the past six months and I want to start in on aerial silks and lyra soon, and it would be FUCKING INCREDIBLE if I could have an in home pole and rig. I would post near DAILY pictures and videos on them if I had these at home no joke.  a collapseable/portable pole from xpoles would run me $1k, and the adaptable indoor/outdoor rig that I want will cost me $1.5k. I will find a way to work these into photosets, don\u0027t you worry! This is honestly something that I will eventually buy without the help of patreon, but it will happen a lot sooner if someone helps",

     "description": "AirBnB nightmare house- so there is the MANSION in Indianapolis that is HUGE and insanely  ugly if  you look at it as a whole, but each individual room is actually kind of cute. But its only available to rent for a week at a time. So I want to pack up and rent it out for a week. That\u0027s right, as SOLID WEEK of nothing but latex, photography, swimming, and hanging out in a mansion with my friends, models, photographers. This shit would be costly, which is why I am planning it now. Just renting it out is going to cost $1.5k, plus I want to have new outfits, new props, and pay the photographers who come to this. It will most likely happen in June or July of 2018, when the weather is warm enough to utilize the outdoor space at the rental, but not so hot my face melts off",
