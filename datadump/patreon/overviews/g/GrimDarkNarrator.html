On Youtube I go by GrimDark Narrator, and I\u0027ve been posting content with more or less frequency since the end of 2012. I originally started my channel wishing to narrate Warhammer (both 40K and Fantasy) novels, and for a time I did just that. After a couple of years GW told me to take down 40K content so I did so and started narrating other Sci-Fi novels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike you already must have intuited, I am an avid lover of science fiction and fantasy in their many forms (movies, books, video games). If nothing else, its because of this that you can rest assured that I put a lot of love in any lore videos I\u0027m making or will make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I DO ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAbout 2 months ago, since my love for 40K lore/novels didn\u0027t diminish in the last decade, I decided to try my hand in doing lore videos since I already had some experience with audio editing. The response I got from my small community of subscribers was very positive, not to mention my channel started slowly growing once more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, I create LORE videos on the Warhammer 40k universe (for the time being). These videos cover/will cover all aspects of the settings, from Imperial History to Space Marines, Chaos Gods and Daemons. Other races/characters,etc will come in time. I have the future of my lore series planned out so you needn\u0027t worry that I\u0027ll run out of material or interest of making it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU DONATE TO MY CHANNEL ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWell, first off, you don\u0027t have to donate. All the content I make will make its way to Youtube, where you can watch it for free whenever you want. HOWEVER, with your support or donations I will be able to do a number of awesome things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eTreat producing videos more or less like a job I actually love, and work several hours EVERY day to bring you lore.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEventually get better sound recording options so my videos have better quality audio-wise.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTry delving into other fantasy or sci-fi universes and bring you lore from there as well (Warcraft, A Song of Ice and Fire, Dune, other settings that YOU might pick yourselves!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eP.S.\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon page is still in its infancy, so some changes will be made in the near future in regards to the Rewards and Incentives sections. BUT don\u0027t worry as the changes will be for the betterment of the patrons, and nothing else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP.P.S\u003cbr\u003eI make my videos 3 or 4 days in advance, so regarding the reward with patron names in the credits of my videos, please be aware it\u0027ll take that amount of time to implement. BUT it will be implemented !! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
