I\u0027m currently documenting my quest to try every game in the book \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789320908/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;camp=1789\u0026amp;creative=9325\u0026amp;creativeASIN=0789320908\u0026amp;linkCode=as2\u0026amp;tag=letspla100gam-20\u0026amp;linkId=S62PVS54FTT3XNZF\"\u003e1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\u003c/a\u003e, before I die, in an ongoing Let\u0027s Play series. From arcade hits to Commodore 64 classics, from DOS-era gems to NES treasures, from Sega Genesis to Playstation, Xbox to Atari, Gameboy to ZX Spectrum, my series explores the classic retro games that we all grew up with, have fond memories of, or heard of but never got a chance to try. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is meant to be a simple and straightforward way for inclined fans to support my series. I\u0027m not looking to make a living off my videos but if you do like watching them on a regular basis then throwing a few dollars my way each month would be a tremendous way to say thank you, and encourage me to keep doing what I\u0027m doing.\u00a0The main reward you\u0027ll get for becoming a Patron is a more exclusive space to talk and meet with me, and access to some exclusive polls from time to time to help me get feedback on what you\u0027d like to see in the series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE REAL REASON FOR THIS PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough my Patreon setup here is rather simple, it has one other important role besides your support: to provide an official space beyond YouTube where you can find and connect with me. The unfortunate reality about gaming channels on YouTube these days is they are vulnerable to takedowns and I have personally seen this fate befall some small channels that I enjoy. If a game company suddenly decides to issue a bunch of strikes, YouTube can be forced to take almost anyone\u0027s channel down, with little recourse to get it back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf my channel were to ever be taken down, Patreon here would be the first place you could come to find me, to learn what happened, and to find out where the series has moved. Of course you can always connect with me for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/gamingjay1001\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e if you prefer, and that\u0027s totally fine if that\u0027s what you\u0027d rather do. In the end whether you decide you want to support me or not, if you are a fan, all I ask is that you enjoy the videos and keep in touch! ... just in case.\u003cbr\u003e"
