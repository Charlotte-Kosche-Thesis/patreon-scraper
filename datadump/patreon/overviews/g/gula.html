    "summary": "Thanks to your support, I was able to produce 4 out of 10 of the top \u201cmost subscribed\u201d buildings on the Steam Workshop. As I continue with personal development in 2016, this Patreon page is currently in a state of flux as I may be shifting my model over to a different mode, soon. This particular section will always have the most current and up-to-date news regarding my personal endeavors for game development, which would not be possible without people like you who are reading this right now\u2026 thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DID IT GO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcellent! Shortly after finding success via Patreon, I was featured on numerous publications including Kotaku, Eurogamer, The New Yorker, Polygon and many others to mention. From there, I had a few name drops in popular YouTube video streams, like Super Bunnyhop, supporting my idea and my cause was viewed as diligent and sincere. I even got to be a part of PAX Prime\u2019s modding panel with other members from the Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive teams -- the opportunity of a lifetime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really had no clue it was going to turn out to be so successful. Later in 2015, Steam and Bethesda even caught some flak for trying to provide a method to sell mods to the community. This page was mentioned time and time again as a positive light at a time when the industry was at it\u2019s most questionable moments. I\u2019d like to think just asking for people to help out is better than demanding they do such, and for that note, I\u2019d like to keep all of my mods free. This was all part of a process to build a community around a passion project, and I\u2019d like to think that we were all successful in coming together to support a game that we love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my time creating mods for Cities: Skylines, I was able to support my living expenses as well as contribute to my total student loan amount. Though not entirely abolished, the mods definitely brought some of my student loan cost down to a manageable month amount. The goal I had originally set out for myself was to find regular full-time work, yet that day is still to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW ABOUT THE FUTURE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m considering changing the focus of this Patreon page away from personal obligations to a more culture friendly method of crowd funding. Ultimately, I\u2019d like to start producing games for the community that I know loves this genre. If and when this page changes over, I\u2019ll do my best to make sure it\u0027s as painless and respectful as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still may make some buildings in the future for you Patreon fans lovers out there, but for now, I think if I really focus on this awesome idea I have, you\u2019re going to really love what I come up with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHumble regards,\u003cbr\u003eBryan Shannon\u003c/em\u003e"
