    "summary": "Hi! My name\u0027s GalacticGlum (Shon) and I\u0027m indie game developer from the north (Canada). I am quite young but don\u0027t underestimate my talent. I\u0027ve been passionate about games since Kindergarten and I\u0027ve been programming for 6 years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on a game called Aquatic Warfare.\u00a0Aquatic Warfare is a 3D third-person arena brawler set in an underwater environment.\u00a0Aquatic Warfare is unlike many other MOBA games in that the game doesn\u0027t focus on lore or player immersion but instead on fast-paced combat. The underwater aspect of the game creates a very fun and interesting gameplay mechanic because it adds in new movement elements and physics elements not seen in a game in this genre.\u00a0The combat system in Aquatic Warfare is inspired by games such as World of Warcraft, and Smite. You will have one primary attack and three secondary attacks (spells, etc..), in addition to that you will also have 2 slots for potions or healing items. In order to attack with your primary attack you will left click and in order to attack with your chosen secondary attack you will right click (secondary attacks will be mapped on a hotbar). Since combat is fast-paced there is no targeting which means attacks are \"cast\" in your area (for example, a spell would just cast in your direction).\u00a0Aquatic Warfare will contain an in-game shop, you will earn currency through gameplay and you\u0027ll be able to use this currency to purchase weapons, spells, etc...Only cosmetic items will be purchasable through real money!\u00a0There will also be exclusive items that can only be obtained through gameplay (not the store), these items will be unlocked at different conditions (achievements, etc..).\u00a0Like many other games in this genre, Aquatic Warfare will support both singe-player and multiplayer play. In single-player the game will create bots for you to play with. In multiplayer there will be a few \"sub-options\", you\u0027ll be able to play on LAN, or online.\u00a0Aquatic Warfare is inspired by games like Smite, League of Legends, and World of Warcraft. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also developing my own game engine called Frosty Engine in my spare time. Frosty Engine is being written in (modern) C++ and will be free and open-source for all developers to use! I stream development of Frosty Engine on my twitch channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also streamer (you already knew that, although I don\u0027t need money to directly stream I can use the money from this Patreon\u00a0to further advance my setup thus improving the quality of my streams. I can also use the money from this Patreon to host video game giveaways more often this way I can give back to all my viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patreon you are supporting development of Aquatic Warfare, my game engine, and my stream! If you\u0027re interested in my content, or my software consider becoming a Patreon. Any amount would help, but if you can\u0027t that\u0027s alright as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out my GitHub by going to this link:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/GalacticGlum/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://github.com/GalacticGlum/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(ALL REWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRewards are \"delivered\" at the start of each month (the first or second week), to receive your rewards (or redeem one) you must message me through Patreon. Rewards are on a \"month-to-month\" basis and will be revoked if you cancel your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreons with declined pledges won\u0027t have access to rewards and will have 96 hours to update payment info, if payment still isn\u0027t received after the 96 hours the Patreon will be blocked from the Patreon page (contact me for special cases).\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e"
