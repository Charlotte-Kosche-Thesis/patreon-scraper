It\u2019s as simple as that! Your three hosts are Linda, Kelly and Joie, \nwho all live in the Atlanta metropolitan area and have enough collective\n gaming experience to make a single septuagenarian. Our podcast is about all types of gaming, from \ntabletop and live action gaming, to video, card and board gaming. We \nbasically do it all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, we choose the major topic for \ndiscussion by rolling a d20 and picking from a numbered list of \npossibilities depending on which number the die lands on. We know what \nthe potential topics might be before the show, but don\u0027t know what we\u2019ll\n actually be discussing until it\u2019s time to roll the dice. We also talk \nabout the games we\u2019re currently playing, whether good or bad, and an \naspect of geek culture that happens to pique our interest in a little \nsection we like to call \u201cOff Topic.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery three months, we release a multi-part actual play session of a one-shot tabletop roleplaying game. In the \nspirit of gaming \"by women, for women,\" our tables and GMs are always\nfemale, nonbinary, or\u00a0 femme-identified. We frequently focus on indie games during our play sessions, and are \nparticularly interested in spotlighting games written or produced by \nwomen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe update in a monthly format and new\n episodes are available on the first of the month on our website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.glitterdice.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eglitterdice.com\u003c/a\u003e, on \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-glitter-dice-podcast?refid=stpr\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Ie3uzoqmyha3pqmk6oi3z5nprja\"\u003eGoogle Play\u003c/a\u003e, and through \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episodes-glitter-dice-podcast/id1171201755?mt=2\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow Your Patronage Will Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many costs associated with podcasting that the average listener may not be aware of, such as website and domain renewal fees, file storage fees, and equipment costs for microphones, headphones, and audio software. At the bare minimum, your patronage assures that we will continue to have all the basics that we need to continue podcasting. It will also allow us to acquire video games, board games and card games suggested by listeners to play and review. If you\u0027re frustrated that we haven\u0027t talked about your favorite game on the show, it might be because we don\u0027t have access to it! Becoming a patron helps expand our library and allows us to sample a wider variety of games to appeal to listeners\u0027 tastes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe currently live in the Atlanta area, participate in a number of local larps, and visit many area conventions. With enough support, we\u0027ll be able to travel to other games and conventions, and potentially provide listeners with reviews or on-site recordings of our experiences. Becoming a patron would assist with travel costs and tickets to these events, ensuring a wide variety of experiences to bring back to the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we\u0027d like to do more streaming sessions, particularly live-plays of board games, and potentially expand our one-shot tabletop sessions. Your patronage would help us purchase the equipment necessary to meed these goals.\u003cbr\u003e"
