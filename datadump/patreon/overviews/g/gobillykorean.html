I love the Korean language, and I visit South Korea for at least 1 month each year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my YouTube channel in 2012 as a way to help explain some of the more difficult concepts that learners face in a more simple way. I\u2019ve also written a 3-book series for learning the Korean language called \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.koreanmadesimple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKorean Made Simple\u003c/a\u003e.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I work on other projects (and do regular life things) during the daytime, I pour all of my free time into making new videos for my channel. Most of my videos started as requests from viewers, and I\u2019ve been able to release a new video every single week since I started. These videos are free, and will always be free. However, making a video takes a really, really, really long time (and a lot of work).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to allow myself to spend more time making new videos, as well as improve the quality of future videos.

Much of the equipment I use currently is either old or cheap (or both), and I would really like to purchase some upgrades to improve the quality of my new videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach \u003cstrong\u003e$2,000\u003c/strong\u003e a month, this will allow me to spend twice as much time on the videos as I do now. I would be able to live on this amount of money and could focus more of my energy on the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a moment to check out some of the rewards on the side to see what you can get by being a supporter of \u201cGO!
