If I can raise around $2500/month I can make this a reality, if not then I\u0027ll have to return to my old career path after around 6 -12 months when my savings for this little venture runs out.

I have many big ideas I\u0027d like to do and I want to be able to work on bigger projects that I would be unable to accomplish myself and really push this anime community further, so any money I make that doesn\u0027t go towards my living costs I\u0027d like to reinvest into bigger and better content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support me on this journey I\u0027m taking then I will be eternally grateful to you, and if not then I appreciate the time you\u0027ve taken to read this anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
