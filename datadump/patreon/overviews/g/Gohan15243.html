    "summary": "To start off I want to talk about the idea of setting a tip goal. Right now I feel as though I\u0027m not making any leeway with my Xbox 360 and with how fast gaming is going I have to upgrade. My Taxes right now are a problem as I had to file an extension with my mother going into the hospital. I can\u0027t think about setting money aside to better my stream and bring content to you guys until at best September or October. I know the focus of the channel is Pokemon but to better the Variety portion of the show a new console is needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow for the tip goal in general I know I said I wouldn\u0027t have one. I still feel kind of bad about asking but I\u0027m at a point where I don\u0027t have a choice. It\u0027s either; put this out there and hope or don\u0027t put this out there and don\u0027t know. Just know you have my word that this will NOT become a focus, at best mentioned twice a night, never a focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mother going into the hospital when she did saved her life however the timing couldn\u0027t have been worse. I had to file an extension for my taxes and had to dip into that money. This means that the next few months I can\u0027t do anything to better the stream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t ignore the idea of not buying into a new console at this point. I know I\u0027ve said last gen could last but Gaming is in general moving much faster than I had hoped and Twitch is moving even faster. I have to jump on the \"Next Gen Bandwagon\" because my Xbox 360 is not going to cut it. Also my PC being able to Game but not Stream those games is also why I\u0027m going after a next gen console.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stream focus will almost always be Pokemon, however, I do want to branch into an idea of variety streaming on the side. It was something that was thought of but brushed aside that I could variety game on just the Xbox 360 but with eye-openers like Dragon Ball Xenoverse and Destiny I now know an upgrade is required. For the best results in content I need a next gen console to play along side the Xbox 360 and behind Pokemon. Pokemon for right now and the coming months will always be 5 nights a week and will range from Battling, Shiny Hunting and Wonder Trading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tip goal will of course never be a focus. There will be perks to tipping using my Patreon, that is now live, and donation links (both below). I will only mention either of them once or twice a night. If we reach the goal set then I will schedule a Karaoke night.\u003cbr\u003e"
