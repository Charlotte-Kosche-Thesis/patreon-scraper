This is here for my biggest supporters, the ones who want to come along for the journey and help me build foundations for bigger things.

The photo sets are shown here months before they are released anywhere else, and many of the sets will never be available to purchase anywhere else, likewise with prints, and you can only receive access to many of the rewards (such as the Gamer Girl) through Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I sign up at the end of the month, will I still receive the rewards for that month?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYep, you will receive the rewards of the tier you signed up for, for whatever month you signed up during, and every month thereafter if you continue to pledge. It doesn\u0027t matter if you sign up on the 1st or the 31st of a month, you will receive that month\u0027s rewards. \u003cbr\u003eNOTE-If an extra reward is offered for signing up by a particular date e.g sign up by the 15th to receive X item, then you will only receive that particular extra reward if you adhere to the terms.

I\u0027m an enormous Harry Potter fan, I\u0027ve followed Supernatural since the very first episode and my (currently only) tattoo is an homage to the show. I am a huge gamer, and my favourite genres are horror (Resident Evil and Silent Hill are my go-to\u0027s) and open world series like Fallout. I love exploring and blowing stuff up nearly as much as I love suspense-filled, heart-attack-inducing games. I\u0027m also a massive fan of the FF series but I don\u0027t have the time to play the games at the moment (I can lose days in those games). That doesn\u0027t mean there won\u0027t be cosplays from them though..\u003cbr\u003e\nI prefer savoury food to sweet and I love Doritos and dips, I\u0027d live off them if it wasn\u0027t so unhealthy. I have three dogs and a husband, and we live on the windiest hill in England (probably not actually true, but it definitely feels like it).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eGi25hC.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been featured (along with some of my work on other models) on several major websites, including CNN, and I\u0027ve been involved with designing and creating set pieces and costumes for theatre productions and TV appearances.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been featured as a model through my work, but never had the opportunity to take it full time, which is what this page is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been involved with cosplay as long as I\u0027ve been working, and it\u0027s a community I thoroughly enjoy being part of. In the past I\u0027ve been mostly behind the scenes, but I now want to be able to be the one in front of the camera, creating the content and featured in it.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn all my current work I do everything. I create the designs (I\u0027m really visual, so I sketch out all my ideas first before doing anything else). I make them, I build the concept and sets around these designs. I model. I do the photography. I\u0027m a one-woman band and I love it.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not to say that in the future I won\u0027t work with others. I sew in abundance, but I will commission other talented artists to create some amazing cosplays for me if needed. I\u0027m not proud and I know my limits. I\u0027d rather pay someone to make something fabulous for me to wear than churn out half-assed work that\u0027s not doing anyone any justice. Plus, supporting others to thrive in creativity is always a great thing, and something I\u0027d love to do more of.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Goals-A.K.A What You Can Expect From My Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\nI want to make cosplay and modelling my full time job, and be able to give you my all and my full attention.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you choose to support me on here you\u0027ll get my utmost attention. After all, for my most loyal friends (we\u0027re totes BFFs now, you do know that right?) you deserve to get the most of me!\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a patron you\u0027ll be helping me to create the best cosplays, the best photos, I\u0027ll be able to upgrade my equipment and spend more time on every aspect of my work, so you\u0027ll get tons of interaction and even more content!\u003cbr\u003e\nThe people who support me will have access to all the best bits. I will of course still be posting on social\u00a0media, so you don\u0027t have to support me in this way, but if you do..well, we\u0027re at another level now, right?\u003cbr\u003e\nI will chat with you, like your stuff, email and comment. I read everything, what you have to say is really important to me. Know that.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this private space, this little safe haven, I can spend the time to give back more. I hear every person, and can really connect and focus on you.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to know more about me then this really is the way to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\nI chat a lot when I have the platform to do it, and that\u0027s what I do here. You\u0027ll get insights into pretty much every aspect of my life. You can ask me questions that I won\u0027t answer anywhere else. We can talk about stuff that I won\u0027t discuss with anyone else. This is the place for all that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs for goals...well, I have a lot. I\u0027m ambitious. I want to produce the best content possible. I want to give you crazy cool cosplays, stuff you\u0027ve asked for and want to see. I want to be able to upgrade my equipment to allow this to happen. I want to work with some really cool photographers who know this industry inside out. I want to connect with other cosplayers on collabs. I want to do it all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo for now..\u003cbr\u003e\n*equipment upgrade. This will allow me to create better quality photo shoots and with more accuracy\u003cbr\u003e\n*I want to build a shop for prints and one-off purchases that you might want. Make suggestions. Tell me what you want to see. I want to give you what you want.\u003cbr\u003e\n*I\u0027d like to dip my toe into Twitch streaming again and do some cool hangouts. Themed cosplays for the games I\u0027m streaming? Yes please!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u7F5rAe.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
