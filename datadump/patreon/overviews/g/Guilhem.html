    "summary": "Hey everyone, and welcome on my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a freelance artist, I do mainly graphic design and web design works, but my true love is 3D art, so that\u0027s what I\u0027ll post here. As a person, however, I am a science fiction fan at heart, so the 3D art I do is of this sort for the main part and inspired by classics artists such as Frank Kelly Freas, John Schoenherr, Chris Foss or Michael Whelan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://guilhem.bedos.free.fr/ozone/images/t_sf_pi1.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"http://guilhem.bedos.free.fr/ozone/images/t_sf_col.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from this, I spend quite some time reading: novels (mainly scifi, of course, but also mainstream and detective stories), essays (on science, history and philosophy) and comic books (from all around the world). Occasionnally, I write short stories too: I\u0027ll try to make some of them translated. As for my novel, I hope I\u0027ll be able to find a publisher soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://guilhem.bedos.free.fr/ozone/images/a_at_sc1.jpg\" style=\"width: 281px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://guilhem.bedos.free.fr/ozone/images/a_at_re1.jpg\" style=\"width: 272px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOtherwise, I have a degree in industrial design (conception of mass produced objects) and also studied architecture before proceeding to CG. I had the opportunity to work on video games projects and do some modding for Unreal Tournament 2 (first place of the Make Something Unreal Contest in 2004 with the map DM-Hardcore).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://guilhem.bedos.free.fr/ozone/images/t_3d_ub1.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"http://guilhem.bedos.free.fr/ozone/images/t_3d_ub9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have this RPG video game project, called Chronicles of the Crystal Wars and now on Greenlight, whom I\u0027ll post some artworks here.
