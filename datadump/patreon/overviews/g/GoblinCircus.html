    "summary": "I set out to find faeries... and they sent me goblins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Goblins insisted we set up a circus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"How?!\" I exclaimed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Just start with what you know,\" They replied, \"We\u0027ll do the rest.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I began telling the tales of the circus. They showed me their circus acts and their histories. They began sending people my way who wanted to join the crew. They appointed me Ringleader of the Circus and put me to work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission of The Goblin Circus is to inspire creativity, wonder and connection. It is a home for all misfits and a space to create new stories together. It is a place for good people who do not fit. It is a place where playtime is sacred. It is a place where you are encouraged to dream BIG.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether you only visit for one show or stay for the rest of your life, the Circus is here to give you permission to play, to dream and to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY SUPPORT THE GOBLIN CIRCUS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Circus is only a few months old and already it is gathering momentum. It has d\u00e9buted as a storytelling show, it has been booked to go walkabout at festivals in the summer and it is encouraging people who have not been creative for years to play. Play helps us learn and grow. It helps to ease depression and heals hearts. It gives us a much needed break from the gloom of day-to-day life and allows us to take a sparkle or two back into the 9-5 when we return.\u00a0I have a crew of tangible humans on board who want to build this into something AMAZING...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND that very same day-to-day means I can\u0027t support it in growing as big as it can without income. We need funding for materials to make costumes and props, for licenses and insurance and legal paperwork, for transport to take this to the places it is needed most, for space/equipment to perform and record shows (to share with you all) and for printing the stories and artwork and CDs to raise further funds to keep going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027ll also give me an incentive to create stories consistently as I plan to post here once a week. Remember you can set a monthly budget limit on your pledge so you don\u0027t go over what you can afford if I post a little more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT YOU\u0027LL GET\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat warm fuzzy feeling that comes from supporting an artist-performer in making her dreams come true, and allowing her to support others in doing the same. And your name listed on our website as a patron of the Circus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExclusive sneak peaks and early access to recordings (audio and, soon, video), art and written pieces on the Patron only blog-posts here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus physical gifts in the post! Explore the \"Rewards\" to see what you\u0027ll get at each level of pledging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.TheGoblinCircus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out The Goblin Circus website here and join the fun!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
