Welcome to my Patreon page.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI go by the online moniker of GuitarwolfTF (or in some cases just Guitarwolf), and I like to create transformation art.\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my art at the following online galleries:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://guitarwolftf.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/guitarwolf666/\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become my Patron, you will be able to view my sketches and \nart ahead of time, and I might add some exclusive Patreon-content in the\n future!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been into transformation art since I was just a little kid. Cartoons like the 1980s Incredible Hulk really struck a chord for me, and made me ponder about the possibilities of transformation-fiction centered around people transforming into animals (to varying degrees).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I discovered the power of the internet back in 2000 or so, I was delighted to find that I wasn\u0027t the only one with these fantasies and it didn\u0027t take long before I became a regular visitor of the most common transformation-related websites and galleries at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I finished high school, I became a professional graphics designer and artist by trade, and after years of working in the DTP industry I lost my job due to personal reasons. With more spare time on my hands, it only made sense to try my hand at making some of my transformation-related art ideas a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I started uploading my TF work to the internet back in 2012, I got a relatively positive feedback and even got to draw quite a few commissions for people, which I enjoyed a lot. Fast-forward to 2017: my financial situation unfortunately has gotten more and more shake-y. By sponsoring me on Patreon, you will help me pay for food and bills, so I can do what I like doing the most: draw TF porn and put mine and other people\u0027s ideas to paper. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the rewards I set up, all Patrons will also get a look at what\u0027s to come in the form of sketches and early drafts that I will post here.\u003cbr\u003e"
