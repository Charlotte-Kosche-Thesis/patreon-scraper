    "summary": "Greetings, and welcome to the Patreon page for Greek Life Today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI, Jon Moore, make podcast episodes \u003cstrong\u003eevery week\u003c/strong\u003e because\u00a0I believe in the power of fraternities and sororities to transform the lives of young people, while solving key challenges for their local communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, this is a time of crisis for Greek letter organizations. It seems like every day there is another embarrassing, catastrophic act -- and corresponding headline -- that puts the future of our fraternity and sorority community in jeopardy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know our young leaders are constantly bombarded with movies, music and social media content that perpetuates lewd, disrespectful and dehumanizing behavior. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut where do they draw positive inspiration from? Who are their Greek Life role models? Where do they find content demonstrating exemplary behavior from high-performing members and chapters?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTelling those positive stories... that\u0027s my role. I\u0027m on a mission to elevate the fraternity and sorority community by sharing inspiring stories from chapters across North America.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this have to do with you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreek Life Today is a passion project of mine and the reality of the situation is that I spend 12+ hours making each episode. In order to devote the necessary time to this work and to expand the range of how I can serve the fraternity and sorority community, the podcast must become a reliable source of income. Now, you can sponsor the show by becoming a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003epatron of the podcast.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the hours of life energy spent on the show, there are also monetary costs: web hosting, media hosting,\u00a0wear and tear on my computer, audio equipment, audio software, and the list goes on. And that doesn\u0027t even include the costs of trying to grow the show to help more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the long run, I hope I can make a living by inspiring and teaching fraternity and sorority leaders. Until that day comes, I am asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo borrow a line from Walt Disney, \u201cWe don\u0027t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow you can help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two primary ways to make money from content. Think about your local network television compared to Netflix. Either I can grow my audience and dangle it in front of advertisers (network television model... lots of ads... the aim is to please advertisers) or I can make content that you -- my audience -- loves and you can directly support my work (netflix model... no ads... the aim is to please YOU!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ebelieve in the power of Greek Life\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e had a great undergraduate fraternity / sorority experience\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eenjoy listening to the podcast and sharing it\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efeel that what I\u0027m doing is important\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can support the show\u00a0by pledging some amount of money for each weekly episode I produce.\u00a0That means that you\u0027ll only be supporting me when I actually make something. There\u0027s skin in the game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, you will be entitled to certain perks, but the main reason you would do this is because you support the show, believe in Greek Life, and want to see the community prosper. Thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1332992\"\u003eClick here to become a patron of the podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
