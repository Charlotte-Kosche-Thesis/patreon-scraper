Show your love for your favorite podcast by donating! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasting is difficult and requires talent. Some talents are innate, and some are earned through hard work and practice.  But sometimes, a talent is traded in a bargain.  A dark, terrible bargain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJosh was a troubled young child in the 1920s. During his teenage years, he left home and wandered the American South, looking for purpose. He ended up playing piano for a seedy jazz bar, the only one in 100 miles that would hire him.  Soon enough, the owner found out about Josh\u2019s \u0027dalliance\u0027 with his beloved wife. Josh escaped with his life, but precious little else. As he walked along the dusty road to nowhere on a moonless night, he came to an intersection. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere, at the intersection, was the devil. He offered Josh Geekspective.com in exchange for his soul. Believing the devil a fool, Josh took the bargain.  Only now has he realized his mistake!  We are trying to raise enough money to buy back Josh\u0027s soul from the devil, and in the process keep Geekspective.com open for the public. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen donating, please make sure to specify which podcast(s) that you are supporting so that we can allocate your funds correctly.  Join us, and together, we can fight back the devil and save this poor wretch\u0027s soul.\u003cbr\u003e"
