Generally, my nostalgic period for gaming is from the mid-90s to early-2000s and I often cover new games that give nostalgic vibes or are a continuation in a series I love. For example, covering Civilization VI because I played Civ 2, 3, and 4 growing up, Stardew Valley for those Harvest Moon memories, or playing Tyranny because classic Western RPGs like Fallout and Neverwinter Nights were a big part of my childhood too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also always try my best to get the games modded into HD widescreen and to update the visuals and mechanics to be improved while still maintaining the original aesthetic experience that was intended by the developers, providing instructions on how to do so yourself as well. I like to imagine that the changes I make to the game would be what the developers themselves would do if they had the opportunity. This is most notable in titles such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMorrowind Overhaul\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVV-z19_VDk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNostalgiasms\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYVqUDxY6COhuiyQxA3oL9Z9vDabqFzGl\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eand the \u003cstrong\u003eAbandonware Adventures\u003c/strong\u003e series\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYVqUDxY6COiK5C-7dzoIZRAPeGJ51KcZ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals \u0026amp; Objectives\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIn the beginning I just wanted to make videos but now it\u0027s become so much more than that. Together, we can build something that doesn\u0027t really exist\u2014a nostalgic gaming community centred around all sorts of old games with a positive, for fun, attitude! Quite often, if you try jumping into an old game\u0027s community, newcomers don\u0027t always get the best of welcomes. This has led me to come up with a \u003cstrong\u003e3-point manifesto\u003c/strong\u003e for the GamerZakh channel and the Zakhcolytes community:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Showing that old games can stand the test of time!\u003c/strong\u003e Many older games are often as good and sometimes better than newer games, especially with a widescreen mod or a fan made remaster. Even if we ignore flaws due to our nostalgia, those \u2018not so good\u2019 games that are a part of who we are can still be special and interesting to look back on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Proving that video games should be about having fun!\u003c/strong\u003e Many out there would denounce a player for not playing 100% perfectly or optimally but I want to prove that it\u2019s not always about being the \u2018best\u2019. Even at high levels of play, you can mess around, do crazy things, and have your own style, whether it\u2019s in a single-player city-builder or in competitive multiplayer. They really are just video games and having fun should be the number one priority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Fostering a gaming culture of positivity and responsibility!\u003c/strong\u003e A positive gaming community is good for everyone in terms of sharing knowledge, learning skills, and grouping up to play some multiplayer games without toxicity, maybe even making some friends. We all should also be informed about the gaming industry and do proper research before buying into a new game, along with being able to talk about gaming issues calmly and open to new ideas to allow better understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome History\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrior to July 2015, I had run my channel in tandem with having a full-time job as a high school teacher. This, of course, was a time consuming and stressful undertaking. I limited my uploads to once a week but I still managed to squeeze a video out, though I had to give up much of my personal time. As the channel grew, it began to get me some attention locally and I secured a few gigs that provided some extra side income. This gave me the opportunity to quit having a full-time job by taking a massive pay cut but giving me a lot more time to focus on content creation. In case you\u0027re wondering, teaching was an amazing experience and I loved the art of being an educator, though management was another issue and I decided to grow my career on a different path for a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I provide extra access and services with the aim to move away from relying on unpredictable ads. Ad revenue on YouTube gives me approximately \u003cstrong\u003eless than\u00a00.002USD per view\u003c/strong\u003e, so it really doesn\u0027t amount to much. This also means that if you give 1USD it counts as over 500-1000 views worth of ad revenue and that\u0027s a lot of power in your hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like supporting what I do (or you use AdBlock and would prefer to contribute in another way) then Patreon is the perfect place or you can subscribe to my Twitch channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHow much time do I spend working on the channel?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepends on the type of content. A let\u0027s play episode takes around 2-5 hours to prep, record, and produce. Reviews can take anywhere between 4-6 hours, not counting the hours spent analysing the game. Special content like my Civilization VI videos take around 12-14 hours each to produce and things like my 24 Upcoming City-building Games video takes around 24-32 hours to complete, including research,\u00a0music selection,\u00a0script writing, resource\u00a0collection, animation,\u00a0vocal recording, editing, sound design,\u00a0and refining. I also spend about 5-6 hours live streaming every week. I also am constantly in tune with gaming media on Twitter to keep myself up to date and informed along with responding to comments on YouTube and Discord as part of my daily routine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eAny associations or possible biases in my work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel has grown to a stage where games are occasionally provided for free or I am sent a review copy. If this is true, I will say so at the beginning of the video and at the top of the video\u0027s description.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a referral link for Humble Bundle where if you use that link and buy something, I get a cut of the earnings at no extra cost to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have many strong connections in the gaming world but I have had a prior partnership with Mortal Moments, the developers of Salem the Crafting MMO and I have received money from Mortal Moments in the past, though this is no longer active.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also been sponsored by LiquidSky. They run cloud computing tech that I\u0027ve been interested in and they sponsored a handful of videos on my YouTube channel in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eShould you give me money?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help me achieve total independence to focus 100% on the channel and community then you could sign up for a reward tier, to which I would be honoured and grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am NOT locking any gaming video content behind any kind of paywall though becoming a supporter here will give you access to the #subhub channel on discord and access to behind-the-scenes posts here on Patreon. \u0027Early access\u0027 to some of my videos are in the form of my Twitch archive for Twitch subs at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://http://www.twitch.tv/GamerZakh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitch.tv/GamerZakh\u003c/a\u003e.

All my successful streams end up on YouTube in higher quality as a \u0027definitive edition\u0027 eventually but the Twitch archive has the video unedited as soon as I\u0027m done streaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already respond to almost every comment on my videos and you could also message me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/GamerZakh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/GamerZakh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.discord.gg/GamerZakh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscord\u003c/a\u003e if you would like some interaction with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, if you have come to this page and spent time reading, I sincerely thank you for even considering supporting the channel.
