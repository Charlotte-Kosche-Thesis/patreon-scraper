    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGames Done Wrongish\u003c/strong\u003e is a Youtube content creator focusing on video games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be mainly concentrating on Microsofts Xbox Games with\nGold and Sonys Playstation Plus Services. I do not own a Playstation VR, Vita\nor Playstation 3 so the Playstation Plus section will be limited to the\nstandard Playstation 4 compatible games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main idea behind this content is to give\ngamers with limited time a glimpse at the games on offer from the services\nmentioned. I know full well that with the amount of games available these days\nit is not easy to play and try them all. Therefore I hope I can help you decide\nwhich games are worth the time investment to download and play and which should\nbe left alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would like to state that I am not the best gamer around, far\nfrom it. Which is why the channel is named Games Done Wrongish. I will get a\nlot of things wrong when playing certain games, if not all. But I will try to\nhave fun with each and every game available through these platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I started the channel back in September last year the\ngoals required to become a YouTube partner were pretty simple. Upload some\ncontent get a few hundred views and there you go. However a week or 2 in all\nthat changed. YouTube changed their requirements and now instead of a few\nhundred views your channel needed 10,000 views. I was ok with that. I was just\nstarting out and figured it would give me time to build up my channel and its\nviewers. Give me some time to learn and grow in the meantime. As such I was\nsteadily attracting around 1,000 views per month. With around 10-15 subscribers\non average each month. This was a steady pace. Nothing amazing but good enough\nas a start and not too crazy so I was able to breath and learn. It was nice. I\nfigured in 10 months to a year I would reach partner status and by that time I\nwould have a clear vision on where I wanted to go with the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy main content has been centred around the Playstation Plus\ninstant game collection and Xbox Games with Gold services. This allowed me to\nmake 3 videos a month from the free games we got from these subscription\nservices. It gave me time to play, record and edit them with no real pressure.\nA couple of days ago however YouTube or Google decided to make even more\nchanges to the program. Instead of simply striving to reach a 10,000 view goal you\nnow need to have viewers watching 4,000 hours\u2019 worth of content on your channel\nin the past year and have 1000 subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso as you may note from their official statement in order\nto be able to link your crowdfunding site or merchandise you already have to be\na YouTube partner. So it is very hard to try and use Patreon for instance to\nget started instead as you cannot properly promote that with these\nrestrictions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor someone like me that makes videos that are often less\nthan 10 minutes long I would need 10\u2019s of thousands of people watching them\nfrom start to finish to get anywhere near that. Also I would need a much bigger\nsubscriber count. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs such what am I going to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, 3 small videos a month is not going to achieve those\nnumbers for me not any time soon. So as YouTube are basically telling us to go\nbig or go home. I need to increase the content I provide here. This means I will\nbe extending the channel to include pretty much everything and anything I do in\nthe gaming world. If I decide I want to play through a single player game in my\nspare time. I will stream it in 2-3 hour sections. I will then download that\nstream and upload it to YouTube as a lets play / play through video. I will\nmake a playlist for each game and try to have the whole game up in the playlist\nas I proceed through it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also play online PC games now and then such as\nWorld of Warcraft. As such when I do a mythic dungeon or raid I may record the\ncontent and use it as a quick dungeon guide or just something to talk over\nwhile I rant about something. Which brings me on to another idea. I will also\ncreate the odd thinking out loud video. In these videos I will have some random\ngameplay going on whilst I talk about what I am currently doing or thinking\nabout in the gaming / YouTube world. This could be anything from planned YouTube\ncontent coming up to how I feel about loot boxes and micro transactions in\ngames. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will not be a set schedule to any of this. I will just create and\nupload as much content as I can going forward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
