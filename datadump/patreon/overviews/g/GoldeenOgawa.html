Maybe you got here because we met at a con, or we\u0027ve been friends for ages, or you followed the trail of owls in silly hats all the way to my door. Well, Patreon page. Anyway. Now you\u0027re here, welcome! Firstly, I want to state clearly what this page is not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHIS IS NOT WHERE YOU BUY MY BOOKS/ARTWORK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, I\u0027m an author and an illustrator. Yes, I sell my work online through a variety of outlets, handily collated on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.heliopauseweb.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHeliopause Productions\u003c/a\u003e website. Please, if you\u0027d like to make a one-time donation to help me keep producing stories and artwork, go forth and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://heliopauseweb.com/fiction/\"\u003ebuy my books\u003c/a\u003e! If you want to drop a lot of cash, consider\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/artwork/\"\u003ecommissioning me\u003c/a\u003e or *gasp*\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/artwork/art-for-sale/\"\u003epurchasing a piece of original artwork\u003c/a\u003e! Those are all straightforward business transactions which substantially support me in my Quest to Change the World for the Better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you already have too many books or no wall space or maybe you just want to see me do more\u2026 well\u2026 \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e\u2026 then this place is for you! But make no mistake, I appreciate every single one of my fans and patrons, and I intend to show it! Just understand that by supporting my Patreon you\u0027re not \u003cem\u003epurchasing\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0anything. In fact, most of these rewards \u003cem\u003ecannot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be bought. Not for love or money. (Well, maybe love\u2026) So have a look to the sidebar on the right, and pick the tier that best fits your wants (and financial situation).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile you consider your options, here\u0027s an overview of the endeavor you\u0027re supporting\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RidingAndTheWolfCoverCropped.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest be said, I create stories. My mediums include imagery and prose, words and watercolors, ink, pen, and pencil. Many of my stories have peripheral illustrations, and many of my paintings have stories behind them. My favorite playground is speculative fiction: fantasy and colorful science fiction. I\u0027ve written about multi-dimensional travelers, ghosts, magicians, dragons, exoplanets, robots, and very large trucks. There are a lot of women in my stories, because I am a woman and I feel our absence in the genre keenly. There\u0027s also a fair number of men, but I try to make them real people and not prescriptive caricatures. There\u0027s also a defiant amount of characters who are not men or women, because people like that exist also\u2014especially in fantastic places. My calling is to create artwork (and I consider books to be pieces of art) that inspires and transports and can act as a shield (or a sword) for those of us in difficult places where conventional weaponry can only go so far. At the very least, I hope my worlds offer a respite for tired minds, where they may recover for a while, before returning to our own troublesome storyline stronger and better for their sojourn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Book1Cover.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisually I look at illustrations as portals. Windows into another world. I use my paintings to help transport my audience. I like drawing things that look real but do not exist in our world. I like faithfully rendering real things, but heightening the wonder. Focusing on the magic. I like using images sequentially to tell a story. One of my dreams is this Patreon may one day allow me to return to the practice of creating comics and graphic novels, that medium which so perfectly transmutes words and pictures into completely different and powerful language.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/01FarSea.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards offered on this Patreon are, like I said, not things you can buy, by and large. What they are are additional portals, extra, hidden routes into the worlds I am creating. By backing this Patreon, not only will you be supporting my life\u0027s calling, but it is my hope you\u0027ll gain a greater insight into my work and my creative spirit that will enhance the experience of reading and viewing my commercially available work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat follows is a detailed explanation of rewards and when/how they are delivered, which should hopefully clear up any lingering questions. But if it fails for any reason, do not hesitate to leave a comment and I will get back to you as fast as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GrimbyGrat.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting at $1 a month you get access to the \u003cstrong\u003eGrimby\u0027s Gratitude\u003c/strong\u003e e-newsletter, which will be delivered electronically in the first week of every month via Patreon message and later posted to my page. Print copies will be sent out at the same time to \u003cstrong\u003eStar Walker\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eMother Chaos\u003c/strong\u003e patrons along with their relevant gifts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe contents of each issue will vary! There could be recaps of any interesting events from the previous months, essays or cleaned-up twitterstorms, accounts of my around-town adventures\u2014maybe recipes, poems, even pieces of flash fiction. And you might be the first to know about exciting new projects I\u0027m tackling and insights into my writing and drawing process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SparksGal.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $5 a month you gain access to the \u003cstrong\u003eSparks Gallery\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003eShort Spells Library\u003c/strong\u003e. The \u003cstrong\u003eGallery\u003c/strong\u003e will consist of rare glimpses into my personal sketch journal, which is filled with concept designs, notes, character sketches, brush pen practice, and more! Though I\u0027ve tweeted some of its content before, the majority of it has never been posted online\u2014or even properly scanned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eShort Spells Library\u003c/strong\u003e consists of similarly rare short stories that are otherwise difficult to find in the wider world\u2014and perhaps some that have never before been published!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth the \u003cstrong\u003eSparks Gallery\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003eShort Spells Library\u003c/strong\u003e will be a series of tagged posts available for patrons at the \u003cstrong\u003eSupporting Magician \u003c/strong\u003etier or \u003cstrong\u003ehigher. \u003c/strong\u003ePatrons will also be notified via email when either is updated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Valdellunians.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $10 a month you gain access to the \u003cstrong\u003eValdelluna Archive\u003c/strong\u003e. Valdelluna is a narrative illustration project that I stumbled into at the end of 2009, and formally began in 2014 when I acquired a Magical Book from a dear friend. The Archive aims to preserve these drawings, many of which have never been posted online before, and offer a comprehensive guide to the fascinating, magical place of Valedelluna. And, in an effort to actually finish the book, I\u0027m going to add a new drawing for every patron who backs at this level\u2014up to one new drawing per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eValdelluna Archive\u003c/strong\u003e will be available as a series of tagged posts for anyone who backs at the \u003cstrong\u003eValdellunian \u003c/strong\u003etier or\u003cstrong\u003e higher\u003c/strong\u003e. As always, notifications of updates will be sent to qualifying parties out as they occur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso at the Valdellunian level\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027ll get a copy of \u003cstrong\u003eevery eBook I publish during the month your pledge is current\u003c/strong\u003e. Now, most months this will be zero books, but some months there might be as many as three, or four! Additionally, new Valdellunians will receive a thank-you eBook after their first pledge goes through. Otherwise \u003cstrong\u003eeBooks\u003c/strong\u003e will be delivered as attachments via email \u003cstrong\u003eas they become available\u003c/strong\u003e and will \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e be posted to the Patreon blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PrintandBookplates.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, a slight (haha) jump. If you pledge $100 a month not only do you get everything in the first three tiers, but also: a \u003cstrong\u003eprint copy of Grimby\u0027s Gratitude\u003c/strong\u003e, snail-mailed to you along with \u003cstrong\u003etwo signed bookplates\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ea signed print\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eYou \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e get \u003cstrong\u003eone print copy of every new book I publish during the month your pledge is current\u003c/strong\u003e. Again, most months the number of books I publish is zero, but some months there\u0027s as many as three! And new \u003cstrong\u003eStar Walker\u003c/strong\u003e patrons will receive one print book of novel-length when their first pledge goes through.\u003cbr\u003eIn all cases, books are shipped direct from the printer so they will arrive unsigned, but you will receive extra signed bookplates with your newsletter equal to the number of books you are getting. \u003cstrong\u003ePrint books will be shipped out in the first week of every month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OriginalandCard.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $500 a month, in addition to all other previous rewards, I will also send you \u003cstrong\u003ean original piece of art\u003c/strong\u003e. Artwork will be entirely up to me, and will probably be quite small, so you don\u0027t have to worry about running out of space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMothers Chaos\u003c/strong\u003e will \u003cstrong\u003ealso receive\u003c/strong\u003e a \u003cstrong\u003ehand-lettered Encouragement Card\u003c/strong\u003e. These will be 3\"x4\" pieces of cardstock with some encouraging words prettily inscribed upon them, handy for sticking in places where you need some cheer.

So, yes, I have a $1,000 a month tier. \u003cstrong\u003eI do not expect anyone to back at this level for the material rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e You just want me to focus on creating more books and art. You also probably have more money than time and/or wall space, so in the interest of not wasting anything, \u003cstrong\u003eAlbatrosses\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ewill not receive any of the previously mentioned physical rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e They\u0027ll still get the eBook emails, the Gallery, the Library, and the Valdelluna Archive, and the e-Newsletter, but that\u0027s it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat one gets for backing at the \u003cstrong\u003eAlbatross\u003c/strong\u003e level is this: a single origami classic crane, folded from a page of a proof book. These are the copies I order for myself and which usually contain errors to a greater or lesser extent. They might as well be recycled for all they\u0027re worth once the final is approved, but in their moment they are as valuable as\u2026 well, as a thousand bucks a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve met me you know I like folding origami and will literally do it at the drop of a hat. But these particular cranes will only be folded for Albatross-level patrons, and each one will be personalized, signed, and dated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCranes will be mailed out to Albatross patrons each month when their pledges go through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you decide you\u0027re not in a position to safely render support at this time, thank you for reading, and I hope your future journey is pleasantly exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eGoldeen Ogawa\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.goldeenogawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Dev-DatC-pen-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
