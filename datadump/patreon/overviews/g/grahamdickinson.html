    "summary": "Hi Everyone! Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this is your first time here, please take a minute to listen to Jack Conte (Patreon\u0027s awesome creator) describe what Patreon is and how it works (It only takes 1 minute).\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis past year has been exceptional for me and I want to make 2016 \neven better with bigger projects, bigger videos, pretty much bigger everything in general. We (me and my crazy friends) would love your support and want\n you on our special team. I want our projects to be insane and inspiring; I want our videos to be so thrilling you can\u0027t help but to watch over and over again. I want to capture and inspire you and others in \nsame way I was when I first discovered BASE jumping. I want to bring on a few people to help me tell my story and capture the nitty-gritty behind the scenes action of what it really is to be a BASE jumper and how I do what I do. I am stoked to be able to share what I love with you. I have a strong passion for \nhuman flight and am constantly striving to further the boundaries of \nwhat is currently thought possible. The wingsuit BASE environment is \nwhere I thrive; it\u0027s where I feel alive and it\u0027s where I feel at home. \nMy goal in what I do is to not only share the experience and beauty of \nflight but also to inspire and encourage you to chase your dreams and \ntackle your challenges head on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here on Patreon to ask for YOU for your support as my sponsor and encourage YOU to become a part of my team (don\u0027t worry you will be rewarded!). My \nvideos, photos and stories that you\u0027ve already grown to love and enjoy will still always be available for viewing online for free because  I \nfeel that putting your content out there for free is generally a good\n thing. I believe in collaboration and the sharing of information; I \nbelieve in teamwork and this is where you and Patreon come into play.  \nPatreon is the perfect way for you, my fans, to become more involved in \nwhat I do. We should get to know each other a bit better. I want to build more \nintimate connections with everyone and everyone, no matter what you pledge, will play a \nrole in my journey.  Whether it is simply pledging $2 because you \nlove and appreciate what I do or pledging 100$ because you think what I do is really special-no matter the contribution-big or small I am truly grateful for your support as my fan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider joining us as a patron on this special journey. We will \nonly be releasing 1-2 videos a month and you can set a monthly\n max so what ever you pledge you never go over your budget. We are also\n offering some pretty cool, Patreon exclusive rewards on the side in \nreturn for your much appreciated support. If you have any tips on\n more rewards you want to see please let us know; we love feedback!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so excited for this, so come join my team! LETS DO THIS!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
