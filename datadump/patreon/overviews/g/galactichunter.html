    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Adam and I\u0027ve been writing about Star Wars toys and action figures online since 1995.  I\u0027ve also written for magazines, for other toy lines, and have generally spent a lot of time researching things and answering questions as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor most of this time, I\u0027ve been able to host my stuff cheaply or free - but in early 2017 the keys to the GalacticHunter.com and 16bit.com servers were handed over to me, as well as the bills.  The sites don\u0027t have a lot of advertising, and server hosting and domain renewals don\u0027t come free.  As such, I need your help - I\u0027ll continue to provide hours of work every night so you have something to read, and all you need to do is help me pay for somewhere to put it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor most of the past two decades, I\u0027ve delivered new stuff almost every week.  Right now, if we keep the server on, you\u0027ll get at least 5 action figure reviews at 16bit.com and Star Wars Q\u0026amp;A at GalacticHunter.com every week - so every weekday morning when you show up at work you\u0027ll have something new to read, even if it\u0027s a holiday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we go, I\u0027ll try to come up with more stuff for you guys - but for now, we just need to keep the server lights on.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u0027m not asking for you to pay for the toys or the research, but it would be fantastic if we could get some help covering the servers that let me post the articles and keep my domain names running.\u00a0\u00a0 But hey, if you want to go over the monthly hosting fees, I\u0027ll gladly take it to cover the site\u0027s other expenses like convention coverage.\u003cbr\u003e"
