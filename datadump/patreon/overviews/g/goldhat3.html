    "summary": "I have been putting free guitar lessons up on the goldhat3 YouTube channel\u00a0since\u00a0YouTube was just a couple guys in the basement back in 2006. Why do I do it? Well,\u00a0mostly so I can remember the songs myself! But I soon discovered that lots of other guitar players like to learn them from me too, so I keep putting them up there. There are already over 100 guitar lessons up there for the music I like including The Beatles, Simon \u0026amp; Garfunkel, John Denver, James Taylor, Gordon Lightfoot, and other acoustic guitar songs from the 60\u0027s an 70\u0027s, and some more modern tunes too. Anything that catches my ear with a nice acoustic guitar part might wind up on there. Lately I have also been putting up lessons for Contemporary Christian songs that I learn while playing with my church band. So now all you YouTube subscribers can become patrons of mine by making your pledges here on Patreon. It won\u0027t cost you much, but it will allow you to show your support for the effort if you are so inclined. I don\u0027t make a lot of videos, just\u00a0when I have time, but I hope you will find them to be worth the effort and your time. I recently upgraded all my video equipment and computer and sound system so I can\u00a0make HD videos, so your\u00a0pledges would help me cover some of those expenses.\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to creating more guitar lesson videos for all of you. Thanks for your support, and have fun with that one!\u003cbr\u003eBest regards,\u003cbr\u003eMark Easley\u003cbr\u003eGoldhat3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
