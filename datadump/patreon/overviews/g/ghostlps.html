CHARGES SHOULD RESUME IN JUNE.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowdy folks, my name is Gene (GHostLPs on YouTube) and I record Let\u0027s Plays for the denizens of the internet.\nI\u0027ve been partaking in this as a hobby since 2009; in the span of time between now and then, I\u0027ve refined my skills at recording, editing, and producing video game-related videos a good deal. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough all this time I\u0027ve considered LPing to be nothing more than a passing hobby. However, recently, I\u0027ve been thinking that I would like to make it something more than that. To do that, I\u0027m reaching out to my viewership to give me a helping hand in reaching the next level of video output.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT MY CONTENT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI record and produce Let\u0027s Plays. A Let\u0027s Play (LP) is video of a person playing through a video game from start to finish with the express goal of providing entertainment or instruction to their viewers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy regular LPs update three times a week (M/W/F) with a typical episode running between twenty and thirty minutes long. My content is generally what I would consider\n PG-13 (leaning R) in nature, mostly due to my having something of a potty mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAbove all else I value the thoughts of my viewership and I try my best to go out of my way to engage them at every opportunity. Whenever applicable I incorporate pertinent viewer comments into my videos; most often when my viewership notices something I don\u0027t and offer me assistance in play. Due to this style of community engagement, I tend to record videos at most a day before they are posted to YouTube for viewing. This has both a positive and a negative side effect. The positive side effect is that I can engage my viewers and incorporate their comments into my LPs. The negative side effect is that when \n\u003cem\u003eReal Life\u003c/em\u003e\u2122 throws a curve ball at me there are typically video delays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI tend towards informative, (generally) intelligent, commentary where it\n is appropriate and typically ramble about random game-related things, \nor make terrible jokes, when it\u0027s not. My videos are aimed at people \nlooking to have a good time, laugh, and possibly learning something new \nwhile watching someone play through a game that they may or may not be \nfamiliar with.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve decided to turn to Patreon as a method for my more dedicated viewers to show their support towards my channel and the content I produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S IN IT FOR YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAside from the warm fuzzy feelings you\u0027ll get from supporting someone with a genuine passion for the hobby, you\u0027ll also be directly influencing the quality of my videos! All support I receive on Patreon goes towards increasing the production qualities of the content that I produce. Not only that, but it also goes towards new games for me to play, new hardware for me to record with, new editing software, and a generally better experience for everyone watching. One of my primary goals of this Patreon campaign is to produce content that will be enjoyed by my entire viewer base.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE GATED CONTENT PROMISE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, I want to be completely clear that I hold a stance that \n\u003cstrong\u003ethere will be absolutely no gated content created only for Patreon supporters\u003c/strong\u003e. Those who support me here will be doing so to the benefit of my viewership at large.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRESOURCES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d like to find out a bit more about me you can check out:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ghostlps\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMy YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e which houses all of the content that I\u0027ve produced over the years.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ghostlps.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMy website\u003c/a\u003e where I publish various blog posts pertaining to things of interest to me \n(LPing, game development, and so on).\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghostlps\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMy Twitter account\u003c/a\u003e where you\u0027ll find me rambling about various things.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for checking out my Patreon campaign, until next time!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Gene"
