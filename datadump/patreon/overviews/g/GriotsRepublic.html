    "summary": "Griots Republic (GR) is a non-profit brand for urban travelers and adventurers offering a digital monthly magazine. The digital magazine, which is the face of the brand, offers both original and curated content about travel and active lifestyles. We seek to appeal to a niche market of travelers by covering the subjects that matter to them and presenting it in a voice they recognize.\u003cbr\u003eThese subjects include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDocumentary style video vignettes featuring the travel stories of\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eselected travelers and adventures\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUrban editorial content\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTravel news and reviews\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCutting edge trends in the world of travel\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTravel lifestyle content (Music, Food, Sights, Events, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCurated travel photography\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since launching in January of 2016, we have accumulated more than 10,000 readers by utilizing free resources and our own skills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy chance and travel, four strangers came together and connected on a group trip to the picturesque\u003cbr\u003eisland of Samoa during the late summer of 2014. Throughout the duration of the trip, conversations of wanderlust and entrepreneurship were shared. From Samoa to Jamaica to India and Sri Lanka, the conversation kept evolving and here in lies the result.\u003cbr\u003eIt has been\u00a0hyped as being the \"Urban\u003cbr\u003eNational Geographic.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Goal\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to archive and present the first person accounts of urban travelers who\u0027ve used their travels to further their craft and to effect the lives of those around them. Through our media and retail\u003cbr\u003eorganizations, as well as our personal and corporate service projects, we endeavor to practice collective economics and create community in a manner that manifests positively for those we touch.\u003cbr\u003eOpportunities and inspiration abound and as Griots Republic we want to shed light on them, for we know that \u0027Where there\u2019s travel, there\u2019s a story.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your monthly support, we can continue to provide great content every month!\u003cbr\u003ePutting together an editorial calendar for an issue of Griots Republic is a lot like throwing a dart for the first time. You start off answering the question \"what do we want to talk about?\" and then you throw the dart and make a lot of broad shots and misses. Then you start to narrow your focus and eventually you strike center with a balanced and interesting issue. Planning a destination issue, however, is even more difficult. \u003cbr\u003eEven though we have done 12 destination issues so far, travelers, and researchers, we want to do everything and talk to everyone as soon as we de-plane, but with limited time, funds and writers, this is challenging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003eNeed help with setting up your account? don\u0027t hesitate to email us at rodney@griotsrepublic.com\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
