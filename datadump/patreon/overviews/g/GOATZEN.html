    "summary": "I\u0027ve spent years in 4H and FFA, where I specialized in goat husbandry, and learned about responsibility as well as the value of hard work, This is exactly what Goat Zen is about: hard work, responsibility, and learning to work with others while remaining true to yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you wear these ties or any other piece of our clothing, you shouldn\u0027t wear them just because they look badass (which they do) you should wear them because they encapsulate what YOU are about. Remember: horses are always bored; cows are always paranoid; and chickens I don\u0027t think I even need to explain... but goats, GOATS KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial goal with this Patreon project is to produce six custom, high-quality, holiday-themed ties over the next year, after which I hope to expand the Goat Zen brand into other types of clothing. We\u0027ve added a couple of additional reward levels for patrons who may not have a need for ties but want to be supportive of the project. I hope you\u0027ll join us in making some really cool ties become a reality this year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNathaniel Owen, President, Goat Zen Fine Apparel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jamesaowen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GoatZenLogoFinal.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
