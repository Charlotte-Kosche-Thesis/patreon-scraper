The tutorials range in difficulty from beginner to more advanced, and the topics that I cover are fresh and fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of this campaign I have been able to produce high quality tutorials based on your feedback. In fact, I just released the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gamegrind.io/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew site\u003c/a\u003e where any GameGrind viewer can get assistance from myself and the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PfBjefT.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLearn to Make Games\u003c/h3\u003eThroughout the courses on the channel you\u0027ll learn beginner C# that will lead you to create your first game in the Simple Game series. After that, you\u0027ll learn how to create awesome inventory systems, an options menu, and even a Simple RPG (still in progress!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/a/L0tfb\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NHMV8gC.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSprinkled within the courses you\u0027ll find one-off tutorials where we look at damage pop-up texts, progress bars, and more.
