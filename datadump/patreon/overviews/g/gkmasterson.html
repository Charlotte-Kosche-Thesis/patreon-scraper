    "summary": "I\u0027ve been writing ever since I could wrap my fist around a crayon and making up stories ever since I could string together words into semi-coherent sentences. So...this is kind of a life-time habit for me. I\u0027ve written four novels (and a children\u0027s book) to date. Two have been published through Rooster and Pig, one I independently published and the last is with the editor right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also written numerous short stories -- some of which were published in various literary magazines when I was in high school and college. Others were just posted to different websites but were always fairly well-received. I\u0027ve done both stand-alone one-off short stories and epic-cyclical serial stories (Alayne\u0027s Story and Adrift). I stumbled onto Patreon when I started supporting the very awesome \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/331erock\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEric Calderone\u003c/a\u003e and he and a few of his followers have been after me to get my own thing going so...here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m constantly getting requests to put my short stories together or to distribute them or give people a chance to do more than just buy one novel or collection a few times a year. I figured I\u0027d give Patreon a shot and use it to publish short stories, novellas, serials, and other works of various formats as well as giving my die-hard fans a chance to see behind the scenes a bit in my novel-writing and creative processes. After all, nothing ventured, nothing gained, \u003cem\u003en\u0027est-ce pas\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e"

After Lanar\u0027ya Three is finished, I have a general fiction novel in the works and a sci-fi series I\u0027m outlining.
