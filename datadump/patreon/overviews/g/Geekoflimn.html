I love drawing and have loved it ever since I was a little girl. Often I would draw dragons, animals, and Sonic characters which I still do to this day funnily enough. Point is though I really love drawing it is my passion I can do it all day and night and still love it the same. That\u0027s why I am trying to make a living off of it with this Patreon. With help from my Patreon, I can perhaps have that life I want to live by being able to draw while also having a way to feed my family and pay my bills. However, my Patreon\u00a0is a bit different instead\u00a0of having different\u00a0rewards per teir\u00a0with the higher amount getting more, I have decided that all teirs\u00a0get you the same thing. I did this because I want people who genuinely want to support me and help me succeed and not people who are just in it for the rewards. I want everyone to feel appreciated\u00a0in the same way no matter how much they give me because it truly does mean alot\u00a0to me. Even a one dollar donation is a huge help it getting me to my goals to doing this for a living and it truly gives me the drive to keep going.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf your interested\u00a0please check out the tiers and consider donating and if not, no hard feelings \u0026amp; \u003cem\u003eThank you for reading\u003c/em\u003e"
