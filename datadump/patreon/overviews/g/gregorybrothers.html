For 9 years, we have been trying to transform the entire universe into a song at a rate that is sadly slower than the universe is expanding at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/schmoyoho\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyoutube.com/schmoyoho\u003c/a\u003e. We\u0027ve songified politics, viral videos, movies, and then just made whatever\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlP9aJnzyZw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eother weird videos we wanted to make\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Along the way, we hope we have made you giggle, gasp in surprise, or cry cathartic tears.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have been so lucky to have you as fans. More than anything, we appreciate you just for having watched our videos, and hopefully not having written too many mean comments on them, unless, in that specific instance, we really deserved them. Our Patreon is for those uber-fans that would like to support our first channel videos at /schmoyoho a little more as we continue our quest to Songify the known universe. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve kept most of our rewards cheap and simple for now. And, with almost every level, you\u0027ll get all of the new music we ever put out (with very occasional exceptions for legal reasons), which is something that has previously never even been possible. We figure you should save the rest of your money for a Christmas present for your mom anyway, unless your Christmas present to her is going to be our songs, in which case you should pledge twice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"But Schmoyoho, what do you do with our money???\" you ask. An excellent question. Your support helps us pay for the batteries that sustain our microphones, the coffee that sustains us, and allows us to pay people who are more talented than us to help with things like cinematography and visual effects on some of our more ambitious videos. More than anything, support from our fans gives us the creative freedom to work on the things that we want to make, stuff that we think you will like, without having to worry about what networks or algorithms or sponsors think. We know not everyone can afford to give us money every month, and that\u0027s fine! The best thing you can do is still just watch all our videos and then tell every single person you know about them. \n\u003cbr\u003e"
