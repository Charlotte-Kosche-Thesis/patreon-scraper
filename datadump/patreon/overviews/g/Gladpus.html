I have a Bachelor\u0027s degree in Interactive Media - Games, and am working on a Master\u0027s in Multimedia and E-Teaching (expect to be done in 2019). I have a wife and a cat, and soon I shall be embarking on my next adventure!

The stream has been an extremely positive influence on my motivation, and a positive boost to my mental health. It\u00a0helps me focus on the things I love; developing and sharing knowledge. I don\u0027t want to be a full time streamer, as I think that would take the joy out of it for me, but I would love to be a full time creative professional. The stream allows me to share my process with you all, and I love your input and feedback through the stream, so I hope to always continue to do that!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWow, you\u0027re still reading?

Well, sometimes I\u0027m not able to stream, and I really want to be able to talk to more of you, when I\u0027m doing not-stream stuff. I want to be able to share my project files as inspiration for your own projects, most of all I want a good way to give something back to those of you who are with me on this adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eAt the end of each month I put any project files I\u0027ve been working on into a drop-box folder, and share the link in discord. If you\u0027ve selected a doodle reward I\u0027ll ask you for a subject for the doodle, and draw it during or at the end of the month, Usually streaming all or part of the process. I usually do research off stream, so I can spend most of the stream actually drawing. As a base I use 30 min on the actual drawing, +30 min extra per $5 up to 3 hours max (or I\u0027ll have no time for anything else!), you can also choose to have the doodle shipped to you. The doodle tiers are limited due to the time it takes me to do them around my other commitments.\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo prevent discord from becoming extra work, I made The Catbasket available to patrons only.
