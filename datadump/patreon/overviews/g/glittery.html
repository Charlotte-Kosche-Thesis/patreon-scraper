    "summary": "Hi! My name is Xandir. I\u0027m a 23 year old genderqueer weirdo living in Oakland, California. I\u0027ve struggled for the past several years to make ends meet and be financially stable and because of that my art and writing projects have taken a back seat to just being able to survive. I have really had to hustle. I\u0027d love to be able to focus more of my time and effort onto making zines, games, and other neat artsy stuff and less time worrying about where my next meal is going to come from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what kind of things can you expect from my work? I make both fiction and non-fiction works. Some of what I do is very personal and somewhat confessional, talking about mental health, chronic pain, surviving various forms of abuse, love and relationships, stuff like that.\u00a0 Other stuff I do is whimisical, silly, sexy, and weird, stuff about magic, highschool crushes, and mythical creatures. Some of my other work is political, talking about sex workers rights, fat positivity, trans bodies, privilege, and other social justice issues. If you want to get an idea of what kinds of stuff I\u0027ll be talking about, or you just want to say hi, check out my \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GlitteryAnimal\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings I\u0027ve done, am working on, and plan on making\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011 a story I wrote on my facebook about a\u003ca href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/hk0xy/a_gay_teen_describes_her_experience_at_a_utah/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e lockdown facility in Utah was reposted to Reddit\u003c/a\u003e where it went viral.\u003cbr\u003eI was interviewed about this for \u003ca href=\"http://www.tinynibbles.com/blogarchives/2011/06/exclusive-interview-abducted-queer-teen-xandir-to-appear-in-san-francisco-today.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eViolet Blue\u0027s Tiny Nibbles\u003c/a\u003e and told my story at \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_ccKTEWlxc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBawdy Storytelling.\u003c/a\u003e You can read more of my writing about the two and half years I spent this facility and the effects it\u0027s had on me \u003ca href=\"http://thecaptiveteen.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently I made a fun, silly, fictional choose your-own-adventure game that you can play for free called \u003ca href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/search?q=teenage+gaywad\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTeenage Gaywad\u003c/a\u003e.
