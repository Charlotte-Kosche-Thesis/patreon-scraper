I have many other forms of social media that you can follow me on! This is just a place for those who wish to help me out a little more so I continue to create, and cosplay more. And for those who do decide to pledge will\u00a0receive exclusive perks and many thanks!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that we have that out of the way:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eHI,\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m Gwenpie Cosplay or you can just call me Gwen! I am an Atlanta based cosplayer! I do attend more Georgia cons, but I do travel out of state to attend a convention currently at least once a year! I have always enjoyed cosplay and I\u0027ve attended conventions since 2003, but around four years ago cosplay became a bigger passion to me! I had a need to do it more, and I wanted to create more! I am very big on\u00a0positivity\u00a0in anything I do, and am extremely keen on body positivity in the cosplay community! I personally believe that cosplay is for everyone, and I hope that shows through what I\u0027ve done already when it comes to cosplaying. From here on out, I am hoping to expand my reach and my skill to create some of the best work I\u0027ve ever created!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/27368966_1576976112399138_5755623664448475400_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=5cb254cf69a362895e2ec9b101b4fd3a\u0026amp;oe=5B287263\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon News Feed\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eEvery single tier will get access to my Patreon news feed including  work in progress photos, advice, tips and tricks, and poll voting for new costumes or creations I will be making!

I will have different material available to different tiers! Also I will have a range of different types of shoots.

Even though I have a full-time job, and I\u0027m good at budgeting my money, most of my money earned is used to pay for school, rent, bills ect. Not only do I support myself fully, but I also am a full-time student. Some cosplay projects require more funds than others and currently I am unable to fully provide for my bigger projects. I haven\u0027t always made my cosplays, I\u0027ve also had help making them, and I\u0027ve bought them from time to time. I would really like to be able to make more, and improve my skill level. Basic supplies for cosplay can be expensive as well. Wigs tend to run anywhere from $20-$70. Sheets of EVA foam can be $25 a bundle! Worbla depending on the size and how much you need can range from $50\u0026lt; up. Also other things add up like fabric, thread, paint, zippers, buttons, ribbon, ect. I am also currently trying to save up to buy a new sewing machine, since my old one has broken and is unusable. Even if you\u0027re only able to pledge $1 that is so helpful to me! Every little bit counts! By pledging you are helping me grow as a cosplayer and enabling me to have the funds to create bigger better things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eDigital rewards will be sent out between the 1st and 3rd if every month!
