For pledging just a \u003cstrong\u003esingle dollar\u003c/strong\u003e a month, you get access to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s where you\u0027ll find a bunch of really neat stuff! I always post a bunch of WIP\u0027s and what not to my Twitter @garuda_six, but I always post a helluva lot more of them here! On some images, you\u0027ll find WIPs for every step of the image process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf requested, I\u0027ll also attach .SAI files to my images so you know exactly how I created each image and what settings I used to finish my works.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCertain images will also have Speed Paint Videos, exclusive to my Patreons. You can watch the entire drawing process unfold right before your eyes, and with some cool commentary from yours truly. (I spend a lot of time making these, so I hope you enjoy them!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ll be able to see my finished art here, and in full resolution before anyone else! Before my Twitter followers, before my Tumblr followers, and before my FurAffinity Followers!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also upload all of my practice sketches and studies here. So if looking at dank, un-released sketch work is your thing, we got it all here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso! Whenever I hold an in-stream art raffle as a patron, you double your chances automatically! And on top of that you get entered into a Patreon exclusive drawing once in a blue moon for a free commission (depending on how much is collectively pledged overall)!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou also get access to my Patreon exclusive Discord channel where we shoot the shit and hang out and shit. During the sketch streams, I open up the Discord voice channel and open it for all to come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot to mention, you also get access to the Private Sketch streams every Friday. Every Friday I host a stream for my patreons where I take requests and draw out your OCs in various shapes, sizes and situations. It\u0027s lots of fun, and the only way to get a request or two from me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(I\u0027m gonna be adding more stuff on here as time goes on. If you have any suggestions, please send me a note on FA!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThink about it. That\u0027s a lot of really cool shit for a dollar. What can you get in this world for a dollar? Not much else!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(A lot of other artists like to have various reward tiers based on how much you can pledge a month, so you\u0027ll only get the good stuff if you dish out an arm and a leg to them every month. But fuck that!!! I ain\u0027t about that life!!!!! I\u0027M LOOKING AT YOU FAF)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(A single dollar a month (the lowest price Patreon will let me set) gets you everything I can offer on my patreon! That\u0027s it! Just a dollar, bro! I know the #struggle is all too real!! And I know not everybody has their pockets lined with cash to toss at furry smut artists, so that\u0027s why I set everything to the absolute minimum! If you want to pledge more than a dollar, be my guest, I\u0027d really appreciate it! But if you can only spare a dollar a month, that\u0027s cool too! You\u0027re still just as #based as everyone else!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n#thank_you_based_god\u003cbr\u003e\n",
