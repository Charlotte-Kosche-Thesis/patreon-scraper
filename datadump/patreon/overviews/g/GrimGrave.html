I\u0027ve been writing since 2010 and I like to think I\u0027ve improved a lot since then - mainly thanks to an awesome friend and Beta-reader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore anything else, I just have to thank you - you, the reader who has been by my side and given me constructive criticism. You\u0027re all awesome and I\u0027m lucky enough to have recieved your feedback and in turn, given you all a good read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m going to take this a step further; without beating around the bushes, I want to create. I want to work within this creative field. With your help, that dream can be a reality. Obviously, and this actualy goes without saying, if you feel like tipping me, then it\u0027s greatly appreciated, but don\u0027t feel bad if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to; I completely understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, don\u0027t tip me much if you expect a higher reward; tip me the amount you feel my work is worth. Take care of yourself first before pledging!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you feel like what I\u0027m doing is worth something and you want to encourage me, then even a single dollar would make my day and spur me on to keep creating for you all! This includes;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Patreon-Only polls where you can vote and influence my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Participate in Raffles where you can win a story of your own request, capped at 3K words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Early previews to planned/upcoming stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a single dollar or more, you\u0027re contributing to more smut, romance, comedy, and anything else in the form of writing. Thank you for reading this!\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Grim\u003cbr\u003e"
