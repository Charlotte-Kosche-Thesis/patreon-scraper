My recaps are published for free via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cheeseburgergothic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheeseburger Gothic\u003c/a\u003e, the website of author and friend John Birmingham. However I believe writers should be paid.\u00a0I launched this Patreon in 2016 to see if readers would value my work enough to pay $USD1 per recap. It was wonderful to see so many people subscribe. I was able to do a lot with the money raised, including make large donations to animal rescue groups, a donation to friends with a sick child, plus funding a new microphone and Soundcloud subscription for the companion Raven On Podcast. This Patreon will continue for Season Seven in 2017, with the minimum subscriber amount remaining at $USD1 per recap ($7 for all of S7).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetailed explanation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Natalie Bochenski, Mother of Kittens, \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e tragic and Worshipper of Jon Snow\u0027s Abs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I began recapping \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e (season 2) on my personal blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, 2014 and 2015 my Raven On recaps (seasons 3, 4 and 5) were published on Fairfax Media websites including The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times. Despite the constant gutter humour and ogling, they somehow drew a fanbase of the most wonderful readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI left my role as a journalist - but Drogon himself could not claw my \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e recaps from my grasping, sticky fingers. They are my raison d\u0027etre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe recaps will remain \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e to view at their new home -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cheeseburgergothic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheeseburger Gothic\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the site of my good buddy and occasional mentor John Birmingham.

He is diversifying his income streams, and transitioning his website - already a brilliant resource for media/politics/pop culture junkies and wannabe writers - to hopefully a money-making venture in the near future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJB has previously described my\u00a0\u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0recaps as one of the best in the world - a breathtaking compliment. I am thrilled that he is hosting Raven On.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarly on in our friendship, JB gave me an important life lesson: Don\u0027t write for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis belief that writers should be paid is as strong as ever, but he is also a realist, hence his embrace of other options.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven JB\u0027s example, and the challenges of being paid for online content, I launched this Patreon as an experiment, to see how many of my gorgeous,\u00a0supple and powerfully sexual readers would actually pay for my recaps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach recap takes me about seven hours of work. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe price tag I place on that labour is $USD1 per\u00a0recap.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s $7 for the entire seventh season of \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note: Patreon charges in \u00a0American dollars, hence the use of $USD1 as a base standard.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon takes 5%, so I wind end up receiving 95c per recap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to value add, such as doing the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/girlclumsy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRaven On companion podcast\u003c/a\u003e with Stuart Layt, filming reaction videos and hosting discussions and ogling sessions at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nataliesthrone/?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever I do ask that if you, dear reader, enjoy my work, that you consider contributing the minimum of $USD1 per recap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA dollar is less than the price of a chocolate bar, or the cup of coffee that you might sip as you read my recap the morning after an episode. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to subscribe, you will have actually supported something you enjoy reading. And you\u0027ll give me\u00a0hope that the idea of people paying for content isn\u0027t a dream broken by clickbait and listicles and celebrity spam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo repeat - my recaps will remain \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e to read every week at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cheeseburgergothic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheeseburger Gothic\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron is entirely optional. It signals that you have the disposable income and the desire to support creative work that you enjoy. I hope you consider it; but either way, I hope you continue to read Raven On for more nicknames, rants, equal-opportunity sexism, innuendo, Jon Snow obsessions and occasional proper analysis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eValar Morghulis!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNatalie, Mother of Kittens.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: The $1 per recap and $7 per season are minimum suggestions.
