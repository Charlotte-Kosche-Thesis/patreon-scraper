I also try to document some of my process. I\u0027ve posted videos on techniques I\u0027ve picked up along the way and things that helps me be productive. You know. Open up my bag of tricks. These things take time to make, so I can\u0027t promise to do regular posts of that but I\u0027ll share whenever I can ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen ofcourse this is a great place to have discussions.
