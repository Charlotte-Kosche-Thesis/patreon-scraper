    "summary": "Hello! My name is Garrett Beelow and I am a freelance music composer based in Chicago. I\u0027ve been working in the field for five years, and I\u0027m currently composing the score for Blackwake, an indie pirate-themed multiplayer game set for release this Fall. About a year ago, I whimsically created a tutorial on how to use FL Studio to create professional music compositions and mixes. The video slowly but surely eked up a larger amount of views than I had expected, and I realized that there was a great deal of appreciation for such content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, since the video\u0027s release I\u0027ve found it difficult to regularly produce these tutorials. It is a large time sink, and as any freelancer knows, financial stability as a musician is more or less a pipe dream. I am often waiting on a single phone call or email to determine if I am able to pay rent this month, and so much of my time is consumed by floating my boat, my channel is unfortunately cast to the wayside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of Patreon, I would be able to treat my tutorial content as part of my job. This would allow me to spend more time on high quality tutorial work, publish content on a regular basis, and be that much more helpful for my viewers. I will do my best to continue creating content regardless of how successful it is, for the joy of the art. But, the less dire my financial situation, the better I can sustain my channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince publishing my first video, I\u0027ve been pretty blown away by how many people have contacted me directly asking for specific advice. I\u0027ve had young budding composers ask me to mentor them personally, and dozens of requests to critique music. As much as I wish I could give all of these budding artists the time they deserve, it\u0027s even less realistic than producing content in a regular basis. The best way for me to give back is to continue creating these videos, and if my viewers feel that my content is worth donating to, I\u0027ll be as flattered as I am appreciative! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for your time! \u003cbr\u003e"
