Some of these discussions involve helping them navigate these topics with their own faith communities, and some is helping them work through their own ideas and theology. Many pastors and priests surprisingly don\u0027t have spaces to navigate new ideas or the emotional support needed for this theological journey. I get to be that space for many clergy. I am also meeting with artists on a regular basis. For many of these creatives, I am the only person who checks in with them on their spiritual journey and gets to invite them deeper into Christian practice and community. Both of these types of conversations are integral to my ministry and our collaborative work! \u003cbr\u003eBy funding conversations, you are helping steward the hearts and minds of creatives around the world, and directly aiding in the transformation of churches into welcoming and affirming spaces! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEVENTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRetreats, workshops, dinner gatherings\u2026 these are spaces where people get to ask difficult questions and explore the answers collaboratively.
