I\u0027m setting up here so that my awesome patrons can connect and also be official Patrons via Patreon. This type of outreach/income helps me keep building, documenting, teaching what I know and above all, practicing. In addition to showing the builds, and continued photography work, I get to interact with a community that is interested in what we do here as well as the products we make and sell. It\u0027s awesome and I am incredibly grateful to share this idea with all of you!"
