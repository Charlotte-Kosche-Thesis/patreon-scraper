    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGinger Nuts of Horror is 100% free\u003c/strong\u003e, as the owner of the site I have always been wary of taking advertising, the site was set up as a thank you to all the authors who have entertained me for over 30 years, and as something to do when I was on long-term sick from work.  It would be great to make money from the site, but that has never felt right to me.  I have always felt that as soon as payment enters the picture, then the integrity of the site can be called into question, and if there is one thing you can say about me is I am a straight talker, I don\u0027t sugar coat anything.  I did experiment with advertising a few years ago, and it just made me feel dirty, I didn\u0027t like it.  So if you are looking to promote your horror based project, Ginger Nuts of Horror is here to help all free of charge.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the new year just waking up, I thought that this would be a great time to remind you what we can offer regarding horror promotion.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREVIEWS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a dedicated family of reviewers, our tastes vary, and we don\u0027t always agree on what we think is a good product, but we are honest, and we are willing to review books, films, comics, toys, video games, TV series, music or whatever else you have that is horror based.    If you would like us to review something of yours, then please send an email to Ginger Nuts of Horror.  To make the process of organising the requests can you please use the email header to highlight what it is you are sending in for review such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBOOK REVIEW: (YOUR NAME AND TITLE) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFILM REVIEW: (YOUR NAME AND TITLE) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eetc.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCould you also please use this format in the body of the email to tell us about your product.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTitle \u003cbr\u003eType of Product (Book Film, Comic, etc.) delete as appropriate \u003cbr\u003eAuthor\u003cbr\u003ePublisher\u003cbr\u003eSynopsis\u003cbr\u003eAmazon Link / Website Link \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eINTERVIEWS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe offer two types of interviews, in general, we will always start our \"Five Minutes With\" set of questions.  These questions are designed to highlight your work, while not coming across as a purely \"look at me\" interview.  One of the best ways to promote your work is to engage with a readership indirectly.  In this age of social media, it can feel that everyone is shouting at everyone else to take notice of them.  It can get somewhat overwhelming, and most readers switch off after a time.  If you can engage with the readership by talking about your love of the horror genre in general, and then mention your work, you are more likely to get a conversion.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also offer a more in-depth interview, however, due to nature and time it takes to research these types of interviews thoroughly, we, as a rule, don\u0027t offer these to everyone who asks for an interview.  These interviews are generally given to those, who we know will take full advantage of the time and effort we put into these interviews.  Get in touch if you want to know more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGUEST POSTS \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGinger Nuts of Horror as some themed ongoing guest posts, such as our ChildHood Fears series, where the things that scared you as a child, and their influence in your work today can be discussed.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have or \"..... That Made Me\" set of articles where you can discuss that one particular book, comic, film, album, etc. that was a defining influence on your decision to become a creator of horror.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf neither of these themed articles takes your fancy, we are also happy to publish any other article that you wish to write about, your work, your life as a creator or in horror in general.  Top Ten lists always go down well, as do things such as \"The Problem With...\", and guest reviews also go down well.  The choice is yours.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBOOK AND FILM  EXTRACTS \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne great way of directly highlighting your work is with extracts.  If you would like us to host an extract from your work, all you have to do is drop us an email.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are submitting anything for the interviews, guest posts or extracts a can you please include a brief biography, any images you would like us to use, and any links to your social media presence or places to purchase and view your work.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEWS ITEMS.  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe offer two types of news items.  A dedicated stands alone news item, where your work is the sole item in the article or a News Blasts where your news will be part of a roundup of Horror News for the week.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth have their pros and cons; the individual one focuses the interest onto your article, but it may suffer some social media reach as those who are not interested in it won\u0027t share it.  Whereas the News Blast has a much higher social media reach but might result in those reading it skipping over your entry in it.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are submitting a news item, please indicate which of the two formats you would like yours to take part in.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGinger Nuts of Horror is here to help, we love horror, and we want to see horror soar back to heady days of the mid-80s, so please let us help you make your mark in 2018. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here comes the difficult bit, running a website of this size requires a lot of time and in recent years a lot of money, while I don\u0027t like the idea of advertising, we have set up this page where you can donate any amount of money. The cost of running this site is becoming astronomical, and this may well be the last year that the Ginger Nuts of Horror exists in this format.   We appreciate that times are tough for everyone, and every penny donated will be received with extreme gratitude."
