    "summary": "Gravity Tales is an online publishing company that translates novels from Chinese and Korean to English, as well as producing original content by English authors with the intention of sharing works that we enjoy around the globe for readers to also read and enjoy with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve done a lot, translating and writing thousands of chapters bringing our total published word count to somewhere close to 20 million words. I personally have translated/looked through over 1,200 chapters, which comes out to about 2 million words. We love the community that we have built along the way and we hope to bring out the best in Chinese and Korean literature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we\u0027re currently going through one of the hardest times since Gravity Tales\u2019 inception and we need your support. Whether it\u0027s your thoughts or a contribution, we\u0027re grateful for any kind of support that you can give us. We\u0027ll keep publishing the works that you love and enjoy reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong our ride to this point, we\u0027ve kept a few core principles. We\u0027re by fans, for fans. We truly care about your reading experience. We\u0027ve always tried our absolute best to keep our ads reader-friendly to the point of sacrificing revenue. With a huge drop in readership due to many of our novels leaving for other sites, Gravity Tales\u0027 future development is in jeopardy. A large part of the features that you guys have come to love; the trophies in commenting, the individual novel subscription and the light and dark theme mode were only made possible with our readership being so large. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, translating each and every chapter is no small feat. Creating a work that thousands enjoy puts a lot of stress on each translator and editor, and even at their quickest, a chapter can take up to a combined 3-4 hours between the translators and editors. We\u0027d love to keep on providing the content that you love, but to do so, we need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re asking for your support on a few things - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eFirst and foremost, server and website development. Frankly, these two things aren\u0027t cheap and they\u0027ve contributed a lot to how large Gravity Tales is today. If we were stuck with the site that would go down after 200 people were on it at once, Gravity Tales simply wouldn\u0027t be here today. We\u0027re still looking to add extra features so that you get a better reading experience. After all, that\u0027s our vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, licenses. Although we originally prepared a fair sum of money in anticipation of licenses, it seems that licenses will be costing an arm and a leg. One of our biggest goals moving forward is to acquire the rights and be able to bring more stories and quicker translations to you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird, supplemental earnings to translators, editors and authors. This is to thank them for putting in all the hard work needed to bring quality translations and works to you all, as well as helping to support them on their journey with each and every novel they work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFourth, extra content for you guys! One of the prime examples is the TKA anime. We\u0027re looking to potentially translate it for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFifth, contests for Gravity Tales merchandise. We all love our logo and I love how it turned out in print. In the future, we\u0027ll be trying to send more of our good stuff to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere are a couple of rewards for those that decide to pledge for Gravity Tales, more details can be found in the rewards section and we\u0027ll be hoping to add more rewards in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, \u003cbr\u003eGGP and the Gravity Staff"
