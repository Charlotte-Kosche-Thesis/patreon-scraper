    "summary": "My name is Michael Mucha a.k.a. Getahinsh Productions on YouTube. I am a father, a husband, a big brother, a novice writer and more importantly a growing Youtuber. I have a daughter who is currently 3 years old, a loving wife of 6 years. After being on the YouTube platform for the last 2 years I seem to have lost out on my chance to grow as the other greats had. YouTube is a rapidly dying platform. Getting paid from them is near impossible. I am a very sociable person who loves to make friends wherever I go. Playing games is a hobby, playing them online for others to see if fun. But making friends with those that love the game things I do is the greatest thing ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have watched many greats rise from nothing and become something. I wanna become one of those greats.(With a few less flaws) I work hard to keep my job, I work even harder to keep a roof over our heads and food in our tummys. But sometimes you do all you can but it just isn\u0027t enough. raising money here will help relief some of the stresses that life just seems to like handing out to us. If I manage to raise a decent amount I have no problem talking about what the money that is being contributed is going. I have one rule about the money I receive while on the YouTube platform. Any and all money I get while I am on YouTube stay with the channel. (Games, better software, better equipment etc) That is however until I raise enough money here then I can be able to use that and help cover bills and such."

A 5 year anniversary holding husband to an amazing wife. However, I work two jobs and I am rarely home. My wife works during the night and I most of the days. Your support here would take the pressure off of me having to work two jobs to keep the roof over our heads. It would help me be able to help raise my daughter better, and in the long run a better father for doing so. In between all of my working two jobs, raising our daughter, I post and live stream gameplays. Some days are good, other days not so much. When I am not streaming or taking care of my daughter I am writing an anime book. Years now in the making but it is coming along. Your support would be able to help me to not only complete the book but possibly get it on the shelves. Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e",
