    "summary": "Hi everyone!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jackie and I want to entertain you. Over the years, I have come to love livestreaming video games and creating highlights from those streams. My overall goal in life is to create a community where being nerdy and geeky is accepted and required. A big piece of that community is creating fun videos for people to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started streaming about four years ago, and my first livestream was for charity. I played a Resident Evil game in hopes of raising donations for my local Children\u0027s Miracle Network Hospital via the Extra Life program. I raised $300! My livestream was literally a camera being pointed at my TV. Of course, streaming has since become easier and more convenient especially with consoles, but I would like to create videos of better quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I have a simple set up. I have my couch, my consoles (I do have an ambition to include PC gaming in the future), and thanks to leftover gift card funds and selling some old equipment, a Yeti mic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting my Patreon means that you will be helping me to obtain not only better equipment, and an upgraded setup, but games in general that will be the first step to creating these streams and highlights. As I am beginning this journey, my campaign will be set up so that any funds dedicated to this Patreon will only be accepted once I create something. After all, I feel that this is the best way to earn your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStreaming and making these videos is fun for me and will always be something that I do because I love it. As some of you have expressed an interest in supporting what I do, I have turned to Patreon to give you that option to help. I am and will forever be grateful for each pledge that comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for hearing me out in my crazy, little adventure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep on gaming!\u003cbr\u003eJackie\u00a0\u003cbr\u003etwitch.tv/geekyfriedrice\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/geekyfriedrice\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/geekyfriedrice\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hi! I\u0027m Jackie, and I am also known as GeekyFriedRice. Years ago, I asked a few friends what could represent me in one image. In one simple response, a friend said Geeky Fried Rice! And thus began my journey to create another piece of my identity that would focus on the acceptance of my geeky hobbies. I did not have that when I was younger; however, I love creating whether it be writing, making YouTube videos and Vines, livestreaming video games, building a community or dabbling in audio projects. It\u2019s a very rewarding feeling to slowly develop your legacy, and even more so when many others join the adventure. I hope you enjoy what I create for you. Let\u2019s create something beautiful.",
