But now it\u0027s time to try some new things. Exciting things! This starts with a brand new weekly podcast called Real Talk, where we\u0027ll discuss all kinds of topics, including suggestions from YOU!\u00a0Beyond that, we have big plans for a ton of new shows that take a closer look at less explored gaming elements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, we want to make BIGGER and BETTER content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the problem with \"bigger\" and \"better\" is that it takes time--a LOT of time. And unfortunately, YouTube isn\u0027t the best platform for shows that take a lot of time to produce. So that\u0027s where Patreon comes in: by allowing us to be less dependent on YouTube\u0027s ad-based model and create more engaging \u0026amp; original content directly for YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027ll be just as excited to see our new content as we are to create it! Thank you for your support!\u003c/div\u003e"
