    "summary": "Hello everyone! We have decided to open a Patreon community page for the Grand Campaign Custom Maps - GCCM mod(s). The last half year has been a wonderful ride, we started out with Terry being launched around February, which sparked something in us. \u003cbr\u003eOn the 5th of March we started something that really connected well with the broader gamebase of Total War Warhammer, the mod \"Grand Campaign Custom Maps\", or what later became known as GCCM. At the time of creation, we didn\u2019t have a clear idea of what we wanted to do with the mod or how to guide it in the different directions we chose. The mod has grown tremendously in scope since then, and the community support has been overwhelming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe feel like we and the map making community have learned a lot, and that we can provide a solid alternative to CA\u0027s settlement maps and introduce a much greater variety. We have therefore decided to create this patreon account for the future support of the GCCM mod and the map making community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy setting up this patreon, we\u0027re hoping to do two things: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) We want to reward and encourage map making. We\u0027re planning on letting patrons vote for their favorite new map included in GCCM each month. This way we hope to encourage map making, and reward the hard work that people put into their maps. In addition to that, we would also pick our favorite new addition each month for an extra reward. Until we hit a donation threshold of 50 dollars, all donations will be used for this.\u003cbr\u003e2) The management and development of the GCCM mod itself. Adding maps, coordinating map makers, fixing bugs, and developing new functionality for maps. Since the release of the map making tool Terry, we have figured out how to create custom siege maps, custom decals, custom reskinned buildings, and other things. This has started becoming increasingly more time consuming as the mod has grown bigger. We are now at a point where we feel that it would be okay to ask for donations, and we hope that you think so too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the core GCCM team has created many of the maps currently included in the mod, GCCM is ultimately a colaborative effort. This is why rewarding and incentivising map making is a core goal of this patron, and if you have other suggestions on how we could do this we would love to hear them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture plans\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTotal War Warhammer 2 will be a fresh start for GCCM in many ways, and we will be much stricter about including new maps. The goal is to have unique, interesting, and varied maps for each and every settlement on the campaign map. We will also ensure that these maps work well with AI, while still being as interesting as possible. In addition to this, we will also work on a better bug tracking system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMap makers\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe have a discord channel for map makers, which you can join\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/NyrXErg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Feel free to join if you\u0027re thinking about creating a map and would like to get or give feedback, learn more, or just show off what you\u0027ve been working on thus far.\u003cbr\u003e"
