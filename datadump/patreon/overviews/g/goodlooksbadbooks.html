    "summary": "\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eGood Looks Bad Books is a bad romance review comedy podcast. You knew that right? I sure hope so.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWe\u0027ve\u003c/strong\u003e been going at it for about 2 years now and it\u0027s been a good long session of hot, sweaty labor. Now, like all good workers we like to get rewarded for what we do. I mean, come on, we read 50 Shades of Grey for fucks sake! Anyway, there\u0027s a bit more to podcasting than slapping a mic down and recording some (good looking) people talk about some sexy books. We sometimes even have special guests and that\u0027s a whole lot of planning! And, I guess, there\u0027s stuff like hosting, editing, commissioning art...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpeaking\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0of art, we have some special material goods for you hopefully coming down the pipeline in the future! You may not want to show this stuff off to your parents, but sticking them on your fridge, sliding them into your favorite sleaze book or wearing them for your naughty photos might be something to put some spice in your life! We will be sending out some goodies at some levels, and maybe even some at the lower levels too! We have to get to paying them good good artists though cause any good work deserves to get paid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u003c/strong\u003e have some ideas in the works for bonus content, like suggestion books, small bite sized episodes about what some of our audience will recommend to us, or something similar to a My Brother, My Brother and Me style show where we dig through r/relationships or submitted questions and try to solve peoples relationship problems! And, if you have some serious questions, I guess we could actually TRY to tackle them as well. Sheesh.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWell crap\u003c/strong\u003e, this stuff is HARD! Guess what I\u0027m asking in the long run is for you to help take care of that podcast HARD ON. And you asked for it! So, from the bottom of our hearts, or respective feeling organs, thanks for at least checking us out! And if you didn\u0027t know we were a smut podcast, guess you do now...\u003cbr\u003e"
