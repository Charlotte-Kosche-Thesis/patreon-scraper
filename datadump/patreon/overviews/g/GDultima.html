    "summary": "Hey! My name is Reece, I stupidly decided to go by \"GDUltima\" on the internet though. I really appreciate you taking the time to check out my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am British, 19 years old and have been playing guitar since 2013 (not a long time), I have had a strong interest in making music since purchasing my first album with my own money at 6 years old. I began releasing music after getting my first guitar and began learning as I arranged covers of video game music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I am making:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am creating music videos, these being my main projects and the only things patrons will pledge for, anything else will be considered extra, bonus content. I plan on creating both cover music and originals, covers being mainly of video games and other geeky media. The genre being based mainly on pop/punk-metal. However all that being said, I do wish to branch out as far as possible, making music from all genres and going in all directions with my videos. Both the audio AND the video mean a lot to me, I have a passion for both aspects of the process, so I intend to keep improving not only my musical and audio production skills, but my video production skills, this is why patrons pledge only for music videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your money goes towards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll money earned from your support will go towards not only improving my content, but producing more of it and getting the audience involved with the content by;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAcquiring new equipment such as instruments, audio equipment, lights, cameras, etc. This equipment will all go towards making my videos look and sound better.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaintaining existing equipment. Guitars need restringing, audio interfaces go kaput, bulbs need replacing. This can get very expensive, your support will help with these costs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImproving my computer. With a more powerful computer I can work on music and videos faster and get you guys involved with the creative process with live streams.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFunding meet-ups and conventions. Events such as MAGFest and other conventions are really great motivator and learning experience for me, I am able to meet a lot of friends/talented musicians, which really pushes me to keep making content. Not to mention how great it is to be able to meet the people who support me at these events. Travel to these places can be extremely expensive however and while I can afford to attend MAGFest each year, I would love to see more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
