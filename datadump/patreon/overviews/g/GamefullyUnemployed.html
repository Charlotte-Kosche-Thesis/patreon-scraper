Due to a massacre of layoffs, our internet comedy family has recently been disbanded -- forcing a slew of talented people to wander the digital earth in search of meaning (and money).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur solution? To gather these beautiful souls, sit them around a table, and live stream everyone playing board games. We call it \"Gamefully Unemployed\" because we\u0027re geniuses. And now we\u0027re looking for a way to not only sustain ourselves, but expand into a world-dominating empire of Twitch shows and podcasts. That\u0027s where you come in! We\u0027d like to keep giving you a daily taste of all your favorite ex-Cracked personalities, but can only do so with the aid of wonderful people like yourselves. Won\u0027t you help us entertain you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join us:\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/gamefully_unemployed"
