    "summary": "I\u0027m a print maker specializing in the old printmaking techniques - wood and copper engraving. These are some of the oldest and most difficult of the printmaking techniques. With the development of digital printing processes intaglio and relief print has lost it\u0027s purpose. But I believe, that even in this day and age we can learn a lot from these techniques. Their technical fidelity far surpasses \u00a0anything that can be achieved with modern printers (\u003ca href=\"http://www.reinisgailitis.com/blogs/on-my-mind/107563399-why-wood-and-copper-engraving-are-my-favourite-print-making-techniques-reinis-gailitis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eread why wood engraving and copper engraving are my favorite printmaking techniques\u003c/a\u003e). My goal is to make other people as passionate about these techniques as I am revealing their beauty to wider audience of people. Read more about my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.reinisgailitis.com/blogs/on-my-mind/118168071-what-are-my-ideas-and-concepts\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eideas and concepts\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut let\u0027s get to the point, \u003cstrong\u003ewhy have I chosen Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a platform for supporting Your favorite artists and content makers by pledging a small amount of money. The power of this tool is that a small contribution by many people can make a big difference in artists creative process. As much as I would like to be a full time artist, it\u0027s not possible at this point in my life. But I believe that with hard work and putting a lot of effort everything is possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would I use your contribution?\u003c/strong\u003e I think this is a very important thing. A lot of people need/ are asking new cameras, computers, etc. I\u0027ve never asked anyone for anything. Since my childhood everything that I have has been earned by hard work. I take things serious and if there is a goal in my life I will do my best and more to reach it. Every single cent from my Patreons will be invested back in art materials, tools, papers, inks and other equipment directly related to my work. It also helps me to be less independent from my full time job allowing me to make more prints, write articles and to communicate with You.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do You get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e First of all, my gratitude. There is no words in human language to express how much it means to me. I can\u0027t thank You enough. What is the purpose of the artist if his work doesn\u0027t reach anyone, doesn\u0027t touch anyone, if no one finds it relevant? Without You I am no one. By being my Patreon You will unlock Creators posts where I will regularly update things that I am working on, my struggles and frustrations, thoughts and ideas, photos of process. Patrons have a chance to occasionally receive prints, drawings and other artwork."
