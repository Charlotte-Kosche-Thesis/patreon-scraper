Despite that, the media landscape here has been bleak. For years, corporate-owned mainstream outlets have shown their priority to be selling advertisements, rather than uncovering the stories that need to be told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the established players were not doing the work that needed to be done, I stepped forward and began my next venture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFearless, Independent Reporting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched my website \u003ca href=\"http://politicsoc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOcean County Politics\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in February and the response from the community has been incredible from day one. With the help of my network of sources, I have turned the site into Ocean County\u0027s political news, opinion \u0026amp; discussion destination. In addition to being a platform for my reporting on the municipal and county-level government of Ocean County, we also offer reform-minded editorials, op-eds and letters to the editor submitted by citizens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpeaking Truth To Power\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat sets apart my work from others is that unlike the newspapers, I am not beholden to corporate advertisers, which can put the brakes on potentially damaging stories. The only people I am beholden to are the thousands of citizens that make use of my website on a daily basis. I have used the rapid growth of my online media outlet to speak truth to Ocean County\u0027s establishment, and I\u0027m just getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are just a few of the things I\u0027ve uncovered in the past year:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://politicsoc.com/2016/05/bombshell-county-emails-show/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLocal newspaper drops story about Sheriff after outside political pressure\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://politicsoc.com/2016/07/carmen-amato-gets-raise/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMayor of Berkeley Township quietly sneaks 194% raise into budget passed at 10 a.m. special meeting\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://politicsoc.com/2016/06/stafford-mayor-caught-using-navy-email-political-purposes/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLeaked emails reveal Stafford Township mayor used Navy computer to run political campaigns\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://politicsoc.com/2016/06/little-egg-harbor-hotbed-corruption/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eQuestions remain after Little Egg Harbor official gets 90% tax assessment reduction\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://politicsoc.com/2016/03/gop-boss-gilmore-facing-federal-tax-liens/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOcean County political boss has nearly $1 million in unpaid federal income taxes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have invested countless hours of time and monetary resources in obtaining video equipment, bandwidth, web hosting and related expenses that come along with running this operation, and I hope to be able to continue expanding / adding additional coverage. With your generous support, I can continue to set the agenda in Ocean County and keep bringing suppressed truths and hidden agendas to light with the help of my sources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe this is the best platform to turn my reporting into a sustainable, long-term institution to serve the citizens of Ocean County with, and expand my coverage further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporters who contribute any amount per month of their choosing can look forward to upcoming exclusive members-only ebooks, sneak peeks and extra features that I\u0027ll be able to add to the site.
