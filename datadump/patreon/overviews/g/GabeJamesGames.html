I can assume you\u0027ve either found me through Tumblr or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeJamesGames\"\u003eTwitter.\u00a0 \u003c/a\u003eMy name is Gabe! I\u0027m 24 and I live in the United States in Pennsylvania. Currently working retail which has hours that fluctuate a lot.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eREMEMBER\u003c/strong\u003e anything you pledge can be a one time thing, just cancel the subscription thing through your profile as to not get recharged every month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBeing A Patron\u003c/h4\u003eWhat I\u0027m expecting the money to go to is really just necessities like student loans, phone bills, and food.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eExtra About Me\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027m working on a few different projects right now. One of them is a Science-Fiction Tabletop RPG called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.s0urcec0de.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eS0urce C0de\u003c/a\u003e. Along with that, one thing I\u0027ve been trying my best to do is to be as positive as possible. Life is hard enough as it is, we all struggle, but I want to remind people that there is always a little bit of positive feeling around. I want to use this to upload videos and audio for the moments when you just need to hear a positive voice. I don\u0027t want people to feel pressured to provide and overwhelming amount but every bit helps me as I\u0027m working harder to get to where I want to be and where I need to be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nVideos will be uploaded at a minimum of once a month, but I am aiming for every week if I can put it together. I will gladly take suggestions on things that you would want to hear, things you feel like would help you to hear, or anything that you may want advice on. This could be just needing help on something, needing to hear something positive, or if you want an outside opinion on it. Depending on the videos and ideas I may try to include multiple subjects in the videos. More than anything else this is about trying to help. It may seem almost like an odd idea, to have an archive of different videos or audio to listen to when feeling down. I have been doing it myself. I have recorded a dozen videos for myself of things that I know I would need to hear at some point and when I came back to the videos they made a difference to me. I have been told many times that a different matters if you can just make a difference in one person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
