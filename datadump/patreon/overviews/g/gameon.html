We currently release an issue every month around the 23rd which allows you to read about the content we\u0027re putting out and enjoy the artwork. At the moment though, we\u0027re a magazine that is online rather than a digital magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main goal is to bring the SMITE Official Magazine into the digital age and allow the magazine to have a lot more interactivity. We want you to be able to view videos, flick through pictures and comment on what you\u0027re looking at. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost and that\u0027s where we hope Patreon, and our readers, will be able to help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Contribute?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst donations and support isn\u0027t mandatory, it is incredibly appreciated as we are a completely free product that releases every month. Your contributions can help to improve the product overall and we\u0027d like to be able to reward you that help!
