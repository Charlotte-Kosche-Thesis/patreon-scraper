Thank you so much for your support,\u00a0 ti is greatly appreciated! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Galaxy\n Magnolia is the story of a Tethican Alien named Sinsen Ruga with pyro \ndestructive tendencies who is just trying to fit into Wormwood Academy \nDeep Space without resorting to the impulse to burn everything down. \nAggressive, hostile and not to mention the only Tethican in W.A, he has a\n difficult time with the human population of students, often getting \ninto fights or losing the respect of his peers because of who and what \nhe is. Nim Piper Fletes is a nerdy Frankenstein and fossil obsessed \nhuman girl who is also attending Wormwood and facing the same plight of \nbetrayal and outcast from her peers simply because she is unable to fit \nin. She harbors many secrets that the school Reporter, Gingham Angora \nwould love to publish in the school news paper -the Daily Rocket\". This \nis Ruga and Nim\u0027s story and how they must learn to fit into the high \ndemands of Wormwood Academy, save what remains of lost Earth and at the \nsame time without losing themselves in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest influence to the comic is my love for sci-fi and other worlds. The comic focuses on Sinsen Ruga, a Tethican Alien and his interpersonal relationships between the only other Tethican he has ever known, Zuten Loki, and the human sapient species. His interaction with the sole other Tethican he has known from birth, and what little he knows of the the Tethican culture, greatly conflicts with the human culture that he was raised under, often leaving him confused, bitter and violent towards the world around him in general. Overly confident and arrogant, he greatly takes this frustration out on the human population of students attending Wormwood, leaving him with a totally bad rep and most outcast of students. The story also focuses on Nim Piper Fletes, a human girl who struggles with confidence and her peers around her, often leaving her in very tight socially awkward situations. She has a reputation from boarding school that carried on with her to Wormwood Academy Deep Space, as being a total conspiracy focused loser in the eyes of her peers. That rep especially ignites again in Wormwood Academy when she involves her life around that of Ruga\u0027s. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGalaxy Magnolia has a huge cast of characters, a lot of detail, hidden messages, massive emotional character growth through the series, and a highly detailed, highly involved plot that requires readers to pay attention and not just wiz through it. It\u2019s not for\nthe casual reader by any means and requires some heavy reading at times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
