    "summary": "Hello friends! My name is Michael Audish, and I\u0027m the hands-at-the-keyboard behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goldplatedgames.com/\"\u003eGold-Plated Games\u003c/a\u003e, a website devoted to reviewing video games of all shapes and sizes. I post regular content every day except Sunday, usually focused on PC games released on the Steam platform. I also cover free indie games and game jam entries, and write essays on the industry from time to time. My biggest features, though, are my seasonal review series where I play and review games in a particular genre every day for a whole month. It started with horror games in October, and has grown to platformers, roguelikes, simulations, point-and-clicks, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing all this content regularly is quite a time investment, as you might imagine. Additionally, I don\u0027t do any kind of advertising or sponsorships on my website and never will. My goal has always been honest reviews as impartial as possible, and I\u0027ve never liked the whole online advertising thing anyway. That means all of my content is 100% free and unrestricted, but I have to pay for the privilege of putting it up on the internet for everyone to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s why we\u0027re here! If you enjoy my work, would like to see it continue, and can spare a dollar a month, you can help me at least break even on maintaining the website. All funds received will be put into my reviews in some way, whether it be upgrades to the website, review copies of games, or hardware for new features. And if, somehow, we can push past the basic goals I need to keep the site running, that opens up a whole new world of possibilities for expanding what I do. Maybe this could be the first step towards becoming a full time independent reviewer? Dare I dream?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by, and double-plus thank you if you decide to support my work! Even if you don\u0027t decide to become a patron, I\u0027d love for you to have a look around\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goldplatedgames.com/\"\u003ethe site\u003c/a\u003e or follow\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11322459/\"\u003emy curations\u003c/a\u003e on Steam and spread the word. Check out the hundreds of reviews and features I\u0027ve done, and let your friends know if you see something you like! Writing reviews has become my passion, so whenever you feel like stopping by, I\u0027ll be here."
