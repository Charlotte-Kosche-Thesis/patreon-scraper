    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Matt! I\u0027m a non-binary trans college student, I\u0027m 23, and I have a BIG problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a first year transfer student, and I have lived at home my entire life, until this past year. I talked my parents into letting me dorm for my first year at the University of California, Irvine. My dad fought be until days before the application deadline for the dorms, but with much convincing from myself, my mother, and my siblings, he caved and let me apply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in the dorms, I have for the first time in my life been able to be myself and explore my identity on my own terms. I see now how detrimental living with and being around my parents, specifically my father, has been for my mental health over the last decade. Even just talking to him on the phone causes my anxiety to spike, and being around him in person is way worse.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLiving with my father again long term is not an option I am willing to take, but right now, I may forced into moving back in with them for the next year.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have done well in my studies so far, and I firmly believe that is due to my ability to live separate from my parents, free from that anxiety and stress. I am confidant in saying my coursework and mental health would suffer if I had to move back in. However, my dad is paying for everything: my tuition, housing, my food...pretty much everything. I was not allowed to get a job earlier in my life, because I was expected to focus on school, or help around the house.\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eMy dad is claiming that he cannot afford to pay for my housing and also my tuition, even if I work a summer job to offset costs. My dad has managed to materialize funds in the past when it was for his own needs, so I am highly suspicious of my dads motives. \u003cstrong\u003eI suspect this is a control thing, and that my dad wants to keep hold of me like he has the rest of my siblings.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf my dad wants to, he can cut me off entirely, and has threatened to do so numerous times when I said something he didn\u0027t like.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eI am hoping that I can get enough support here to at least bargain with my dad to let me live near campus, and not have to move back in to that abusive environment.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few options:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) I manage to raise funds \u0026amp; convince my parents to let me move into an apartment I have been invited into by a friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe cost for this would be $550. It would still be a long shot, but if I hit that number, my parents literally cannot justify me living at home by saying we cannot afford it. This might spark other problems (like my parents admitting it was a control thing, perhaps), but that is the Big Goal.\u003cbr\u003eThere would be 5 people in the apartment, which I have no problem with, but my parents seem to? The convincing is on me, and if I have the funds, I\u0027m confident I can work with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) I live at home, and use the funds gathered over the year to FULLY justify not living at home in the coming year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile not ideal, this is something that is a very real possibility. I would have to suffer a lot through the year (actually more like 15 months because Summer + School year + Summer), but it is something I must consider, and plan for. By the end of that year, I would ABSOLUTELY be able to move out, so that\u0027s STILL GOOD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Doing all this pisses my parents off sufficiently enough that I am cut off financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is if the stuff really hits the fan. I\u0027m gonna need all the help I can get for this, and I\u0027ll need to figure out financial aide for college. This is the worst case scenario.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny way I see it, I still need help here. My parents would rather I spent whatever money I raise towards tuition rather than housing. They want me to live at home and commute. I cannot afford to spend 3 hours on a bus, where I cannot concentrate on my work, and I also do not have a license due to a fear of driving due to past trauma. I am working on that, but there is no guarantee I can overcome that any time soon. I\u0027ve tried to no avail so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything you can contribute would be greatly appreciated\u003c/strong\u003e, and if you want more information, I am available to answer such questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t know what, if anything, I can give in return, except my appreciation. It has become clear to me that streaming regularly might not be possible given my future time commitments. I\u0027ll keep you all informed if this changes, but for now I can\u0027t offer anything but my thanks.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have removed a few of the potential living situations as they have become non-options as I further converse with my parents.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNEW REWARD TIER\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e: My boyfriend Xavier is offering \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eregular art commission slots\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for those who  donate to the $70 reward tier. In order to send in the request and receive the art piece, please provide your email, Twitter, or Tumblr and Xavier will contact you regarding the commission.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and consideration.\u003cbr\u003e-Matt\u003cbr\u003e"
