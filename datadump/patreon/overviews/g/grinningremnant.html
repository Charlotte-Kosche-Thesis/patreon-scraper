    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, everyone. I\u0027m Alex, owner/operator/editor-in-chief at GrinningRemnant.com (the #1 website for Force of Will content), and one of the longest-running Force of Will journalists in the industry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started GrinningRemnant back at the end of December 2015, I knew I wanted to create a website unlike any other Force of Will website. I didn\u2019t want a site that just posted clickbait, nor did I want a site that catered only to a specific subsection of the Force of Will community. Force of Will is still a relatively new game, and I wanted to help foster the growing FoW community by providing high-quality articles, podcasts, and videos that any player could enjoy and learn from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere we are, over a year later, and GrinningRemnant has quickly grown from a small, start-up website into the #1 site for Force of Will content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp to this point, GrinningRemnant.com has been run off the hard work and dedication of the staff. The writers, editors, and artists work tirelessly to produce content each week because we love Force of Will and want to see it grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy monetize?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping the lights on at GrinningRemnant costs quite a bit of money. This cost is incurred from web hosting fees, domain ownership fees, and podcast hosting fees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I originally had planned to have the site funded entirely through Patreon, the growing hosting costs of the site took it from \"a fun way to spend $30 a month\" to \"a legit burden on my wallet\", and I decided ads were necessary. Between the crowdfunding revenue and ad revenue, I\u0027m still not close to breaking even on the hosting costs for the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of current, spending does not include paying our writers, editors, artists, and other team members for their time and effort. The content at GR has always been provided entirely out of the generosity, long hours, and hard work of my amazing staff. GrinningRemnant has very much been a labor of love for us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would really appreciate help with the operational costs of the site. I would love to be able to start compensating contributors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy opening up lines of communication between patrons and us, it gives a more personal feeling to the relationship between Team Remnant and our wonderful audience. We\u2019ll be using the patron stream/comments to directly interact with our audience. Got suggestions, feedback, ideas, requests, or questions for the staff? This would be the easiest way to reach us. We\u2019ve always enjoyed interacting with our readers, and Patreon makes it easier and more convenient.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you do with the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question. As I previously mentioned, I am currently funding the entire site and all associated hosting fees out of pocket. First and foremost, funds earned through this Patreon will be going into keeping the lights on at GrinningRemnant.com. The initial goal is to cover the current monthly operating costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that initial goal is surpassed, I will be putting the money into improving the site. This could mean a variety of things including better hosting, better plugins, new equipment, and other things that make GrinningRemnant better than it already is. It would be nice to reward the staff once in a while as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I get for being a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from that warm, fuzzy feeling in knowing you\u2019re supporting our site, you get the aforementioned lines of communication with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a more detailed list of rewards, check out the \"Rewards\" column on this very page! There\u0027s a lot of really cool stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat happens if you don\u2019t reach your goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing. Regardless of how successful this crowdfunding campaign is, I will keep GrinningRemnant in operation for as long as I reasonably can. I absolutely adore running this site, producing content, working with my wonderful teammates, and supporting our great Force of Will community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe so very much appreciate you all for your patronage!\u003cbr\u003e"
