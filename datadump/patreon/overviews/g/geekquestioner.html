    "summary": "Hey guys, this is Charlie from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://geekquestioner.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egeekquestioner.com\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/+CharlieHoover\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle Plus\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s been a long road getting to this point, but I\u0027m finally taking people\u0027s advice and digging into Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s all this about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell for those who don\u0027t know, I started asking my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/collection/8DhPa\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeek Question of the Day\u003c/a\u003e back in 2011 and have (at the time I\u0027m writing this) posed over 1,600 of them since! In 2013 I added my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/collection/YTXRI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeekscape of the Day\u003c/a\u003e to showcase (with attribution) amazing scifi and fantasy artwork. Both of these Collections, and the community that has blossomed around them, are nothing short of incredible. Up until recently, I\u0027ve been doing it all without expecting any kind of compensation besides the joy I get out of the whole thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOK, Mr. Greedy, what changed? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, in order to find some way to honor all of the amazing geeks in the community, I started the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://geekquestioner.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeek Questioner Podcast\u003c/a\u003e last year. It\u0027s been a massive work-in-progress as I am not an audio expert nor a voice talent of any kind. All of the details are at the new website, but basically the show has two parts; an interview with a member of our community (or someone that I think the community might love to learn about) and an overview of some of the best answers to my geek questions from the previous week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, the place this all began, Google Plus, has slowly deteriorated over the years and I desperately want to make sure our community survives independent of any particular social network. If you want to know why they are so important to me, just look at any random thread and you\u0027ll understand! With that in mind, I have created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://geekquestioner.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egeekquestioner.com\u003c/a\u003e as a central repository for everything going forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet to the point!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight. Well in a nutshell, unlike posting to places like G+, Twitter, or Facebook, website hosting, online storage, and decent equipment is far from free. I\u0027m starting this Patreon as a way to help off-set costs for the moment. If it goes well enough, I have some other ideas for future projects but I\u0027ll save that for a later date. For now I\u0027ll just say that if you can afford to toss a few bucks my way, I would greatly appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for over six years of amazing geekery so far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Charlie\u003cbr\u003e"
