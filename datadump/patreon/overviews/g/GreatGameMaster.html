Are you strange?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Guy Sclanders and have been Role playing since 1989. That\u2019s before Pokemon Go, YouTube and even the Internet! I started the Great Game Master channel about two years ago but got out two videos\u2026 then two more\u2026 then nothing. Why? Because I felt it wasn\u2019t what I wanted it to be \u2013 a resource for players and Game Masters to be able to use to improve their games. So together with my two friends Derrick aka Web Goblin and Carla aka Marketing Goblin we decided to get together and revive the channel and create a space for the role players to learn and grow from my experiences and one another! Because we all love table top role playing. That was in February of 2016, and I am proud to say we have grown the channels (yes we have two) from a handful of videos to over 200 videos so far and counting, and have released 2 a week! We even added a third video of us role playing with our friends making it 3 a week. Mondays and Wednesdays :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe create How To Be A Great Game Master videos and how to be a Great Role Player videos, basically a lot of Tabletop RPG related content for Game Masters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes we are Strange, some more than others :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so you do AWESOME Tabletop Roleplaying How To\u0027s for Game Masters and Role players and much more but what is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is essentially a place where you can support a creator financially for the awesome content they make for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would really appreciate your support and even if that isn\u0027t through becoming a Patron but by liking, sharing and subscribing to our Youtube Channels, that\u0027s awesome too. The point of Patreon is that we will still be making all the content for free and if you want to, you can support us and get rewards for that support. Remember you don\u0027t have to do this but please consider supporting our work with a dollar, or more if you want :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why did you come onto Patreon if you will still make the content anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell because as much as we love doing this and creating all these videos, it does take a lot of time and effort. Most people don\u0027t realize that we spend at least three nights a week working on the channel and one day on the weekend, which yes, we do enjoy and love, and are passionate about and will continue to do so into the far future but it is time consuming, and we\u2019ve kinda spent all our cash on making it as good as it can be. We want to help people become better Game Masters and Role Players so that more people get involved and have better experiences and we want to eventually take over the world... Mwha ha ha ... cough cough. But seriously we love our channels and love RPG\u0027s and being on Patreon would give us the space to create more content, replace our current equipment, make better content and possibly give our GM Guy a little bit of a life as he does almost all the work. \u003cem\u003e*The marketing goblin and web goblin look up and feel as though they have been left out, then they return to working in their dungeon*\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would I get if I did become  Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell we thought long and hard about that, because we\u2019re kinda giving everything away free anyway already, and will continue to do so regardless of what happens here. So we got together with some of the guys we\u2019ve met on this incredible journey thus far, and have \u2013 we think \u2013 put together some pretty cool options as a way of saying thank you to those who do decide to become part of our Table. Check them out on the right. We\u2019ve also partnered with some really awesome people to give you really cool stuff such as awesome Papercraft Dungeon miniatures drawn by Marvel Artist Sean Izaakse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I can\u0027t, don\u0027t want to, or stop giving you money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are totally welcome to stop, start or never give us money. It\u0027s up to you :) We will never judge or be upset, as we know real life is important and so would never want to put you in a place where you are choosing between us and two minute noodles. Pick the noodles, trust us we have all been there \u003cem\u003e*Marketing Goblin coughs pointedly\u003c/em\u003e* Please remember you can stop being a Patron at any time; you aren\u0027t locked into anything. Equally so you can start giving us money at any point :) We are flexible like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for your support, in whatever way you give it, comments, shares, subscribes and possibly Patronage.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the table :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSincerely\u003cbr\u003eGuy aka Great Game Master\u003cbr\u003eCarla aka Marketing Goblin\u003cbr\u003eDerrick aka Web Goblin\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS.
