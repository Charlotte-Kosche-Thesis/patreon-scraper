We\u0027ve explained why the Catoblepas is real but misunderstood; why Bards aren\u0027t really Bards; taken you sailing to New Zealand looking for Crepuscular rays; settled the debate between Kobolds and Bullywugs; taken a good look at Displacer Beasts; given you context for things truly Eldritch; discussed Katanas, Dragons, and the City of Brass; explored the planar realms; wondered about Mayonnaise; and covered a whole Cosmos of things you need to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we are it, we give you some hints and helpful suggestions about how to incorporate all the real world knowledge we gain into your games. The actual science, history, mythology, religious practices, and word origins help to enhance your table top gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re looking for even more words to spice up your games with. We love it, this is exactly the sort of thing we\u0027d have used in our own games had it existed before now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now it does and here we are asking you to help support us. To help us keep making the show you\u0027ve come to love and to learn from. Without your support, we\u0027d have a much harder time making the episodes and getting them out to you. If you like what we do, if you want to see us keep doing it, this is your chance to help make that happen. Every little bit helps. Select a pledge level and let\u0027s get started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e______________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be charging on a per episode basis. At the end of the month your pledge total will be calculated and billed. This way, you only get billed for episodes that actually come out, so if complications arise and we can\u0027t get an episode to you you aren\u0027t charged for it. You can also specify a maximum total pledge for the month, meaning you are in full control of your pledges and don\u0027t get surprised. We release one episode each week, so plan accordingly.\u003cbr\u003e"
