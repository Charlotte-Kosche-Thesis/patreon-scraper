    "summary": "I\u0027ve always wanted to learn music, play music, and record music. My first home recording was when I was 4 or something, and I grabbed my dad\u0027s tape recorder and sang \"Kodachrome\". Unlistenable, but maybe I\u0027ll put it on my box set someday to meet a contractual obligation or something. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTook piano lessons, but they didn\u0027t stick. Most of it I play by ear these days. I\u0027m a terrible sight-reader and my technique is awful. Same with guitar; I hold the neck all wrong and use my thumb for barre chords. Carpal tunnel, here I come. I refuse to play my bass without a plectrum (but hey, Carol Kaye and Roger Waters play with plectrums, so maybe that\u0027s ok). I have no coordination on the drums. I ignore or forgot everything I was taught in four years of singing lessons, but I feel like my singing\u0027s more authentic when it\u0027s a mess. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love songs, and I love deconstructing them and putting them back together. And I love arrangements and putting some tiny little spin on a track I grew up hearing. And vocal harmonies are one of the reasons I get up each morning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had it in my craw to record an album for 30 years, and so far I\u0027ve mostly done that in the music room of my apartment. I\u0027ve been a session player for little local projects in a studio, but I\u0027ve never worked on my own tracks except when I\u0027m at home, in my music room with the cat\u0027s litter box.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my ultimate goal is to book a studio, record a proper album, and put it out on vinyl (along with the other formats). Couldn\u0027t possibly afford to do that on my own, but with your help, maybe I could.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeantime, I\u0027ll just keep posting my tracks online, cause each time I get a like on Facebook for a track, or a comment of encouragement on YouTube, it\u0027s like the sun came out just for me. Any pledges would just be a bonus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a bunch of musical friends and family, and I hope to have some of them as guest stars on my videos at some point, if they\u0027re interested. I know a lot of talented people who light my fire creatively.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hope you enjoy, and let me know what you think, what you\u0027d like, or just how your day was. If you\u0027ve gotten this far and haven\u0027t stopped reading yet, I already like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers\u003cbr\u003eGreg"
