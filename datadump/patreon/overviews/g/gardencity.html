    "summary": "Thank you so much for checking us out here. We can\u0027t thank you enough for the opportunity to keep writing and performing songs for a living. Thank you to our fans and patrons who have made it possible. It inspires and motivates us to keep growing and perfecting our craft everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRDLCNkOK4M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eTHE STORY\u003c/h2\u003eJoel and Dan met in college and became the best of friends. They wrote songs and played shows together every chance they had. A growing buzz of potential was felt with each performance. But when they graduated, they ended up in different cities to pursue their own musical careers. While separated, they still collaborated as often as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year (2017), that sustained collaboration has reached a tipping point, and the time to officially launch our band has come. We are Garden City. Though still in different cities, we will be releasing our original songs in the form of live music videos throughout the year. The goal is to release one new song/video a month. With your help, distance will be defeated and beautiful songs and videos will be made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQUICK PATREON EXPLANATION\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eWe think Patreon is brilliant and may be the future of how art gets made. You have the opportunity to pledge a dollar (or however much you like) per song/video that we release, becoming a direct line of support for us in our creative goals. In return you are given various perks and rewards that are for patrons only, as well as inside access to our journey as we continue to grow as professional songwriters and performers. This is not a hit and run model where we make one big push for one big project and hope we get to create something if the money comes in. Patreon provides us a good chance at ongoing creative output, as well as the opportunity to have an ongoing relationship with the people who are most passionate about our work. We will be writing songs, and making videos no matter what. It\u0027s who we are. But with your support, we will absolutely go further than we could alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFAQ\u0027S\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can I cancel my pledge at any time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Absolutely. Pledges can be cancelled at any time. Even Midnight.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What if I pledge a dollar amount per song, and then you put out 50 songs in a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: When setting up your pledge, you set a monthly limit for what you would give. Thank you for thinking we\u0027re prolific. Even so, our plan is one song a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What if I don\u0027t like the stuff you put out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Ouch. But fair. You can cancel your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can have a look around the page here. And please don\u0027t hesitate to get in touch with any additional questions.\u00a0The question of funding is at the center of every creative endeavor, and we believe this platform and community could be the engine of our success. Thanks for checking us out. We would be humbled and honored to have you join the team!\u003cbr\u003e"
