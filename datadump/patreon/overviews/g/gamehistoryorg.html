    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eMy name is Frank, and I\u0027ve spent my entire adult life saving video game history.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been at it since about 1998, when I was helping to locate, buy, and make digital rips of cartridge games. In 2003 I helped legitimize this practice by founding Lost Levels, the first website dedicated to finding and preserving unreleased video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose early days as a budding software pirate blossomed into a video game industry career that has seen me editing websites like Gamasutra and 1UP, working on a pioneering games-on-demand service called GameTap, and over the last few years, becoming a game developer myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven as I did these things, I kept my preservation work going. I\u0027ve always considered it my life\u0027s work, even while maintaining a day job. But it\u0027s just never enough, there\u0027s too much to do. To preserve video games the way they deserve, it would have to be someone\u0027s job. Which made me think...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat if preserving video game history\u00a0\u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0my job?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing. I founded\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gamehistory.org\"\u003eThe Video Game History Foundation\u003c/a\u003e last year. We\u0027re a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation dedicated to figuring out how to save as much video game history as we can, and make it accessible to everyone. Our goal is to make sure that storytellers have what they need to be able to tell the story of video games, and we\u0027re already working through a tremendous backlog of incredible material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWe\u0027re building a digital library of video game history.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an historian myself, I know the kinds of materials that historians rely on to tell stories, so that\u0027s what we\u0027re focusing on right now: gathering, digitizing, and making available video game artifacts, to whoever wants to access it. If you\u0027re a historian, that means a wealth of material to work with. If you\u0027re not a historian, that means lots of cool old video game stuff to look at and play with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBut that\u0027s just the beginning.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re hoping that this is merely the humble start to what will become a larger organization. I want to grow the Foundation into something that lives well beyond my lifetime, and affects some real change in the way that the industry treats its past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo games matter, and we want to make sure their roots are never forgotten. I\u0027m doing this with or without you - this is my job now, for the rest of my life. But the more help I\u0027m able to to get now, the more we can accomplish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThank you, thank you, thank you!!!\u003c/h4\u003e"
