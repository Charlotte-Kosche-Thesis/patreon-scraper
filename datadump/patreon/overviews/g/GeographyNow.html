This page is where you can support GN and get exclusive content only posted up here for Patreon Patrons that the general public does not have access to! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Majority of the money raised here will go towards administrative costs. AKA: Paying for the graphic animators like Ken/ Jared/ Peadar/ Vincent/ and for filming/ animating and placing cornerbox imagerey on the videos for GN. They are the magic behind GN and they work so hard to help pump out the episodes, In the beginning we were lucky to have one episode a month, now we can get about 3-4 WITH flag / Fan Friday episodes as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I am planning to start paying my friends that guest star on the show,(Like KEITH!) they used to do it for free and I appreciated it but the more this channel grows I feel it\u0027s probably a better move to take things professionally and start compensating them financially for their services.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny other hirings will be mentioned if they pop up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeftover money goes towards various other things like buying new equipment (you helped me buy a new Camera for vlogging!) and small life stuff here and there (you\u0027ve helped me pay my internet bill a few times too!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo I don\u0027t waste finances on Shiny new cars and luxury fur coats.

This gives me more time to research, write scripts and host the show in addition to managing social media platforms and other life stuff on the side.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate videos and posts come out to inform you on what the extra patreon money will be spent on. For example we used extra money in the past to buy a a drone for aerial shots in the Heritage trip and Geograbee videos as well as a desk chair and a Bicycle for Ken to get around since he had no means of transporation\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for everything and we are glad you are all helping out with the production of Geography Now!",
