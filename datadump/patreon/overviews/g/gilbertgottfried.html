    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m internationally admired and respected comedian and actor Gilbert Gottfried, and welcome to Gilbert Gottfried\u0027s Amazing Colossal Patreon Page! Before we ask you for money -- which we will do again and again -- you probably want to know WHY we need money in the first place. And if you\u0027re like me, you want to know what the fuck you\u0027re going to get for it. Like when you check into a hotel...you get a night\u0027s sleep, sure, but you also get all the shampoo, hand lotion, Kleenex and toilet paper you can swipe from the room and the housekeeper\u0027s cart. Now that\u0027s value!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, check out some of the stars and showbiz VIPs who\u0027ve been foolish enough to consent to do our podcast: My co-host Frank Santopadre and I have talked to, insulted, and laughed and sang with Carl Reiner, Matthew Broderick, Chevy Chase, Henry Winkler, Jim Gaffigan, Judd Apatow, Dick Cavett (twice), Dick Van Dyke, Norman Lear, Micky Dolenz, Bruce Dern, Jimmy Webb, Steven Wright and many more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s not just \u003cem\u003ewho\u003c/em\u003e the guests are that makes the show what it is; it\u0027s \u003cem\u003ewhat they\u0027re talking about\u003c/em\u003e. For example, where else -- \u003cem\u003eseriously, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ewhere? -- \u003c/em\u003eare you going to hear the stories we cover in lengthy and preposterous detail on \u003cem\u003eGilbert Gottfried\u0027s Amazing Colossal Podcast\u003c/em\u003e? Trust us when we tell you that NO ONE has spent more time discussing the size of Milton Berle\u0027s schmeckle (with the possible exception of Berle himself). And where else will you get (practically) up-to-the-minute updates on Cesar Romero\u0027s proclivity for having citrus fruit tossed at his bare bottom? CNN? The \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e? Forget it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we do\u003cem\u003e so much more\u003c/em\u003e than bringing you salacious innuendo and totally unverifiable rumors. We also track down the \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e stars of Hollywood -- the actors, directors, producers, screenwriters and musicians who made Tinseltown what it was in the glory days. And we dive \u003cem\u003edeep -- \u003c/em\u003eto dig out the long-lost stories and forgotten anecdotes that YOU want to hear! In fact, Frank does so much intensive research that we know things about the guests that they don\u2019t know themselves! And never mind Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence. We track down the people you really want to hear from, like Janet Ann Gallow, a child actress from the 1942 horror flick \u003cem\u003eThe Ghost of Frankenstein\u003c/em\u003e. Janet entertained us with stories about playing hide-and-seek with Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. in their full Igor and Frankenstein costumes! That\u2019s not only the kind of thing you\u0027d only hear on this podcast, but it\u0027s also the childhood I wanted! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs \u003cem\u003eVanity Fair\u003c/em\u003e wrote, \"Gilbert and Frank\u0027s guests \u201ccome with nothing to promote; they\u2019re just there to share great stories and to bask in Gottfried\u2019s and Santopadre\u2019s idolatry.\u201d The \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times \u003c/em\u003eadded, \u201cthe podcast is about something Gottfried holds dear -- the lived lives of show business.\u201d The\u003cem\u003e Village Voice\u003c/em\u003e also summed us up nicely, naming \u003cem\u003eGilbert Gottfried\u2019s Amazing Colossal Podcast! \u003c/em\u003ethe \"Best Podcast of 2015,\" and adding that our \u201cknowledge runs deep.\" The Voice even called me a \u201csurprisingly generous interviewer.\u201d Hey, no one was more surprised than I was! (they also called me an \"aesthete.\"  My lawyers are still trying to figure out what that means, and whether we can take them to court them over it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you love what we\u0027re doing and you share our passion for classic (the more obscure the better) Hollywood, you\u0027re in luck, because there are so many warm and generous ways you can help. Um...actually, there\u0027s only one. Send money! We\u0027re offering ALL NEW AND EXCITING REWARDS via Patreon so sign up for one soon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Or we\u0027ll know you\u0027re just as big a cheapskate as I am).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for your support!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGilbert\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
