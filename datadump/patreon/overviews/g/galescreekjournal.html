    "summary": "The Gales Creek Journal and the Banks Post are two online and print news publications covering the city of Banks, Oregon, and the rural unincorporated communities of Gales Creek, Glenwood, Manning, Buxton, Timber, Roy, Hayward, and many more small mountain and agricultural communities in the far northwestern reaches of Washington County. Most of these communities would not have a source of journalism to tell their stories without the Gales Creek Journal and the Banks Post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Started in 2013 by local residents Matthew and Chas Hundley, the Gales Creek Journal and the Banks Post cover local public interest stories, traffic, construction, natural disasters, local city and county politics, and much more. We\u0027d like to expand our operations to meet the needs of the local community and spread stories and news that are not covered by more traditional papers, but we need YOUR help to do so. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo reports, more in depth stories, better visual equipment (we currently use a cell phone for most of our photography!) newspaper boxes, and more publications that would not fall under the scope of a usual news article are all things we would like to do, but currently cannot without more funding. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur current costs include fuel, website maintenance, printing, business registration fees, business services, event and booth fees, staff pay, and more.\u003cbr\u003eThey all add up quickly, and we\u0027d like to do even more in the community - but we need proper equipment, and need to cover travel costs and business fees first. \u00a0Please help preserve the independance of our area - local and independent news sources are few and far between, and we cherish and love our work, and want to do more! \u00a0\u00a0Every little bit helps out."
