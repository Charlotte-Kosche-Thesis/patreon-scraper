    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Daniel, I\u0027m a 22 year old freelance artist. I\u0027ve been drawing for as long as I can remember, using various different mediums over the years. These days I usually draw digitally with a Cintiq on Manga Studio. I draw a variety of things but my go to has been anthropomorphic animals since the Sonic the Hedgehog days! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my Goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon acts as a tip jar for my current webcomic, Underworld Nightmares, as well as future stories in the Ramosus Chronicles. The benefits on supporting is that you get to see comic pages early and other fun things that wouldn\u0027t show up on the website or other places until much later!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Underworld Nightmares?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUN is a story about an average high school student who gets possessed by a nasty demon. This demon sends the girl to gather her two Vassals (lackeys) who are both trying to live normal human lives after their lives had been cut way too short. The three of them meet and when they do, things take a wrong turn for both the girl and the demon. There are lots of twists and turns in the story and themes of LGBQT if that\u0027s your sort of thing! The comic will  hit a rating of PG-13 but will unlikely go any higher than that. This comic is current main focus for the Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the other comics?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently there are four other separate stories involved in The Ramosus Chronicles, which is the overarching name to all these stories that take place in the same universe. One takes place before UN and is currently untitled but it involves a woman named Ashelin. Then there is Phantom Melody, a monster of the week sort of story that eventually evolves into something deeper. After this in the timeline comes We Are The Hunted, a comic mostly centered around a family curse and wendigos. Lastly, a story to wrap everything together, also currently untitled, but it involves The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse! While all of these comics tie into each other, UN is my current focus! I also have a lot of smaller stories and bonus comics planned to fill in gaps and give you more information on these characters and the world I\u0027ve built!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get For Pledging?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly Access - You have access to pages earlier than anyone else. It could be a day early or several days, depending on the pace I\u0027m it. Even pledging one dollar will allow you to see updates early.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConcepts: What it says on the tin, any concept drawings, sketches, ect that I have for the webcomic. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWIPs: I will sometimes post some Work in Progress things here, whether it be pages or other things. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWallpapers: Once a month I will release new wallpapers which will relate to the comic. These will stay Patreon exclusive for at least 3 months, perhaps even longer, before I release them to the general public. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBonus Side Comics and Concept: Comics that involve UN and some stuff that goes on behind the scenes of the main series. Not required to enjoy the comic but fun things to see regardless.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt Videos are currently ON HOLD until I can figure something out for editing but I do plan to bring them back.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOther Story Concepts: Those other comics I mentioned? Their concepts and such fall under this category. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCameos: Some of you have a chance at being in the comic as some sort of cameo! I\u0027ll try to let you decide how you want to be seen (whether it\u0027s a background character, on a billboard, as a brand) but not everything will be available. I\u0027m limiting this to three people and once they\u0027re gone, I will remove this tier.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
