In a nutshell: you are able to directly support the creators of things that move you.  As with typical Patreon pages, mine has numerous different pledge levels (levels of pledgery?), each with an increasing list of rewards to thank you for your support.  It\u0027s not a small thing to support an artist with a monthly pledge, and I appreciate your consideration. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here on Patreon for a number of reasons, but the most important one is this: I love having a symbiotic relationship with my fans. \u00a0I do my best work with an audience, for an audience, and having monthly expectations will be a proper kick in the butt for me. \u00a0I tend to work like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003econceptualize conceptualize conceptualize!;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etalk about the idea, and reach out to models and artists, friends and acquaintances, and gauge interest in being part of the project;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003econceptualize conceptualize conceptualize!;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003econceptualize some more!;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eget distracted by other ideas for projects;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eeventually come back to the original idea, and start over with reaching out to collaborators. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe big reason I\u0027m on Patreon is that having a monthly product to make available to you wonderful people will help my get projects out of my head and into production. \u00a0Some of these ideas are already in production (specifically my ongoing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gbenjaminensor.com/virago/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVIRAGO Collection\u003c/a\u003e), but some exist only in detailed sprawling notes. \u00a0Patreon will make these shoots happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a journey we\u0027ll be taking together, my friends, and I can\u0027t wait to see where we go. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your love and support,\u003cbr\u003e--G.
