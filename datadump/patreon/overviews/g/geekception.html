This has involved coding (web and traditional apps), tech support (you\u0027re welcome friends and family), tech blogging, radio show host and now as a creator on YouTube via Geekception\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/%E2%80%8Byoutube.com/geekception\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyoutube.com/geekception\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWell Emmanuel, why the backstory?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Glad you did not ask reader, or rather, glad I asked myself lol. As long as I could remember I\u0027ve always been inquisitive and this is what has led to me making YouTube videos today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been so lucky to have such an amazing community behind me, yes, that means you reading this right now!. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that I\u0027ll be able to touch and be touched by so many amazing people from all around the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Emmanuel Olalere and I\u0027m really passionate about sharing my love of technology with the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Patron, Why now??\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gears.jpg\"\u003eWhile I\u0027ve held off pushing my patreon for a long time, the time has come I feel where I really really do need your love and support. If you\u0027ve been following the channel, you must have known that in the middle of this year I had a depressive episode that lasted quite a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you amazing people in the Geekception community really showed your love and support via the comments and DMs and I\u0027m so grateful. What you did not know is why perhaps I had this breakdown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, ever since I\u0027ve taken YouTube serious, I have had to make a ton of sacrifices in every area of my life. Now I\u0027m not asking for pity or charity because of sacrifices,\u003cstrong\u003e no!\u003c/strong\u003e, but this is why I work my ass off juggling between school, events, shooting, editing and meetings. I do not believe in handouts hence why since day 1 I have spent 100% of my funds on Geekception, even sometimes at the detriment of some other responsibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I asking for money now?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWell, it\u0027s simple. I\u0027ve gotten to a stage now where to grow past the stage that I am I need financial support. In the past I have gotten a few jobs here and there but nothing constant enough not to live with mounting debts as I have to now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith me being in my final year of college, having to look for an apartment this month as\u00a0 I\u0027ve been asked to evict my current building and all the miscellaneous expense I have to shell out to keep Geekception going, a little support right now will go a long way, really!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a successful Patreon account would free me having to worry about where my next meal is coming from but rather focus on creating the next best video that I can create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means I\u0027ll be able to create more high quality videos with the ability to bring on additional help when I need to, more variety to the videos and even Patreon specific content should you choose to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney made from this Patreon would go into my upkeep which includes rent and money to be able to go to more events + locations to shoot. It will also go into hiring extra hands when needed as well as acquiring gear to shoot even better videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be posting exclusive Behind the Scenes post to this Patreon page as well as to the secret Facebook group which all Patreon supporters will have access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere will also be exclusive video content posted here on Patreon for supporters\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDamn, I don\u0027t have the money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem my friend. As someone who is totally broke right now I know how you feel. I wouldn\u0027t want you to inconvenience yourself because of me, in fact I want the opposite. As I\u0027ve been doing in almost 4 years now on YouTube, I\u0027ll try to continue making awesome videos as much as current resources permit me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
