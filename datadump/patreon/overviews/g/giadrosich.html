    "summary": "My name is Josh Giadrosich, known online as BikdipOnABus. I\u0027ve been a Youtube Let\u0027s Player (someone who commentates over video games, basically) for a few years. I also stream similar content (on Twitch, under the name \"Skrumpei\"), usually for games where a more laid-back approach is preferable. If you\u0027ve never seen my content before, a brief way to sum up my \"style\" is that I use dry and absurd humor, as well as personal experiences to give that extra touch. The thing that mainly sets me apart is that I\u0027m less... loud than most other LPers. I don\u0027t use facecams, and I try not to pander towards a major demographic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have also made a few amateur games with the Zelda Classic engine, which have received generally positive reviews. They can be found on PureZC.net, under the titles \"Bikdip\u0027s Adventure\", \"Bikdip\u0027s Adventure 2: Electric Boogaloo\", and \"Mitch\". As of 2018, I am officially working on a new game: \"Bikdip\u0027s Adventure 3: A Mitch in the Matrix\". Work on it is very slow and sporadic, but I do like to share my progress with my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor a few years, I treated this account as a secondary job, and had a \"if I earn this much, I\u0027ll make this many videos\" approach to it. I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s best to keep it as a hobby without a strict schedule, however, so think of it as a tip jar. There are still rewards for supporting me, but I will not be basing the amount of normal, free content that I produce off of the amount of money I make from this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me in a tier that has any kind of personalized reward, particularly the cumulative one explained in the $2 \"Bargo\" section, be sure to contact me via PM to let me know the specifics of what you want to do. That is also how I will provide links to the private discord channel explained in the $10 \"Junspinar\" section."

I\u0027m most well-known for being a Let\u0027s Player on Youtube, but I\u0027ve been a professional internet lurker for about as long as the internet has been around. I generally spend most of my free time playing video games (mostly Nintendo ones, as that\u0027s what I grew up with), or feeling like my opinions on things matter, so I decided to combine the two, and people seem to enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA good amount of my material also includes my friends/roommates Martin and Joel, so we usually do streams together, and they occasionally show up in other videos too, depending on the game.

     "description": "The $600 \"goal\" is listed here simply because that\u0027s around what I\u0027ve been making monthly for the past couple years. Surpassing this goal doesn\u0027t necessarily grant any more content (though if a drastic increase is seen I may change my mind on that). And by the same token, dipping below it doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll make less unless I run into unforeseen problems financially and don\u0027t have enough free time to make videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy schedule for making videos and doing streams is mostly based on my work schedule, and is always subject to change. Currently, my goal is to release one public video and one private video (available to $10 tier patrons and above) per week, on average. I will always hold myself to the four private videos per month, as those are being paid for. The public ones may occasionally break schedule if I have too much else going on, but I don\u0027t want this to be a regular occurance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also very slowly working on Bikdip\u0027s Adventure 3, but I don\u0027t have anything approaching an estimated release date for that at this time, and I expect it to take several years to finish, assuming I finish it at all. This is purely a passion project of mine, and any progress made on it will be done independently of the amount of money pledged. It is a fan game using assets from the Zelda series, among others, so even if I wanted to accept donations towards it, legally I would not be able to.\u003cbr\u003e",
