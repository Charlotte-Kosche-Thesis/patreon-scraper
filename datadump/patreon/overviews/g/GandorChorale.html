     "description": "The problem with playing shows for a lot of bands is the booking companies that charge a ridiculous amount of money to audience members who have come out to see 10-20 minutes of their favorite bands play. They charge too much money, overbook, and the evening is a hodgepodgy mess. They expect every band to meet a minimum amount of tickets sold when everyone knows that those shows suck. We want to curate our own shows with like-minded musicians and performance artists at DIY venues and rented spaces. We want to put on lineups that people can enjoy from start to finish and create an experience for both performers and their audience: more than a gig--a celebration, a party! We have plans to throw awesome shows with comedians, all sorts of performance artists, musicians and all kinds of fun noise. The performers will get paid, the audience will donate money, and the DIY space will make some money too so they won\u0027t be forced to closed down like countless other spaces.\u00a0\u003cbr /\u003e",

Fits 4 people without all of our equipment. Did I mention we have a lot of gear? We find ways to make it work, but at the cost of some blood circulation. There is no way we can be in that car with our gear for longer than 30 minutes without something falling off of someone. We had to superglue Cam\u0027s nose back on last time.
