Until\nall my backlog is cleared up the reward tiers (commissions slots)\nwill be closing down. However if you are still donating to the\npatreon the pieces being completed will still go there first before\nmy other galleries. After everthing is caught up the page will likely\nbe rebuilt in a new way so that backlog doesn\u0027t continue to be an\nissue moving forward. I also hope to finally be able fit in personal\nprojects under a new setup.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince\nI have gotten a job art\u0027s been entirely difficult to get to. A lot of\nthis is due to me getting promoted at said job after only 2 days on\nthe job. I originally signed up to unload trucks for a few hours a\ncouple days a week. Now I\u0027m working full time (in hours only\u2026 still\nconsidered part time) with near daily call-ins (yes even on days\nalready worked and days off). It\u0027s been rough to say the least, and\nhas been running me ragged. I was hoping it would calm down, but a\nfew months in and I don\u0027t see an end to it despite my boss always\nsaying otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nArt\u0027s\nnot getting the time it deserves and as such I know patrons are\nstarting to feel shafted. So I\u0027ve decided that closing down the\ncommission slots is the best option. The influx has been drastically\nto high for me to juggle with the job and its put me months behind in\nart. I will still be working on every piece that I have listed, but\ncutting off commission slots here allows me to work on the backlog\nwithout double the amount coming in on top of whatever I finish.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nObviously\neveryone is still free to stay on Patreon and donate to view art\npieces\nas they are completed or cut the funding and go on\nwithout me.\nThough patrons who\nI owe art I ask at least keep an eye on your messages and emails so I\ncan contact them for their pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain\nI apologize for what a mess everything ended up turning into, and it\nwasn\u0027t entirely planned that I\u0027d be working as much as I am. Things\nwill get back up to snuff in time, and when everythings back to\nnormal I hope to have a better patreon where people might get a\nbetter tasting of my more personal ideas and comics to enjoy as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
