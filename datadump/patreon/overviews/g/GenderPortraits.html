The captivating power of the project is in the quantity and diversity of the subjects that are represented. However, creating new work takes time. Our artist also runs the entire project as executive director\u00a0AND she works a second job because we can\u0027t pay her a living wage. You can help us pay Drew Riley so that she can devote more of her time to Gender Portraits and paint new work for the series. Become a patron!",
