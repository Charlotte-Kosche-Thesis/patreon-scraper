    "summary": "Hi, my name is Greg Eckels. I am a New York born Sydney raised photographer who specialises in conceptual art nude photography. Firstly, thanks for stopping by my Patreon! Many of you may already know me from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/greg.eckels/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gregeckelsphotography.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e and perhaps my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gregeckelsphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e where I post censored and sneak peek previews of my ongoing projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first  started my Patreon, I was working part time at a trampoline park and doing as much photography work as possible in my freetime. I did my fair share of Freelance work, but all of the content I produced for my Patreon was done on a TFP basis. In the last six months my lifestyle and career have changed drastically and I am now working full time as a professional Photographer \u0026amp; Videographer for one of the top film companies in Australia. While this has been an amazing opportunity, it has definitely left me with significantly less time to create the art I enjoy working on. In light of this, I had decided to completely rework my patreon, and in complete honesty remove all of my tiers. I will no longer be using Patreon in the conventional way - all of my work NSFW and otherwise, will be available on my Social Media platforms and website - for Free. \u003cbr\u003eThe reasoning behind this is really simple, I create art to create art. So that people can see it and enjoy it and see the beauty in it that I did while creating. While Patreon is a fantastic tool to help aid creators, I do not feel that the restrictions it imposes with regards to my audience reached outweighs the monetary balance. Simply put, I do not want my work to only be available to those who can afford to pay for it.  \u003cbr\u003eInstead, I am going to concentrate on revamping my Etsy store and website in order to maximise the amount of Prints currently available. I will keep my patreon open, but simply for if people wish to donate to my work and help me out on my journey.  I eventually want to start releasing conceptual books and E-books.\u003cbr\u003eSo, you can find me at the following: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/greg.eckels/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e  | \u003ca href=\"http://gregeckelsphotography.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e  | \u003ca href=\"http://www.gregeckelsphotography.com/\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e  | \u003ca href=\"https://500px.com/greg_eckels\"\u003e500px\u003c/a\u003e  | \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/au/people/TrueTraceur1\"\u003eEtsy \u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eand who knows, perhaps when Patreon is a little more developed in the coming years and they have ironed out some of their kinks, I will look at starting back up properly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
