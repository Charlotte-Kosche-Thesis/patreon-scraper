    "summary": "GardenFork.TV is a YouTube and iTunes video show that I produce and host. I make DIY videos about an eclectic array of subjects: Cooking, Home Improvement, Beekeeping, Car Repair, Foraging, and other fun stuff. In addition to the video show, I host \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/gardenfork-radio-diy-podcast/id330291397?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGardenFork Radio\u003c/a\u003e, an audio podcast and post regularly to the \u003ca href=\"http://gardenfork.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGardenFork.TV\u003c/a\u003e website. I\u0027ve been doing this for over 10 years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started a Patreon support page so fans of GardenFork become monthly supporters of us and help us create\n more GardenFork videos, podcasts, plus interesting posts on our site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuy GF A Cup of Coffee\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can support GardenFork starting at $3/month, which is about the cost of a cup of good coffee. Consider having one less coffee each month, and sending us that $3. Your monthly support will allow us to upgrade our video equipment, buy new hard drives, and hire someone part time to help produce the show and website. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If you\u0027d like to support GardenFork with a one time payment, use our \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026amp;hosted_button_id=F3V4PPNJFZKBN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePayPal account here\u003c/a\u003e, thx!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t you already make money on the web?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, we do make some money from ads on YouTube, Amazon links, and product review videos, but its not nearly enough to make GardenFork sustainable. While the number of video views per month keeps rising, our YouTube revenue per viewer keeps dropping. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo $ from iTunes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe receive no revenue from iTunes, where about 1/3 of our audience is. Your monthly support will allow us to keep posting to iTunes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp Us Be Less Dependent On Ad Revenue\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. With your monthly support, we can make GardenFork better. I can spend less time \u0027chasing eyeballs\u0027 ie: ad revenue, and more time making great content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt Costs $ To Produce GardenFork\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt might not seem like it, but it costs money each month to produce GardenFork videos. The hosting fees for our website, the email newsletter service, etc. and gear keeps breaking. Like when I ruined the lens making the sap evaporator... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, at the basic level of $3/month, your monthly support is less than a cup of coffee each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow here is a list of perks of becoming a sustaining supporter of GF. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll GF Patrons will get exclusive posts from me via Patreon. These will be photos, behind the scenes stuff, thoughts, questions, and an occasional Google hangout or Skype conference, all just for those who are supporting GardenFork thru Patreon. When I share something new, you\u0027ll get an email from our Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to check this out, I\u0027d appreciate it if you\u0027d consider becoming a Patron. thx! eric. \u003cbr\u003e"
