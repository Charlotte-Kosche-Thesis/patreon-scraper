     "about": "GreenActionNews is founded by JD Sullivan who is passionate since 9th grade Earth Science class about environmental concerns. In 2011, JD earned a B.A. in Journalism/Mass Communication. Shortly thereafter, JD produced a talk radio show, PaleoRadio with host Jeremiah Bannister.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, JD launched GreenActionNews, and went to various events to put his reporting skills to practice covering environmental events. One of the things that stuck out for JD was how often he was the only news media present at these events. Over time, he saw this more and more and when the mainstream media did cover environmental events, activists were portrayed in a negative light. So from there, JD has been working on making GreenActionNews a worldwide leader in environmental news coverage with a dedication to journalistic integrity and objectivity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoing so means GreenActionNews needs regional editors and about 9 contributing writers in each region to find and tell the stories of grassroots environmental activism in every corner of the world. We expect to compensate these writers fairly for their time, skill and effort. And in order to devote the time this project needs, we expect JD to also be compensated enough so that he does not have to be distracted from this project in order to earn a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to finding talented writers to hop onto this endeavor, the website needs some additional technology. In the long range, JD plans to launch a podcast version of our news to maximize the number of people who can become aware of what is going on and to get involved. But in the near future, JD has a plan to develop a way for grassroots activists and our writers to connect with each other more easily. In the overall budget, the technology is a small piece, but it must be in place for everything else to come into place efficiently and effectively. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur campaign is set up with manageable clear goals based on funding for technology, funding for the editors, writers and JD, and funding for operations. A goal is not a goal unless it has a deadline, so JD has set mini-goals over a one-year time span to work toward the overall goal of development. The deadlines are based on observances of environmental interests in our calendar. As each goal is achieved, Patreon will automatically open the next goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at the goal we are working on now and the rewards offered to those who contribute at different levels -  and please give $1 or more to help us reach our current goal. Your support is greatly appreciated and noticed. Thank you!",
