I live in California, having come to San Francisco in 2008 to do an MFA in fine art at CCA. I live with my husband, our dog Rose and our cat Aura, in a little cabin near Tilden Regional Park. I sing in a band called Dire Wolves, and my husband and I have a band called LAPIS. I make paintings and drawings that describe energetic space. Energetic space is felt space, the reality that we experience with our bodies. My artwork is professional research informed by my own experiences and the traditions of Indian tantric painting, spiritualist painting, surrealism and abstract expressionism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of years ago I read an article in the East Bay Express, Oakland\u0027s art/news weekly about the indie gamer scene. The article mentioned how some indie game designers, specifically women and queer-identifying folks, were using the website called Patreon.com to connect with fans and get support for their creations, which were outside of the boundaries of the kinds of projects that usually get commercial support. I was immediately intrigued by this new infrastructure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy motivation for being an artist is to shed light on this experience of being alive, for the benefit of all. Ever since finishing my MFA degree in 2010 I\u0027d been trying to figure out how to be a practicing artist who can take part in the cultural dialogues of our time, without being dominated or influenced by the agendas of the \"art market\". Patreon seemed like the answer I was looking for. A community of creators and supporters of the arts who were making things happen for each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
