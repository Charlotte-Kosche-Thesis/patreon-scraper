Here are some suggestions after asking people what they think Gwulo\u0027s value is to them. (All the numbers below are amount-per-month, and in US$, the currency that Patreon uses. I\u0027ve added HK$ and \u00a3\u00a0equivalents in brackets.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$1 (\u003cem\u003eHK$8 / \u00a30.70\u003c/em\u003e) \u2013 Reading Gwulo\u0027s newsletters is like reading a magazine I buy occasionally.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$3 (\u003cem\u003eHK$24 / \u00a32.10\u003c/em\u003e) \u2013 I read Gwulo\u0027s newsletters and visit the website.

(One example quoted to me was\u003cem\u003e \"I think for me a better comparison would be my subscription to Ancestry.co.uk \u2026 I have the middle one of this, (not worldwide, my local library provides that) \u2026 which costs me about \u00a3100 a year.

Just think of it as a level of contribution. More about rewards below.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can change the amount to whatever you like: lucky $2.88? No problem. Type in the amount you want to contribute each month (don\u0027t forget it is in US$), and click the Continue button.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be asked to login.

If you look at other pages you\u0027ll see things like \"Pledge $ABC and I\u0027ll send you a new XYZ each month\". But then I\u0027d be spending time doing stuff that doesn\u0027t help Gwulo get better. I\u0027d rather put my energy into Gwulo, so I\u0027m not using the rewards part of Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t become a patron? Does anything change?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing changes. All the content on Gwulo needs to stay freely available to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people only visit Gwulo a few times for help with a specific question. Others may not be able to afford to make a regular contribution. Others may feel they contribute material to Gwulo, and that\u0027s enough for now. That\u0027s all fine - whether you\u0027re a patron or not, Gwulo works just the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you plan to use the monthly contributions to fund new projects?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo. You may be thinking of Kickstarter, which is about raising funds for a new project. \"Help me raise $100,000, then I\u0027ll ... publish a book / make a film / etc.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Patreon is about providing recurring funding to let people keep doing what they\u0027re doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you won\u0027t make any changes because of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. I\u0027ve already written about the plans for the year - see \"\u003ca href=\"http://gwulo.com/node/30082\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGwulo in 2016\u003c/a\u003e\" \u2013 and will continue working on them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you asking for patrons to contribute?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are monthly expenses to pay (hosting mainly), and occasional expenses for computer hardware and software. In addition\u00a0I spend at least 20-30 hours each week working on Gwulo. All the other bills of family life in Hong Kong still have to be paid, so I\u0027m asking for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut Gwulo is built on the work of many volunteers, why should you be paid for your time?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGwulo would only be a fraction of the site it is without the contributions of many volunteers. For some of our regular contributors, they\u0027ve put in hundreds of hours of time over the years. If asking for patrons turns away these contributors, I\u0027ll have to think of some other solution instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I think most people realise that there\u0027s a lot of time spent behind the scenes keeping Gwulo working and growing - dealing with spam, handling upgrades, adding / coding new features, answering questions by email, keeping the website tidy, etc, etc. I hope that this, plus the fact that becoming a patron is completely optional, will make it acceptable to Gwulo\u0027s readers and contributors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you doing this now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGwulo continues to grow and take more time. Family expenses (school fees!) don\u0027t get any less. Having turned down offers of support with costs in the early years, recently I\u0027ve been thinking to ask for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I heard about Patreon. Though it\u0027s still quite new (started in 2013), it shows that people are willing to support creators whose work they value. It appears to work best when those creators already have an established audience, so they\u0027re receiving support from people who know their work, not trying to build something new from scratch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGwulo has been running for long enough I hope it\u0027s clear what it\u0027s all about, and whether it has value. So I\u0027m hoping the Patreon model can work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also another reason. It\u0027s been ten years since I wrote that first post about the air raid shelters under Kowloon Park. That starts me thinking about the next ten years. Then coincidentally I\u0027ve been asked about \u0027sustainability\u0027 by several people recently. (Not the recycle and climate change type of sustainability, but how to give Gwulo a long life.) I haven\u0027t given it a lot of thought yet, but support from patrons could be part of the answer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo do you think it\u0027ll work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not sure! Looking through Patreon there are some remarkable successes (A knitting magazine receiving US$18,000 / HK$ 140,000 per issue! \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/knitty).\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/knitty).\u003c/a\u003e But there are also plenty that have run for several months and just have one or two patrons (hi mum!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hopeful, but let\u0027s see what happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid\u003cbr\u003e"
