    "summary": "Greetings.\nWe thank you so much for visiting our patreon page. People usually don\u0027t even\nbother to click on that link, so let us thank you once again. :))\u003cbr\u003e\nNow that you\u0027re here, we know that you care about the life of game developers and we have prepared these things for you to read.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you hate texts, don\u0027t worry. You can skip to TL;DR section at the very bottom of\nthis post. But we believe you won\u0027t do that, right?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a very small team consist of only 2 guys. One is responsible for the Programming (plus every other thing we need. 3D Animation, VFx, Story Writing, Game Design, etc), and the other one is responsible for all of the 2D and 3D Graphics (also, plus many things).\u003cbr\u003eBut before that, we were just a JRPG and Anime lover who wanted to create something that other people can enjoy. Then we started to learn creating games.\u003cbr\u003eAfter around 3 years worth of failure, we can finally create a decent game called Epic Conquest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4760/38468538620_303b365fb4_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Epic Conquest\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s our project started on November 2015. After so many failures on previous minigame projects, we finally come to our senses, that what we ever wanted is to make an RPG. So, this project is our last resort. That was quite ambitious, since our game development skill was not very advanced, and clearly there\u0027s sooooo many things to do for the 2 of us.\u003cbr\u003eSometimes we thought that it\u0027s impossible to finish this game alone, and we\u0027ve abandoned the project few times for 8 months. But after those struggles, Epic Conquest\u0027 first chapter is ready.\u003cbr\u003eYes. Just the first chapter, 2 hours play time, and it took us 2 years!\u003cbr\u003eAfter we launched this game to PlayStore last October, we were so happy that people really liked it. Reading the reviews and messages gives us a new spirit to continue developing this game.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently the game is only 50% finished (2nd Chapter). We\u0027re planning to make 4 Chapters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4759/26406458648_ba49b44280_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course developing a game is very hard, and time consuming. One chapter can take around 3 months of development even if we hire people to help.\u003cbr\u003eAlthough people like our game, and they give very positive reviews, the download rate per day is not very high because we don\u0027t spend a buck on marketing. Of course we want more people to enjoy the game, BUT that\u0027s only when the game is fully completed.\u003cbr\u003eThe revenue from Epic Conquest is actually enough to pay for our living expenses, paying the rent, and upgrading our tools for development. But it\u0027s barely enough to hire people, buy musics for the game, and so many other things.\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention that there\u0027s so many hack/mods out there that don\u0027t give us any download counts / ratings / reviews to boost Epic Conquest rank in the PlayStore chart.\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you want to support us, we hope that you want to become our Patron, to help us sustain the development of Epic Conquest, and better games in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you will get\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou will get these rewards based on your pledge\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e-\u003cem\u003e Community Vote\u003c/em\u003e : Sometimes we can\u0027t decide what to do for the story, or costume design, monster design, anything. You can vote to help us decide.\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cem\u003eSecret WIPs\u003c/em\u003e : Access to any progress that we make. The process of creating 3d models, animations, 2D sketches for the characters, the background, monsters, and many more. Well, not so secret anymore. We might spam post the WIPs on productive weeks.\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cem\u003eDigital Artbook\u003c/em\u003e : We\u0027ll collect every artwork into a PDF after the game completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy new character as the Goal\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBelieve it or not, creating a new character is so painful. It takes around 2 months to complete, which means the Chapter update will be delayed. And the game will be finished much longer. Our top priority right now is to finish the story, and the game.\u003cbr\u003eBut if we get enough support, we will include a new character in the upcoming chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we going to do after Epic Conquest finished\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is the first time we get feedback from players. Their suggestion is sometimes quite overwhelming to handle, because the code/program is written 2 years ago when we were still learning. There are things that can\u0027t be implemented because of the system we made.\u003cbr\u003eBut, we have listed every single suggestion that can be our guide to make a better game next time. We hope you will continue the support as long as we create games. :))\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe need money to sustain the development.
