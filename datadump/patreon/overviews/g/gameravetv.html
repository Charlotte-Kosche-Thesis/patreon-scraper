You\u0027re the reason I do what I love, and I love making your retro gaming life that much more complete.

Pleasure to meet you! Original PlayStation fan numero uno and long time contributor to the gaming world at large through various outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it exactly that you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://Game-Rave.com\"\u003eGame-Rave.com\u003c/a\u003e is the go-to source for gamers and collectors. Along with creating reviews, features, and video content, the site focuses on the literal full set of USA released Sony PlayStation game titles. This includes all known variations like Greatest Hits and Collectors Editions, obscure releases with the Lightspan Educational Library, and doing crazy projects like the 5 Second Video and the Living History Updates.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI also cover the Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast, LaserActive, Sega CD, Turbo Duo / Grafx-16, and Neo Geo CD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s actually kind of cool.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know, right? I try and be as available to everyone as I can. You have questions, I hopefully have answers. Game-Rave\u2019s database of information has been used in Wikipedia, in eBay seller descriptions, published in collector\u2019s guides, and more. I was even featured in the Guinness Book of World Records: Gamer Edition. As time goes on, more and more content will be hitting the site, as future expansions are already being planned for more types of data.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what happens with my Patreon Funds?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll Patreon funds go 100% directly back into the site and show. In the past, this included green screen special effects, allowed upgrades to the lights used, and more. Currently it includes software licensing (we use many of the Adobe Cloud programs for production), site finances, and other hidden costs. Once those are covered, the remainder is put towards any physical items needed to maintain a 100% accurate variant database.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNifty. So what do I, the Patron, get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour patronage supports the content you love, and allows for more of what you love to be created. Any amount - regardless of amount - is donated on a monthly basis. Think of it as a tip jar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor your patronage, various benefits are automatically included, and more arrive based on the amount pledged. No matter your contribution, you have your name permanently etched into the YouTube end-credits (even if you move on), early 3 Day Access to all new weekly episodes, and my behind-the-scenes commentaries and ramblings. Other bonuses include \u003cstrong\u003epermanent credits at the end of every episode\u003c/strong\u003e, your name and personal web-site linked from \u003ca href=\"http://Game-Rave.com\"\u003eGame-Rave.com\u003c/a\u003e, as well as receiving an exclusive, hand drawn postcard from me.
