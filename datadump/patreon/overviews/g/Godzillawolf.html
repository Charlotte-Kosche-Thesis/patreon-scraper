    "summary": "Hello everyone, I\u0027m known as Godzillawolf, Kendell2, Kendell, and Pony Discord. I like to make pony art work, fanfictions, tumblr blogs, Minecraft and other gaming videos, and am looking to get into video analysis as well once I get the kinks ironed out. I\u0027m also an avid Kamen Rider, Power Rangers, and Steven Universe fanatic and enjoy making content for those fandoms as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an amateur voice actor who\u0027s done roles in the Pony POV Series audio adaptation and would like to do more readings of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an avid minecrafter and love to build in that blocky digital world. I\u0027m currently working on massive build of the Den-Liner from Minecraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also occasionally write song lyrics (I\u0027m not a good composer, but have a mind for lyrics).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy best known works are the Getting Back on Your Hooves Verse (first story co-written with Shadow Raiko), The Legend of Spyro: A New Dawn (currently on hold), and my work as a beta reader and co-writer in the Pony POV Series (I\u0027m no longer involved in that project presently). I\u0027m also the creator of the Ask Pony Discord and Ask Twilight and Copycat tumblrs, both of which I intend to update more frequently, which is part of the reason I\u0027ve established this Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, my family life is currently undergoing an upheaval of a very private nature and my family is in desperate need of money, which is why I haven\u0027t been updating my stories and blogs as frequently as I once did. If I begin getting a cash flow from Patreon, I can afford to dedicate myself more fully to my fanworks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen my life is not in turmoil, I\u0027m normally a very active content creator, pumping out updates to my blog and fanworks on a weekly basis, so if I can make enough via patreon to help my family, I\u0027ll be able to pump out fanworks on a regular basis. This is why I\u0027m asking for per month, because I think in the long run that will make life easier on everyone once I start pumping things out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I begin getting a big enough gain, I\u0027ll be able to afford to boost my quality further by buying better programs and more toys to review, as well as see movies that I can review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a college graduate with a Bachelor\u0027s of English Arts, which I\u0027ve been working to apply to my content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, of course I\u0027m not going to be a big old jerk and ask you to help me out with nothing in return, that\u0027d be nasty of me wouldn\u0027t it? Down below you\u0027ll find your rewards for helping me out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
