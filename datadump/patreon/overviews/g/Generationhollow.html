To make people laugh, to make people happy, to make people think, hell just to even make them impressed. I knew I just had to do it myself. I picked up a copy of Fraps, and using Windows Movie Maker, I created my first video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a hobby, something I just enjoyed for myself. I made videos for my friends, for the 5 people out there who watched them, I made them because it made me happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7 Years, almost 2000 videos and Hundreds of Streams later, I\u0027m 24 Years old and it\u0027s still my Hobby, it\u0027s still my Passion, it makes me very happy to do. Only now, I dedicate myself to it, it\u0027s even more than a Hobby, it is my life. I\u0027m able to earn enough money to get by on, doing something I\u0027m filled with Passion for, something that makes me happy to do. That is unbelievable and for however long I can do this, I won\u0027t ever regret it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo after a couple years of this strange, wonderful place I find myself in I\u0027m finally making a Patreon. The purpose of this, is to allow me to continue doing this. I want to feel secure in that I can pay living costs and importantly, the gear to keep making more. To keep doing this thing I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has taken me a long time to ask for this and anyone who wishes to support me finally can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and Thank you to anyone who\u0027s ever enjoyed what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Join the Discord Server!:\u00a0https://discord.gg/MzpNEak)\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve always wanted to do this!\u003cbr\u003eUsing Adobe Premier Pro has been a dream come true, I\u0027ve been putting in money to use it and buy 3rd party kits like the fancy new Transitions you\u0027ve seen in videos. I\u0027d love to put some money aside to use some more!\u003cbr\u003eA quality Video Camera would be fantastic. I\u0027ve been using my Webcam for everything at home, and a cheap Camcorder for travel. It limits my potential to include RL stuff in videos, from skits to background footage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach this goal, I would plan to slowly improve and replace old equipment ontop of this.",
