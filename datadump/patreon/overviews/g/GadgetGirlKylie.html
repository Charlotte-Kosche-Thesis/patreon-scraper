    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi guys GadgetGirlKylie here!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt means a lot to me that any of you would consider helping me out by becoming a Patron. Doing youtube full time and trying to earn a living is difficult when the earnings fluctuate from month to month. I started in 2012 and in 2017 i\u0027ve had to setup a patreon and ask for help! Even if you pledge $1 that still supports me greatly and mitigates the financial blow of those viewers who do use AdBlock. Helping me by becoming a patron means that I can continue to do this full time and give you guys regular fun content to watch! It means that I can buy more games and replace equipment more easily, bringing you guys the latest games and best quality videos I possibly can! You are literally helping me to fulfill my dream! Thanks \u003cstrong\u003eTEAMGGK\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes you unique / different to other YouTubers?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI only play games I enjoy on my channel and my opinion will never be for sale. My commentary / thoughts / impressions are 100% honest. I cover mainstream games but I also cover the more niche obscure games as well, including Japanese language games. This means that the growth of my channel is slow and i\u0027m not chasing trending games. I don\u0027t want to simply upload something to make money. Unfortunately playing what you want to play doesn\u0027t mean a stable income on youtube, I know this all too well since I\u0027ve been running my channel this way since it began in 2012. I have over four thousand four hundred videos on the channel and each one has been made with dedication and passion. It\u0027s always disheartening to see a game series not do well on YouTube after spending such time, energy and love on it. So if you decide to become a patron you are providing direct support and helping me to play the games I want! Making me truly happy in my job every time I hit record! Help Senpai to have the happy feels :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you decide to become a Patron, thank you so much! If not, then thank you for looking and maybe consider the other options listed below to help out. Every single TeamGGK member is important to me no matter what you decide. Thank you for reading and take it easy guys!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther ways to make a donation outside of Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a \u003ca href=\"https://streamlabs.com/gadgetgirlkylie\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStreamLabs Link\u003c/a\u003e on my youtube channel which is the best way to donate because paypal only take a small % from any donations. \u00a0You can find this on my channels \u0027Home\u0027 page on the banner and in most live stream / video descriptions. Due to low youtube earnings we have monthly goals on streamtip, which is based off the current support here on patreon and youtube AdRev conditions. It\u0027s very important that we hit these goals to sustain the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternatively you may wish to send me PSN points via my email address. I have a UK PSN and NA PSN so cards in \u00a3 or $ will help. I also have Nintendo consoles so EShop points in \u00a3 help. Please ONLY use this email for this purpose, do not send me questions using my email. This is for business inquiries mainly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can find my email address on my Twitter and Youtube page\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GadgetGirlKylie\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/GadgetGirlKylie\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther ways you can help at no extra cost!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiking videos, adding my videos to your favourites, sharing videos, commenting on videos, turning off AdBlock for my channel. Some examples -\u00a0A great thing to do if you turn AdBlock off is to leave one of my long playlists on while you go out or overnight. Also sharing my videos and playlists on gaming forums, Twitter and other such places is great!\u00a0ALL of these things as individual actions help my channel immensely and are very much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a PlayAsia partner. This means that by making sales I get a small commission and I get monthly credit to spend on the PlayAsia website. This allows me to buy games for the channel and it\u0027s a \u003cstrong\u003eHUGE HELP\u003c/strong\u003e. To keep this partnership I have to meet sales targets though.  You can buy anything from PlayAsia using my affiliate link and it will help the channel. \u003cbr\u003eYou can even buy Digital games, Computer software, Playstation Network, Itunes, Xbox Live, Nintendo eShop and prepaid cards on there, getting the codes within minutes! \u00a0Also all of these things can be bought in different currency for different region accounts! This is a great way to show support outside of being a patron at no extra cost to you. Use this link to make purchases \u003ca href=\"http://www.play-asia.com/?tagid=999538\"\u003ehttp://www.play-asia.com/?tagid=999538\u003c/a\u003e as long as you go through this link it counts as a sale for me and gives a small channel \u00a0commision tip :) You could even bookmark this link to use as your main PlayAsia page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 order = 1 sale for me. So even if you have multiple items in 1 order it is still only one sale.\nIf it doesn\u0027t impact you with shipping, then you can help with sales by making one order at a time, for multiple items you are buying\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also get a $3 discount on orders of $20 or more! Excluding cash equivalent items. Use GGKCOUP at checkout to get things more cheaply!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
