    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAs of March 2018, this patreon has been converted from per content to monthly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFormerly, this Patreon was for \u003ca href=\"http://gomakemeasandwich.wordpress.com/\"\u003emy blog of the same name\u003c/a\u003e. However, in 2016 I shut down the blog due to long-running harassment and my inability to deal with the emotional fallout of that harassment - though everything I wrote for Go Make Me a Sandwich is still available and can be freely referenced by anyone who wishes to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo who am I?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, my name is Anna Kreider, and I\u2019m a game designer, illustrator, and writer who is the brain behind the popular feminist gaming blog \u003ca href=\"http://gomakemeasandwich.wordpress.com/\"\u003eGo Make Me a Sandwich\u003c/a\u003e, a blog which critically examines sexism and misogyny as it affects all areas of gaming. GMMaS has accrued more than 2.6 million views to date, and has helped real change to occur in the games industry. I also design games about social justice and gender, including The Starlit Kingdom, Autonomy, and The Watch - my most recently published game, which is about women and nonbinary people smashing patriarchy in a dark fantasy setting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, I attempted to return to Patreon after a lengthy hiatus by cleaning up old datasets from my blog with the intent to eventually do new ones. However, that work kept getting put on hold, because it didn\u2019t really have my attention anymore. And importantly, there was always important work that needed doing around social justice and making and holding space for marginalized people in the games community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, it made me realize that that work that kept getting in the way of what I said I wanted to do was what I was really passionate about, and that since I\u2019ve been thinking about converting my Patreon to monthly for a long, long time, maybe I should just do it already.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why should you support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make space for marginalized people in gaming, both as creators and participants. How do I do this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI describe problems that are acting as barriers to marginalized creators and players in ways that start conversations and get people to pay attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I don\u2019t post actively to my blog anymore, I am still very active on Google+ and Twitter. Something I spend a lot of time doing is observing patterns of interaction and putting them into words in ways that clarify the problem for people with privilege. \u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AnnaKreider\"\u003eSome threads that have gotten a lot of traction on my public Google+ page include\u003c/a\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e#Metoo and reprocessing things you didn\u2019t know were terrible at the time\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMasculinity, the limitations of imagination, and violence\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGames centering not-men and the dilemma of commercial success requiring men to think that those games are really about them\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInclusivity and the impossibility of being inclusive AND staying neutral\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to professionally connect with a woman without being weird or creepy\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also pretty good at making viral threads on Twitter about social justice stuff. Here are some things that I\u2019ve gotten a lot of views for yelling at Twitter about the past few months:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e#timesup, #metoo, and how gaming isn\u2019t going to shape up any time soon if they can\u2019t even get International Women\u2019s Day memes right\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSocial justice party balance is important\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCyber harassment and why it traumatizes people for life\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWomen don\u2019t tell men about rattling sexist encounters because they\u2019re so fucking normal that we forget about them almost right away\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI also travel to a lot of conventions to do panels\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e2017 was a banner year for conventions for me! And I got to be on a lot of great panels, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMetatopia: Cruel to be kind - designing games that hurt\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMetatopia: We have always GMed\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMetatopia: Mental illness and addiction - you can still make your game\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBreakout 2017: Illustrating for RPGs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFanExpo: Panels on GMing and Freelancing\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMost importantly: I do a lot of labor (both emotional and actual) to make and hold space for marginalized people in games\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is just some of the work that I have been doing the past few months:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI spend A LOT of spoons on emotional labor for marginalized people who are having trouble existing in games. There are so many marginalized people in our community that are hurting because they feel unseen and unheard and I do what I can to support these people when I can.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI co-organize a gaming space that is chock full of gender diverse and queer folks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen I have spoons to spare, I take on some social justice tanking to pull focus on issues that are making people feel unheard, but where some backlash will be drawn.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have used my position of \u201cauthority\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d to push people with power to make real, meaningful change.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd here are some things that I hope to be able to do in the upcoming months, in addition to community organizing, ongoing emotional labor and awareness-raising\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019ve devoted a lot of time and brainpower to the question of how to make it so that privileged gamers buy games by and about folks who don\u2019t look like them, and I\u2019ve started having serious planning conversations with a few folks about getting something new off the ground to help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to be able to distill everything that I have learned about being a self-publishing game designer into easy accessible ways that make it easier for marginalized gamers to get into game design - including making tools to help people doing DIY game layout. I also want to make a publicly accessible version of the tool I made myself for budgeting and planning my most recent Kickstarter, since the budget ended up being greatly successful.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportantly, this is not a permanent commitment.
