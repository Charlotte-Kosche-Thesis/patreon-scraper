A world where proud humans fight for control of land and resources, side by side with giant, sapient animals.\u00a0Whether it\u2019s the cat-riding Gyb, the fierce Sanglier, the lizardfolk of Tchudeka, or even the Church of the Chimera, all fight to claim the most valuable natural resource of all: Yellowdust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore valuable than gold and rarer by far, yellowdust is mined in secret throughout the world. It has miraculous healing powers - a paste made from this substance can cure even serious wounds. As well, given in measured doses over a month, yellowdust can uplift any animal of sufficient size into a giant, big enough to be ridden by a human, and regular dustmeals will maintain its intelligence. But yellowdust is rare, and tensions run high as supplies of this vital substance run dry\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54ff32bee4b020d91e65b7e4/t/5a48f575f9619ae3bb5b68e5/1514730887733/About+the+Project.png?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Steve Cook. I\u0027ve had several pieces of fiction published over the last few years, both traditionally and through self-publishing. During that time, I\u0027ve been working to develop the world of Giant\u0027s Reach, and now I would love to bring it to you,\u00a0one story at a time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron of this project means that, from just $3, you\u0027ll receive an exclusive short story every month, both in text and Kindle format. At higher levels, I\u0027ll be able to send you the stories as printed booklets. Your support will enable me to develop the world still further, to collaborate with artists and other creators, and to continue to write the novel I am currently working on, set in the world of Giant\u0027s Reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons at $5 and above will also receive three anthologies of my previously-published short stories from other worlds, both science fiction and fantasy, as well as the monthly story. These are normally only available to buy through Amazon, and feature over fifteen short stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $9, each Patron can chat with me and get involved with creating lore for the world - an animal group, a short story idea, an institution. That lore might find its way into a short story, a blog post, or even a novel. The world is wide, and the possibilities are endless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I have funding goals that mean more content for you. As soon as we get to $50/month, I\u2019ll be pairing my writing with illustrations by a variety of artists. You\u2019ll get this artwork in your inbox at no extra cost or effort to you. At $300/month, I\u2019ll be able to record each short story and make it available to you as a Patron-only podcast. The end goal for now is $1500/month, which would allow me to put my day job on the back-burner to make way for more content - both short stories and longer pieces. At that point, I\u2019d be able to double the amount of short stories sent out to you each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a taster, here are two short stories from the world of Giant\u0027s Reach, both available for free:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Uplifted\u0027, a prequel to my novel Claws of the Chimera. Gita, the daughter of a nobleman, begins to find her way in the world as a soldier in the army. But life in the Duke\u0027s Guard is very different to that which she has known, and both Gita and her feline counterpart, Nan\u00e9, soon find themselves fighting for their very survival.\u003cbr\u003eClick for \u003ca href=\"http://stevecookfiction.com/uplifted-pdf\"\u003ePDF\u003c/a\u003e, for \u003ca href=\"http://stevecookfiction.com/uplifted\"\u003eweb\u003c/a\u003e, or for \u003ca href=\"http://stevecookfiction.com/uplifted-kindle\"\u003eKindle\u003c/a\u003e format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Feathered Death\u0027, a tale of grizzled war veterans trying to find a place in a world that has moved on.
