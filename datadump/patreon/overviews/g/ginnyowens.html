    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come! I\u2019ve\nbeen a singer/songwriter for nearly two decades, and I love connecting with my\nfans. I released my first book in 2014, I blog regularly, and in 2016, I\ncreated the \u201cHow I See It\u201d video series, which offers a window into my world as\na person who happens to be blind. There are so many other ways I want to reach\nout, connect with you, and give you cool content, but all of that costs money,\nand as an indie artist, I pay out of pocket. With your help, I will be able to\nnot only create positive, thoughtful content, but also produce it more often. Here\nare some of the things your patronage will support:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMusic\u003cbr\u003e\n\nInstead of releasing an album every 18 months or so, I\u2019d\nlove to release a new song every 4-6 weeks, and then compile a cd to sell at\nconcerts after a year. These days, many fans enjoy streaming music and\nlistening to individual songs by many different artists instead of an entire\nalbum by one artist. Creating and releasing songs individually or in groups of\n3 or 4 is much more cost effective than making a whole album all at once. As a\npatron, you\u2019ll hear the music I\u2019m creating before anyone else does, and in our\nhangouts, you\u2019ll get to hear about the heart and direction my music is taking\nnext.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nVideos\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMany of you have said you enjoy watching my lyric, live\nperformance, and How I See It videos. Your patronage will help me produce them\nin a sustainable fashion, and you\u2019ll also get to hear and see the making of these\nvideos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPodcast\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love podcasts so much and would love to produce one\u2014or\nperhaps several\u2014myself. I recently created the pilot episode of the \u201cHow I See\nIt\u201d podcast, which you\u2019ll get to hear as a Patreon supporter. Podcasts take an\nincredible amount of time and effort to produce. And did I mention money?\nMaking a podcast is ridiculously expensive, y\u2019all. You\u2019ll get a\nbehind-the-scenes look, and the opportunity to offer your ideas and opinions in\nour hangout chats.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCourses and Workshops for Writers\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne of my passions is empowering other creative folks to\ncreate. I\u2019d love to offer some online courses and workshops for those who wish\nto express their hearts through various types of creativity, and with your\nsupport, I can. I will bring in the best experts to help teach, too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nConcerts\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLast but not least, I\u2019d love to be able to offer concerts to\nchurches and venues that can\u2019t afford them. As a patron, you\u2019ll be helping me\ndo that. And as a thank-you for your partnership, several tiers of support\nreceive backstage access at concerts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for partnering with me in these ventures\nof creativity! I look forward to being on this journey with you.\u003cbr\u003e"
