    "summary": "Hey Everyone and welcome to the official Patreon page of Gorte\u0027s Adventures. My name is C.J and I create Youtube Gaming videos along with Vlogs. I started Youtube October of last year, in 2017, my goal for Youtube is to make people smile. Make them laugh, and happy even if it is for just a split second. It really is my goal in life to make people happy, and smile, and laugh. I know how it feels to be depressed, and lonely. And making a goal for myself to make others feel the opposite of those negative feelings was a must for me. Everyone always tells me I\u0027m funny, and that I should be a comedian, truthfully I didn\u0027t see it, but that thought made me think of how I can try to not only make people laugh, but to help them through their troubled times. My Adventure, of playing games, doing Vlogs, learning new things, is also my viewers Adventure. We are in it together! My Youtube Channel, Gorte\u0027s Adventures, doesn\u0027t only focus on making others happy, but also to inspire people and motivate them to achieve goals and dreams! My goal, ever since watching Youtube, was to becoming a Youtuber. My other real goal is to be come an author. I love writing, which is also shown on my channel as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many amazing things I want to achieve and also want others to achieve! I want this journey, my journey, Your journey, to be something Astounding and memorable. Starting a Patreon would help me in so many ways. Buying new equipment, making better videos, personally talk to my viewers, and building a great channel that will make the Adventure a memory for a lifetime!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time for reading and watching the video! I hope you all have a wonderful day! And remember to be the best YOU you can be! Smile loud and proud! And I will see you all in the next Episode! Bye!\u003cbr\u003e"
