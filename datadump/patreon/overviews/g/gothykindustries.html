     "about": "SRSGMNG is a YouTube Gaming channel devoted to bringing you entertainment through video game commentary, but we can\u0027t do it without you! Rough times have rocked the channel of late, but with YOUR help, we can build the channel back to it\u0027s full glory!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCast:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGothyk- Founder and manager of the channel. Is bouncy and happy most of the time, but does\u0027t mean she can\u0027t rage. Gothyk also does all of the intro animation work and most of the jingles, as well as artwork for the channel (Thumbnails, banners, faces, icons, ect.). Gothyk is male to female transgender, for a fun fact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElizabitch- Gothyk\u0027s first partner on the channel and co-owner. Elizabitch is more of the critic of the group, less focused on the comedic side of playing video gaming as she is on the quality of the game. Elizabitch is also the complete creator of Princess Time, Gothyk having little to nothing to do with this show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaefen- Fairly recent addition to the channel, Haefen brings a breath of fresh air from another region of the US, having traveled to a few exotic places and experienced a lot of interesting things the other 2 have not. Which, of course, makes for amazing stories. Haefen has been a video game enthusiast for quite some time, and was more than willing to fill the shoes of Skyy, an old channel partner who helped create Anything Goes and Princess Time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLarry- The editing guy. Keeps himself behind the scenes of the channel as he\u0027s not the most social of people. But loves editing YouTube videos on sheer principal. At the moment, Larry is in charge of all of the channel\u0027s video editing and uploading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKian- NEWEST ADDITION! Kian is currently our newest editor, who is going through a training spell with Larry at the moment. Kian\u0027s current project is creating a \"Best Of\" Highlight reel of Castle Crashers, but soon Kian will graduate into becoming the editor for one of our shows regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSRSGMNG hosts a number of shows to watch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSRSGMNG: Elizabitch and Gothyk bring you 2 videos a week, one focused on console games, the other focused on games purchased through Steam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything Goes: Gothyk and Haefen bring you 2 videos a DAY, some retro mixed in with the new. View Discretion is advised, though, because on this show... Anything Goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrincess Time: Haefen and Elizabitch bring you a video a week in which they slow down and take it easier while playing games so cutesty and colorful, you will likely loose your mind. This one is for the viewer who think Gothyk\u0027s manic energy may be a bit much, and would just like to relax with something a little less rambunctious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRumpus Room: Our \"guest star\" show. This show has a little more variety, as the cast of the other shows bring in new people to play games with. At the moment, we are only able to have guests who are locals, but we hope to work our way up to bigger names!\u003cbr\u003e",
