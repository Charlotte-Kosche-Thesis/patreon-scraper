A completed ten minute video may come from three times the footage, taking as much as a couple of hours to edit \u0026amp; process, and further time to publish on a regular schedule and never be late.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes, this is our story to continue to share with the world, but we are looking for better ways to sustain the effort. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, we\u0027re going to keep this simple.
