    "summary": "I have always done crafts of some type all my life.  I always enjoyed doing unique crafts instead of doing what \"everyone\" else was doing.  In 2000, I moved from Virginia to Florida in order to keep a job.  I moved alone since I had no spouse and my children were all grown, so I had little to occupy myself - especially on weekends.  I then discovered the Carol Duval Show and her guest was Donna Kato.  Donna was making a beautiful pendant from \u0027polymer clay\u0027.  I always thought that was a child\u0027s craft and was fascinated at how much could be done with clay.  I looked it up on the Internet and found that there was a brand new polymer clay guild starting in Orlando and went to a meeting.  I fell in love with this medium.  I joined the National Polymer Clay Guild- NPCG (now IPCA) and served on the Board as VP-Membership for 4 years.  Then my life changed when my Mother came to visit me and got sick.  She could not return home because she required 24/7 care so she stayed with me since I had just retired.  I had to sell my home in FL and return to VA to get some help caring for her.  She was with me for 5 years and then we lost her.  It was hard getting my life back.  I had previously met some local clayers and we started getting together for clay days.  I then began watching polymer clay videos on YouTube, hoping to get inspiration and ideas.  Not only did I get some ideas, I also discovered some new interests.  I love card making, paper crafts and mixed media projects!  One of the people I was following did some polymer clay but mentioned she didn\u0027t really know that much about clay since she was mainly a decorative painter.  I started helping her out and she encouraged me to do videos on YouTube.  It took me a while to get up enough nerve (and the camera) to do videos but I finally made my first video in May 2016.  I started doing polymer clay tutorials in real time and was amazed how many people were interested in my videos.  In less than 3 months had acquired over 1100 subscribers to my channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my Patron, you will allow me to continue making these video tutorials. \u00a0It just is not in my budget to purchase all of the supplies needed. \u00a0I would appreciate your help!"
