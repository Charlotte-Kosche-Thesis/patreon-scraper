The seventeenth and eighteenth issues were produced with funding from successful Kickstarter campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also produce an occasional blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://grubstreetgrackle.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egrubstreetgrackle.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow This Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you sign up to become a patron of the \u003cem\u003eGrackle\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on Patreon, you\u0027re agreeing to send us a certain dollar amount (it can be as little as $1)\u00a0\u003cem\u003eeach time a new issue is released\u003c/em\u003e. When we announce that the issue is out, your card will be charged for the amount you pledged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Are Helping Us Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your help, there are a lot of things the Grackle can do that we couldn\u0027t do otherwise. For starters:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProduce the print magazine more frequently.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDistribute the magazine free in Dallas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay contributors for web content.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDesign in-school poetry tutorials around the poems published in the \u003cem\u003eGrackle\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePromote the magazine and website more aggressively.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo thank you for believing in the Grackle, we will honor your patronage with one of the rewards detailed at the bottom of this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMore issues of \u003cem\u003eGrub Street Grackle\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eRight now, when people ask us how often the \u003cem\u003eGrackle \u003c/em\u003ecomes out, we have to say \"whenever we have time for it.\" We\u0027d like it to be three or four times a year, but that\u0027s not realistic without a substantial, dependable budget. We can make this happen together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePay blog contributors\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe already pay contributors to the print magazine: artists and authors alike. But there\u0027s not enough left over to compensate authors for contributing to our excellent blog. Happily, the authors behind the Grackle are enthusiastic about it, and volunteer their time and effort to the blog, and will probably keep doing it for a long time to come.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut we don\u0027t think that writers should go unpaid, just because they\u0027re willing to work for free. And we don\u0027t think readers should have to wait for us to have spare time to write great articles. If you like the blog, and if you want to help us post more often, becoming a patron is a great way to show that and reward these fine people for their dedication.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLet it be known\u003c/h3\u003e\nPeople who have read \u003cem\u003eGrub Street Grackl\u003c/em\u003ee and follow the blog at grubstreetgrackle.com know that it\u0027s not like anything else out there, and that the writing and art we publish is outstanding. Everyone should read this stuff, right? But not everyone knows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWord of mouth is great. Please, yes, tell your friends about the \u003cem\u003eGrackle\u003c/em\u003e. Share posts from the\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ewebsite via email or\u00a0on your favorite social network. Bring people to local events.
