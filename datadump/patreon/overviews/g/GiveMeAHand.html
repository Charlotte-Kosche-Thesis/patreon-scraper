I\u0027m a really creative dude and I\u0027ve got a lot of ideas for songs that I\u0027d like to make and stuff I\u0027d like to experiment with, but at the moment I don\u0027t have the money to make these cool ideas into a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I\u0027d like to buy a guitar, as well as the special prosthetic that I need to play it. Those arms don\u0027t come cheap, and unfortunately the old one that I used to own no longer fits. Additionally, left-handed guitars (which, despite not having a left hand, is ironically the type of guitar I need) are typically more expensive than standard guitars, and require special order or (in some cases) special design. I haven\u0027t been able to afford any of this stuff in a long time, and it\u0027s been the source of much frustration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I\u0027d like to upgrade my PC. My computer is an ancient rustbucket that can barely play music, let alone handle projects with multiple high quality samples and effects being rendered at once. During the writing of my song \"A Town in the Mountains,\" I had to lower the bitrate of the song drastically just so that I could play it back in editing without pops and clicks making it unlistenable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I\u0027d like to buy a good quality microphone, maybe some better recording equipment. More instruments. More stuff! I want to completely expand my music-making capabilities, and I hope you guys can help me do that, over time."
