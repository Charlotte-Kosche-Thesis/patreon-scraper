    "summary": "Hello cosplay, anime, and video game lovers!! \u00a0My name is Gabrielle, but you can call me Gabby! Or Goob. Whatever works for you lol! One of my strongest passions in life is making fictional characters come to life using cosplay! Cosplay or \"Costume Play\" is a very fulfilling activity that is both time consuming and costly! By doing cosplay I have been lucky enough to have grown a following who asks to see me create more content and I would be so honored to finally be able to follow through on these requests! With Patreon I hope to be able create more cosplay content for everyone and use this opportunity to get closer to you guys as well! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a Patreon for my cosplay content, you do not have to donate and just because you donate doesn\u0027t mean I view anyone higher than the other, I love you all equally for even considering to support me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow you can find descriptions of tiers and rewards so that your questions on things can be answered as quickly as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\"Ooolala\" Sets:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Ooolala\" sets will feature me mostly in cosplay, but sometimes out of cosplay as well. This includes focusing on Lingerie sometimes and the artistic side of cosplay boudoir and glamour shots in 20+ images. I do not shoot nudity. I love to mix both the actual full cosplay with inspired lingerie as well! I will release these sets every month for my Alchemist tier patrons and higher. \u003cstrong\u003eThese are copyrighted images,\u003c/strong\u003e and sharing these images will result in a DMCA removal and instant block without refund. Please keep these images private and for Patron eye\u0027s only. \u003cem\u003ePlease respect my work and me as an artist. \u0026lt;3\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eMonthly Personalized Prints/Polaroids:\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDepending on the tier you are subscribed to, you will receive different prints and rewards! Chocobro tier first being \u00a0a 8 x 10, Big Daddy tier is a 8 x 10 \u0026amp; 4 x 6. Then finally Hero of time gets all of the above in addition to their 11x17 poster print. These prints will either be one of the regular cosplay that I have done that month or one of the cosplay boudoir\u0027s that I have done. They will not include a watermark and will be shipped professional to ensure that they are delivered in prestige condition. \u00a0Please note that these prints do take a lot of time to have first of all, shipped to me, then individually prepped and signed, I then create every label, and tape every single envelope and make sure everything is in great condition. This can take a couple of weeks.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePRINTS ARE CURRENTLY EXTREMELY DELAYED!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH YOUR PRINTS PLEASE PM ME AND LET ME KNOW!

This snapchat will include BTS of my cosplays, everyday life, funny videos of me in my cosplays, and more... Must be 18+! Also.. lots and lots of pictures of my cats. You have been warned lol. Even get replies from me in or out of cosplay and talk to me VIA Snapchat! Snapchat has to be one of my favorite ways to talk to everyone, I love getting to know you guys and talking about games and anime! I don\u0027t post nudes, but I feel more comfortable with having it 18+ due to occasional lewd content, drinking, and just other aaaaaddduullt things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRules for Snapchat are simple: You are more than welcome to take screenshots of the photos I share. You must ASK PRIOR to taking any screenshots of video content though. More than likely I will be completely fine with the screen shot, I just need to grant you permission before hand. Can\u0027t spend days being paranoid that someone took a screenshot of me picking my nose or something. heeeeeeell no!! \u0026gt;:( lol but jokes aside, please follow these rules. Failure to do so will result in a suspension or ban from my Snapchat access.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003ePersonalized\u00a0cosplay!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eFor the Hero of Time Tier, if you pledge $300, you get to choose your own cosplay for me!

I would love to be able to cosplay as your favorite characters and this is a great opportunity to be able to make your visions come to life! The cosplay would need to be in budget (sorry guys, I can\u0027t make a full armored suit with those funds, but just message me and we can work something out!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e- 10 images of a Private shoot for your eyes only\u003cbr\u003e- No nudity or implied nude\u003cbr\u003e- Boudoir shots may be included \u003cem\u003edepending on the cosplay \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0( Message for more details)\u003cbr\u003e- You will be put in a queue of when the donation is made.
