It\u0027s being published in a chapter/issue format both on the internet (free) and in print. The issues consist of approximately 50-70 pages, and are published in print individually and as collections through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://indyplanet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIndyplanet\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the plot?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn so many stories about fantasy worlds, the protagonist encounters some ancient gods who have been locked away for zillions of years, and possess incredible wisdom. They are usually reserved, grave, dignified, and powerful. They point the protagonist in the right direction and aid him in every way they can, which is usually not so very much. They vaguely recall massive wars and squabbles with each other that stretched over hundreds of years and impacted the lives of mortals worldwide. Their histories, and their motives, are mysterious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrayling is a story about a few such gods and how they got that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt transpires in a world called Faidia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Grayling\u0027s background?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA previous iteration of Grayling ran from 2002-2008. The new version started in 2010 and updates as often as I can find time and energy for it after my day job! I started redoing the comic from scratch since the \"draft\" version of 2002-2008 was subject to a lot of flaws that I now hope to fix. I was determined to finish the comic in spite of those flaws, so I did, but I\u0027m going back over it now and readdressing lots of the story that was left vague or untold. The story is going to be similar, but also incredibly different, and I hope it will have as much to offer older readers as folks who are viewing the story for the first time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been fortunate to receive lots of excellent support from my readers in the past, and I have set up this Patreon so that if anyone wishes to provide for the comic\u0027s future, they can do so in an accessible, structured, and straightforward manner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be wondering this if you came here from the comic\u0027s site. Briefly, Patreon is a site designed for patrons of the arts (that\u0027s you!) to make micropayments in a simplified, structured way to artists you feel warrant your support! In my case, I\u0027ll be using any monies that come to me through Patreon to cover bills, buy art supplies, and pay for the comic\u0027s webspace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a lot for reading all this, and I hope you consider supporting Grayling!"
