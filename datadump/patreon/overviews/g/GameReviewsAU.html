    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe History of GameReviewsAU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGameReviewsAU was started by a single Aussie gamer who felt that there could be more honest reviews published online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first review was published on March 3, 2015, which was for \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/king-of-thieves-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKing of Thieves on iOS\u003c/a\u003e. This was uploaded on the initial free Wordpress version of GameReviewsAU, which was later replaced by a \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhole new website\u003c/a\u003e in June of 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGameReviewsAU worked with \u003ca href=\"http://livelinkwebsites.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLive Link Websites\u003c/a\u003e to come up with the most affordable and efficient website. Eventually \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egamereviewsau.com\u003c/a\u003e was launched and could finally drop .wordpress from the URL and have a bit more freedom with the website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeeing as we fund our reviews entirely ourselves, we\u0027ve mainly been reviewing free-to-play games for mobile devices and computers. Any mainstream games that have been reviewed by GameReviewsAU were either already in our possession, purchased by us, or (if we\u0027re lucky) provided to us by game developers such as \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/soma-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSOMA by Frictional Games\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/the-aquatic-adventure-of-the-last-human-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Aquatic Adventures of the Last Human by YCJY\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/tom-clancys-the-division-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTom Clancy\u0027s The Division by Ubisoft\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/street-fighter-v-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStreet Fighter V by Capcom\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEntering our second year of reviewing, we\u0027ve established a rather decent following on social media, and are currently receiving over 150 unique visitors per day to the website. This might not sound like much, but it\u0027s a great start. We\u0027ll keep reviewing games as much as we can, because we love writing and getting our opinions out there to the public for consideration. Lately we\u0027ve just begun to dip on toes in to writing reviews of Anime old and current.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, we\u0027ve been trying our hand at \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7SkVtKG8IXapGIZj9ba4Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo reviews on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e, which is heaps of fun! But with only basic equipment and video editing software, there\u0027s only so far we can go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Funding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn average a written review can take between 12 and 50 hours to put together. This includes finding potential games to review, contacting the developers/publishers, playing the game (sometimes all the way to the end if it\u0027s a story-heavy game), taking screenshots to go through, writing the content, proofreading and advertising via social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo reviews can take longer than written reviews to put together because of recording the footage, writing a script, recording the voice-over, editing the footage and uploading (with Australian internet it can easily take 6 or more hours to upload a video). After it\u0027s uploaded, a page needs to be created on our website so fans can stay up to date with what we\u0027ve been doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe spend a lot of time putting together reviews for everyone to enjoy, but in order to get our reviews out there, a lot of time has to go into advertising via various social medias and email campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid I mention we fund ourselves? I think I did, but just to remind you, we fund ourselves. With that in mind, you can imagine having a regular job that pays for things like food, rent, dog food etc. but then using the rest of your time finding potential games to review and reviewing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we try to stay up to date with the latest games, if \nwe\u0027re unable to get our hands on the latest and greatest, we will need \nto purchase them ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs gamers will know, it can cost anywhere upwards and beyond $100AUD to pick up a recent release, depending on the platform you want to play it on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep providing you and everyone else with the latest and up to date game reviews, we need funding in order to continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where we need your help! If you would be kind enough to make monthly donations to go towards our work, not only will we know that GameReviewsAU is appreciated, but we can also put those funds towards more and better games to review, visiting game exhibitions to get the latest news, publishing higher quality video reviews, enhancing the quality of our website and heaps more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment we rely on advertising, such as Google AdSense, affiliate links etc. to gain any funding. And for those in the know, this can be incredibly challenging to earn any more than $10/year. So donations of any amount would be greatly appreciated and it\u0027ll all be put to good use in order to increase the exposure of GameReviewsAU and give the people what they want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount donated would be extremely helpful as it will help us provide you with newer and better reviews, and would also help make up for the time spent in front of the computer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider this: Full time work in Australia consists of 38 hours during the week. After taking into consideration 8 hours sleep a night and writing an average of 3 reviews a week, that only leaves about 24 hours left of free time to spend with our loved ones, play games to chill out and do general everyday stuff like food shopping, walking the dog, eating etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Will Go\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen owning a website, there are certain costs involved in order to keep the website online. Such things as domain name registration need to be paid biennially and hosting (renting the space on a server for your website to sit) needs to be renewed annually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only that but if anything goes wrong with the website, we need to get in touch with our website developers to fix it. This can become quite costly as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can hear from some of our videos, the voice-over recordings don\u0027t sound amazing. This is due to a lack of proper equipment. Funding gained from Patreon would go towards getting our hands on appropriate hardware needed to record decent sound. In our review of \u003ca href=\"http://gamereviewsau.com/kingdom-gameplay-and-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKingdom by by Raw Fury\u003c/a\u003e, you can hear the voice-over sounds quite professional which we loved! That\u0027s because we called in a favour with someone in the know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time goes by, games become more and more hardware intensive. As games start to require more powerful hardware, eventually our systems will become obsolete. Any funds raised with Patreon would also go towards keeping our gaming systems up to date so we can continue to provide reviews at the maximum settings available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027ll consider donating some of your hard earned money to GameReviewsAU so we can keep pushing, and thank you for reading our story!
