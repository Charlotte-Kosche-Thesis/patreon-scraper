Or, maybe you listen to my radio show that will be in it\u0027s tenth year on June 18th. Then again, maybe you just accidentally stumbled across me today, but I don\u0027t believe there are accidents.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://genakirby.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-Body-2.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAfter creating free content for 10 years I am at a place where I have to \"get a real job\" or quit. But I CAN\u0027T quit. I LOVE what I do to much. When I found out about Patreon I cried. Then I thought, \"THIS, this is it!\" For $1 folks can get the content I have been working so hard on for years, it doesn\u0027t break the bank and I can do my life work! YES YES YES AND YES!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://genakirby.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-body-3.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe exciting thing is that with Patreon I can finally do things the way I want to. I don\u0027t have to appeal to a huge audience but make content for the audience I want, and who wants what I put out (I said put out lol).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy new shows will provide good information, yes, but will be delivered in my voice; which is oft times \u00a0irreverent, funny and sometimes rude and crude. There will be some swearing, but mostly it\u0027s going to be crazy good info delivered in a funny way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have always held back and tried to be very professional (I will continue to do so on my weekly radio show), but I have always wanted to do a show where I could just be me. Now I will be able to be my usual swear-y self (let loose) and still provide great info.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://genakirby.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-body-4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is simple. You help me achieve my dreams, and I will give back as much as I possibly can. We have concocted a plan which will not only pay for us to provide you with great information and entertainment, but will also provide a whole new generation of parents and birth workers with quality information \u00a0and tools to foster a new \"peace on earth\" through gentle birth. Scroll up and to the right to read through our \"goals\" to see exactly what we are planning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you ahead of time for using your donation to help change the world, no seriously! Between taking care of system issues and talking to people who say that they can\u0027t afford my instruction, I\u0027ve decided I don\u0027t want to have to sell the information I share anymore. I mean I still would like to feed my children, but it seems so natural just to share this information rather than sell it. My husband, Craig, who created and built Doulabook, feels the same. He would much rather write and produce this show than sell websites (I mean, he started Doulabook because he was tired of seeing really bad sites created by people who had no idea of what birth workers did or believed in), so he has joined me in offering his creation to anyone trying to build a business once we reach our goals. You are the ones who will make this happen, through your generosity.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eNow go take a look at the rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://genakirby.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-Body-5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://genakirby.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-Reward-Body-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for caring!
