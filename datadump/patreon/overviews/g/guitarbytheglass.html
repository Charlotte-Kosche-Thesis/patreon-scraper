    "summary": "Hello everybody. My name is Shaun, I\u0027m a primary school teacher and a musician. I live in Western Australia in a city called Fremantle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because \u003c/strong\u003eit allows me to quickly build and contribute to a community with content that is unique, useful and easy to follow, whether you want to learn to play an instrument, or sing. I\u0027m hoping that with Patreon I\u0027ll be able to contribute more hours to this community that I have a zillion ideas for, but don\u0027t have the time to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Guitar By The Glass? \u003c/strong\u003eLearning guitar should be a fun shared experience of jamming, singing, and drinking with other people (you don\u0027t \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to drink). Every week I take my guitar down to my local pub where I lead a guitar circle. We drink, sing and laugh while we learn new songs. If you don\u0027t get it the first week, you\u0027ll get it next week, or the next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI take a lot of time charting out songs. They need to be correct, easy to read, and easy to follow. I have written 4x 50 page guitar songbooks now, which I do not profit from, it is for the convenience of all having the same song charts to follow together. You can download the first book for free\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/details/GBTGBook1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI have a \u003cstrong\u003epodcast\u003c/strong\u003e that I started about 2 years ago, and a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube page\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0with about 400 subscribers. My goal on these mediums is to create an atmosphere where you feel like you\u0027re in one of our guitar circle sessions. Each week, you\u0027ll pour yourself a little something, sit down and jam along with me and my session.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs an exclusive Patreon member,\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027ll have access to all of the chord charts and song books, we will have monthly online hangouts where you can ask any questions you may have, you can have access to the live sessions that I record so you\u0027ll be able to strum along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a lot of time to create videos and content, but I\u0027m hoping that with support from my Patreon page I\u0027ll be able to spend more time creating them, because I really love doing it.\u003cbr\u003e"
