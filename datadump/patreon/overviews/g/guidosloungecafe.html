I had never felt peaceful before and for sure, it was a life-changing moment.The inner peace that I experienced at that moment was so moving that I had to head back to the market to find more of this music.When I arrived home from the vacation, I had 20 albums in my suitcase.That is how it started for me.That one moment was so inspirational!It gave my life a new direction and now I spend my days putting together the kind of Chillout and Downtempo compilations that inspired me so much all those years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery time I start a new mix, my mind goes back to that morning in Bali; the morning that started it all!\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, thanks to this love of Lounge music, I have many friends throughout the world that find themselves inspired in similar ways (artists, producers, record labels etc.) and I also have a great time running my virtual\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuidosLoungeCafe/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(Guido\u2019s) Lounge Caf\u00e9 on Facebook\u003c/a\u003e .
