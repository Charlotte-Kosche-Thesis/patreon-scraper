You\u0027ll not that there aren\u0027t that many reward tiers and no goals to speak of. Maybe someday down the line there will be, but this place right now is basically for people who like my stuff and wanna toss a buck or two my way, that\u0027s about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, that\u0027s not to say you won\u0027t get a couple of perks for doing so. There\u0027s noting big or grandiose on offer, but for as little as one dollar a month, you\u0027ll gain access to all of my non-reading videos a full week before they hit youtube and vidme. You\u0027ll also gain access to a patron-exclusive reading of a public domain story every single month, for as long as you\u0027re a donor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, this is totally optional, and aside from those public domain readings, none of my content is going to be put behind a paywall of any kind, and those readings are mostly there as my thanks to those who saw fit to, at least, toss some coinage over to a starving artist. Things might expand in the future, but as it stands now, whatever you can send is always much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for having a look, I hope you enjoy what you see, and I look forward to continuing to entertain you!\u003cbr\u003e"
