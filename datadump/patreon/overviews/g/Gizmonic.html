We, the cast, are all linked, oddly enough, through the now defunct gaming website 1up.com, and somehow we now make a podcast about MST3K together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, we first started knocking around the idea for this show in 2009 and we\u0027ve been making it since 2012, so I don\u0027t have all the details straight in my head. Memories fade, but this podcast will never die! Here\u0027s the thing: we decided to launch a Patreon campaign because we like doing this, and we know you like listening to it and sending us letters and talking on the Facebook page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to grow, meaning more episodes, a more rigid schedule, and bathing in the finest champagnes and French perfumes. With your support we hope to make it all a reality. Your support means more than just diamond earrings and very shiny Italian leather shoes, it means everything to us. We just want to thank you, the patron, for your patronage on Patreon."
