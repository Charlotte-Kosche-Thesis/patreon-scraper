I have been drawing for a while, ever since I was a young girl, and it has been a huge dream of mine to continue doing this for a living. However, times are tough, and there\u0027s a lot of competition. That doesn\u0027t mean I want to give up completely, but I know that I cannot do it alone. I am seeking out those who would be willing to help me by offering support and perhaps in exchange I would create something for them so they would not go empty handed, of course! I\u0027m open to suggestions, and am hoping to hear from others who may show interest in what I love to do.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Hello everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been told time and time again to start doing things with my artwork and I always put it off because of many reasons. I haven\u0027t given up yet, but if I plan on achieving my dreams then I must start now as we all do start somewhere! However, to keep a website alive, purchase art supplies and hopefully a new computer, I am willing to offer my services as an artist to sketch some illustrations for people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe main goal! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the plan:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am striving to work on my art more, but for that, I truly need a new computer among other art-related supplies (pencils, paper, paints, and whatever I may need to create pictures for you!). The alternative would to be replace parts instead of a whole new desktop. As for my current computer, it is close to about ten years old now, and having a new one would mean more artwork could be done digitally instead of only pencil, pen and paper. Not that I don\u0027t enjoy this method, but I\u0027ve got to grow with the times, and become more advanced which would help ensure success within the field I have desired for so long. It has been a challenge because I cannot do as much digital art like I used to for this reason alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had ideas for quite some time on what I\u0027d like to do with my art which includes illustrating books for children and possibly writing them myself if I do not collaborate with a writer or even work on other projects such as t-shirt and logo designs, greeting cards, calendars and much more. It all depends on how well this goes and if I can manage a way to support a hobby that I have such a passion for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall, I am open to most suggestions so feel free to contact me via message through the Patreon messenger or my email\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:glacialshiverdraws@yahoo.com\"\u003eglacialshiverdraws@yahoo.com\u003c/a\u003e. Please leave details and the best time to reach you, and perhaps we can work out something! Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e*This as a total goal and not per creation. The pricing may vary depending and a list of prices is in progress.*\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrice ranges could be from $5-$100 dollars, depending on what is requested from a simple sketch to a more detailed piece of art. If it is a means to reach my goal then I will do all I can, but do not worry because this is something I do enjoy, and I would be happy to do so!\u003cbr\u003e",
