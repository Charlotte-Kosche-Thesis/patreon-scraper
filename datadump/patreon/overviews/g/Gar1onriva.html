I started YouTubing on a whim over 6 years ago, making poor quality Minecraft videos. Since then, my\nchannel\u2019s expanded to have as many as 5 ongoing gaming series both single and\nmultiplayer, playing Minecraft and whatever else I fancy.\u003cbr\u003eIn November 2013, I tried new waters for my channel by making a parody\nof CinemaSins, mock-critiquing the late nineties Pok\u00e9mon anime, calling it\nPok\u00e9Sins. Over the next year, my channel\u2019s popularity greatly increased,\nelevating me from around 100 subscribers to over 5,000. A bit surer on my feet\nwith the comedy I was presenting, I decided to completely reinvent the style so\nit was uniquely mine, keeping the name Pok\u00e9Sins.\u003cbr\u003eThis new style, while inspired by CinemaSins, uses a compound scoring\nsystem made of Plusles and Minun, denoting positive and negative points\nrespectively. Despite some mixed reception to begin with, most viewers seem to\nlike my new style and continue to support the series.\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon to support that series during its times of copyright-crisis, but as my channel has gaming, general and\u00a0Pok\u00e9Sins content, it\u0027s only right that my Patreon reflect that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith multiple single player, multiplayer and one-off gaming videos, the Gar1onriva channel has something for everyone. Why not try something new today?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I began to monetise Pok\u00e9Sins, I was fairly content with the ad\nrevenue, especially after joining the Freedom! Network. This, however, began to\nchange when I started receiving copyright flags on my Pok\u00e9Sins uploads,\nblocking their monetisation and stopping me from uploading another until the\ndispute was settled. Don\u2019t worry though; my work comes under fair use, so I\u2019m\nnot breaking any laws.\u003cbr\u003eThis massive limitation on the series caused quite a stir among my\nviewers when I brought it to light and I was overwhelmed by the support they\noffered. Up until now I\u2019ve resisted suggestions that I upload the episodes on\nother sites until the flags are cleared because I\u2019ve come to rely on the income\nfrom the ad rev. That was when I began considering Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eThese days YouTube is my full time job and I rely heavily on Patreon money to supplement my ad rev and merchandise sales. With my patrons\u0027 support, I can continue to produce 5+ new videos every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from putting a smile on my face and ensuring the good stuff keeps on coming, I have lined up a host of rewards and milestones to\ngive you some actual incentive to pledge to me.\u003cbr\u003eWhether you want early access to new videos, to see special episodes\nnot released to the general public, to game or even chat with me on Skype, I think there\u2019s something for everyone. See below for a full\nrun-down of the rewards.\u003cbr\u003eMilestones to which I aspire finding new, interesting things on which to do videos, upping\u00a0Pok\u00e9Sins to a weekly series and earning enough from this Patreon to live on.\u003cbr\u003eMilestones we\u0027ve already reached are the\u00a0making of merchandise, a special Behind-The-Scenes Featurette to be released FOR FREE along with each new episode, and new, top-quality audio and visual recording equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for reading my page.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u2019ll pledge my work and help Pok\u00e9Sins \u0026amp; my channel evolve.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: Payments are made at the start of the month. Rewards for $5 and higher will be made available after first confirmed payment.\u003cbr\u003eNote Also: To give time for any declined pledges to be rectified, I wait until about a week into the month before giving out the rewards for processed pledges.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
