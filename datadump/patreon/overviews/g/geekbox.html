    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to The Geekbox!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what we\u0027ve been saying to our podcast\u0027s listeners every single week, for five years, across (at this point) nearly 300 episodes. And we\u0027re still here! And now we totally want to take your money -- in return for more awesome (and free) content, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you don\u0027t know who the heck we are: The Geekbox is one of the most popular geek culture podcasts on iTunes, starring a panel of professional nerds who discuss the latest happenings in video games, film, television, comic books, and all kinds of other stuff -- and then put it out for you to listen to every Wednesday morning. We come from a pretty nerdy background, too; The Geekbox is one of the heirs to the podcasting golden age of dearly departed gaming super-site 1UP.com, and chaired by some of the same awesome editors who you remember from those good ol\u0027 days. Also, we record in a \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e cool comic shop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.geekbox.net/patreon/GeekboxCast-Patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince day one, Geekbox founder \u003cstrong\u003eRyan Scott \u003c/strong\u003e-- former executive editor for 1UP.com and IGN Entertainment, and current editorial gun-for-hire -- has been joined by comic retail professional \u003cstrong\u003eRyan Higgins\u003c/strong\u003e, along with an evolving lineup of co-hosts. Our current team consists of GameSpot news director \u003cstrong\u003eJustin Haywald\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and video game localization pro\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Fitch\u003c/strong\u003e. And we sometimes get some awesome guests on; our past guests have included folks like IGN super-editor Greg Miller (who knows a lot of stuff about chicken wings), and\u00a0Supergiant Games creative director Greg Kasavin (who was part of the team that made the excellent Xbox Live hit Bastion).\u00a0So, hey, you can probably assume we know what we\u0027re talking about (most of the time, anyway).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll joking aside: The reality of podcasting is that it\u0027s a \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003ehard format to monetize with traditional avenues like ads, because even the big ones are small potatoes compared to giant websites, television shows, Super Bowls, and what have you -- so instead, we\u0027re going directly to the people who think we\u0027re worth keeping around.\u00a0We\u0027re here on Patreon to ask for your support, so that we can keep bringing you quality content every single week. And heck, we\u0027d even like to expand our operations a bit, and start producing regular YouTube videos and Twitch gaming livestreams. Hopefully we\u0027ll get there. It all comes down to how much you guys think we\u0027re worth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, we\u0027ve kept our reward tiers pretty simple; you give us a bit of funding, and we\u0027ll give you a bit of cast interaction and input on certain things. Remember that every little\u00a0bit helps. Let\u0027s take this thing totally indie and make the coolest dork empire ever (or, you know, at least the seventh or eighth coolest)!\u003cbr\u003e"
