    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon campaign. My name is Greg Massi and I am a guitarist/songwriter currently involved in the bands Baliset and Concilium, as well as the host of a music interview podcast called The Color Of Air. You may also know me from my prior history with the bands maudlin of the Well and Kayo Dot, both of which I was a founding member of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy story is not much different than other artists. I have self-funded the production and release of a Baliset album and EP but in order to finish the second album, I find myself at the limit of my own resources and the time seemed right to try a crowdfunding campaign. I was skeptical of the other sites out there as they are based around a short 30 day campaign which I didn\u2019t feel suited my goals as a musician. I don\u2019t just want to raise money, I want to try and build a grassroots audience and that takes time and patience. I settled on Patreon because it allows me to provide my backers with new music while at the same time helping me raise funds to achieve my creative goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aim of my campaign is to produce and release one new song per month. These represent songs and instrumental ideas that I have been creating over the years during studio downtime. The rewards, based on how much you wish to contribute, will vary from the basics of getting the current month\u2019s new song and go all the way up to receiving monthly behind the scenes and guitar lesson videos. The beauty of this campaign is that it puts the responsibility on me to be productive and earn your support as a backer and it is support that I want to work hard to earn and put to good use in helping achieve my musical goals as well as producing high quality music and videos for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
