A select group of students is chosen to participate and it\u0027s considered a great honor and a step in the right direction for the developement of the young ones. During THEx the students will gather first hand experience in all kinds of employments and will, without a doubt, get a head start over the rest of the kids in the country.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/lcc9ls1y7/Screen1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s neat for them but what\u0027s the game all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are Kelly Turner, high school teacher and responsible guardian.
