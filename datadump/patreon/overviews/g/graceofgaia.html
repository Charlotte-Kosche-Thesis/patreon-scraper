    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\"THE CHILDREN OF GAIA\" is a culmination and a combination of several ideas that have been slow-roasting in my heart for almost fifteen years. It is a story of friendship, love, lore, and \u003cem\u003ehome\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- a concept that, to me, goes far deeper than where you hang your hat or rest your head. The characters within are alive, and I don\u0027t know everything about them yet - which I think is what makes writing them so exciting. Their world is new and different for me, as well, as usually I drift more towards completely fantastical settings that operate on rules of my own creation. In contrast, \"THE CHILDREN OF GAIA\" is set in a modified reality very similar to our own - a modern world with fluctuating gas prices, iPod\u0027s, and Facebook - where humanity suddenly has to contend with a formerly dormant race of people with a deep and powerful connection to the natural world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI DECIDED ON PATREON because I have put off formalizing my writing for far too long. I want to be published, and I want to share my worlds and the characters within them with anyone who will sit still long enough to listen to me. I work two jobs - one as a full-time teacher and another part-time as a bookseller - and somehow I still find time to write. As a matter of fact, there are some days that I feel like I live more in the worlds of these words and whimsy than I do in the physical realm. Even on days that I don\u0027t have time for writing, the stories are always there, forming and weaving a path from my heart to my mind and pulling me toward an adventure so palpable I can almost touch it. I want to share that. I \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to share that. It may take fifteen more years, but I know that one day I \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0have a real gateway to these worlds sitting in my hand - a hard copy of a book that I\u0027ve actually published, that will be on a shelf in a library where someone else can slip through the pages into the world that \u003cem\u003eI \u003c/em\u003egave them the key to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWITH ONLY A SMALL PLEDGE of a couple of dollars per chapter, or episode, or scene - you can help me, and that\u0027s all I\u0027m asking. You don\u0027t have to give me a lot, but just a little - so I can take one less shift at my second job and instead spend that evening writing, or so that I can buy a timeline program to help me map things out in the grand scheme of the storyline. And honestly, seeing the pledge and knowing that I\u0027m not just writing for me but for \u003cem\u003eyou - my readers (\u003cstrong\u003emy readers!\u003c/strong\u003e) \u003c/em\u003e- will give me motivation and inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI HAVE SO MUCH MORE than chapters and storylines that I want to show you. I want to give you character sheets and timelines, relationship charts and family trees, sketches of the characters, audio of scenes so that you can hear how these people actually speak. Take my hand, journey with me, get to know these characters with me and discover the secrets of their world, and I promise you won\u0027t be disappointed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
