I started YouTube about a year ago and I\u0027ve been loving it. In particular I like doing opinion pieces, lore recaps and opinion pieces regarding certain games such as the Witcher series and World of Warcraft. I have lots of ideas for future content and intend to keep on making YouTube videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few subscribers asking me regularly on bringing back a certain series I did last year where I gave short recaps of chapters from the Witcher books. I\u0027m hoping to bring this series back if I receive help from you.\u00a0If you sign up as a patron - your pledge will go directly into making this series come back as well as provide me with the resources to try making new content for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you will gain access to the Discord channel as well as updates about the channel via vlogs only available through Patreon. I will not use the funds as a replacement as of my full-time job until the channel is more built-up."
