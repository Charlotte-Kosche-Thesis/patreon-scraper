Immediate regret ensued.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, yep! You found my Patreon, that means you\u0027ve either stumbled across this trying to access something that I no longer share publicly or that you\u0027re a good friend of mine who feels as though you should be giving me money. No? Well, that\u0027s a shame.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sure you\u0027re thinking the usual \"get out and get a real job\" but for someone who is physically disabled living in a place where manual labor is the entire job market, there is not much that I can do. Art, however, is one of the things that I can do and that I want to do! Currently, I will admit that a lot of it (if not most or all of it) is MLP:FiM related, though I do plan on branching out in the future when I\u0027ve had some time to get comfortable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started off just drawing and doing things on MS Paint when I was twelve, simply because I was annoyed with having to use bases. I will admit, the biggest problem with my development has always been that I am too stubborn to accept help, but my stubborn attitude is why I did not give up despite multiple other artists and peers telling me it was in my best interest. I\u0027ve made it this far, and I plan on continuing to go further and expand my horizons though, for now, I am going to have to find some financial support. Maybe things will stay small, maybe things will get big. We never know what the big image will be like until it\u0027s passed and we\u0027re looking back at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page, I will be sharing traditional sketches, bases or line arts, and even give some of the beginners out there tips and assistance if you\u0027ll come to me for help. I know how hard it is to start off small, but I\u0027m hoping I can help some others with getting their starts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
