As such the primary goal of the Patreon is to offset costs. Contributors will be contacted in regards to their preferences as far as updates are concerned and as such contributors will have greater influence over the update schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe total yearly operating costs for the community are: \u00a0$266 a year. This was money that I was previously paying out of pocket. It\u0027s broken down as follows: $216 a year for the website. $10 a year for the domain name. $10 every 3 months for the mumble server. As such this is a fairly large amount of money that I pay to keep things operational. The goal of the Patreon account is to alleviate this financial cost in order to at least cancel out the fact that the website typically costs money and produces none."

     "description": "So, warhammer age of wrath is currently our oldest community map that has not had an over-haul or remake. It\u0027s also a map with a general set of flaws and issues that would constitute a necessity \u0027for\u0027 a remake. So, what would a remake of warhammer age of wrath include? Here\u0027s a general list of new features in an Age of Wrath Remake:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rebuilt terrain. The primary goal will be A) a more accurate terrain of the Empire, Brettonia, and the Badlands. In contrast to fears that I would make the map \u0027too\u0027 large the map would only be marginally increased in size in order to handle and address a few key problems. The main benefit would be I could remove the tunnel system from the map, and make them \u0027on\u0027 map tunnels so when you move through a tunnel you\u0027re actually just moving through the mountain range. As such I\u0027d be expanding the mountain ranges to work as real tunnels, and this would make for a more \u0027dynamic\u0027 under-mountain tunnel system. This would alleviate the most hated feature of WAOW.\u003cbr\u003e- Rebuilt Tool-Tip System a lot of these are inconsistent and would be polished.\u003cbr\u003e- More comprehensive spawn lists.\u003cbr\u003e- New bases and events that handle aspects of the game that are not currently handled.\u003cbr\u003e- New Hirable Elites\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEstimated time of completion: 3 months.",

The empire is fallen and controlled by the dark emperor Maximilian III. Many nations have been swept aside or crushed, and the elves are once again a unified people in desperation. The map would function along the lines of multiple evolving factions and have three paths for each color based on their respective lore based settings.
