    "summary": "Hi, my name is \u003cstrong\u003eJosh\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI\u2019ve been writing about music since the summer of 1998 starting with my own zine Raze (four issues, photocopied, 50 copies each) and as a result I quickly became a reviewer for Pasadena, CA based publication Flipside from 1998-2000 when the zine ended. I became quite hated for my short and obtusely negative reviews as \u003cem\u003eJ-Cyco\u003c/em\u003e because quite frankly: I was a 17 year old hardcore punk/crossover kid at the time. \u003cem\u003eTodd\u003c/em\u003e (editor-in-chief post \u003cem\u003eAl Flipside\u003c/em\u003e) was amused enough by my idiocy at the time to send me stuff for years, anyhow. I didn\u2019t begin writing about video games, or much of anything else, online until \u003ca href=\"http://grizzlybutts.blogspot.com/\"\u003e2009\u003c/a\u003e primarily to expand my writing oeuvre and general lexicon. In the space between I\u2019d received about six years of college education (\u003cem\u003eMicrobiology, research and technical writing\u003c/em\u003e) primarily in Oregon and Washington state. Though I\u2019ve had many jobs throughout my life (physical therapist, editor, etc.) I have a soul-crushing career in lab management/experimental design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals for Grizzly Butts as a pursuit and potential business are driven by a compulsive Heavy Metal obsession. Every waking moment of the day I\u2019m an overly enthused fan of HEAVY METAL who is compelled to write every free second I get. My methodology is \u2018old school\u2019 in the sense that I grew up reading music \u2018zines, as well as big heavy metal magazines, in the early 90\u2019s \u2014 an era where reviews/features were long, in-depth, and honest. You won\u2019t get a messy 200 word blog entry from me, every release deserves at least 600-1000 words of thought and extensive repeat listens. Without serious consideration and effort, why would writing be worth reading? I believe the effort musicians put into music is worth serious time and thought. This is the value I offer as a writer. My philosophy of earnest criticism backed by extensive listening and thorough research stands out in the suffocating metal blog biosphere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt had been impossible to consider writing about music as a sustainable full-time career until I\u2019d seen crowd-sourcing work so well for a select few. It is entirely possible to foster a small community of shared interest with small scale crowd-sourced funding. The cost of maintaining an advertisement free website with zero sponsored content is roughly $100 per year. To achieve this goal I need 8-10 people to pledge $1.00 USD per month, per year. That is the main goal of my \u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/GrizzlyButts\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e, though my ambitions will expand over time as features, collaboration, and artist interaction increases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
