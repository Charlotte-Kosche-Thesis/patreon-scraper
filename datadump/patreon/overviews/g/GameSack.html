We like reviewing games, lots and lots of games each episode every two weeks. Mostly retro games though a few more modern games creep in when they become relevant to the topics we discuss. But that\u0027s OK, because they\u0027re games! We try to put on the highest quality show we can and we\u0027re always looking for ways to make it even better. There\u0027s always room for improvement!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love making Game Sack. We wish we could do more but we have other obligations in life at the moment. Like jobs and stuff. But we like Game Sack much more. That\u0027s why we make sure to release episodes on a consistent basis. No long lulls wondering when the next episode will appear. No compromise in quality. Just a love for videogames and talking about them. We love showing you lots of different games, obscure and even popular ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo what\u0027s the deal with this Patreon page or whatever this is?\u003c/h3\u003eWell to make our taxes more complicated, of course! But the first thing you need to know is that we\u0027re not going to put episodes behind a paywall. We\u0027re not going to give timed exclusives to Patreon patrons. You can still watch them for free on Youtube. By donating you\u0027re basically helping us out and it is 100% optional. The thing is that some videos make a lot less money than others. Not every subscriber watches every video. We don\u0027t want to have to resort to just making videos designed to get tons of views to support the show. We feel that would compromise the quality and variety of the topics we\u0027d like to cover. For example not many people watch the Halloween-themed episodes. We put a lot of time, money and effort into the last one. A lot more people are using AdBlock on their browsers as well. If we had a more stable income that we could count on then we could cover topics and themes that may not be as popular from time to time. If you don\u0027t feel comfortable doing this, we understand and we still value you very much as a viewer of the show. But if you do donate, it helps us with equipment, computer costs, time and stuff like that. And we\u0027re always looking for ways to improve quality in all areas... except our wooden delivery. So basically by becoming a Patron you\u0027re helping us out and you can cancel or change your donation amount at any time. Only become a Patron if you truly feel comfortable with it and want to support the show in this way! You can also donate directly via Youtube if you feel uncomfortable with a monthly thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOK, but is that the only reason you\u0027re doing this?\u003c/h3\u003eWell, no. We\u0027re trying to buy mansions and stuff for all of our friends. Just kidding. Google and Youtube are always on the brink of doing something that damages the way we bring you content. Game Sack has been OK in this regard so far but you never know what they\u0027ll come up with next. It can be very discouraging to content creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBut I\u0027ve seen your videos! You have a Neo-Geo and you bought a 3DO at launch! You also have a complete Earthbound, Snatcher and MUSHA. You\u0027re swimming in money! I wish I had as much money as you!\u003c/h3\u003eErrr. Yeah. For one not all of those things were purchased around the same time nor the exuberant prices they go for these days. But we still need to work mundane jobs to survive. We\u0027re not rich. We wish we were but that\u0027s probably not going to happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo what do I get if I pledge?\u003c/h3\u003eTHANK YOU! We\u0027re amazed that anyone would even want to give $1 to us. That just blows our mind.\u003cbr\u003e"
