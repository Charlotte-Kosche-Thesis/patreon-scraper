It can be used with any set of rules, but\nover the next year, I will also be working on rules specifically designed for\nit. The premise is that the northern border of a kingdom has just survived a\ndevastating war that claimed the lives of a third of its population. Now is the\ntime for rebuilding. In the midst of political and social turmoil, people\nliving ordinary lives must make difficult decisions so that they can survive\nthe unforgiving seasons to come. They can support each other or turn on each\nother, pursue their own ambitions or the common good. One of the central\nquestions for people playing in Rothlingsmark is this: when the world falls\napart, who do you help?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get if I\ncontribute?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nfirst thing that patrons get is full access to the setting document, which is\nover 15,000 words of worldbuilding. Every piece that I write with the backing\nof my patrons expands on that material. You\u0027ll get more detailed descriptions\nof locations, culture, history, and social dynamics. In addition, you\u0027ll get\nessays that take you through the process of researching and writing the\nsetting, essays that any worldbuilder should find valuable.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPeople\nwho decide to contribute more money will have a larger say in the direction that\nthe expansions take. That can mean in-world information (like gender roles or\nlegal systems), setting-related essays (cultural contact or the role of\nviolence), or broader material of use to writers and game designers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you use donations\nfor?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHalf\nof the money that patrons give will go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.covenanthouse.ca/homeless-youth/Home.aspx\"\u003eCovenant House Toronto\u003c/a\u003e, a shelter for\nhomeless teens. Given that one of the major themes of Rothlingsmark is the\nhealing that follows violence, it seemed appropriate. I\u0027ll be donating the\nmoney each month, and will put up a statement of the amount given as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nother half of the money will go toward preparing Rothlingsmark for publication.\nEvery dollar that Covenant House receives means a dollar that I\u0027ll set aside to\npay for art, layout, and other assistance for the project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m\nGeoffrey McVey, retired academic with a focus on comparative religion, freelancer\nwriter for role-playing games, and author. I spent ten years teaching the history\nof religions, then made the shift to do creative projects, think about my own\nfantasy settings, and write essays on how to apply scholarly theories of\nreligion to imaginary worlds.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\nmain interest with this project is to take all of that creative drive and put\nit to use for the benefit of others. I\u0027m not doing this for the sake of making\nmoney; all that I want is to find a way for people to donate to a good cause\nwhile getting something creative in return.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout that game?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve\nplayed role-playing games for nearly thirty years. I believe that some game\nsettings benefit from having rules written specifically for them, rules that\nemphasize the themes of the setting and encourage players to inhabit the\nfiction more fully. For that reason, I\u0027ve put together a set of role-playing\nrules for Rothlingsmark. It\u0027s my eventual goal to release them alongside the\nsetting material, and while enjoying the world doesn\u0027t depend on using them,\nthey do add to the depth of it.\u003cbr\u003e"
