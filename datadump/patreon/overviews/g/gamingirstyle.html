Although the content that I produce primarily focuses on blind Let\u2019s Plays and detailed walkthroughs of retro video games, I also\ncreate video game reviews, Top 5/10/15 countdowns, Q\u0026amp;As, topical/conversational vlogs, and whatever else magically pops into my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWho Is Rabbit? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat would be me! My real name is Rebekah (and you\u2019re welcome to address\nme that way if you prefer), but I\u2019ve been lovingly called Rabbit for as long as\nI can remember. I work in research and education, serving as both a health\nscientist and researcher. I presently hold a M.S. in Health Science (with a focus in Health Education and an emphasis in research), and at some point I\nplan to continue onward towards my PhD. In what specific field, I couldn\u2019t tell\nyou--I\u0027m rather passionate about quite a few things!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy Should I Support You? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy Patreon account was born from the recommendation of some of you who wanted to donate/tip me in an easier way. To be completely transparent, the reality of content creation is that it comes with both a financial and time investment that can be minimized through your support. Advertisement revenue varies considerably for a number of reasons, so your donations through Patreon provide a level of consistency that ultimately helps me curtail the impact certain expenses (i.e. hardware, equipment, games).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of that being said, I do not expect anyone to become a patron. But, if you are feeling generous and want to help out, I truly do appreciate it! \u003cstrong\u003eYour contribution on any level\u2014even just $1.00 each month\u2014does make a significant difference.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhere Will My Donations Go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight\nback into my channel. As I\u2019ve mentioned already, I have my \u201cbig girl job\u201d which\npays my bills and allows me to enjoy the things in life that I want to pursue.\nHowever, retro games are a little bit expensive, so I am not always in the\nposition to pick up highly requested titles for my viewers. As such, it was\nrecommended to me awhile ago that I allow people to donate, so that I can\ncontinue to not only expand my video game collection (which in turn expands the\nvariety of Let\u2019s Plays that I will be able to produce), but to also upgrade all\nof my equipment and software. Additionally as a sort of distant possibility, if\nI find myself in the position where my channel becomes somewhat\nself-sustaining, I can step down from my role as a full-time researcher and\nmove into a part-time position\u2014meaning more time for video games and YouTube!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat Can You Offer in Return?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSadly, very little (outside of my everlasting gratitude, that is). Given my career duties and job role, I\u2019m\na rather busy woman, so I\u2019m unfortunately not in the position to offer as many enticing\nor interesting perks as others can. However, I can assure you that you will see an\nincrease in my channel\u2019s production value, a wider variety of video games being\nLPed, and more frequent uploads (provided that I can step down from my\nfull-time scientist role into a part-time one). \u003cstrong\u003eI do want to note that I only want you to become a patron if you truly enjoy what I do and want to help out directly. My perks may change over time as I become more or less busy with work commitments, so please keep that in mind!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat If I Can\u0027t Donate Right Now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat is completely fine and should not trouble you in the slightest! You taking the time to watch my videos is more than enough for me, so I never want you to feel as though you must contribute monetarily to the channel. This is simply a \"tip jar\" that is open for you to utilize if you are in the position or have the desire to do so. \u003cstrong\u003eAt no point will my videos ever become inaccessible due to a paywall. All of my content will forever remain free for everyone to view, so please rest assured that I never want your donations to be anything but voluntary.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read all of this! I am excited about\nthe future of Rabbit Plays Games and hope that you\u2019ll stick along with me for\nthe ride!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nxx"
