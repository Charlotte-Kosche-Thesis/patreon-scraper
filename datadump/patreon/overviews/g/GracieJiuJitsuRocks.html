Welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m glad you\u2019re here and want to support the show! My goal has always been to provide a show that\u0027s entertaining, educational, and inspirational. I believe I am accomplishing this through the exceptional guests and interviews, as well as through the Make a Difference/Make an Impact Segments. \u003cbr\u003eThe response and feedback I\u2019ve received about the show has been incredible. It really moves me on a deep level, having heard from so many people about what they\u2019ve gotten out of the show, and how much they enjoy listening to it. It has far exceeded the expectations I had when I started it, and for that I am beyond grateful. \u003cbr\u003eAs you know, I have never charged a fee for listening (I wanted to provide a great show that\u2019s free to the listeners), and have intentionally stayed away from sponsors, as I didn\u2019t want to over commercialize the show (I have considered taking on sponsors and am not completely shutting that door but for now I still feel this is the way I want to go). \u003cbr\u003eSo since you\u2019re here, I\u2019m assuming you have enjoyed listening to the show and feel it has provided value for you. I am very happy that we are connected through the podcast and hope we can make that connection even deeper.\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a look at the categories/levels of support and the \u201cperks\u201d you receive in each (BTW, the catoagories are just suggestions-feel free to support with any amount you can (even 1 dollar). The \u201cperks\u201d aren\u2019t there to entice you to support (I\u2019m hoping that if you\u2019re here you are already interested in supporting the show), they are merely my small ways to say thank you...\u003cbr\u003eAs I continue my journey with the podcast, I will to continue providing interesting, insightful, and entertaining episodes with great guests. Thank you so much for your support and encouragement!\u003cbr\u003eMarty\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
