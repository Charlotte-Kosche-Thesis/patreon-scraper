That\u0027s why Patreon makes a lot more sense.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe more support I get from Patreon, the more time I can spend creating great YouTube videos and writing my books.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs of January of 2016, I have hired a video editor for my channel. Editing my videos takes the most time, but is also the simplest work. By hiring that portion of making videos out, my daily time commitment is greatly reduced, meaning I can make videos more regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor right now, ALL my Patreon money will be going to my editor, plus a little extra out of my own pocket.\u00a0As the Patreon fund grows, I will stop having to pay my editor out of pocket. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as its feasible, I will also be giving them a raise, because they\u0027re totally worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\"WHAT EXACTLY DO I GET OUT OF THIS?\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRewards are something I struggled with for quite a while, and to this day I welcome suggestions on how to make them better.

You guys are the reason I\u0027m able to make videos at all, so it just makes sense to me to give you even more content. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTypically, the weekend video will be a recap of the past week and a look forward into the plan for the new week.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e$5 - MY BOOKS, PLUS MY WRITING ADVICE:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If you pledge five bucks a month, I consider that like a subscription to my writing career. It helps me tremendously, and so you get every book I ever publish\u2014weeks before I make them available for sale.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou also get early access to my Writer Wednesday videos. Every Wednesday I put out a special video with writing advice. Often it concerns what I\u0027m going through RIGHT now as a writer and indie author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Writer Wednesday videos are published here on Patreon two weeks before they go public on my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e$10 - FILMS:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0For those who pledge ten dollars, you\u0027ll get everything listed above, and you\u0027ll also receive for free any films I produce.

But people pledged high amounts anyway, and I felt bad not giving them anything extra for it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, for those who make a higher contribution each month, I offer insider access. I have a monthly hangout where I discuss what I did in the last month, what my plans are for the next month, and what\u0027s been going on in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThese people also get my films, and the other reward tiers, like my books.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, these people can reach out to me any time. If they want to email, chat, or have a personal conversation, they can consider me on call. It\u0027s the least I can do to repay their generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eAND THAT\u0027S IT.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all I have to say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to be a patron, you\u0027re one of the reasons I can keep making YouTube content for everyone, ad-free.

I don\u0027t want to work with publishers or film studios. Those corporations are in the business of making money. If they happen to make art along the way, it\u0027s a side effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be the opposite of that. I want to create my art free from corporate mandates and the threat of no paycheck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Studio Executive, YOU have become my paycheck. In exchange, YOU get to be my Studio Executive. You get to be there for the creation process. You\u0027ve proven you believe in me, so I\u0027m going to invite you in to the process itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 1st of every month, I will schedule an exclusive YouTube stream. I\u0027ll go live in my office for about an hour, and I will discuss my plans for the coming month and what I plan to get done. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also recap the previous month and what I produced, including a look at my numbers you can\u0027t get any other way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll always be up to date on what I\u0027m doing and how I\u0027m making use of YOUR generous contributions. And you will have an unprecedented level of access to my artistic creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what it means to be a Studio Executive.\u003c/div\u003e",
