I have in turn written books, released records, produced magazines, but I\u0027ve always come back to the visual arts as my main focus. \u00a0I have been gifted with a passion for art, for beauty, and for sharing it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe invisible College Magazine: \u003c/strong\u003eI started The Invisible College Magazine with the prompting of Robert Venosa \u0026amp; Martina Hoffmann. \u00a0I had been playing with the idea of a magazine that brought the contemporary art and consciousness scene together, and Robert \u0026amp; Martina said, \"Go for it\". \u00a0I have pursued it since, and am now working on the 8th edition of the magazine. \u00a0My goal is to make it a quarterly magazine, and to have a small monthly e-edition. \u00a0We feature Artist, Poets, Musicians, Storytellers, and Philosophy. \u00a0The perfect vehicle for the perfect times we live in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me?:\u003c/strong\u003eWhy support an artist? That is an excellent question. \u00a0Artist thrive best when they know they are supported. \u00a0Paetron is a great vehicle for those of us who have strived throughout their lives to live their art to the fullest. \u00a0I have \u00a0found a community who appreciates\u00a0my art on line via Facebook, Google+ \u0026amp; Tumblr. I would like to expand on this, returning to Galleries, and expanding my art into Graphic Novels, Folios, and to Film. I want my art to affect a greater change, and to be made more available to a larger audience. \u00a0Your patronage allows this to happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you support me you get a variety of prints in different formats depending on the level of patronage, as well as other benefits including calendars, magazines as well as access \u0026amp; perks to the relaunched EarthRites Radio. \u00a0Later on there will be Folios, \u0026amp; Graphic Novels and Limited Editions only available to Patreons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks so much for taking the time to visit my Patreon site. \u00a0I hope that you enjoy my work, and the direction I am going in with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBright Blessings,\u003cbr\u003eGwyllm"

His early artistic influences were Willifred S\u00e4tty, Max Ernst, Rick Griffin and various schools of Buddhist Mandala Art. Pursuing the depths of the Mandala and its secrets has been the basis of his art ever since. The basic tools for his artistic adventures lately have been the Airbrush and Photoshop.\u003cbr\u003eIn the past Gwyllm was involved with Surrealism and Arcane Metaphysics moving between the US and Europe. He started a publishing company for street poets (DIY Press) and later Grey Pavilion, an early Electronica Band, that moved between L.A. and London before crashing and burning. He returned to painting and printing in various forms and hasn\u2019t stopped since.\u003cbr\u003e",
