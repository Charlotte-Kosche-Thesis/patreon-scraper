    "summary": "Visual art is a message which transcends language, it moves us with color, form and composition. These works spark imagination, creates a story in our minds, fires up our emotions without regard to time, culture and the rise and fall of nations. This form of message has been a passion of mine since childhood and everything I experience in life becomes a part of it. In my view an artist becomes successful when they become the message itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really did try to play by the rules in my beginning years, find a benefactor, an early buyer or two, the typical art shows then work your way up the gallery ladder to fame and fortune! Every young artist hears these things, there are some problems with this currently traditional approach, not to mention a large box of unwritten rules. From what I have experienced, the gallery world can be very constraining and has its own agendas that many times have little to do with the message of their artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I want for my studio? Freedom from an accepted system which makes moves to control and constrain what artwork is produced without any regard for humanity in general. Gulotta Studios is attempting to operate without the traditional galleries and bring works directly to the public. I want Gulotta Studios to be a free agent, setting prices based upon need, not greed. To promote freedom of expression and to show that artists can operate independently and that galleries are an option rather than a necessity is a vital part of being the message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGulotta Studios is my home, my world, it serves the community with lessons and an apprentice program to help new talent develop their skills to become creators. It is a precious thing and thus it can be frightening to work without the backing of the gallery scene, yet I chose this path willingly despite my earlier successes within that arena in order to have the freedom to share my knowledge, to show my work on my own terms and with your help it can be done and you can be a proud Patron of the Arts and be a grand part of this venture!\u003cbr\u003e"
