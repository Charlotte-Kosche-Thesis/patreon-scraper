I have an Etsy shop, Instagram, and Facebook page called GeilerArts. This past year, I\u0027ve been experimenting more with my artwork and have been learning more about the human figure. My artwork is mostly based on the figure painting. Someday, I would also like to start investing in video equipment to make a YouTube channel for time lapse videos of\u00a0the processes of my\u00a0artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will help me\u00a0a lot in investing in more art equipment and making websites to sell and showcase my artwork on. My goal is to invest in more supplies, prints of my artwork, websites, and great quality business cards! My biggest goal though, is to show you how beautiful the human body is and how every single one of us is beautiful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support! It truly means so much to me and I am really looking forward to showing you what I can do with my artwork. I hope my art gives you inspiration!"
