I\u0027m George Kavallines\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and I\u0027m an illustrator that loves making sometimes creepy, sometimes sparkly, sometimes super nerdy illustrations! I\u0027ve always been a fan of weird things that go bump in the night, princesses in ornate dresses, and video games, and I think all of those heavily influence my work. On this page I\u0027m going to be posting all kinds of artwork -- original characters, studies, fanart, doodles, painting experiments -- all in the name of improvement. Plus, I\u0027ve got a Twitch page, so sometimes I\u0027ll do streams! I\u0027ve been known to take doodle requests, have spooky story sharing sessions, and way too often, forget I\u0027m on stream and start getting \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0into my music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe structure of this is pretty simple -- I draw stuff! I try and make new, exciting things with a focus on both improvement and fun. $1 gets you a high resolution copy of the drawing. Anything past that amount is purely decided by how much you want to support me. Any amount is a treasure to me, so I\u0027m eternally grateful to all of you that pledge your support to me. Thank you. Thankyouthankyouthankyou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make good art, then make better art after that\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
