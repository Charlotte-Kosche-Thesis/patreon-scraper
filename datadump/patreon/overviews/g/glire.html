    "summary": "I have a theory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis theory is that people who like someone\u0027s work generally want that person to keep making it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat that means is usually abstracted. You made X awesome story, now make something else that\u0027s like X awesome story but not exactly. What is required in an economic system in which that person has to be paid in order to eat is: I\u0027ll let you eat, and in return, you keep making something else that\u0027s like X awesome story but not exactly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fiction for around 15 years. I\u0027ve developed my own style, and my own characters. Those characters have lives and jobs. Some are magic users; some are mundane. (Sometimes, they coexist.) Most of them have tails, or fur, or beaks. All of them, however, have an emotional core at their centre, a voice with which to speak, and something to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use these characters to make stories. Sometimes I know what I\u0027m making beforehand; sometimes I don\u0027t. Sometimes I only know halfway through the story. But everything I write has its own beating heart, its own emotional truth. I may write about people and situations far removed from anything anyone has ever experienced, but I am always searching for the part of that experience that will connect to something that we all experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t believe in gating content, even temporally. Every post I post will be released for free elsewhere at the same time as it is released for paid patrons. You aren\u0027t paying me for access to my writing process (of which it is, and I quote: Sit down, think of what to write, and write), or early access to my stories, or some exclusive VIP lounge. You\u0027re paying me so I can keep writing. That\u0027s a fair bargain, I think, and I\u0027d hope you feel the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how much I might have to say about a subject, my stories will be between 1,000 and 2,000 words most frequently, sometimes longer than that. My longest stories can be upwards of 8,000 words. All of these will be released for the same price. Length is not a determinant of quality. How much do you think a thousand words are worth? Fifty cents? That\u0027s fair. A dollar? Two dollars?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing NaNoWriMo sprints in lieu of novel writing. I\u0027ve written 27 stories in 27 days, each about a different character, about a different event. I\u0027ve written 38,000 words, edited and polished, in 27 days. How much is nearly 40,000 words in four weeks worth to you? Five dollars? Ten? Twenty?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where my wager comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI bet that some people, maybe you, will think my stories are awesome. I bet that some people, maybe you, will want me to make more of them. And I bet that some people, maybe you, will help me eat so I can do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in return, I\u0027ll keep finding emotional truths to write about, and keep writing about them.\u003cbr\u003e"
