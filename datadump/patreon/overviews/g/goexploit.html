These new technologies are \nchanged our life and everything. We are adapting our lifes to new \ntechnologies. Businesses hold sensitive information on their employees, \nsalary information, financial results, and business plans for the year \nahead. They may also hold trade secrets, research and other information \nthat gives them a competitive edge. Individuals usually hold sensitive \npersonal information on their home computers and typically perform \nonline functions such as banking, shopping and social networking; \nsharing their sensitive information with others over the internet. These\n changes make our lives much easier and productive. But as\n more and more of this information is stored and processed \nelectronically and transmitted across company networks or the internet, \nthe risk of unauthorised access increases and we are presented with \ngrowing challenges of how best to protect it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn our\ntrainings, we are explaining what\nis happening in the field of information security, hackers attack\nmethods and measures to be taken to ensure security against these attacks.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat contributions\nwill our training bring to you:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\tIt will\nprovide information about personal security (bank accounts, social media\naccounts, email accounts, etc.) tips.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\tGiving you\na good perspective about risks in the virtual world.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\tIf you are an\nIT personel, trainings have significant\nbenefits in your career\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\tIf you are\na company manager, you will be aware of the cyber attacks and learn the\nmeasures you should take\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\tIt will increase\nyour knowledge in information security and ethical hacking\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\tProvides\nyou with a starting point and career in Ethical Hacking and information\nsecurity.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\tWith\ncourses enriched by examples, you can learn theoretical knowledge also improve\nyour practical skills.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos we will create in a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur aim is to cover two topic completely in a video course within one month.

On the other hand everyone who use technology need to learn this knowledge. Our team and I love what we are doing and we want share our knowledge \nwith others. We believe sharing and helping people is important. So we are giving our full time to create these courses and make avaliable for everyone that need it with an affordable price.

     "about": "My name is G\u00f6khan OKUMU\u015e. I started my career by learning programming\n languages. In my high school days I learned C and C++. After a few \nyears later I started to learn C# programming language. I did some basic\n automation programmes for accountants. I studied these programming \nlanguages until university. In my university years I started to learn \nweb programming languages.

We kept maintained these \nprojects during our university days. \u003cstrong\u003eAfter university I started \nto work at IT Department of Turkish National Police. I was responsible \nfrom Systems, Networks and Security structure of Personnel Information \nSystem project. These project have users between 250.000 to 300.000 in \ngeneral and we had 15.000 active users twenty four hours.\u003c/strong\u003e I \nmanaged to run this project without any major incident for 4 years. In \norder to run this project smoothly I took courses about Microsoft \nServers, Hyper-V Virtualization, Juniper and Cisco switches and routers,\n Checkpoint Firewalls, IBM IPS\u2019s, Linux Servers, Antivirus Systems and \nCertified Ethical Hacking. Because of the different workflow in Turkish \nNational Police I was able gain so many valuable knowledge and \nexperiences.\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter gaining these valuable skills I was able focus much more on \ncyber security. I learned Assembly for both 32 bit and 64 bit \narthitecture. I learned Python and sharpening my Python skills in area \nof security. For the time being I prepared courses and continue to \nprepare another courses for other people to learn security topics fast \nand easily. My courses are on different online teaching platforms.
