You can also check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gracegordonofficial.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gracegordonofficial/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e for more information about me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003eMy entire purpose as an artist is to foster community, connection, and healing through the work I produce. However, being a full time actress, model, and podcaster is both expensive AND isolating. Having a Patreon allows me to connect with a community, produce work that all of you desire, and survive off my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI DIDN\u0027T KNOW YOU WERE A _______!\u003cbr\u003eBecause I have been involved in such a wide area of communities over the years, you may be here looking for one thing and discover something totally new. You may be looking for my acting and modeling work and have no interest in activism. You may only be interested in a book podcast, and not want to see any modeling work, and that\u0027s fine too! However you heard about me, welcome! I will be using this space to feature discussions on art, pop culture, sex \u0026amp; relationships, healing and meditation, body image, and fandom. I will also be posting modeling work, and film projects. At the point of posting this, I am also using Patreon to launch a new BOOK PODCAST! (You may know me from Book Jawn Podcast, which was dedicated to discussing books and publishing through the lens of social justice, feminism, and fandom).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI DON\u0027T WANT TO GIVE YOU MY MONEY!\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t have to! I\u0027m going to keep doing what I am doing, and you are under no obligation to give me money to do that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI WANT TO GIVE YOU MY MONEY BUT I AM TOO BROKE!\u003cbr\u003eHey, I totally understand, and I love you for wanting to be supportive. As with all artists, a word of encouragement goes a long way, as does a retweet or a comment online. Thank you for being so sweet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSEX/NUDITY/FEMINISM/RACE/GENDER DYNAMICS/POLITICS MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMe too! That\u0027s why I read about them, talk about them, and feature them in my work. Our culture is misinformed, angry, hurt, and confused around all of these issues. If you are uncomfortable, I invite you to have an open mind and unlearn some toxic programming with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BEFORE I BECOME A PATRON....\u003cbr\u003eEmail me your specific Patreon questions at gracegordonofficial@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI LOVE YOU!\u003cbr\u003e"
