    "summary": "My name is Gabriel; I\u0027m a Melbourne based writer probably most well known for being a host of the semi-popular podcast Movie Maintenance and for once winning a screenwriting award from the Emmys. Outside of this I\u0027m a pretty prolific playwright and the author of Boone Shepard and Boone Shepard\u0027s American Adventure, a pair of YA adventure novels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no secret that writing is an absolute nightmare of a career to try and make it in. Getting anybody to notice your work is an uphill battle, making that work good enough to be worth the notice is a full time job and trying to make a living from it is a naive hope at best. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands, I make just enough money from my various creative pursuits to get by, and that alone makes me one of the lucky ones. But it remains a struggle. Authors make $2 per book sold; unless you\u0027re moving an astronomical amount of copies (I\u0027m not) then you\u0027re hardly going to be living comfortably any time soon. Similar challenges arise when trying to make a living doing theatre or podcasting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m turning to Patreon. I\u0027ve got no interest in getting rich from writing, I just want to keep getting by doing what I love, and so I\u0027m offering up everything I have, from samples of works in progress to full novels, plays and screenplays yet to see the light of day. I don\u0027t believe in asking for handouts so I\u0027m pretty much giving full access to anybody willing to part with some of their hard earned to read a yarn or two. This is very simply a case of \u0027if you like my stuff, have some more of it for less than the price of a coffee a month.\u0027 And if you do, I can\u0027t put into words how grateful I am. Writing for a living always seemed like a distant and impossible dream, and it\u0027s due to people like you that somehow it has become a reality. For that I can\u0027t thank you enough. \u003cbr\u003e"
