Our aim here with the Patreon is to devote a lot more time to Matt and Co. doing things, from reviews of upcoming games on consoles and computers to reviewing new and cool tech, doing unboxings of a sundry assortment of weird and wild monthly subscription boxes and a ongoing look into the recording of a record that Matt is working on! \u00a0As this grows, there will be a lot more interesting and hopefully funny videos, podcasts, posts that will engage you, interest you, and get you in on our strange community of funny, opinionated wackjobs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/a80bbde4aacb2a091f375d48ce0d81a4/tumblr_inline_oldhfdJf8B1qzs0ma_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/5f702ac717a947ed1927c4ef921fd6da/tumblr_inline_oldhfik65m1qzs0ma_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations are going into the construction of a set headquartered out of my home, and towards production costs of doing the series from my own place instead of me having to find slow moments in the day at my job and filming it there.\u00a0 This way I can pop online, and get information and reviews out to you, the viewer, so fast it\u0027ll make your head spin. As it is now, I shoot on the weekends, end the show, and am generally a week or so late in reviewing new content that everyone else has jammed out at warp speed. It\u0027s the downside to not having a good enough setup to put out a professional looking show. \u00a0But it will be easy to get there if the money is there!
