As a child, I was a late reader. Once a very patient EA helped spark my passion for the subject I quickly became a voracious reader. Writing naturally followed.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;My Influences\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;\n\u003cdiv\u003e\nSome writers can easily identify who their strongest influences were. Though I certainly did my fair share of experimental imitating my writing style is largely a result of deliberately trying to do things differently from established authors right from the beginning.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI credit a lot of my development to the fact that I\u0027ve always had a thick skin for criticism and drive to improve. I was lucky enough to be part of the fanfiction.net community in the early 2000\u0027s - a time at which the site was largely unmoderated. That meant that there was no room for a lack of emotional resiliency and certainly no room for mistakes. My ideal learning environment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;What Science Fiction and Romantic Science Fiction Mean to Me\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;\n\u003cdiv\u003eI believe in the purpose of Science Fiction as many of the founding fathers of the genre did. In essence that by taking the problems of this world out of context we can remove human ego from the conversation and discuss ideas more objectively. On the other hand I also believe in fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the word \u0027Romance\u0027 is added to the genre I emphasize healthy relationships and the romance \u00a0and steaminess share center stage with the other elements of the story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
