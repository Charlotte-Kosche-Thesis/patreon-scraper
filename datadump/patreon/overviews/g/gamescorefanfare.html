    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHi, I\u2019m Mathew Dyason! I make a video series called Game Score Fanfare, a show that celebrates music in video games. Music is an aspect in games that is so often overlooked, as that\u0027s often the point: to work without you even realising it\u0027s there. I look at games through the lens of its score, discovering the unique perspective and roles that music can bring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/11PA8QlyRNI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you using Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the end of 2016, I was severely unhappy with my career trajectory and decided to quit my job. I wanted to pursue online video, a hobby of mine for a decade, and so committed myself to learning video production. I created Game Score Fanfare not only to share my passion of video game music, but also as a project to teach myself how to write and edit videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u2019m supporting my wife and I through casual work in an unrelated field, and all my spare time is going toward making videos. I\u2019d love to leave work all together and have more time dedicated to learning, making videos and achieving my dream of making a living through online video. You can help make this happen through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/COgzJey4EAc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u2019re charging per video: how often do you make videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to consistently one or two videos per month, but that\u0027s not possible at the moment as I\u0027m still learning and taking the time to make sure the videos are as good as they possibly can be. Most often it\u0027s once per month, occasionally it\u0027s none, and it will NEVER be three or more - I will never charge for any more than two videos per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gr03nRLbWos\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for choosing to support me in this journey, in whatever way you\u2019re able. Even if that\u2019s just through watching and commenting, I\u2019m so grateful for all the support I receive. I want to learn as much as I can and make Game Score Fanfare as good as it can be. Thanks to Patreon, you can help make this happen and get some cool perks out of it too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
