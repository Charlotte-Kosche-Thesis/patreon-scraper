    "summary": "Hi! \u00a0I\u0027m Grumpy Princess. \u00a0I\u0027m a princess and I have a vlog. YouTube.com/grumpyprincess\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hobbies include: exploring the interwebs, irreverent feminism, weird princess shit, burping, alerting you to things that should irritate you, and ranting about the patriarchy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut guess what? Being an angry princess on the internet is a lot of work. \u00a0How much work? \u00a0Well, currently, it takes 1.5-2 days to film and edit a video, plus an additional 2-3 hours per day writing new content, photoshopping silly things for Facebook, learning new editing skills, and other random princess business.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who geek out on financial stuff, here\u0027s a more in depth sample of some of the things your money would be doing for the Grumpy Princess show:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetter lighting- what I have is ok, but for better image quality I need 2 or 3 more lights for my princess studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore people! I want to introduce you to my magical friends! This means coordinating actors and additional help, more complicated editing, and hopefully paying everyone for their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiscellaneous props and costumes- The more money I have for, say, centaur costumes; the more entertained you will be. \u00a0I promise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore frequent content: \u00a0I would love to be producing weekly Patron-only content. I also have a dream of making a series of videos for kids! Right now, it takes 2-3 full days per week to produce one video, so I can\u0027t afford to commit to regularly producing more content. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBIGGER, VERY EXCITING, TOP SECRET THINGS that cost money and are also a surprise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOH, and paying me a little bit so I can continue to spend around a third of my time making silly ranty feminist princess shit for the internet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically what I am saying is, you should give me your money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
