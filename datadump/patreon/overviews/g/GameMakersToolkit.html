    "summary": "Hi! My name\u0027s Mark Brown, and I\u0027m the creator of a YouTube series about game design, called Game Maker\u0027s Toolkit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn each episode I strive to reveal the hidden genius of my favourite games, demystify the design process, pass on the philosophies of the world\u0027s best designers, or take a critical look at the most recent releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve talked about how\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmIkEvEBtA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMario\u0027s stages are inspired by Chinese poetry\u003c/a\u003e, how\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqk5Zf0tw3o\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSpelunky generates levels\u003c/a\u003e, how\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qot5_rMB8Jc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Last Guardian tells a story through the language of games\u003c/a\u003e, how\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHhX5GtWNr8\u0026amp;t=7s\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShovel Knight nails nostalgia\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg0Nbfzo_00\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewhat Mirror\u0027s Edge Catalyst should have learned from Burnout Paradise\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos are for both gamers looking to learn more about their favourite games, and new designers looking to find out more about how games use their design to challenge us, deliver experiences, and tell stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got endless ideas for new episodes - and I want you to help me make them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service where you can pledge to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support themselves and keep making new stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is better for creators than advertising or sponsorship. The content is 100% uncompromised, payment is more predictable, and creators don\u0027t need to stoop to clickbait content or other shady practices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon means that creators serve their viewers, not advertisers or corporate sponsors. And where the viewers choose what deserves to be made and who deserves a voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I end up paying?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pay per month. I always release at least one video a month, but often will put out two. In the very unlikely circumstance that I don\u0027t make a single video, I won\u0027t charge anyone for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2017, I was able to make Game Maker\u0027s Toolkit my full time job. So, Patreon is now my primary source of income. I therefore need the money to, like, eat and stuff - all while spending upwards of 100 hours researching, writing, editing, and publishing the latest episode of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also use the money to purchase equipment for the show (like hard drives to store game captures, better capture equipment, and new consoles), games, online services, and stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patrons pledging $1 or more get updates about the show, behind the scenes stuff, opportunities to help with upcoming episodes, a monthly newsletter about me and my work, and a terrific collection of articles and videos that should be of interest to any fan of GMTK.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, you can take part in our regular GameClub discussions and join our Discord server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $3 a video and you\u0027ll get a bonus video each month. This is called Game Maker\u0027s Playlist and is a collection of three recently released indie games that may be of interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd those who pledge $5 will get new episodes of Game Maker\u0027s Toolkit 24 hours early and will appear in the credits for every paid-for episode. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill I get previous Patron-only content when I subscribe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, but only after your first payment has been processed (which happens at the beginning of the month).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything to declare?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also work as a freelance writer and consultant so I sometimes get paid for that. I sometimes receive free games from developers but will make this clear in the description for any video that talks about the game at length.\u003cbr\u003e"
