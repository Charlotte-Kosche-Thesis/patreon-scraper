    "summary": "Thank you so much to all of those who have and continue to support me and that have a heart for trees, plants, food security, adventures, silliness and supporting those who want to go out and create positive shifts in the world! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for you to support the things you want to support. You get to decide how much of a pledge you want to make (as low as $1) on a per-project basis towards ideas that you resonate with and want to see succeed. Remember there are multiple projects happening each month so make sure that your contributions are affordable to you if you end up paying for 2 or 3 projects in one month. You can also go into your account settings and place a limit on your monthly spending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe projects we set up will directly benefit you and the community by setting up systems that increase supply and lower the price of fresh, local foods that are growing all over the Phoenix-Metro area. You get to follow along by watching videos where you will learn and be inspired by all of the great ideas as well as the community togetherness these projects generate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some examples of what our videos will look like, only patrons will have access to see our project videos. Pledge and follow along with us as each idea unfolds and witness the changes in the people and our communities.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.foragingfanatics.com/foraging-videos\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://www.foragingfanatics.com/foraging-videos\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here allows me to perform the work that is necessary to build and spread ideas based on natural systems. The goal is to get these ideas to take root around the country and eventually the world, easing people\u0027s lives and bringing a balanced amount of the natural world into our day to day routines. The less I have to worry about money, the more time I can focus on what I do best, protecting people, the planet and giving all living beings (including plants and animals) their fair share of access to the basic needs required to support healthy life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***Note, I make my own money to support my lifestyle through my tree care company\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.treelation.co\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.treelation.co\u003c/a\u003e and my foraging program\u00a0\u003ca\u003ewww.foragingfanatics.com.\u003c/a\u003e Any contributions that you make here on Patreon are going directly to pay for materials necessary to create projects that I have a passion for and believe will make a positive impact on our daily lives. I am using the money you give me to build things for others or the local community and to implement and experiment with ideas that make life easier and healthier for all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pledge to work for free to create all of these projects because I am fortunate enough to make the money I need to live. So, you put a small amount of money in here and there, I pump out systems that create an infinite benefit to the my community and the world. Here is one example of a regenerative idea I was able to create while I was going to school for Urban Farming and Nutrition Coaching which allows people to essentially grow food for free!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bioticbeds.wordpress.com/garden-beds/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://bioticbeds.wordpress.com/garden-beds/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegenerative Project Example: Date palms here require very little energy or water to create hundreds of pounds of dates per tree. We can capture this energy and share with the community to feed those who have limited access to food. The fronds from the tree can be processed easily into fiber boards used for building or it can be added to blacktop to build stronger and less expensive roads. The energy that the people receive from the dates allows them to work and provide value to their communities. There are many other advantages and uses of these energies but just the value of those two things is enough for the energy we captured to create supportive changes in a community. Just imagine all of the possibilities! I do the work once and reap the benefits over and over with little to no extra time or energy :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many projects I am working on but being limited by my own personal funds is slowing me down from what I could really be doing and providing to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease let\u0027s all work together to create the changes that we know will increase the standard of living for the people in our communities. As systems are built and spread we can create sustainable, positive change the world over."

     "about": "Thank you so much for reading this section and working towards getting to know me better! Here is a brief overview of who I am and why I am on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealizing that I am an artist/inventor/visionary more than I am an actual entrepreneur, I find that it is time to focus on my passion and to build ideas and systems that are changing the way people interact with each other and the planet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is becoming more clear each day that our society has caused humans to become separate from the natural world. We see the challenges of the epidemics we find in the health of our people and the health of our planet. There are plenty of well-organized studies that have proven that being near natural areas, humans see a decrease in mental and physical symptoms of many different kinds of disease. Eating food that has been picked and eaten in the same day have properties that allow the body to to absorb the proper nutrients necessary to create radical healing in our bodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of you reading this know that I have an inherent passion for being in nature and finding ways for our \u0027Tamed\u0027 lives to incorporate a healthy dose of living with and caring for our plant and tree allies. I live each day to find the connections and opportunities where we can offer nature to become part of our routines in a way that offers simplicity and convenience. We can create a higher standard of living for all of Earth\u0027s inhabitants by incorporating systems that put nature to work for us without compromising too much of our time or energy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, give me the opportunity to get more involved, to create more projects, to gather more community and to create ideas that can become movements! With enough time, dedication and support from people who have a heart for a world where we all have the opportunity to follow our dreams, I will birth concepts that will spawn a new way of life that calls for more love, compassion, connection and beauty in our everyday world.",

Doing this will allow us to undercut other date suppliers from other parts of the country and the rest of the world so we can provide fresh, local dates to our restaurants and health food stores at competitive prices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can we get the price down to $2/lb? We found a way to work with the \u0027Double Up Food Bucks\u0027 program so that we can get our prices down to $2/pound for those who are going through a hard time and are on WIC, SNAP and SFMNP. This allows these people to afford fresh, healthy food for themselves and their families. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know about dates then you know that they are a staple of a healthy family home.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also be able to experience the entire process through watching the educational videos that I will be making with point of view cameras and some basic editing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be filming every step of the process and making the videos available on the Patron-only page kept private, exclusively for all contributors. Yes, even if you only pledge a $1 per project :) You will see how things unfold and the changes we create together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTake a look at these past super-food gatherings we have done completed:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/%E2%80%8Bhttp://www.foragingfanatics.com/foraging-videos\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.foragingfanatics.com/foraging-videos\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e",

We will be selling dates for $4/lb to the general public. Can you imagine that? $4 per pound for fresh, local dates?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to purchase the proper containers to store our dates. Air tight containers will give dates a 6 months shelf life at room temperature and up to a year if refrigerated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to purchase enough to store 2,000 pounds of dates while we get them distributed to the area, we will need to get about $800 worth of containers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, this isn\u0027t a business idea for making money, this is about sustainably rescuing food and getting to the community at an affordable price. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCash gotta flow for such good things to grow!
