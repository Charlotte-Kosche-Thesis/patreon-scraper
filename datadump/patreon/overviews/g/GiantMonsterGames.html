Let me tell you about what I\u2019m making and why I need your help. To start I\u2019m a huge Magic: the Gathering fan, so much so that I have an entire youtube channel full of magic related videos. The focus of my channel is about getting people playing the game even if they don\u2019t have much to spend on cards. The way I do this is by presenting a regular deck tech of interesting yet competitive budget decks normally ranging from $20-$80. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u2019t need to spend $1000 to have a good magic deck. Let me show you how $40 can get you playing and winning games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAd revenue on YouTube currently covers the cards I need to buy for the budget deck tech videos and some slow upgrades such as the new mic I bought back in the summer. Unfortunately that is about as far as it goes, this means I still need to work a full time job to pay for day to day life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your direct support I can focus on making more regular high quality content, with the dream of one day being able to do this full time.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do I post videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work on a 2 week rotation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 1: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWednesday: Live Stream(7pm-est)\u003cbr\u003eFriday: Budget Deck Tech \u0026amp; Gameplay\u003cbr\u003eSat \u0026amp; Sun: Gameplay of recent deck\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 2: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWednesday: Live Stream(7pm-est)\u003cbr\u003eFriday: Revisited Deck Tech, Let\u2019s talk Magic or Week off\u003cbr\u003eSat \u0026amp; Sun: Gameplay if there was a revisited deck tech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOccasionally there are other videos that pop up too.
