    "summary": "I first want to thank each and every one of you who contribute to these projects. All proceeds go towards supporting the creation of my work that I hope will bring joy and inspiration to many. Now I\u0027ll tell you a bit about myself and why you may want to join me on this epic quest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an artist, musician, writer, and game developer. I\u0027m a huge fan of post-apocolyptics, dystopians, sci-fi and fantasy. I love the 80s, early 90s nostalgia, and RPG video games! If you love these things too, then I think you\u0027ll find enjoyment in what I do and want to bring to the world. Currently I am writing Synthwave and Vaporwave music for the soundtrack of my video game, Phoenix Undying. This series I worked on for the past 8 years. From the books, to the art and now to the video game and music. Xbox has come to me asking if I\u0027d like to take my game to console and of course, I accepted this offer. All my patrons will have their names mentioned as a special thanks in my published works which are soon to come. But you all get exclusive first looks, tutorials, concept designs, book illustrations, character art, music, comic strip pages, and whole chapters to the book series monthly. I know that together, we can bring this series to life and one day, I hope to use this funding to open a full studio where I hope to hire a fantastic team to continue bringing my visions and stories to life in the hopes of entertaining everyone who loves a great adventure in the future as much as I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you again and I look forward to your support. It means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e-Ginger Anne London\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gingerannelondon.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
