    "summary": "Hello and thank you for considering becoming a Patron. Should you become a Patron I want you to know I will do whatever I can to help you with your musical goals! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patrons see video\u0027s first, get song and PDF downloads, lessons and other perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming my Patreon doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll just be a financial contributor. It also gives you the opportunity to help me with things like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Helping me pick the next cover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Getting a free download of the song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Upgrade to better recording and filming equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Get one-on-one music lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put up 4-6 videos each month and you can pledge as little as up to $1 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 13, I was taking drum lessons at the corner music store. I was in a band already, it was going to be awesome! Then I was told, \"we found a drummer who\u0027s better than you...but we need a bass player!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u00a0moment changed my life! I switched my deposit from a drum kit to a bass guitar, enrolled in the high school band program, and ever since, I\u0027ve been practicing, performing and pursuing my love of playing music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been very lucky to have\u00a0traveled the world playing music and have done almost every type of gig you can imagine. From 1000 seat theatres night after night to cocktail music in the corner, dances, concerts, festivals, bars and clubs, musical theatre, writing and arranging, band leading, and teaching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent years looking for that one concept, idea or exercise (I\u0027ve even checked out George Russell and Slonimsky) that would change my playing forever and make me a great musician/improviser. Unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t work like that. However, there are definitely things you can learn and practice that will\u00a0drastically save you time in the long run. The most important things to learn and the fastest way to playing an instrument is to: \u003cbr\u003e1. Approach learning and practicing music as you would a language and a sport.\u003cbr\u003e2. Understand the Major Scale and how to play Diatonically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this approach, I\u0027ve also been able to learn and play piano, guitar and drums.\u003cbr\u003e"
