Golden Spiral Media uses professional quality equipment in our studio, and it\u2019s designed to last a long time, but nothing lasts forever.  When a piece of equipment needs to be replaced, it\u2019s usually expensive.  I\u2019d also like to upgrade our live show cameras and purchase a high-end audio recorder that would allow us to have a portable studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I would very much like to be able to compensate our co-hosts for the time, dedication, and work that they put in to each show. Your support of Golden Spiral Media will enable me to do that. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Patreon isn\u0027t really your thing but you still want to support us financially, you can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations\u0026amp;business=76R387DF23GVS\u0026amp;lc=US\u0026amp;item_name=Golden%20Spiral%20Media\u0026amp;no_note=0\u0026amp;cn=Add%20message%20to%20Golden%20Spiral%20Media%3A\u0026amp;no_shipping=1\u0026amp;rm=1\u0026amp;return=http%3A%2F%2Fww.goldenspiralmedia.com%2Fdonation-success\u0026amp;cancel_return=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldenspiralmedia.com%2Fdonation-cancel%C2%A4cy_code=USD\u0026amp;bn=PP-DonationsBF%3Abtn_donateCC_LG.gif%3ANonHosted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here to send us a donation via PayPal.\u003c/a\u003e"
