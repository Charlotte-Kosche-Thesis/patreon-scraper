    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! We\u0027re Caitlin and Jordan, and we make \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/geekdownpod\"\u003ethe Geekdown Podcast\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe Geekdown is a show that not only looks at news from the worlds of pop culture and science through a feminist and socially just lens (yeah, we\u0027re one of \u003cstrong\u003ethose\u003c/strong\u003e shows), it also tries to find the spots where nerds who like different things can find some common ground.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did this happen?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSometime in 2014, the Doctor Who relaunch hit Canadian Netflix. To \nthat point Jordan\u0027s only familiarity with the show was a vague recollection of\n being terrified as a child when that \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fnzcAFy8d8\"\u003ecreepy theme music\u003c/a\u003e\nstarted playing after Polka Dot Door ended on TVOntario. But with the \n2009 reboot, and especially David Tennant\u2019s turn as the Tenth Doctor, \nthe show became a sort of phenomenon in Jordan\u0027s circle of friends, \nspecifically with young women he knew who never expressed any tendency to\n nerdery before. So he made an effort to check it out.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nAnd he hated it.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHe could spot the reasons why he hated it (the camp, the mugging, the \nthreadbare special effects), but every so often he saw what others saw in\n it: when the Ninth Doctor went H.A.M. on \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIjUSzpYcuA\"\u003eThe Last Dalek in the Universe \u003c/a\u003ehe thought he was all in. By the time \nthe Tenth Doctor was fighting werewolves with Queen Victoria the next \nseason, he was throwing up his hands. And he was troubled by what he seemed \nto be missing. Of course no one has to like everything, but this was \nsomething of \u201chis people,\u201d and he felt lacking because he couldn\u2019t get over\n whatever was keeping him from just enjoying it. It couldn\u2019t be the space\n travel, he loved \n\u003cem\u003eStar Trek: TNG\u003c/em\u003e. It couldn\u2019t be the time travel, he loved \u003cem\u003eBack to the Future\u003c/em\u003e\nas much as any eighties baby. Was it the Britishness? Jordan grew up loving \nAmerican superheroes and Japanese anime, did his fandom fall \nalong nationalist lines? He took these concerns to his friend Caitlin, one\n of the aforementioned young women who loved Doctor Who, from well \nbefore its 21st Century reboot. They never really reached an answer, but Jordan\n never stopped thinking about this idea that he and Caitlin were both \nnerds/geeks/dorks, but in completely different ways. Surely their fandoms \nhad to overlap somewhere?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u2019s when Geekdown was born. Every Tuesday, Jord and Cait \nbring each other things from their various areas of interest, things the \nother likely wouldn\u2019t check out, and talk about whether they liked it, and \nwhy or why not, as they try to find the sweet spots where fandoms \nintersect. And as they find new things to love, maybe you will as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving built a small but dedicated audience and having proven to themselves they could do it consistently (\u003cstrong\u003eover 80 weekly episodes\u003c/strong\u003e) they started to think about how the show could grow, and what it would take to do that, and if there was a way for the people who listen to the show to help develop that growth, they had to try, because they love this show and the folks who listen that much. Sometimes you have to take a gamble on yourself, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what would the money go to?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoundcloud hosting\u003c/strong\u003e. Ensuring that come June 2017, we don\u0027t run the risk of losing any of the content we\u0027ve already made up until now.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA mixer\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0027ve never had a guest on the show not because we don\u0027t want to, we just can\u0027t accommodate one with our current setup of two mics and a laptop. A simple mixer would not only improve the overall sound quality of the show, but it would be easier to add extra mics for guests and interviews.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransportation\u003c/strong\u003e. People often comment on how they love our dynamic, and the simple reason the show has that energy is because we\u0027re both in the room when we record. We pride ourselves on not having to rely on Skype or Google hangouts to make the show, but keeping us in the same room involves Caitlin making an almost two-hour commute from Hamilton to Toronto every week.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA chair for Caitlin. \u003c/strong\u003eLook at that video. This isn\u0027t a joke. She basically sits on a fabric-covered milkcrate for hours at a time (Her and Jordan \u003cstrong\u003edo\u003c/strong\u003e switch, he\u0027s not a monster).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese goals are, admittedly, modest. But as regular listeners of the show have no doubt discerned, we are not....\u003cstrong\u003e\"wealthy.\"\u003c/strong\u003e We could probably eventually meet these goals on our own, and frankly our WASP-y guilt screams at us pretty relentlessly to suffer in silence carry it alone. But we believe in what we do, we believe it brings a small bit of good and fun into the world and the lives of our listeners. We just want the opportunity for the show to become what we both think it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever much you feel you can support, even if it\u0027s $1 a month, even if it\u0027s a rate and review on \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/geekdown-podcast/id1078851550?mt=2\"\u003eApple Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, all of it helps us grow the show, and we are more grateful for it than you\u0027ll ever know.\u003cbr\u003e"
