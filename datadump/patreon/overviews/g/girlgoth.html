I\u0027m Lily, aka Girlgoth, and I\u0027m an artist. I make lots of different kinds of art, some silly and some serious. One of my biggest artistic passions is portraiture, and more specifically, white pencil portraits. You may have seen some of my work before, like my David Bowie tribute portrait, or one of my other fan art or fantasy portraiture pieces. But I also do paintings, cartoon bats, sew little plush monsters, make doll wigs, all kinds of things! I want to share all of it with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/26qp5fVtlXY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is Patreon, and what does it do that makes it so EPIC? What Patreon does, is it makes it possible for you to go from being a fan of, let\u0027s say, my work, to being a Patron of it. You choose a reward tier, make a monthly payment, and voila! You are a \u003cstrong\u003ePatron of the Arts\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach reward tier has a more detailed description of what you\u0027ll get at \nthat level. Since I am inspired a lot by magic and fairytales, each \nreward tier has the name of a kind of magical creature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReward tiers start at just $1 a month, and go up from there. \u003cbr\u003eI will still be posting free content like finished artwork, info about shows and where you can find my pieces in person and online, like I always have. But there will be things like my work in progress photos and videos and concept artwork that I will now be only posted to to my Patrons, and as a supporter, you choose how involved you want to be.  \u003cbr\u003eAdditional things like voting and participating in fan art requests, \u003cbr\u003eSpecial Patron-only discounts,\u003cbr\u003eGetting one on one art tutoring or critique, \u003cbr\u003eOr having your monthly pledge go towards buying or commissioning art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always down for an epic adventure, and the journey there is just so much better when I\u0027m not on it alone. My main goal is to be able to make art full time, and I can\u0027t do that without your help. By choosing to support my Patreon, you not only get to see and be included all the steps along the way, you are allowing me to create more art, and create more ways to interact with all my fans and supporters and patrons (like you!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
