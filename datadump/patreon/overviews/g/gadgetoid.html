    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Phil. Creator and maintainer of Pinout.xyz! I really need your help to further develop Pinout, add new features, catalogue more boards, and build an API so that all of the data it\u0027s collected can be shared to tools, apps and websites across the Pi community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, and for coming this far! If you need help with your Pi project, or just want to chat technology,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/8wRN4WB\"\u003ejoin us over in our Discord server\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started Pinout as part of my Raspberry Pi blog back in 2013. The idea? To provide a simple\u00a0 visual and interactive representation of the Raspberry Pi\u0027s GPIO, complete with details about what each pin does, and how they can be used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToward the end of 2015 Pinout had grown immensely, transforming to accommodate the new form-factor Raspberry Pi boards, and had begun to list individual add-on boards giving an at-a-glance reference for the pins they used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI moved Pinout from my blog across to its own domain; Pinout.xyz in November 2015, and every year since traffic has doubled. Now it\u0027s not unusual to see 2000 (or 4000 according to Cloudflare) visitors every single day! It\u0027s only by the good graces of Cloudflare\u0027s free caching proxy and CDN that it can handle this traffic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m proud of Pinout\u0027s growth, and grateful to all the people who have made contributions, submitted their boards, discussed the roadmap, and come up with new ideas for how to make the site better, but in order to grow it further I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture plans for Pinout.xyz include;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ean API, providing access to full add-on board information for any website or tool to consume\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eembeddable images and board stats widgets for shop owners to use in their product listings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea more complete compatibility tool, letting you see which add-on boards will work together\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ean overhaul of the tooling and static site generator to make it more automated\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebetter tools and guides to help designers submit their boards\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etesting and documenting more boards from more manufacturers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebigger, better photos of every add-on listed\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emore charts, graphs and information derived from the pin data to help board designers make the right choice of pin\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might imagine- all of this takes time and infrastructure. Your contribution will help make these plans possible, and drive Pinout.xyz forward into another year of being the go-to resource for Raspberry Pi add-on information and more! You\u0027ll also keep Pinout.xyz ad-free\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
