Our goal in creating this podcast is to create a simple, entertaining show for women to listen to about the everyday things we encounter with a very important mission, to pull our thoughts toward God and what those things can teach us about God. We want to consistently ground our hearts, thoughts, and minds in Him and support each other while we do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other side that we didn\u0027t necessarily think of but seem to have accomplished is to make it seem like a family, like you are not just a part of a community but a family. You\u0027ll hear our squabbles and inside jokes. You\u0027ll be pulled inside our silliness and also our vulnerability as we open up to each other as only family can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a ministry for us and we are willing to invest in it ourselves. We also see room to grow beyond what we are able to personally finance.\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
