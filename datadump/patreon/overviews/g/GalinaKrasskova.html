    "summary": "Many\nof you know me by my work. I am the author of numerous books on the Northern\nTradition, Devotional Work, Polytheism, and the Runes. I also maintain a\nregular blog at \u003ca href=\"http://krasskova.wordpress.com./\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://krasskova.wordpress.com.\u003c/a\u003e While Heathen,\nI work across traditions because the restoration of polytheisms is a matter of\n\u003cem\u003ecollective\u003c/em\u003e restoration, not just one tradition at one time. This is my passion;\nit\u2019s my purpose; it\u2019s my sacred work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\nwork has taken me in many different directions: I began as a priest, became a\nshaman, a vitki, a diviner (Gods, I never, ever thought I\u2019d be graced with the\nskill to divine. it was one of the most unexpected of gifts from the Gods,\nsecond only to, two years ago, suddenly being given the gift of painting!),\nwriter, artist, activist, academic, and, yes, I will admit, trouble-maker.\nSometimes for the savor, you need to stir the pot. Like me or hate me, you know\nthat with me there is no BS. I will not be moved from my stance on an issue:\nnot by intimidation, threats, pleas. I will not say what i think people want to\nhear. To the best of my ability, I am committed to speaking truth about my\nexperiences with the Gods, the development of our theologies, the necessity of\nall aspects of the Work, and the fractures and issues facing polytheisms today.\nI may not be delicate about it \u2014 that is not part of my job or sadly, my\nnature, even when I might like it to be \u2014 but I do the best I can with what I\nhave been given, and with what I have been permitted to develop. And I do my\nbest to aid those who come to me as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat\nyou may not know is that I suffer from severe chronic pain due to my first\ncareer as a ballet dancer. Migraines, severe, debilitating back pain, ongoing\nmobility issues,including on some days difficulty walking, constant exhaustion,\nand a lovely diagnosis (yes i am being sarcastic) of fibro-myalgia. It\u2019s not an\neasy thing asking for support or even help. I am proud and moreover I belong to\nOdin and He\u2019s trained me to be pretty self-reliant and strong willed over the\nyears. It is, however, a very difficult thing to do this Work without community\nsupport. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAn\nawful lot of people have asked me, sometimes over and over, what they can do to\nhelp. Well, this is something really concrete you can do. Even $1 a month would\nhelp \u2014 I mean, think about it: if everyone who finds my work useful pledged $1\na month, I\u2019ll bet my main goal would be met right there and then some!\nCommunity is a powerful thing. In traditional societies, it wasn\u2019t just the\nshaman or the priest doing the work: it was a community effort. Sometimes that\nmeant leading rituals, sometimes it meant cooking a meal to feed the shaman.\nThe idea of nourishing the community\u2019s relationship with the Gods was something\neveryone had a part in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur\ncommunity isn\u2019t there yet, but it could be. We can support our religious\nprofessionals. I do. At least I try to do so wherever I am able and now I am\nasking the same. I\u2019m going to keep plugging away at my Work no matter what, but\nit would be nice to do so knowing I had the support of an amazing community at\nmy back, and it would be nice to do so without the stress and exhaustion that\nkeep me from serving that community to my fullest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwant to be able to do more for my Gods and more for our communities. I want you\nto be able to do more for Them too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTake\na look at some of my current and most recent projects: \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eOrganized the Polytheist Day of Protest and Remembrance, July\n31, 2015.

     "description": "Meeting this goal would guarantee that I can keep creating at least one prayer card per month. Generally, given that costs have risen over the past year, it takes $450 to  create one prayer card. While I often receive some donations and sponsorship toward specific cards, it\u2019s rarely enough to cover the whole thing and for each card, I easily spend $200 or more out of pocket. This is an important project. We are giving space back to our Gods. Each image is a small, portable shrine. We are giving our Gods more windows in the world through which They can act. It\u2019s part of re-sacralizing the world, or rather opening our eyes to the sacred that never left. The more I am able to raise here, the more I can contribute to that process. \u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "Five hundred dollars is about what I make in one week of teaching. If I am able to meet this goal, it will enable me to set aside a huge swath of time that otherwise would be spent scrambling to meet my regular, most basic needs. With this taken care of, I\u2019ll be able to finish the four or five outstanding book projects I have going (including my book on making pilgrimages, and the Hermes devotional) and I may even be able to take requests for small chapbooks and specific how-to articles. I\u2019d like to be able to write more frequently for polytheist.com for instance, but i am often simply exhausted. Meeting this goal would give me the ability to re-prioritize some of my non-teaching time in ways that feed right back into the community.  \u003cbr\u003e",
