That\u0027s why I\u0027m starting now a Patreon, because I love drawing, but was too busy to invest myself in it in the past months.\u003cbr\u003eAny money earned through such support is money I don\u0027t have to take \ntime to earn through my job, allowing me more time to draw fun stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know much what to expect, but whoever gives a little bit, even if it\u0027s not for long, have my thanks for her generosity. Every single contribution helps and I want to reward generous patrons with accepted requests \u0026amp; ideas (see conditions in the reward section).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to be doing around 2-3 pics per month at least, and I hope I can do more! I\u0027ll also dump some Work-in-Progress and sketches here. As my patrons, you\u0027ll be able to vote on what to do next, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell... thanks for reading, and I hope it will bring out your goodwill as I have never been good to express myself.\u003cbr\u003e"
