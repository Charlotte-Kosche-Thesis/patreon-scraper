    "summary": "LL Cool J called GirlieGirlArmy.com\u0027s founder Chlo\u00e9 Jo Davis the \"OG of eco-blogging,\" and from a man that smells that fine, we will take being called old. When most conscious lifestyle experts were just a dream in their mama\u0027s ovaries, we were here - speaking out and letting it be known that animals aren\u0027t ours to use and abuse, and that kindness is fucking righteous. In a time where every youngun with a room that has good lighting is waxing poetic about eco-style, ad sales are being dramatically diluted and we need your support. After 20 years of publishing conscious content, we want to not only keep going - but start growing again! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve always refused advertisers who find to be creating unethical or toxic product for earth or animal, which has drastically limited our ability to make a huge ad revenue off GirlieGirl Army. For some time, ads were selling well enough to keep GGA self-sustaining (meaning, paying for costs,) but it\u0027s been a while since that was the case. We\u0027ve basically been paying to keep GGA alive for a few years now. With decades of loyal community, we realized it was time to ask you to be more involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond our founder Chlo\u00e9 Jo Davis speaking events and presenting sustainable options in media, we will be going back to creating live video content, a podcast, and more events. Donors will have EXCLUSIVE input, access to our authors, and will receive space to promote what they care about to our audience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGirlieGirl Army is your Glamazon Guide to Conscious Living; a one-stop online resource for a ferociously progressive, urban-minded approach to cruelty-free living. We carry picket signs and upcycled Stella McCartney clutches. Our message is simple: You can live large and still make a positive impact. You can be eco-conscious and elegant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur website, newsletter, and social channels are packed with the what\u0027s-what and the how-to and low-down on what some might glibly call \"green living,\" but our bulletin ain\u0027t (always) soaked in patchouli, and it\u0027s definitely not asking you to become some sort of hygiene-shunning hippy (unless you like that sort of thing.) We\u0027re here for the sake of providing the before-it\u0027s-current pulse of conscientious living, fresh and fierce to your Inbox weekly. It\u0027s by and for people who fancy fashion without the fiendishness of animal testing or skins, and who want to indulge and promote the best life possible, for both themselves, their kids, their pets, their stomachs, and their inner-circle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been featured everywhere from The New York Times to Jimmy Kimmel and celebs from Alicia Silverstone to Emily Deschanel have claimed us as a favorite website.
