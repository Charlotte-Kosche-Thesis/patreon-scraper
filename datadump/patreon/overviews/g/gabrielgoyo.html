    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eDear Patron,\u003cbr\u003eThere are people in this world who know no misery and woe and there are people who take comfort in researching and writing down any important story. This story is about me, Gabriel. I am the sort of people who know that there\u0027s always something: something to research, something to read, something to write and something to do to make a sanctuary, no matter how small. And for this reason, I\u0027m happy to say, I am very fortunate indeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gabrielgoyo.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy personal website\u003c/a\u003e and teaching in Venezuela since 2009. In that time, I have been fortunate to be able to share my experiences with hundreds of people in my country and abroad. Eight years later, I want to keep doing this in a safe environment, but I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on expanding my website and writing career, which I want to make available to people in my country and around the world. Whereas in the past I have been able to finance it myself, the dire situation in my country precludes me from being able to do this. I have focused all of my efforts and savings towards moving out of the country and continue my work, but I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking my family members, my friends, my rebel nerds, my \"panas\", and the family members, friends my \"panas\" to support my effort to keep making what I make in a place where there is a chance and hope for a future for me and my family. Please consider donating to help me reach our goals and share my page with others who might be willing to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you feel\u00a0that a having a talented writer and compassionate teacher in a place where he can quietly sit and work on his art is preferable to having him in a country filled with violence, famine and other frustrating and numberless humiliations, then every time you pledge you might say to yourself: \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027the world is quiet here\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e as a sort of proclaim for kindness and the fortune in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eG\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp spread the word!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
