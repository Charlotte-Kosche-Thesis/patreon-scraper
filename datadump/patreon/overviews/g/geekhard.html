To provide the most entertaining show possible. Since then we\u0027ve produced over 380 weekly episodes \u00a0on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://realityradio101.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erealityradio101.com\u003c/a\u003e, covering our usual genre topics of movies, TV, comics, music and geek culture. Each week, we look at the news, do a review (movies, TV, comics, music and even live theatre) and interview someone we think has an interesting project coming out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the show start we have interview some amazing people, such as...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActors:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Jeffrey Combs, Brian Posehn, Kristian Bruun\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComic Creators:\u003c/strong\u003e Chris Claremont, Greg Rucka, Marjorie Liu\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAuthors:\u003c/strong\u003e Max Allan Collins, Greg Rucka, Sam Maggs,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusicians: \u003c/strong\u003eThe Doubleclicks, Kyle Stevens, Wordburglar\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had a great time doing this show over the years. Since the beginning we have been personally handling all most all of the costs. Sure we have had limited advertising but it\u0027s not enough to sustain the show. As each year passes the costs never go down. So making improvements to the show/site is difficult.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why we are here: We\u0027re looking for some help with these costs. We absolutely love doing this show every week and we want to continue to do it and make it better for you, our fans. In an effort to be honest and up front with you, we do currently have 1 sponsor who pays for advertising with us. Our sponsor is great but they only cover a small portion of our overall expenses to produce Geek Hard each week. With your help we are hoping to cover our studio space rental, our website hosting/fees/maintenance, equipment rentals and other miscellaneous fees \u0026amp; materials that we use to make the show. With your help, we would like to provide more content. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYES, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003emore podcasts, new writers for our site and, of course, way more videos. All of this is awesome but very expensive to produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you in advance for helping out. Whether you end up becoming our patron or you just let your friends know about the show - we still thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember if you\u0027re gonna geek out, \u003cstrong\u003eGEEK HARD!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
