Yes a little scary but as they say, If you don\u0027t take the leap, you will never find out if you can fly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last few years I have uploaded quite a few models to my \u003ca href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/Geoffro/designs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThingiverse\u003c/a\u003e page and other model sharing sites and\u00a0have enjoyed giving away models, and will continue to do so but it does not pay the bills sadly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATED CONDITIONS APRIL 2ND 2018\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e#1 Rule, do not share or redistribute these files.

I don\u0027t expect people to advertise for me, your business is your business and I wish you all the best success. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page here exists because I am trying to provide a wide range of props and cosplay items and models that can help not only your humble hobby maker, but also support alot of cosplay business that often rely on buying very expensive files and often of poor quality and at the same time keep the models secure for good people like yourself by having them exclusive to Patreon members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of models that I have never uploaded \nanywhere, premium figure busts, cosplay pieces etc and am open to pretty\n much any request.
