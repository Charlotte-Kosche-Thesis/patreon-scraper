You are an endless source of encouragment and you mean the world to me. Thanks for being awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u00a0want to invite everone to come on an interesting journey with me. Get an inside look into my studio and watch me create my body of work... and be a part of it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I create? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost often I draw faces. I love exploring the face as I draw each section, then watching as it comes to life and tells it\u0027s own unique story. I also enjoy creating landscapes, still life and word art among other things. I\u0027m always thinking up a new project that I want to try.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy connecting directly with fans of my artwork and Patreon is a perfect place to do that. Here, I can share exclusive photos, videos and other secret content with my fans. I can get to know them and let them into my world as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is\u00a0a crowd-funding site like kickstarter. But instead of contributing lots of money for a large project, it\u2019s about pledging small amounts to support your favorite artists who create more regularly and on a smaller scale. You can pledge as little or as much as you want stating at $1 per month. You can cancel any time so there\u0027s no pressure at all! Plus you have to check out the REWARDS you get in return!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI would deeply appreciate your support! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my artwork and you want to help me make more of it, please consider becoming a $1 patron (more if you really want to!). You\u0027ll be directly responsible for each piece of artwork I create. I\u0027m excited to show you what I\u0027m currently working on! Become my newest patron and join the fun!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
