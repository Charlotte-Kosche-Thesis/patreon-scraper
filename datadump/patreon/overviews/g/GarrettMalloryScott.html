    "summary": "I never have any idea what to put here.\u003cbr\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you a writer?\"\u003cbr\u003eYes but writing fiction is so much easier, nothing has to make sense.\u003cbr\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t it though?\"\u003cbr\u003eWell yes, there are rules and regulations, make an interesting beginning, avoid exposition- Oh, we\u0027re not off to a good start are we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Garrett, I\u0027m a Canadian writer and actor making it big in Toronto. At least that was the plan.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently on welfare, in the army and scrambling for time to make amazing works, as well as rent, I\u0027m trying out patreon as a way to provide more access to my stories and potentially supplement my income until I can get on my feet making a living as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three major goals:\u003cbr\u003e1. Earn a living from making my art, which I\u0027ll describe further below.\u003cbr\u003e2. Expand my audience from the current 150 or so \"friends and family who promise to read it, any day now\".\u003cbr\u003e3. Experiment with different mediums and methods to find the most effective way to present my stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, I want to create works that both entertain and stimulate thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also worked as director, producer and casting director, dabbled in photography, sketching, comics, and every kind of medium. Even tried modelling (pay\u0027s great but it takes a toll on the body, dunno how those statues do it). I\u0027d like to further experiment as a photographer, videographer and perhaps sketcher but for now my main focuses are novels and shorter prose works, screenplays, stage plays and the odd shoot-off idea including poetry, choose-your-own-adventure and random rants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written award-winning plays, published short stories and a poem, produced films shown across Canada and acted in such works as Norte, Hell on Wheels, Passchendaele, The Right Kind of Wrong, Eleftheromania, Snake Alley and The Hitchhiker. I highly recommend watching all of them, as they are as diverse as I am! I will post what I can of work I\u0027m in and especially I\u0027ve personally made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a very unique fellow, quite liberal, socialist, Daoist and a touch Bohemian. But don\u0027t let that scare you, I just enjoy writing captivating stories about fantastical things, though I work in all genres my main ones are usually fantasy, dark drama and comedy, usually with a touch of historical and war influence (my first love was military history). I\u0027m happy to talk but will avoid any non-constructive comments. You have an opinion, that\u0027s nice, but if I can\u0027t understand or apply it to my own choices I\u0027ll have to let it remain an opinion only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please feel free to peruse what I post and send requests. I love taking outside ideas into my work, it\u0027s the best thing against writer\u0027s block, and I always credit where credit\u0027s due.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the purpose of this account isn\u0027t to look for collaborators I\u0027m more than up for helping with others\u0027 work. I\u0027ve done lots of writing for others including some big-name companies and have experience in every field related to the film and theatre industries, as I believe to be good in one area you should have a good understanding of the surrounding areas. I\u0027m particularly interested in camera work but have to wait for funding to get anything to work with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhew, does all that text prove I\u0027m a writer?\u003cbr\u003e"

With this I will definitely be buying better equipment and experimenting with it through different projects, and with experimentation comes more input from YOU! I\u0027ll be able to hire people to flesh out my works with art, acting, production, etc. This will move me from writer to producer of sorts, able to make things I haven\u0027t much chance of doing for the next little while. And of course with this goal reached I\u0027ll have a whole new set of goals to create! Oh boy hope this doesn\u0027t go too fast, I\u0027ll need time to think... What am I saying?!",
