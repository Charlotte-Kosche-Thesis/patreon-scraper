    "summary": "Thanks for slipping by! My name is Grana Banana the most APEELING YOUTUBER and with me is my equally as APEELING sidekick Banana my plantain puppet who co-hosts with me on this channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to my channel then firstly, welcome! I talk about video games and I review them. I may do opinion pieces down the line but for now I am focusing purely on funny but informative game reviews. My main objective is to inform you all of what games you should buy and play and which games you should avoid.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eMy goal\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy number one goal though is to always keep things entertaining and funny and the kind of content that will cheer you up when you had a bad day and not be the kind of content that makes you switch tabs if your mother/father/loved one etc etc etc walk into the room. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor me, playing video games is about having fun and I want that to be reflected in my channel whilst at the same time do my job as a reviewer and give my viewers an honest opinion of the game I am reviewing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I first started my channel over 2 years ago, I started as a cam-less tiny Let\u0027s play channel doing episodic content and I felt like I was getting nowhere with my channel. Before the creation of Grana Banana, I used to write reviews for two relatively small fan-made Nintendo websites and I really enjoyed writing them, and that\u0027s when I thought... \"hang on I can create funny video game reviews to show people gameplay and talk about them!\" I created a few reviews and gained some subscribers but I still felt that the growth of my channel was pretty slow. How can I stand out from other more established review channels that dominate the YouTube space?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided to rebrand my channel by creating a persona that people hopefully will remember and make me stand out from other YouTube channels. A banana mask and a handmade banana puppet. A lot of Youtubers are inspired by other content creators but I was inspired mostly by puppet shows that I grew up with like The Muppets, Bodger and Badger, Sooty etc on TV. I absolutely loved the interaction between the main character and these puppets and I thought I would start up my own show.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA year after rebranding and now I run a game review channel with over 1000 banana peel subs (A term I lovingly call my subscribers) lots of interaction and most importantly a lot of happy people who love my content. Most importantly, I absolutely love what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eHang on... all your content is free?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDid your parents ever tell you nothing in life is free? Well they are WRONG! Those of you know me personally will know I absolutely hate gated content through season passes/DLC, Amiibo etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving tiers on Patreon would make me look like a total hypocrite therefore I will not gate off content, hold it to ransom of 500,000 banana peels, or send my banana puppet after you and smash your head in for your wallet.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo access my APEELING content, you need only access it. You are free to pay as much or as little as you want. If you think my content is crap then feel free to pay nothing. And if you ever do become a patron, but decide to stop, no hard feelings. Remember,\u00a0 it\u0027s YOUR money, you are NOT obliged to give me any of it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever if you do donate, thank you from the bottom of my banana peel!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eWhy should I support this pair of Bananas on Patreon? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSince launching my channel I\u0027ve made friends with some of the most amazing content creators/gamers all over the world thanks to the internet.  I adore every single aspect of making review videos, and I can\u0027t imagine something else I\u0027d rather be doing.  The problem is that it\u0027s difficult balancing the channel with my own personal responsibilities, and it\u0027s growing progressively harder to support oneself with ad revenue alone.  I won\u0027t bore you with the details, but basically there\u0027s less and less money to go around for Youtubers like me.  So what does support through Patreon actually mean?\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI can create the content I want without worrying about YouTube\u0027s horrible laws of algorithms, advertisers etc. Hell, having a Patreon means no ads on my YouTube videos!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOne day I would love to do YouTube full time. If that opportunity ever arises\u00a0I\u0027ll finally have the time to make Grana Banana into what I want it to be.  More APEELING content, more comedy, more games, more everything. Just for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money received will be used to buy games, upgrade any software/hardware and generally help me improve my content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003ePEELING the love!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\tI just want to thank all 1200+ of you who decided to click that subscribe button, jingled my ringle dingle bell, watch my videos and leave me comments in the comment section. Support from amazing people like you is what keeps me going with the Grana Banana channel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo if you find it in yourself to pledge even as little as one dollar a month, you\u0027ve got my eternal gratitude.  I seriously can\u0027t thank you enough, or properly communicate how much it means to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith all this Patreon chat out of the way, it\u0027s time to SPLIT and make more videos just for YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
