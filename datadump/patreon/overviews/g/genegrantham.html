    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOME INTRODUCTIONS ARE PROBABLY IN ORDER. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Gene Grantham, and I\nwant to tell you a story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFair warning, it probably won\u2019t be\na happy one. It\u2019ll definitely be a weird one, that much I can guarantee. Who knows what unsettling things you might encounter?\nAll sorts of odd fellows show up in my tales. The still-ticking machinations of a long-dead conspiracy, breeding mystical\nhorrors. Ill-tempered ghosts that haunt the rocky beaches of the Maine\ncoast. A mechanical demiurge plotting to spread itself like glistening grease\nacross the cosmos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOr maybe a love story set at the\nend of the world is more your speed? Or a daughter willing to do anything\nto save her mother, even undo time itself. How about the ineffable mystery of the illusive Majorane Jane? Heck, I\u2019ve even got the story of 1930\u2019s\nmob enforcer Boss Burns and how he finally found redemption through the Gospel of the Snakehunter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, I recently made the move from \"incredibly tiny indy writer\" to \"slightly less tiny, but still incredibly small writer\". \u003ca href=\"http://amazon.com/author/genegrantham\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTake a look at my Amazon offerings! \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe point\u00a0is, I tell\nall sorts of stories. It\u2019s what I do, it\u2019s what I love, and it\u2019s what keeps me\nalive. It\u2019s been my way of surviving a lot of hard times, to take the pains and\nanxieties I\u2019ve experienced and grow them into something both terrible and\nutterly familiar. It\u2019s as much a part of me as the beating of my heart, the breath\nof my lungs, or my hideously malformed insides. Maybe not the insides part,\nsince I aim for a slightly-higher level of quality control than the Good Lord\nfelt fit to give me. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been described as a\ncombination of the late-great Douglas Adams and the still-great-and-perfectly-on-time\nStephen King. It\u2019s a flattering compliment, and one that I\u2019ve been shamelessly\ndragging out whenever the chance arises. While I certainly don\u2019t want to\nelevate myself to the level of those Titans, its a pretty apt comparison genre-wise: I\nlike my horror esoteric, my comedy smart, and my humor dark. Mix them together and what\ndo you get? Probably murdered at the hands of an evil librarian. If Stephen\nKing hasn\u2019t written that one yet I\u2019m totally gonna do it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWho are we kidding, he\u2019s totally\ndone that one already.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u0027RE MY ONLY HOPE! (No pressure.) \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis might come as a bit of a\nsurprise, but writing is NOT a steady income. I know, I know; I too was fooled\nby all those sexy reality shows depicting writers as hot-rodding globe-trotters\nwith cash to burn. I barely have change to burn, and do you know how hard it is\nto set pennies on fire? It\u2019s basically impossible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot to mention there\u2019s the slight\nissue of me being\u2026 how to put this politely? Differently-abled. And not to get\ntoo political, but that\u2019s not exactly a good thing to be right now. (As opposed\nto all those other eras of humanity that were oh-so-caring, but I digress.) I\nrequire a good deal of medical upkeep, and that\u2019s expensive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI don\u2019t want the world. I\u2019m not a\nman of deep desires. I just want to make sure I\u2019ve got a roof above my head,\nsafety for my loved ones, and blood in my veins. In that order too. (Don\u2019t tell\nmy loved ones, I don\u2019t want them to know I\u2019m getting soft on them.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn order to write to my fullest I need\nto be secure. I need my \u003cem\u003efamily\u003c/em\u003e to be\nsecure. I\u0027ll never stop writing, no matter how tough it may get, but this is a real chance to boost my profile and make a professional go of it. Maybe I\u0027ll even find some security doing something I love. Ha! Wouldn\u0027t that be something! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S IN IT FOR YOU, MY NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL PATRON. \u003cbr\u003e(Did I mention you have impeccable taste?)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou\u2019ll benefit immediately by having\na well-balanced author, no longer trapped by the confines of endless worry, free\nto fully and truly dedicate himself to the dark arts of weird writing. I\u2019ll be\nable to fully to flesh out the worlds I\u2019ve created for starters. Connect with\nmy fans better. Attend conventions even! Hell, I\u2019d be able to afford taking more\nresearch trips. The majority of my work relies heavily on the true history of\nthe American occult, and that\u2019s something best experienced up close.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\nexample, the Majorane Jane series is set entirely in Maine. I\u2019d love to make a\nday-trip up to Presque Isle, since that\u2019s the setting for a future book and one\nof the few Maine locales I haven\u2019t personally visited. Right now that\u2019s an\nimpossibility for reasons that are both medical and financial\u2026 which is really\njust a complicated way of saying they\u2019re all financial. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOf course there are other, more\nimmediate benefits. For starters I\u2019ll be sharing my thoughts and experiences \u003cem\u003evis-\u00e0-vis \u003c/em\u003ebeing a writer, a disabled man,\nand a weirdo in general. There\u2019ll also be early access to new chapters,\npreviews, short stories, and probably a couple of pictures of my dog Trip. I\u2019ve\ngot a whole slew of unused covers and alternate drafts just waiting to be\nshared! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND WHILE I\u0027VE GOT YOU HERE...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you. I don\u2019t get the chance\nto address my readers very often, and while I have you: thank you, thank, thank\nyou, THANK YOU. It goes without saying, a storyteller is no good if he got no\none to tell the story to. Without you there is no me. And I truly appreciate\nyou taking the time to read all these crazy weird things I write. It fills my\nheart with so much warmth to know that people actually like this stuff. (My\nwork has often been lauded as \u201creadable\u201d and \u201cfull of words\u201d by many critics!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s funny\u2026 you\u2019d think by their\nvery nature the writer would have a direct pipeline to his audience. Thing is,\nwhen I\u2019m spinning a yarn I\u2019m not Gene Grantham, I\u2019m the Storyteller. And I don\u2019t\ntell stories about a backwoods writer being all sappy about how much his\naudience means to him. I tell stories about trepanation and trepidation, though\nnot necessarily in that order. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo one more time\u2026 thank you for\neverything, dear reader. You\u2019ve granted my heart\u2019s most cherished dreams\nalready simply by listening to my ramblings. Anything more you can do to help is the cherry on top! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
