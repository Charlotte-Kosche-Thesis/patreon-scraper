    "summary": "Thanks to all of you who have joined us on Patreon, The Rubin Report\u2019s move to independence has been a huge success. Now, one year after our initial Patreon launch we\u2019ve taken the final step to fully controlling our destiny. We\u2019ve built a fantastic home studio that will take this show about critical thinking, open debate, and free speech to a whole new level. To the over 4,000 of you who have joined us so far I thank you once again, and to the rest of you this is my pitch to get you on board with us! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith our professional-grade home studio we are creating more content, expanding the show, and doing more live streaming. Basically we can do what we want, when we want, and it\u0027s all because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we hit our goal of $40,000 we\u2019ll expand our team with a full-time editor and publisher, expanding our content yet again! Not only will we do more interviews, but we plan to start hosting our own debates and panels, taking the show on the road, be able to fly in bigger guests, launch new segments and collaborations with some of your favorite YouTubers, and continue to be totally free to make any and all executive decisions on our own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ijb3Kby.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t do this without you... literally. We now know that the best way to share these ideas is to be beholden to nobody but our fans. You guys have helped us grow and share our message across the world. Now we\u2019re giving you the chance to actually help produce this show which is helping shape minds and find answers instead of picking fights. I\u2019m honored that so many of you have been part of this so far and you\u2019ve allowed me and my incredible team to create something that we all can be proud of. And this is just the beginning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron means making a monthly contribution towards the show. Think of it like your Netflix subscription, only the content is free and you get rewarded for your level of contribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe messages you all send me from across the globe are beyond inspiring and absolute proof that ideas are the most powerful force out there. So if you hear what I\u0027m saying, if you care about not only continuing the work we\u0027ve been doing but making this bigger with no outside restrictions whatsoever, then sign up on Patreon right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vDlWvvL.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe took out a major loan for our new home studio in LA and we already know that it will be worth it in the long term. We will have the opportunity to immediately create more content including interviews, debates, new segments and collaborations, and more live streaming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron of The Rubin Report you\u0027re allowing us to answer to no one but ourselves and to only take deals and partnerships that fit what with we want to do. (Thanks to our current Patrons, we\u0027ve already been able to say \"no\" several offers that weren\u0027t right for us.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know some of you will be able to give a lot, some of you just a little, and some of you right in between. For real, every dollar counts for us to not just grow, but to keep The Rubin Report on the air. We\u0027ve come so far and helped change the debate, but we\u0027re really only getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is just the beginning once again, and we can\u0027t wait for what comes next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Dave\u003cbr\u003e"
