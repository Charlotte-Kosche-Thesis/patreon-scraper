    "summary": "We\u0027ve been very fortunate to be able to create snarky, weird videos that people actually watch, but we\u0027re never satisfied to settle where we\u0027re at. We always want to continue to grow and expand, whether it be upgrading equipment, hiring actors, renting filming locations, etc. We\u0027re a very small group and we tend to overextend ourselves both physically and monetarily, doing everything from running a studio to editing to building all our own props and sets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to our crazy projects than simply watching our videos. We appreciate that by itself. But if you feel like contributing more, it\u0027ll all go back into creating more stuff. From time to time, the site may go a few weeks without any new videos being posted, but rest assured that just because we\u0027re not posting something doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re not working hard on stuff behind the scenes, usually multiple projects at once because we\u0027re kind of crazy. We tend to spend longer editing our videos than it seems many other online video creators do because it\u0027s our favorite aspect and we like to get creative with it whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve kept our Patreon pledge tiers very low because honestly there\u0027s better things you should be spending large amounts of money on. We may change up some tiers and add some higher rewards in the future, but for right now just think of this as donations that give you a little something back as a thank you for continuing to watch and support what we do.\u003cbr\u003e"
