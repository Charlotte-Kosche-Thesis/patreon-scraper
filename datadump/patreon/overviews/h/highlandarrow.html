\u00a0Through the wonderful means of things like Patreon, we can have our readers support us directly, rather than have to start leaning much heavier on things like advertising. \u00a0Instead of having to rely on those ads, we can be supported directly by our readership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s just the thing, isn\u0027t it? \u00a0Traditionally, comparable press outlet sites like the Escapist, IGN, Gamespot, and the like, are supported by a combination of advertisements, sponsored content, advetorials, and the like. \u00a0As people who write reviews, we really don\u0027t like the idea of having one hand in the pockets of the publishers\u0027 marketing budgets while at the same time trying to maintain integrity while we report to you on what games we think are and aren\u0027t worth playing. \u00a0You can do it, but it\u0027s a difficult tightrope to walk, and we\u0027d rather not have to do so at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are Highland Arrow?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/en/about-menu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHighland Arrow is a four-person team of gamers\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0- three writers, and a PR guy - who are passionate about games. \u00a0With all the furor over the integrity of video games journalism, of reviewers being on the take, and the like, we felt we would address the problem of such by creating, by filling that lack of responsible journalism by doing our best to cover games responsibly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can take a poke around our website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.highlandarrow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.highlandarrow.com\u003c/a\u003e and here\u0027s a few samples of recent reviews as of the time of writing this summary:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/en/reviews/pc-reviews/270-review-afterlife-empire.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAfterlife Empire\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/en/reviews/pc-reviews/266-xenobloom.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eXenobloom\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/images/features/theconsumingshadow-feature.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Consuming Shadow\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/images/features/d4-ep1-feature.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eD4: Dark Dreams Don\u0027t Die (Episode 1)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/en/reviews/pc-reviews/243-her-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHer Story\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/en/reviews/pc-reviews/242-wwe-2k15.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWWE 2K15\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/en/reviews/pc-reviews/219-chromasquad.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChroma Squad\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.highlandarrow.com/en/reviews/pc-reviews/234-gta5-online.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGrand Theft Auto V Online\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a site that allows patrons of creative projects to directly support the works they want to see made. \u00a0You can commit to giving us a current amount by month or by creative work \u00a0- for us, by month!
