    "summary": "HEY GUYS\u003cbr\u003eBefore I get in to who I am and get all introspective I wanted to say that you absolutely don\u0027t have to support me on Patreon. I in no way, shape or form will stop releasing content for all my other social media sites this is just for people who want to throw money at me because they think I\u0027m cool.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16903501_1251618851591094_6865711020423593700_o.jpg?oh=3ac9a33d086becd62d57587d6b1f9754\u0026amp;oe=5A503A2A\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here you probably are at least vaguely familiar with who I am but if not or if you\u0027re just reading this for fun I should probably tell you about who I am and what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Haiden Hazard (Pronounced the exact same as Hayden I just have to be original and my parents can\u0027t spell). I\u0027m sort of a human who was created and continues to exist mostly in Alabama. I dress up as fictional characters sometimes and other times I dress up as a tall blonde 18 year old human who wears all black, thinks they\u0027re funnier than they are, writes in third person a lot, likes animals, can\u0027t eat gluten or dairy and wants to sleep. I was homeschooled growing up so I didn\u0027t really know anyone or do anything but when I was 12/13 I had one friend who I dragged to a tiny convention (around 150 people attended) really close to where we lived (and still live). I cosplayed awfully in a crushed velvet outfit and a cheapo eBay wig but I had so much fun and met so many cool people that I\u0027m still close with and I immediately fell in love with cosplay and the environment that cons have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing video games since I could hold things in my\u00a0hands and I like to play them nonstop until I almost die which is why I always look like I\u0027m currently in the middle of decomposing and its also why 99% of my cosplays are based off of video game characters. My whole family is addicted to WOW and have been playing it since Burning Crusade came out and we play it together to bond and I only play DPS because if people try to get close to me I cry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been cosplaying actively since 2012 but I\u0027ve only been making my own costumes since 2015 and I\u0027ve only been making (good) armor since 2016. I taught myself everything I know about sewing and crafting things. I started sewing as a child because I\u0027m 6\u00271 barefoot and 10 pounds soaking wet and nothing fits me because I\u0027m a giant green bean so I altered a lot of things or made things for myself. When I first started cosplaying I ordered all of my cosplays online but because I was stretched out on a taffy machine like the girl in Willy Wonka nothing fit me so I didn\u0027t want to wear them because I looked silly. Because of that I wanted to start making my own cosplays and because I already knew how to sew it was easy for me to start making my own things. Eventually I wanted to start making props and armor so I saved up my money and bought worbla and starting making things with that and never stopped.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI attend about 30-45 conventions a year depending on my schedule and what cons overlap each other each year but most of them are in the southeast where I\u0027m located. The conventions I attend are usually between Texas, Miami and Maryland but every now and then I travel outside of that little circle and go places like California or New York and hopefully soon I\u0027ll be able to travel out of the country for conventions. I also frequently guest at conventions where I sell my merchandise and get to meet YOU GUYS! Conventions have made me in to the person I am today and I don\u0027t know where I would be or what I would be doing if I hadn\u0027t discovered them. Maybe I would have pursued modeling more aggressively and I would be rich and famous and friends with the Kardashians but here we are anyway. Now I just make\u00a0costumes and post pictures on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16819271_1251618854924427_2133833358688567581_o.jpg?oh=751d49c55c607a132b5be1456c2ad126\u0026amp;oe=5A45AB16\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally wasn\u0027t going to make a patreon because I felt like it was not for me. \u00a0I didn\u0027t really get what it was and I considered it just asking for money (which I don\u0027t like to do at all).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter it was explained to me that it\u0027s kind of like how people would have fan clubs back in the day where they would send a fee in and get items from the person in return it made more sense to me and felt more like money being exchanged for goods and services.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of people have been asking me recently to make a patreon or asking if I had one. I was hesitant to make one because of my pride issues associated with money but after a lot of coaxing from my friends and family I decided I would just make one and put it out in the universe and see what happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16836423_1251618884924424_8356594242151883463_o.jpg?oh=26e69c64558ea6bd74adef56874d20c9\u0026amp;oe=5A816466\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned earlier I was homeschooled growing up so it was easier for me to go to conventions and travel and work on cosplay a lot because I had so much free time. I graduated from high school when I was 15 and since then I\u0027ve been doing cosplay as a full time thing and making costumes and going to conventions nonstop. I would love to continue doing what I do as often and as long as I can and thats where you guys come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI consider cosplay to be my job. I treat it that way by constantly working on new projects and improving on my skills (by failing a lot and learning from trial and error) and I thought Patreon would be the best way to share the amount of time and effort I have to put in to each and every project I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16804019_1251619234924389_1916023296385998416_o.jpg?oh=0a81a53b284bf2f9680bf7ff91b80571\u0026amp;oe=5A46C16C\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to throw money at me on this website not only will I be mildly grateful to you but you\u0027ll also receive stuff and things from me in the mail sometimes.\u003cbr\u003eAs my patrons, you guys would be the first to get access to my new content as well as seeing content that I normally don\u0027t post such as all the behind the scenes photos, progress photos, cosplay plans, full videos of me working on my cosplays and making things (props, wigs, armor, etc.) and stuff like that. On top of all of that cool stuff you guys would also be getting the physical rewards of the tier you sign up for so THERE\u0027S THAT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16903499_1251619241591055_3297555234682807070_o.jpg?oh=c1ae242c0b66fabe8f9d1045e2195018\u0026amp;oe=5A49332A\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far you\u0027re really committed or don\u0027t have a life so maybe you should go work on that.
