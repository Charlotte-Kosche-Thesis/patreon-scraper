I write short stories, novels, poetry and also record spoken word poetry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little about me...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fiction for many years and have gone through and am currently going through the process of finding representation. I did very briefly try and self-publish my work, but it proved too costly to sustain it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin the last couple years, I discovered poetry, which became an outlet to share my feelings about my mental health issues of depression and anxiety. After a year of writing poetry, I realised I had enough to publish a collection and did so in July 2016, it\u0027s called Fading Footsteps. Again it was very costly, but I decided putting a book out there, that would raise awareness for mental health, was too important to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I joined Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had heard of Patreon for a while but I never connected the dots that this service, which helps creators, could help me too. Once finally figuring it out lol, I thought it was a perfect match for me to get some financial support for my creativity, especially since I\u0027m not able to work right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe topics and themes I\u0027m drawn to write about often touches upon social issues and this is what inspires me - to help others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI already write and publish poetry on my instagram account (@_harditsingh) and Facebook page and I would like to release another collection of poetry in the future. I\u0027m currently working on releasing my first zine called \u0027The Self\u0027 which will be a collection of haikus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also in the midst of editing a novel that I hope I can begin to submit to agents soon.\u00a0A previous novel is already being submitted in the hope of finding a literary agent. I also have many completed short stories that I hope to release individually or as a collection and a screenplay, written several years ago, which needs a final edit before it can be sent off in the hopes to be bought.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your support help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy creativity is my only way of supporting myself right now. Your kind pledges will help me as I put in the many hours to write and edit my works of fiction, write and publish my poetry, including zines and future collections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt can take me days sometimes weeks to write, record and produce my spoken word poetry that are uploaded to my YouTube channel. You will be supporting me as I continue to build my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith each of your pledges, I can concentrate on helping myself the only way I know how, through my creative outlets. Your contributions will also give me creative freedom and I won\u0027t have to worry about being restricted :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be able to see my writing goals on the left for what I\u0027m currently focusing on, and I will try and keep you all updated as often as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI\u0027m still of course figuring this site out, but I already want to say a big thank you for checking out my page regardless of if you become a Patron or not. I\u0027m just happy to be part of a new creative support community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace \u0026amp; Love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehardit x\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
