    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eI am so happy you found my page and are interested in joining my close-knit group of friends.  As my friend you will access to discussions about race and guided meditation podcasts.  In addition, I will add both behind the scenes insight into the creation of these podcasts and podcasts that I create especially for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working to improve the racial divide for all of my life.\u00a0 I can\u0027t think of anything more important that I can do with my life. Patreon allows my friends, fans, and patrons easy access to all of my efforts to heal the racial divide.\u00a0 I am also passionate about created guided meditation podcasts that help heal body mind and spirit.\u00a0 \u00a0I am happy to share my work on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a sense, I am creating a vessel.\u00a0 A vessel that contains an open space for interactive healing.\u00a0 I work to bring together people from all over the world to share my healing solutions.\u00a0 These solutions take many forms.\u00a0 Talking, mediation, facilitation, and role play.\u00a0 I invite my friends to participate with me and to contact me directly and often to let me know their healing concerns.\u00a0 I work on those concerns and respond with healing solutions and I put them all on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my passions is healing the racial divide.  Recently, I\u2019ve launched a radio show:\u00a0 Let\u0027s Talk About Race.\u00a0 I bring guests to talk about race,\u00a0 any aspect of race, from many perspectives. Some guests are vastly knowledgeable; some are just finding their voice.  I welcome them all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0 create podcasts from my race dialogue and share all of these podcasts with my friends on Patreon.  My goal is to engage discussion so that we can learn from each other and increase and strengthen race dialogue and race relations.\u00a0 I welcome opportunities to partner with others doing similar work.\u00a0 One of my goals for my Patreon is to do this work full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to creating conversations about race, I facilitate race dialogue, locally and abroad. I offer workshops on race and work with groups seeking to set up race dialogue in their home communities.  Recently, I traveled to Miami and to Oregon for race dialogue seminars. As part of the offering, I conducted guided meditations to heal from the inside out as we learn to fully process internalized negative beliefs and feelings about race. Beliefs that hold us back from opening up to new opportunities for friendship across the racial spectrum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help heal body mind and spirit, I create guided meditations aimed at helping people relax and reach their goals about many aspects of life.\u00a0 One focus is to help people who want to eliminate negativity from their belief system and find more fulfilling lives.\u00a0 I create all manner of guided meditation for many reasons.\u00a0 I welcome the participation of my friends on Patreon to contact me direction with ideas for all kinds of guided meditations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
