    "summary": "Well, hi there. My name is Kris, I\u2019m 25 years old and I live in Tennessee, USA. I\u0027m a struggling graphic designer who loves to make people happy with my art :-) I have issues financially and would appreciate any help given!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve always been that person that is easy going and ready to make you laugh at the drop of a hat whenever it\u2019s necessary. I just get so much joy out of uplifting someone\u2019s mood or encouraging others - and pretty much acting like an insane person LOL I\u2019ve always had an interest in graphic design since I was very young, around 11, so when it came time to go to college - I knew that was what I wanted to do. I\u2019ve been blessed enough to have parents that always loved and supported me no matter what I wanted to do in life as long as it made me happy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kind of found One Direction I guess at my lowest point in my life. I had just gone through a bad divorce from a man who hurt me on a level I could never really describe. I was young and didn\u2019t want to be divorced so I tried so hard to make things work, but I finally made the decision to leave when I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and one month later, my dad died unexpectedly. He was my biggest fan I think. He always told me I could do big things and believed in my art and talent so much. He thought everything I did was just the \u003cstrong\u003ebest\u003c/strong\u003e thing he had ever seen and I always thought it was just because he was my dad and HAD to say that you know lol but he pushed me to apply for the best digital media program around and I got a full ride scholarship for it, which was great of course and I was very thankful. I worked really hard in college and finished at the top of my digital classes, but I was stupid and got married right after graduation to someone who I thought loved and supported me, but really he was just selfish and manipulative and because of him I got stuck working a job I hated that had nothing to do with my degree and my passion for art. After I left him and my dad died I slipped into this really dark place and I stopped making art because I thought it was pointless and that I would never be able to do anything with it. But I was watching TV on New Years day 2014 and the 1D movie was on and I thought I could watch it to make fun of it and laugh or something and ended up falling IN LOVE with the boys.\u003cbr\u003eSince then, they (mainly Harry), have been the main inspiration for my art because they just made me happy you know? They provided that distraction I needed and when my art was recently spread all over the internet with my watermark cut out I really thought I was going to lose my mind. Like finally, someone sees what I can do and it felt like it didn\u2019t even matter. But after fighting for credit, I\u2019ve been written about on Sugarscape, Seventeen, CelebMix, Capital FM, Cosmo, DOLLY, and Maximum Pop - but it still seems like a lot of people are struggling to find me so I hope to someday meet and talk to everyone who has seen my artwork throughout the fandom, and maybe someday to even be noticed by the band who really changed my life. I don\u2019t care how corny it sounds, or how silly it seems for a 25 year old woman to be in love with a boy band. Music speaks to me and frees me - and in those boys and people I have met \u003cem\u003ethrough\u003c/em\u003e them, I have found friends that have been there for me even if they have no clue what they\u2019ve done for me.\u003cbr\u003eI want to share and spread my art to as many people as possible, and if anything I hope I can spread the message to inspire people to believe that no matter what you go through or how far you fall, there\u2019s always light at the end of the tunnel and you should never EVER give up on what makes you happy. Do what you love, and \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eignore\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e those who want to hold you back.\u003cbr\u003e"
