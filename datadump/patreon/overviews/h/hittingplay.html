We decided we were having so much fun, that we\u0027d record our breakdowns and reviews in podcast form. Over the next few years, we brought along other regular guest hosts and really began having fun with the form of podcasting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou never know what our next episode will bring: It could be a super in-depth breakdown of an episode from a cartoon from the 90\u0027s, It might be a fun conversation with an executive producer of The Simpsons, it might even be an episode two of us reviewing a show that doesn\u0027t exist with comedy bits in between segments. We always try to keep it fresh and fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we couldn\u0027t keep this show going without the support of great listeners like you! You get us! So thank you so much for all your help in keeping the show alive. Let keep hitting play together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
