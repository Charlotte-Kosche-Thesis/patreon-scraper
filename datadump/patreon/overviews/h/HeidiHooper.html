    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT HEIDI HOOPER\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter dozens of operations and radiation treatments, the cancerous tumor in Heidi Hooper\u2019s upper right arm was finally killed, taking with it most of the arm itself. Another operation removed a muscle from her back and placed it on the arm to protect the bone, but provided no other function.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this permanent handicap, Heidi Hooper knew her days as a metal sculptor were over. She had received her Sculpture degree from Virginia Commonwealth University, usually listed as one of the top five sculpture schools in the country, and had done Master\u2019s work at UCLA in Long Beach and the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston (where she also taught for some time).\u00a0Her work had been seen in galleries around the country and her artistic metal armor pieces had won her many costuming awards, including at Science Fiction\u2019s biggest convention, Worldcon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then, at the turn of the century, she was left wondering what she could do. She could only work a few hours without pain, and often had to stick her arm into a machine that would massage it to treat the lymphedema she suffered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing she knew: She would not give up. The monster inside her demanded that she create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe tried sculpting in soft clays, making dolls of friends and famous people. This attracted coverage in some doll magazines and even got Peter Falk\u2019s attention, who bought the one she had made of his character from \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d But even creating those were painful for her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen she discovered dryer lint. The first work was quite primitive, but she persisted and taught herself how to make each piece more intricate than the previous. Galleries started to take notice, and it wasn\u2019t long before Ripley\u2019s Believe it or Not found her, featured her in one of their books, and bought her work to show in their museums around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer fame grew, and as the work got larger and more complicated, serious art collectors started buying her work. \u003cem\u003eConsumer Reports\u003c/em\u003e did an side piece on her work (next to an article about dryers, of course) and called her \u201cthe Andy Warhol of dryer lint.\u201d So she did a very large piece featuring Warhol which won her the prestigious Niche Award in 2014. (She\u2019s been nominated for four others.) This led to a series honoring famous artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe\u2019s never forgotten her fantasy and science fiction roots, though, and loves doing fantasy pieces for her own amusement. And in 2016, she was honored to be the Artist Guest of Honor for Albacon, a science fiction and fantasy convention in Albany, New York, and then in 2017 she was the Artist Guest of Honor at the Heliosphere convention in Tarrytown, New York.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeidi says she could not have done so much if it wasn\u2019t for fans saving their more colorful lint and sending it to her. She thanks them each year with a free signed print.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe and her husband live in the beautiful Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. They have been married more than 30 years, and enjoy hearing the pitter patter of little feet around the house (they have four cats).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer web page is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://heidihooper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHeidiHooper.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
