    "summary": "I assume many of you don\u0027t know how this works so I\u0027ll take a second and explain.\u00a0 Patreon is like a tip jar for\u00a0your favorite artists or creators.\u00a0 Most creators are set up for flat monthly donations.\u00a0 Right now mine is set up for a Per-Video donation.\u00a0 That can scare some people because it can be a little unpredictable when I upload but Patreon handles that by allowing you to put a monthly cap on your donations. (I suggest\u00a0you do that by the way)\u00a0 When I make extra videos like the time lapse ones or the Q\u0026amp;A videos, those videos are just extra and not part of any Patreon\u00a0donation charge, so don\u0027t worry about that.\u00a0 So why am I excited about Patreon? Well\u00a0simply put, it will allow me to\u00a0create more project videos \u0026amp; plans more often."
