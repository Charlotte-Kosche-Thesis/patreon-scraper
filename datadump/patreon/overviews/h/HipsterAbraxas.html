He is generally depicted with the head of a rooster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHipster: \u003c/strong\u003ea subcultural melting pot of indie styles and progressive culture, focusing on the obscure, the original, and possibly the overly trendy and \u0027elite\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCombining these two things seemed incongruous to me, so I did it. And what flowed out on twitter was an exploration of the myth of Abraxas set in a mythic Portland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to keep going on the story, and I\u0027d like your help and encouragement to do it. The first chapter is freely available on twitter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hipsterAbraxas\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@HipsterAbraxas\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve moved away from that medium due to it\u0027s limitations, and will be posting further chapters both here and at a website to be determined in the future."
