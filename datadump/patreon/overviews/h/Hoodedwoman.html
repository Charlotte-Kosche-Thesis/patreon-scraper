I\u0027m Hooded Woman or as some of you might know me, Dee. I\u0027m a cosplayer from Florida and I adore it here. That, however, doesn\u0027t stop me from travelling and sharing my love of cosplay anywhere I can! I have been making my own costumes for over 13 years and I have continued to try and challenge myself. It all started on Halloween when I wanted to be a character from a video game but knew I could never find it in a store. I was blessed to have a very talented grandmother who helped me make my costume. It wasn\u0027t too long after I sought out to learn to sew that I learned about conventions, cosplay, and this amazing community! So, here I am! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I tend to make costumes from things I am passionate about. This includes: anime, video games, movies, and even books. I however, am a gamer at heart. I have been playing games with my brother since I was a very young girl. Video Games are still a huge part of my life! Only a few years ago I found out about Twitch and started sharing my gaming experience with other gamers! One of my hardest problems is finding enough time to create new costumes, work full time, and catch up on all my favorite games! Hard as I might find it I still work hard at all of them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I\u0027ve always been a rather open and expressive person. I don\u0027t find social interaction hard and I love meeting new people. I can sometime be shy around someone new, but I always love to meet and include everyone! Cosplay is all about love. I have met some of the best people, made the most meaningful relationships, grown as an individual, and overall just become a more loving person thanks to cosplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://hoodedwoman.weebly.com/uploads/2/1/1/6/21167690/4219049_orig.jpg\" style=\"width: 431px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I thought on this for awhile. I did not want to look as though I wanted someone to pay my way or that I was looking for a handout. This is not the case. I work a full time job, make all my own costumes, and try my best to improve myself and give back in multiple forms . With your support I will be able to do this more efficiently. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your support will go towards completing costumes faster, more efficient, showcases them more appropriately, and just better finished results! What does this mean for you? This means I will be able to give more efficient, faster, and better content faster! Content that includes detailed work in progress photos, tutorials, and behind the scenes so you can learn my processes and tricks!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As always, your support is completely optional!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I will still post all of my finished costumes on my other social networks. There will be some exclusive content for going the extra to support me, but you will still be able to see everything I craft and complete. Patreon will have exclusive behind the scenes stuff, sexy photoshoots, and others but my finished costume creations will ALWAYS be posted on my other social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Payment up front system\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo keep things fair to all my previous Patreon supporters and my new ones I have made my Patreon one that requires payment at the time of pledge. I have had an influx of people pledging for a matter of an hour and then retracting it. I have no issue if you don\u0027t like the content, I\u0027ll refund you! This however, will stop those doing it just for the content and leaving. This is ruining all my statistics for Patreon as the surveys are now filled with inaccurate information from the \"fake\" accounts. Sorry for any inconvience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Regardless of your support I still plan to work towards bettering my craft and continuing to bring you quality costumes made with love and dedication.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
