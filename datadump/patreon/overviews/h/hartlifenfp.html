The story explores the lives of the Policies of the HartLife corporation, a despotic insurance company in the ruins of what was once New England.  Our Fair City is chock full of mad scientists, molepeople, giant ants, and murderous executives, and has been lauded for its incisive writing, dynamic voice acting, and immersive sound design.\u00a0 The world of the podcast is further fleshed out by live shows, immersive events with themed food and drink, and a dynamic comic series!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/our-fair-city-radio/Patreon+Images/Live+recording.jpg\" style=\"width: 757px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/our-fair-city-radio/Patreon+Images/banner02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re here on Patreon for two very important reasons: whenever possible we want to pay the artists who create Our Fair City, and we want to make sure the show is always free to any listener who wants to hear it.
