That\u0027s not my real name, but it\u0027s close.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work as a freelance writer, editor, and animator, and have worked for, among others, films of the School of Life. But I also make videos of my own for the internet. That\u0027s probably why you\u0027re here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bBHLQZy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of videos on the internet are funny. A lot of videos on the internet are smart. My goal has always been to do both at the same time - to make a useful or important point in the guise of comedy. My videos cover a variety of topics and styles, but the overall focus is on analysing media and trying to contribute to the discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to release around three videos a month. I usually end up making less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe content I create is often too off-the-cuff, or weird, or esoteric for a mainstream audience, which is why I use Patreon to support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/szb2evz.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get access to bonus, extra content I either make specially for my backers, or which I thought was too experimental or out-there for the full videos and didn\u0027t want to risk inflicting on a more casual audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also get your name in the credits, or have your name spoken out over the ending of videos as a direct way of thanking you for your direct help with making these videos possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Tg2fXQY.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me helps me take more risks with my projects - a lot of material I cover is copyrighted, and Fair Use is more of a guideline than a law, making it impossible for me to ever really profit from monetising my work.\u00a0With your support, I can afford to continue to cover topics in a valuable way without fear of being rendered incapable of feeding myself in the space of a single copyright claim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money also goes to better production equipment and also the various props and bits of software that get used in the course of making internet videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/K6nKvrL.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA less foolhardy critic would tell you there\u0027s no easy answer, and it depends on what you personally prefer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u0027s actually a right answer, and that answer is \u003cu\u003eXavier: Renegade Angel.\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0There are no other correct answers, and if you disagree, you are \u003cem\u003ewrong\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
