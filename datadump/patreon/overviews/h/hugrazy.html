I love games and I want to devote as much time as possible to creating videos and involving myself in the community. For the first time in my life, I\u0027m going to embrace my passion instead of pushing it away and go after my dreams. For me, that means Youtube and one day, designing a game of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve turned to the community to help me realize this goal. If you choose to, you can support me through Patreon and help me spend as much time doing this as I possibly can. I\u0027m dedicated to this thing and I want to prove that I\u0027m capable of putting in that time and getting better at what I do if I\u0027m given the chance."
