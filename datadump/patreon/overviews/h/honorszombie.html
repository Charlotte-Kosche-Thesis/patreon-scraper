    "summary": "I\u0027m here because I have ideas I want to share with an incredibly giving, loving, intelligent and responsive community. Ever since I started making video essays in 2013, I\u0027ve seen the way people enthusiastically respond to the form. They speak the language of film in order to tap into our collective obsessions, the way we need film and love film. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve wanted to share more ideas, create more essays, but it\u0027s difficult to pitch series to outlets in this economy. Unsurprisingly I have more ideas than anyone can afford to pay me for and no time to make them on my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I could be given a little bit of financial assistance, I could possibly afford to quit one of my dayjobs and work on the essays that have been floating in the back of my head like unwritten novels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are directions the video essay has yet to take, ideas the form has yet to reveal to us, and I want to explore the possibilities of the medium. Video essays as we know them are only a few years old and it\u0027s been humbling and exciting to be allowed to create something with such a wide ranging group of devotees. The people who watch my essays and want to have conversations about these films are some of the most kind and intelligent people with whom I\u0027ve had the pleasure of interacting. I want to keep creating work that will stir the emotions of cinephiles, to awaken discussion on forgotten films, to keep evolving with the medium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will not put a stop to the work I do elsewhere as I owe it to the editors who have put their trust in me to keep doing my absolute best for them. This will just help me pursue the passion projects I\u0027ve put on the backburner for too long.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe projects I want to start include: a series on alternative or acid westerns, a feature length video essay about the depiction of America in films, a series on the evolving grammar of action movies, ten minute analyses of entire directors\u0027 careers and stylistic hallmarks, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can reasonably hope to produce at least two new video essays every month, or more if I get enough donors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
