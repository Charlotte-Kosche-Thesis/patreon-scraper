    "summary": "OUR ULTIMATE SCOPE IS TO BRING OUT THE BEST IN YOU\u003cbr\u003eAn open source internet platform of robots serving individuals, companies and organisations. Our ultimate scope is to bring out the best in you. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 We are Stefan and Ioan Rosca, two brothers starting off a project named HAI. I have studied architecture but have always planned to bring joy and enrichment in many people\u2019s lives. Software is the perfect tool to achieve this goal. My brother Ioan has joined me. He studied Graphic Design, then spent 6 years in Africa, participating in a non-profit education project and running a small business.\u003cbr\u003e  The success of our project depends on all of us, including you. The good part is that HAI is not meant to be used by a small group of people but will benefit and help people from all walks of life, whether rich, poor, learned or clueless. It will help you figure out the things you\u2019re best at and give you tools to enjoy the wealth of the greater part of the world\u2019s knowledge. If you\u2019ve already figured out most of the things and your life is already set in place, HAI will enable you to focus on the bigger and more meaningful things, without having to waste your time with a plethora of tasks you are not meant to take care of.\u003cbr\u003e  We live in an incredibly stressful environment, we are continuously forced to fulfill tasks and concern ourselves with things that can be solved by default. By using artificial intelligence on its bright side you\u0027ll get rid of a great deal of stress.\u003cbr\u003e  Your robot will allow you to spend time where you are absolutely irreplaceable, have more time for friends, hobbies, offer love and support to your family and people who need it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are commited to do everything it takes for this project to succeed and I mean ANYTHING, as long as it\u2019s legal. We will do a podcast, will post frequent updates, build a website, make videos, listen to feedback, do constant research, write articles and books, hire programmers and everyting it takes, step by step. It is the dream of my life and I will always pursue it. We are super enthusiastic about seeing this project happen and see how it will have a positive impact in people\u0027s lives. We are going to publish pretty everything under the MIT open source license, so you will be able to freely use the resources. We like to be transparent, so we\u2019ll let you know how every dollar we get is spent. You are very welcome to contribute in any way, not only with money. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u201cWhen you\u2019re surrounded by people who share a passionate commitment around a common purpose, anything is possible.\u201d Howard Schultz\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
