    "summary": "Hello there,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a dedicated Vancouverite Indigenous artist, musician, teacher, and arts programmer, living and working in my home town. I have a long history of making art since I was a kid. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Emily Carr University and I have been actively involved in community and independent arts projects since graduation in 2007. \u00a0Now I feel more then ever that my time would be put to better use if I am able to dedicate my time to making art, making music, and thinking about the bigger issues. Instead of struggling to make ends meet, and wasting my energy on things that do not fully use my talents and abilities, I would like to make a living off of doing my art. Patreon is a perfect setting cause patrons fund you and you post your creations thus closing the loop of reciprication, and you get to be a part of someones creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a dedicated artist and I won\u0027t disapoint you. I will produce and post regularily, and I appreciate any feed back anyone can give to make this site more interactive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art is wimsical and expressionistic, lively and magical and is a cultural fusion with influences from all over the world including: Northwest coast indigenous, Modernist,Impressionist, Hindu, Haitian, Mexican, Chinese and Ancient\u00a0Egyptian and many more. I make drawings and paintings, I do printmaking, beadwork and fabric art, mixed-media and more. I also am a singer in blues and roots band \"Haisla with Nasty, Brutish and Short\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here to request patronage for my creative efforts. I am prolific, talented, hardworking and disciplined. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am changing all the time so I will surprise you too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your support,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a beautiful day, \u00a0Love Haisla\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
