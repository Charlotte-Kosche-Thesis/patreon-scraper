    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Dawn Vogel, and I\u0027ve been writing fiction for as long as I can remember (really. We found a story I wrote when I was about 4 or 5 when we were going through stuff from my dad\u0027s house. It probably wasn\u0027t the first.). I started getting serious about being an author in 2009, and I\u0027ve been cranking out short stories, novellas, and novels ever since. My website is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://historythatneverwas.com\"\u003eHistory That Never Was\u003c/a\u003e, and you can learn more about my published and forthcoming work there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting doesn\u0027t pay the bills, but I\u0027d like to see if it can! I\u0027m trying out Patreon to see if perhaps I can get to a point where writing can be a larger part of my life. Don\u0027t get me wrong--I don\u0027t see this as being something that will let me quit my day job (also, I actually love my day job and co-workers). But maybe it\u0027ll let me go part time, so that I can have more hours in the week to devote to writing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to writing, I\u0027m also a maker--I crochet pretty much everything under the sun, which you can find at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://etsy.com/shop/scarywhitegirl/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScary White Girl Designs\u003c/a\u003e. But I decided to focus my Patreon on my writing rather than my crocheting for logistical reasons. Still, if you really want crocheted goodies, there\u0027s a reward level for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also an editor. I\u0027m the co-editor of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://madscientistjournal.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMad Scientist Journal\u003c/a\u003e and our \u003cem\u003eMad Scientist Journal Presents\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0anthologies. I\u0027ve been copy editing professionally for more than 10 years. And between editing, reading slush, and writing, I\u0027ve developed some good critiquing skills, which you can take advantage of at the highest reward level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy all the water themes in my reward levels? Because I like to write stories about creatures who live in the water and want to murder people. I\u0027ve written mermaids, vodyanoi, nerieds, nyxes, and more. It\u0027s a definite theme in my writing, so if that\u0027s the sort of stuff you\u0027re into, you\u0027ve come to the right place."
