Thank you for being a part of the community that I\u0027ve created which takes up a substantial amount of my time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Hawk-Talk not to create a breaking news website, but to create a platform for me to share my insights, thoughts and emotions. That is my unique selling point, nobody has my insight, thought or emotions and I feel that is well portrayed in the website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently taken to adding elements to the site such as podcasts and the Football 101 section. The podcasts especially resulted in quite hefty sums needing to be spent for the equipment and ongoing hosting costs, plus adding to the costs of the actual website in terms of hard costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site has grown at an absolutely unbelievable rate, with regular returning visitors and new members each and every day, it\u0027s an absolute joy to keep a track of. This site means a lot to me, as does the community. I actively try and participate in the Seahawk community and make it better. I am a moderator on Seahawks.net, the largest Seahawks football forum on the planet which also involves lots of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime is something that is reaching breaking point at the moment, I have 3 children, a wife and a business as well as another baby on the way in June 2018, so I think the amount of time, energy and cost that I invest into this football team is testament to the love I have for them, and of course, the Hawk-Talk community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. Seriously, thank you."
