    "summary": "Welcome Squeamers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting \u003ca href=\"http://www.HorrificHistory.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Horrific History Podcast\u003c/a\u003e and checking out our Patreon! Our bi-weekly main episodes will always remain free, but if we can raise enough financial support from our listeners each month we\u2019ll have the means to develop more merchandise, expand to weekly free episodes, as well as create bonus episodes and content rewards available exclusively for our Patreon supporters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach bi-weekly episode typically receives over 40 hours of volunteer time including research, fact-checking, recording, editing, production elements, copy writing, social media, website maintenance and more! All that work is divided between just two volunteers, your co-hosts, Eric Slyter and Jordan Watney. If we are to expand beyond our current level of programming we need to be able to compensate our volunteers for their hard work and offer them the security to be able to devote more time, energy and focus to its further development. To accomplish that goal, we\u2019re hoping to fund this free program PBS-style, through listener-supported programming. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to provide you an even better listener experience with improved sound, more frequent episodes and a ton of more regular (and BONUS!) content for our website and social media accounts. To do that, our small 501c3 nonprofit needs to be able to bring Eric and Jordan on as paid staff so they can devote more time to the program without risking starvation and homelessness. Because Kron\u2019s budget goes towards maintaining our other discounted educational programs for underfunded schools, libraries and museums, we simply can\u2019t afford to bring them on as paid staff by ourselves. (Our one and only full-time paid staff, our Executive Director, already receives far less than he needs and deserves; we can\u0027t add more regular staff without outside funding.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate all of our listeners. If all you can do is regularly download and listen to our free episodes, write us a positive review, fill out a listener survey and recommend us to a friend that still helps! Things like that make our podcast more attractive to potential advertisers, which would give us the ability to fund the program through ad revenue. But, if you want to go above and beyond by contributing a few dollars to support our program each month, you\u0027ll get added to our Listener Hall of Fame and all the proceeds will go to providing you more awesome and squeam-filled content! We\u0027ll definitely make it worth your while!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening and supporting us\u2026 Until next time, no squeam allowed!\u003cbr\u003e"

New episodes are released bi-weekly on Tuesdays!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHorrific History\u00a0is a program of Kron, an educational 501(c)3 nonprofit headquartered in Ellensburg, WA. Other Kron programs include the Knights of Veritas, Veritas Medieval Faire and Haunting Ellensburg, among others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurtis Bender\u003cbr\u003eA graduate of Central Washington University, Curtis received a bachelors degree majoring in History, with a minor in Military Science in 2012. While enjoying all aspects of history, Curtis\u2019 primary area of interest is in 19th Century Western culture. Along with an interest in history, he has acquired the morbid and curious hobby of collecting the unique and beautiful remains of mammals, from a llama skull to a bear\u2019s baculum, and everything in between. His home is a menagerie of death contrasted by flourishing house plants and works of art. By being a co-host of Horrific History, Curtis hopes to bring the strange and bizarre aspects of history to the everyday listener who might be too intimidated to either ask or research it themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEric Slyter\u003cbr\u003eEric was the weird kid in your grade school class who always perked up when the other kids were saying, \u201cgross!\u201d Fascinated with horror and the macabre from his earliest memories, his lifelong interest in the arts and humanities never strayed very far from his gruesome roots. A graduate of the Art Institute of Seattle, even his artwork regularly featured monsters of some kind. A lover of medieval history in particular, he is a practitioner of historical European martial arts, and brings his knowledge of arms, armour and period combat to schools, libraries and museums throughout the Pacific Northwest with \u201cKnights of Veritas.\u201d His devotion to historical accuracy in particular feeds his passion as a co-host of \u201cHorrific History,\u201d where he hopes to excite the weird kid in everyone with those nasty details that are usually glossed over in history books.\u003cbr\u003e",
