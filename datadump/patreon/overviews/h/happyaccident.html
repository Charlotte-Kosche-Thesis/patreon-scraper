    "summary": "Hello everyone. My name is Kyle and I am a painter. My main page is over here at facebook.com/happyaccidentstudio\u003cbr\u003eI love to paint in the style of the Late and great Bob Ross. Some people have told me I should try and pursue this passion to a deeper degree, and this is my first major step towards that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eW\u003c/em\u003ehy should you give me your hard earned money, and what do I intend to do with it?\u003cbr\u003eAs it is I do sell my work in a non formal setting so that I can keep the costs of the piece down as low as possible. I think everyone should have something happy in their home to make them smile. The biggest thing I do is with every piece sold, 50% goes directly to charity. This leaves a 50% tip for me to cover supplies and time spent on the piece. While this can help, unfortunately materials for this form of painting can be rather costly. In order to facilitate more painting, and more time dedicated to the craft I have opened this page to give you, my most valued audience, an opportunity to help me along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith more donations and revenue you can help me with\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-canvas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-paint (very important)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- tools and\u00a0equipment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-more time allowed to be dedicated to practice and experimentation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA\u003c/em\u003eside from that you will be helping me with affording equipment for my side projects such as cleaning trash and debris from nature trails and reserves in my local and outlying communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA\u003c/em\u003es it is I do not have much in lieu to offer you except for creating more works. If I am able to track individual donors I will allow you to use the collective amount that you have donated, and use that for an up to 50% discount on any piece. This 50% will be that artist cut which you have already paid me, and we would only have to match the charitable donation (as well as shipping and handling if applicable). Think of it as an in store credit for taking the time to help me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe donation process is simple. You can sign up for a per piece donation (say $5.00 US) and you can set a monthly cap (say anywhere from 5-20 dollars). I prefer this over a flat monthly donation. I could never ask for people to just blindly give me money, I do not accept hand outs. I am here to work, and do work, to make the world a little happier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for your consideration, and wish you only the best. If you cant donate, that is perfectly fine. Just share my stuff around, spread the love and happiness, and know that this helps me in every way as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is version .01 of my patreon. I am still working towards creating better rewards for donors, if you have any suggestions just let me know in the comments and I will definitely thank you for the suggestion. Let me know what you think I am worth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and God bless you my friend.\u003cbr\u003e"

I am trying to get an easel since the one I have currently is a very simple desk model (Which I love don\u0027t get me wrong). It currently works off of the power of duct tape, which is not always friendly to my pieces and can cause for some very happy accidents. Once I have an easel that can stand upright with me I will also be able to set it up for broadcasting in an easier fashion. Upon reaching this I will be doing far more recordings of my paintings, and hopefully releasing speed paint edits. You can sign up for a per piece donation here at patreon and I would be eternally grateful. One major advantage you can receive is we will tally up your current total donations and it can be used for up to 50% off of a piece! If you can think of what you would like to see as rewards just let me know and I may add it. Thank you for your time, And God bless.",
