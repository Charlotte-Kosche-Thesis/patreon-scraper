The best thing about it is that we all have such varied tastes and there\u0027s \u003cem\u003eso much\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0music out there that there\u0027s always something to discover.

We\u0027ve got many different countries, genres, artists, and everything you can think of all carefully curated for your enjoyment. You might see some things that you\u0027ve heard on the radio, some bands that are about to blow up, and international hits that you\u0027ve never even heard before. \u003cstrong\u003eThe goal is to celebrate music\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0no matter what genre, no matter where it\u0027s from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Headphone Couture you can expect to find album reviews, new artist features, music videos, and even interviews with both artists and industry professionals, and we want to publish as much of that great content as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Headphone Couture is on Patreon, In Manda\u0027s Words:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I\u0027ve been blogging for years, it\u0027s only the past few years that I\u0027ve really enjoyed coming into my own as a music journalist. I really want to put as much effort as possible into writing as much as I can and sharing as much music as I can, but that takes time, effort, and cash. The website itself has expenses regarding domain registration and hosting, but also since this is a newer blog I cannot rely 100% on \"freebies\" to discover and listen to new music and attend shows. I would love to be able to use funds from Patreon to purchase more music to review when comp copies and streaming are not available and also to be able to review concerts where I can also hopefully discover new artists who may be opening for the main acts as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love it if one day Headphone Couture was a big enough name to sustain itself, but in the mean time we are a small community of music fans and your support is both why I\u0027m here and how we\u0027ll make our little corner of the internet as awesome as possible."
