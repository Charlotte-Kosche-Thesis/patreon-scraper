Our mission is to create jobs for women living in rural villages as media creators. Without some remuneration, families will not support women spending time as correspondents in their communities, it\u0027s that simple. A paid community correspondent position encourages the much needed family support, legitimatizes the work and raises the prestige and power of all women in the village. It takes very little money to provide a woman with a paid job as a media content creator, very little. Just $30USD per month is enough for a woman to proudly work as a media creator from her home village. Taking photos, conducting interviews, podcasts and community centered film not only gives a woman skills that are unique and power in the community, it brings the hundreds and thousands of untold stories about the life to women to the forefront and breaks down patriarchy.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a studio in rural Nepal and we have the skills to train women, the equipment they need to create. We need benefactors to support small salaries for them each month so they can work, help support their families from that work and garner societal support for change. Let\u0027s employ women, let\u0027s get stories made and told. Let\u0027s do this now! \u00a0Thank you for helping the women of Nepal. It\u0027s a real motivation for them to know that many people are cheering for their success.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExclusive created content will be available here for our patrons and other content will be distributed in Nepal via YouTube, Soundcloud, Facebook and others. A large percentage of the population, including women, have internet access via mobile phones and use social media networks daily.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer Farm Films is a project of The Global Mountain Fund a US 501c3 publicly supported charity.

We can recruit them for workshops to go in depth with the community correspondents and begin to really train them to be journalists. Since these are professional women working full time in these fields, they will seek some payment for their time, which is fair.
