We celebrate our local musical heritage - especially the music of Bing Crosby, Mildred Bailey, and Al Rinker - while also livin\u0027 it up in the spirit of the birthplace of Jazz: New Orleans, baby! Laissez le bon temps rouler!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, the Bartlett\u0027s capacity is just over 100 people for our events.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone can make every show, and not every fan of Hot Club of Spokane and our guest musicians can fit in the room! Also - each variety show includes as many as a dozen musicians on stage at once. That\u0027s a lot of mouths to feed! But it\u0027s what makes this show so exciting and unique.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo each month, we\u0027ll release a selection of high quality videos, a sort of \"best of\" collection from Northwest of New Orleans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour pledge of support for each month\u0027s new video collection means:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e1) You can still participate and experience Northwest of New Orleans, even if you can\u0027t attend in person!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e2) We can create an operating budget, and even increase musician compensation for the event!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e3) We can attract regional and national acts, which means you\u0027ll see even more variety, and our local musicians will be able to collaborate and trade ideas with musicians from all over the place. This makes our local scene even stronger, and also helps spread the word that somethin\u0027 great is happening in Spokane!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of this insures that Northwest of New Orleans will continue to improve and evolve, and hopefully, it means we can sustain the event for years to come.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWon\u0027t you consider becoming a patron of Northwest of New Orleans?
