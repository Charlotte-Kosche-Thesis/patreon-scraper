    "summary": "Hello! My name is Daniel Winsor, but in the hiking world people like to call me \"Beta\". I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2017. Now that I\u0027m finished, I\u0027m writing a book about my stubborn journey through one of the most difficult years to ever tackle continuous steps on the 2,650 mile trail from Mexico to Canada. The brutal winter of 2016/17 dumped record-breaking snow in the High Sierra, which was followed by a complete reversal into months of dry weather along the entire trail, causing California, Oregon, and Washington to experience one of the worst fire seasons in the trail\u0027s history. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until now, I\u0027d been releasing blogs every week covering sequential sections of my journey, complete with photos and videos of my trek.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s time for a change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the end goal of publishing a book, it\u0027s time to stop releasing each new chapter online and move into book-writing mode... which is an incredibly contradictory problem for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I\u0027d really like to publish a book that people will be excited for. A book that will contain new stories that nobody has read yet. But... I also have have enjoyed sharing my story along the way with everyone, one chapter at a time. Not to mention, some folks would rather read my story in the blog format with the photos and video instead of a traditional printed book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my blog covering from the Mexican border through half of the Sierra will remain free and open for everyone online. For those who would like to continue reading, rather than waiting for the book, all it takes is any contribution on Patreon. Higher contributions earn higher rewards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, even the smallest amount helps to keep me motivated to complete what I hope to be one of the biggest accomplishments of my life. Look at it as buying me a coffee to keep me motivated or a beer for finishing the trail! I couldn\u0027t have gotten here without everyone supporting me along the way, so thank you to everyone!\u003cbr\u003e"
