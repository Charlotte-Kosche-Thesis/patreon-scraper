    "summary": "Hello World!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf school taught me anything, it\u0027s that deadlines are a hell of a way to spur motivation. Because this is my first attempt at Patreon, my tiers and rewards are subject to change as I figure out how this all works, what people want, and get into the momentum of creating art on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, about me. Hey, I\u0027m HeyArt3mis, or you may know me as Ally. A little known fact about me is that I went to art school! I graduated with a Bachelors in Studio Art with a concentration in painting, though photography, ceramics, and digital imaging are my other favorite mediums. Since graduating, I discovered that art is a VERY difficult field to land a successful career in (if not impossible), and after floating around in retail for a bit (more like drowning), managed to land a career in Technical Support which has done pretty well at paying my bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I don\u0027t feel like telling people to \"turn it off and on again\" is why I was put on this planet. I have a need to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! Here\u0027s where you come in. Making art for just myself is boring and uninspiring at best, I want to make things for people who will love and appreciate it. I\u0027ve started with some pretty low-cost tiers for people like myself who have mouth(s) to feed and bills to pay (and student loans AM I RIGHT?!). As I get more comfortable with how this all works, I will be opening up more options and tiers for people to regularly receive art in their home and support me in the process. Thank you for inspiring me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all I\u0027ve got for now, thanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e"
