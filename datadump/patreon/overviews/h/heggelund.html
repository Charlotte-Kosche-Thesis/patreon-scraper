Since the\ninception of the most ancient mythologies, stories have helped people define\nand give form to ideas too complex and multifaceted for concise, linear\ndefinition: Ideas such as love and justice that can be simultaneously embodied by\nboth pain and fidelity. Incarnating such ideas repeatedly\nin multiple myths with different forms and faces helped people reconcile the\nmultidimensionality of modernizing concepts.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is to say our understanding of\ncomplicated ideas maintains seemingly contradictory truths: a person can kill another and still be\njust, words can be harmless and still hurt, things can be different and still the same.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nAn infallible definition of concepts\nsuch as pain, justice, or love, would be as infinitely long as the body\nof examples embodying them. Just as any perfectly representational model would\nbe a 1:1 replica of\nits subject, a semantic definition of these concepts would be equal parts\nimpossible and useless.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nDespite that, you and I can talk\nabout love and justice with an operational understanding because of stories.\nBefore Beattie, Hemingway, Shakespeare, Homer, such casual conversations about the\nspecifics of human experiences weren\u2019t possible. Without them, the eventual working\ndefinitions we derived and their applications, such as courts meant to realize justice,\nwould not have been developed. Underlying our most objective understandings of how\nthings are and ought to be is a fantasy developed and supported by stories,\neven today.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nStories like click-bait\nadvertisements that depict racists getting their righteous comeuppance and\nothers that reinforce societal norms by illustrating events that need not have\nliterally happened but are consistent enough with our worldview to be\nimaginable.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nBridging that gap between what we\nknow and what we know to be possible in order to develop a better understanding\nof ourselves and each other is the most important thing I can imagine doing. It\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m a creator on Patreon, and why I\u2019m dedicated to becoming the best writer\nI can be.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tMy name is John Heggelund. I\u0027m an author of short, literary fiction writing out of Austin, Texas. My debut short story, \"Check, Bet, Kill\" is featured in the Spring 2018 issue of the \n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.csuchico.edu/watershed/2018-spring/fiction/heggelund-john.shtml\"\u003eWatershed Review\u003c/a\u003e. I write every day\nand endeavor to present new and old ideas in ways that help everyone understand\nthem more definitively.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tAnd you can help me.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tI write short stories, but that\u0027s only the very beginning of the professional process of turning fiction into cash. My stories need to be edited, revised (sometimes sent back to editing), submitted, and finally marketed if readers respond to them well. A good month\u0027s writing can easily cost $100 in editing alone.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThen you have to submit. Besides taking up valuable writing time, each submission costs about $2 on average. There are dozens, \n\t\u003cem\u003edozens \u003c/em\u003eof magazines out there that don\u0027t charge a penny to read submissions. But I send my work to hundreds, literally \u003cem\u003ehundreds\u003c/em\u003e, of magazines, contests, awards, grants, and residencies every year. I\u0027m happy when my stories go out to about fifty markets a piece. That adds another $100 to my monthly costs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMy monthly costs = $100 + $2*50 = $200\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tWhile writing might not require more than a pen, paper, and some creative energy, establishing yourself as a professional author requires significantly more investment. It takes professional editing to get published these days, and not the kind you get from a friendly old English teacher either. Making it into a magazine, repeatedly, and then going even further to win a Pushcart Prize or the Story Prize requires the kind of editing people do for their livelihood: the kind they make you pay for.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow Your Help Will Help\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tAs my patron, your pledge will cover a portion of the most direct costs of my profession, editing and submission fees.

You\u0027ll become part of my journey to professional authorship, and together we\u0027ll work to rise up from obscure literary magazines all the way to the New Yorker!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you take the extra step to become an \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eEpic Editor Enforcer\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u0027ll receive all the perks of an \u003cstrong\u003eSFS \u003c/strong\u003eas well as a personalized letter from me every quarter, thanking you for your contribution. Each letter will mention any stories developed while you were a patron, so you can know which pieces you helped make possible.
