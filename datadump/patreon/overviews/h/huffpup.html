The great part about being an artist is knowing that people enjoy what I have to offer. I\u0027ve decided to create a Patreon in order to use as a tipping service, allowing me to possibly get more time to work on projects and improve along the way, and of course you all getting something in exchange!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003eHow will pledging help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledging will be like a tip jar,\u003c/strong\u003e helping give me some added income that will help wonderfully in allowing me to have more time to work on commissions by taking on less, to push myself and improve along the way. In all honesty, I work everyday trying to strive to be better with every commission and just to make sure I make enough income, reducing the amount of time I get to focus on actually learning and doing studies or personal pieces to further improve myself. Not only will I get time to better myself, I can also focus on putting out content such as prints, pins, and other merchandise in the future rather than solely focus on commissions, and overall put out better content for everyone to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003eWhat does this mean for you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor starters, \u003cstrong\u003ethis is not a paywall. \u003c/strong\u003eAll commissioned content and various pieces will simply be posted here \u003cstrong\u003efirst\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0before being posted on Twitter or FA, but most likely \u003cstrong\u003eonly by a few days or so.\u003c/strong\u003e Along with an early preview of completed content, you will also get any full high-res versions of each piece I post, early previews of in-progress pieces, sketches, and possibly personal pieces/scribbles I may not post to the public, and possibly a more in-depth view on my process! And of course, during personal projects, I will love for some input on what people might want to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOvertime, I will possibly add more rewards, future raffles, and so-on, depending on future works and projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll high-res files for each month will be sent out at the end of the month when Patreon charges each pledge!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e**Note that some rewards are locked based on what tier you choose.**\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
