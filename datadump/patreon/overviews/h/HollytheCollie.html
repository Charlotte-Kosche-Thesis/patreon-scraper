    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Kristen. I am a graphic designer from Newcastle, Australia. In my spare time I draw comics of my dog \u003cstrong\u003eHolly, \u003c/strong\u003ea\u003cstrong\u003e Rough Collie \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(you know, a \"Lassie\" dog)\u003c/em\u003e. I try to depict the sweetness and funniness of day to day life with dogs, I feel like a lot of people can relate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up this page to help cover the costs of Holly\u0027s treat addiction. She\u0027s gotta get that jerky. Seriously, I\u0027m pretty sure roo jerky is like doggie crack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to put out at least 1 comic a week on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HollytheCollieCartoon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://hollythecolliecartoon.blogspot.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, for special occasions I\u0027ll post extra. For example, in the lead up to Christmas I created a cartoon for each of the 12 days before Christmas called 12 Dogs of Christmas. I also have an \u003ca href=\"https://shop.spreadshirt.com.au/HollytheCollie\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eonline store\u003c/a\u003e where people can by some Collie merch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy schedule at the moment means that I post a comic on Friday evenings (New South Wales time), and I draw whenever I get a chance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes it gets hard to find time to draw, I work full time and there is a lot to do at home. Some extra cash would help cover expenses, and would go towards getting some new equipment that will make drawing easier. My comics will always be free for people to read, but if you would like to support\n what I do by contributing via Patreon, that would be great! Having \nsupporters means that I can spend more time making comics and drawings, \nas well as focusing on some other projects that I\u0027m hoping to \nbring to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy goals are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eJerky Addicts Anonymous \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHolly\u0027s roo jerky addiction is not cheap. She is nuts for that stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Equipment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to save enough money to buy some new equipment, a new computer would go a long way. This is my most immediate goal. A new set up could help go a long way for the quality and quantity of my comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Holly the Collie book\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would one day like to publish a children\u0027s (and adult\u0027s!) book. This is a long way down the track though, years maybe. But hopefully, some day, I\u0027ll be able to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePS: For one time donations, you can select a pledge and then select \u0027no reward\u0027.
