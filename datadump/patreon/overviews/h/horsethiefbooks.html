    "summary": "Horsethief is committed to delivering the finest poems we can rope and wrangle, on a monthly basis. If you enjoy the content we publish, we hope you\u0027ll consider supporting the cause through our Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make the poems we champion available to the widest possible audience, and to us that means publishing here, on the web, without a paywall, without a mandatory account, in a format that\u0027s designed to be legible and accessible cross-platform\u2014think smartphones, tablets, PCs, all of it. It also means, because we want to pick our poems from the very best poem-pool available, inviting submissions 100% free to writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping the magazine as open as we want it to be, however, poses a problem. Producing this magazine costs us and will continue to cost us. It costs us in time, of course. It costs us, too, in software fees, web-hosting fees\u2014and it adds up. Plus, (call us crazy) we believe our authors deserve some form of compensation, maybe not a new pony, but something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the industry standard platform for those looking to donate to their favorite producers of digital media, such as podcasts, bloggers, vloggers, and online magazines. Instead of giving a single sum, like you would with a Kickstarter, Patreon allows donors to contribute monthly. Think of it as a subscription, like the one you pay for your Netflix or Spotify. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the noises we\u0027re making, please consider making a pledge. Ask yourself\u2014would you buy us an egg cream every month to keep the Horsethief thieving? How about an egg salad sandwich \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e an egg cream? What if I promised to let a poet take a bite out of said sandwich? What about two poets? See where we\u0027re headed? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think $1 a month is totally reasonable (and helpful), but if you think Horsethief is worth $5 a month, we\u0027ll tell you how much we love you by sending along a smoking nice t-shirt featuring our wise egg-with-a-horse-inside logo. If you don\u0027t feel like you can contribute, we won\u0027t take it personally. Read when the reading looks good, and share what you like, spread the word. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd either way, see you out there in the hollows. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2014The Thieves. \u003cbr\u003e"
