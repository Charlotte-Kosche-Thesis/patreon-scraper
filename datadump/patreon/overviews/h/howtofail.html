Everything feels that much less fail-y with amazing people like you showing you care.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s why we\u0027re on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e - running a podcast can get pricey with a lot of monthly fees and equipment costs (at least, in order to keep our quality high and our episodes valuable). Since December 2017, we\u0027ve also introduced a new stationery subscription service - Fail! Mail! Our goal is to help you get through failure with humor and community and we\u0027d love to be able to do that in multiple ways that run in addition to the podcast. We\u0027d also love to eventually take the podcast on the road and do live shows!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are a few things our lovely listeners have said about the podcast:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I\u0027m already in love with this podcast. Kristin and Tina have such a fun chemistry - I\u0027m constantly laughing through the episodes. It\u0027s so refreshing to hear people talk about failure for once, rather than trying to tell us how to succeed the \u0027right\u0027 way. Thanks for the new take, ladies!\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Krista M.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"[Tina and Kristin] have created an environment and community that values openness and honesty, and the stories shared have been so encouraging. I highly recommend this podcast.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Alyssa N.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I love this podcast! I am so glad I stumbled upon it because it really is a breath of fresh air in a world where we all feel like we need to look \u0027successful\u0027 (and then think something is royally effed up about us if we aren\u0027t by these crazy standards). This is more than a podcast - it\u0027s a movement.\"\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Danielle L.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get the full picture of who we are and what our podcast and message is about, read our origin story below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout How to Fail!:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI (Kristin) came up with the idea for this podcast after hitting a breaking point where I felt completely overwhelmed by information overload on how to \u201cbe a boss\u201d and how to \u201cmake $100,000 while you sleep.\u201d I\u0027ve always been a creative person and an entrepreneur at heart, but these messages didn\u2019t feel inspiring \u2013 they felt defeating. How could I ever compete with the barrage of success stories we hear about on the internet? I feel like a failure a lot \u2013 but I\u2019ve had a difficult time finding anything that helps me work through and overcome these feelings. Not everything can be solved by \u201chustling harder.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where this podcast comes in! Tina was so on board with the idea for this project that she jumped in with hardly any begging. With her social work experience and my entrepreneurial experience, we\u2019re shining a light on the shadowy stigma of talking about failure. \u003cem\u003eHow to Fail!\u003c/em\u003e is for you if you struggle, make mistakes, doubt yourself, feel like you\u2019re faking it, and wish more people opened up about these feelings too. We all fail \u2013 so let\u2019s talk about it and \u003cem\u003efail forward together\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out more at howtofailpodcast.co or on Instagram - @howtofailpodcast !\u003cbr\u003eListen wherever you get your podcasts!"
