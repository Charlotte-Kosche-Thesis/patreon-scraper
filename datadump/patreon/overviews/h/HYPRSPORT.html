    "summary": "Thank You for visiting the HYPR-SPORT Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Is HYPR-SPORT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHYPR-SPORT is a YouTube channel I started in late 2016 as a place to get my ideas about sport out into the world. As a small town New Zealand kid I was (like many others) absolutely sports mad, and this passion lead me to pursue a career in sports. While I enjoyed studying and the opportunities it gave me (an Internship at the Crusaders Super Rugby franchise for example) I found I often disagreed with the direction sport was heading in, and out of that frustration the HYPR-SPORT Channel was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe this channel has the foundations of becoming a force in the sports world and maybe even reaching my ultimate goal of 100,000 subs (YouTube\u0027s silver play button).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe How To Fix Series\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis series is the foundation of the channel. After one of my first ever videos (How To Fix Super Rugby) garnered mainstream popularity and was featured on 3 News here in New Zealand, I decided to make it into a series, where the goal is to \u0027fix\u0027 sports teams, organisations and competitions. In these videos I lay out 3 clear, original and innovative strategies that the team/ organisation/ competition can use to massively improve and turn their fortunes around. So far I have done Super Rugby, the Wallabies, The Springboks and the Wellington Sevens, and I am continuing this with three more episodes about Southern Hemisphere rugby before moving on to Northern Hemisphere Rugby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe How To Fix episodes also feature mini skits at the start of each video that link up to form a larger story, and help add the spark of humor that is unique to my channel. These videos can often take 1-2 months to produce due to the heavy researching, scripting and editing workload but I am committed to growing the series and fixing as many teams as possible. The plan is to expand this series into other sports once world Rugby has been covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnalysis\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor big events such as the Lions tour to New Zealand,\u00a0I will look in depth into the tactics used by both sides and provide a unique perspective that no mainstream outlet will cover. These insight and analysis videos are very popular and I plan to keep pumping them out for the foreseeable future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRants\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRants on various subjects (usually sport related) provide consistent content to the channel while I work on my more work intensive series and analysis. I provide my unique perspective and will often veer off into other subjects and ideas. These rants have a free audio download available for all viewers so you can listen on the go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture Projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese include:\u003cbr\u003e1. The \u0027Coach Roast\u0027 series where i\u0027ll be breaking down exactly what a coach has done wrong in very (VERY)\u00a0harsh detail.\u003cbr\u003e2. The \u0027Tier One\u0027 e-book (and possible paperback)\u00a0where I look at the strengths, weaknesses and unique characteristics of all of the coaches of tier one rugby nations. This book will cover each coaches\u0027 tactical approach, rank their effectiveness and discuss what would happen in hypothetical head to head match-ups as we head into the 2018 world cup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat your contributions will do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will go directly back into the channel, helping provide equipment such as: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Better quality studio lighting for more professional production quality\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* A\u00a0high definition webcam for quicker and easier recording.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* A pop filter and mount for my microphone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* A faster and more powerful PC (already halfway through the build) that can render videos with a\u00a0bit more pace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Coffee (high caffeination levels are essential for brainstorming ways to fix things).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also look to quit one or all of my 3 part time jobs and put more time into the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank you for your contributions either here or through YouTube views, comments and likes. I always appreciate your continued support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHenry"
