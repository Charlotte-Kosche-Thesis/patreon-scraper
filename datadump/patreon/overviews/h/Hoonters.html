A mixture of Monster Hunter, Classic JRPGs and loads of hentai. You take on the role of a Beast Hunter, exploring lands in search of monsters whose fluids contain special characteristics, making them valuable resources for creating medicine, commodities and several other things. Not all monsters appreciate being exploited like that, in fact, if you lose to them, they\u0027re likely to make you taste your own medicine! ...Quite literally, in this case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSent off to a newly discovered archipelago, fresh out of your hunter training, you\u0027ll meet with never before seen monsters, places and people, expanding the Guild\u0027s control over the area and unlocking new tools and resources so that you can explore the region better and faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe careful though! You\u0027re not the only hunter in the region, so during your expeditions you\u0027ll also be competing with other hunters, seeking to make a name for themselves as well.

For a long time I aspired to eventually have my own go at it, but never had the proper resources to devote myself to a project like this. With your support, however,I can work a lot of hours on this project to make Hoonters into the game it deserves to be, without having to put monetary issues first. Hoonters is and will always be free, but if I hope to make it into a really good game, I\u0027m gonna need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, patrons will get access to the game\u0027s builds two weeks before they actually go out to the public. Additionally, people who pledge are also the ones who decide what I should focus my efforts on while developing the game! Do you want more monster variety? Maybe just more scene variety in the monsters we already have? Maybe you\u0027re more interested in the game aspect of Hoonters and you want more weapons? Pet system? More NPCs? Rivals? You choose, I turn it into a reality...Well, digital reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge per game update?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI intend to make BIG updates, released every few months. The reason I didn\u0027t just downright put a monthly pledge model is because, at the moment, Hoonters is more of a side project for me, so I didn\u0027t feel it would be right to charge you every month for it, especially if, for whatever reason, I ended up having to focus on other things during that month. But if you\u0027re worried about me possibly updating more often than you expected, feel free to set up a monthly maximum (Though it is unlikely I will ever update more than once in the same month.) With enough pledges however, I will turn Hoonters into a full-time job and switch it up to a monthly model as I\u0027ll begin dishing out updates non-stop. Once we get to this level, I\u0027ll also be able to set up a proper schedule for how much content I\u0027ll be dishing out with each update and from that, get an idea of how long I\u0027ll need to deliver the finished product.\u003cbr\u003e"
