Whether you want to build a shed, put vinyl\nsiding on your house, replace a window, or any other DIY type project, I\u0027m there\nto show you how to do it and answer your questions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, it takes more than just me\nto produce everything you see. My business partner is the guy behind the camera\nthat does everything techie that you don\u2019t see. From audio to lighting to video\nediting, website operation, the list goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur focus at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.house-improvements.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHouse-Improvements.com\u003c/a\u003e has\nalways been about providing the most detailed, informative videos. We have not\nworried about making sure we put out a new video every week just to get them\nout, or skipped steps to make the video shorter. We strive to have the best quality\nvideo possible for each project we tackle.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMany people comment after watching our\nvideos that they like that I take the time to explain and demonstrate many\nsteps in the project that are overlooked or skipped on shorter length videos\n(or TV shows for that matter). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDoing these videos is still just a\n\"side job\" for us. We are both working full-time in our respective\nindustries, but would love to be able to dedicate more time to the videos and\nwebsite instead.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor example, when I do a renovation job locally,\nit benefits one household whereas if we continue to create how-to DIY videos\nfor the world, we can empower so many more people, and save them money while\ndoing so.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your help through Patreon, you can\nhelp us get closer to our goal. We would be grateful for any contribution given\nthrough Patreon because producing the content does take time and money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you enjoy our videos and have found them\nhelpful, and maybe we\u0027ve even saved you money by helping you DIY, consider pledging\nus to help us produce even more content and reach more people.  Your pledges will go towards upgrading equipment,\nbuying materials, and other production expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some suggested pledge levels\nbelow but we don\u2019t want to encourage anyone to pledge more than they are\ncomfortable with so please pledge whatever works for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
