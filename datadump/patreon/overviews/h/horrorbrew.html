Looking to offer another venue to the horror community in Portland, Oregon, Matt Holland and Cat Dolber started horror trivia at Home, A Bar on February 6, 2016. We dabbled in podcasting throughout that time but on March 13th, 2017 Horror Brew Podcast was born!\u003cbr\u003eFor us, it\u0027s always been about the exchange of ideas and the broadening of horror horizons! From\u00a0drinking a beer and bewildering horror fans every other Tuesday at 719 SE Morrison St, to bringing on a rotating cast of guests with different horror perspectives - we want Horror Brew to be by fans and for fans!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to engage our listeners and bring genre fans together both near and far - and your support helps us achieve that goal."
