A developing hyperrealist world of delights and treasures, such as my latest painting photos and videos, rewards for you, and stories about why I do what I do and how!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e Almost five years ago I began the crazy journey of painting professionally. I fell in love with painting life like water images in oils and the process and stories that develops with each one. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI was recovering from burn out, and in the healing process, I discovered the creative painter in me that had laid dormant for over 30 years! Never did I think my works would sell, or care that they would be even seen by others, but I soon realised I had a following of people who loved to read the stories and see the progress of my work. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy work has, over a short period of time achieved major recognition in the Australian arts scene, including being selected as a finalist in \u003ca href=\"http://johnglover.com.au/exhibitions/2013\"\u003ethe Glover Prize\u003c/a\u003e (the richest annual prize for landscape painting in Australia.) and \u003ca href=\"http://artprize.com.au/finalists-2013.html\"\u003eThe Fleurieu Art Prize\u003c/a\u003e.

By the end of this year I am trying to build up my support base enough so that \u00a0I can work 100% on my dream. I have put in my resignation for the paid work I am currently doing by the end of December in great anticipation that I can find enough support, work, commissions etc. to sustain our family and support the restorative work we love to do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to join me in this journey?
