I\u0027ve loved video games and making myself and others laugh since as long as I can remember but haven\u0027t had much ambition for anything else. That is until I tried video editing and Photoshop for fun. Turns out I liked it.. \u003cstrong\u003ea lot\u003c/strong\u003e.. and.. maybe I can make a little money doing it too. So naturally I started my own YouTube Channel. I make content that entertains me and hopefully other people out there will find some value in it too. I put a lot of work it my videos. From the editing to Photoshops and basic animations to custom thumbnails. Its nice to know other people appreciate it too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and, please \u003cstrong\u003eDON\u0027T PLEDGE\u003c/strong\u003e anything if you expect to get some \"free stuff\" of any kind in return. This is not kickstarter. My Patreon page is a tip-jar, although it will help me to make better content.\u003cbr\u003e"
