If you like any of it or want to see me do better, you can become a Patron, and help me produce more and better things. I write, direct, voice coach, make foley art for, record, create, and produce most of the voice over stuff you\u0027ll see here. Currently, I am animating, voicing, and writing for an online webseries called Chrono Trigger Abridged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChrono Trigger Abridged is strictly\u003cstrong\u003e not-for-profit\u003c/strong\u003e. I do not gain ad revenue from it, and though it may direct people to my peripheral content that does earn me money (my voice over services, animation, foley art, writing... etc), I still have to pay bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford the high tier stuff, that\u0027s okay because even a dollar shows your support, and it makes me feel good to see my number of Fans go up, so don\u0027t be afraid of the dollar donations. If you\u0027re able to donate a bit more, you\u0027re going to get some pretty cool swag!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust so you know, all your donations are going towards furthering my advancement in the arts. BUT, since not many people want to give something for nothing, I am producing some sweet stuff just for you! If you\u0027re on the lower reward tiers you\u0027ll get a credit in my voice over stuff, and in the back of my comics. If you donate amongst the higher tiers, you\u0027ll be getting digital copies of stuff I do, physical copies, and I can even make T-Shirts!\u003cbr\u003e"

I have collaborated with other voice actors on at-home projects and performed on game productions such as Fallout New Vegas, Project: Brazil, produced by Radian-Helix Media. I have competed in many live voice over competitions at comicon. I have belonged to multiple voice over groups, and now I create my own voice over projects using my own animations, writing, directing, and so on. I am a multi-talented individual that would love to see my works go some place.",
