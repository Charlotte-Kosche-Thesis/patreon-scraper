I am currently working on a creating a large, connected world of strange and awesome stories. I will be releasing my newest novel, The Edge of Never a chapter at a time here to my Patrons. I will also be writing a short story in this world each month that will go exclusively to my patrons.\u00a0As you know, I also produce The Author Stories Podcast twice a week. The podcast is an enormous amount of work. Having patrons for my writing will allow me to focus time on creating new fiction while also bringing you quality author interviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor the first few days of the campaign, if you sign up for any level pledge, you will have access to a digital copy of all of my stories and books to date.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach of my books so far have been set in the fictional town of Weston, Mississippi. Weston is a strange place where one character said \"Weston is one of those places where the veil between this world and the next is a little thinner than most.\" If you\u0027ve read Bloom, Mulligan, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, Writer\u0027s Block, or the host of short stories that I\u0027ve set in this town, you will realize that there is something larger going on than what you can see on the surface.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had the idea of a connected world that tells a larger story for quite some time, and I chose a small town aesthetic on purpose. By building a place and characters that the reader can get to know and feel that they are a part of, the world becomes something magical, and real at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my Patreon campaign, you will get to see first hand how this world is constructed and receive insider information on what\u0027s going on. If you\u0027re a fan of literature, you\u0027ll also get a view to the creative process like no other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLEkavIhktI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what some folks have said about some of the other Weston stories I\u0027ve published already:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Garner\u2019s folksy prose remind us that we\u2019re surrounded by magic, that Weston is every town, and that there is a bit a Stu in each of us.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Garner has an easy way about his storytelling, one that draws you in and puts you right alongside the characters. Even when trouble happens for Stu, the author makes sure that the readers feel safe and confident in the process. I love Garner\u0027s writing style and with each new story he just keeps getting better and better. I love how Writer\u0027s Block ultimately ended as well, capping off a story that essentially ended up telling itself.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"This book exceeded my expectations. It grabbed me from the moment I started reading it and I kept thinking about when I could pick it up and continue until I finished. This book is actually the first book that I have used the highlight feature on my Kindle. I highlighted several passages reading it. I believe this book will be one of those that you will get something different out of it each time that you read it. I cannot recommend this book enough. This book will help change your life and the way you look at things.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love fiction, and want to be a part, please consider becoming a patron.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

When I started writing, I wanted to surround myself with the best of the best in publishing. I believed, and still do, that to become really great you should hang around with people that are great. \u003cbr\u003eI started Author Stories as a way to try to better understand creative people and to find out what really makes them tick. In the last two years I\u0027ve interviewed over 150 people and have released nearly that many episodes. \u003cbr\u003eI recently increased the podcast to twice a week, and most weeks I dedicate the Friday show to what I call the Author Stories Writer\u0027s Workshop. On these shows we really peel back the layers of the writing process.\u003cbr\u003eI am also a writer. I write stories that are a little weird, a little strange, but full of heart and wonder. Here\u0027s what a couple of folks have said about my stories:\u003cbr\u003e\"I laughed, I cried, it changed my life!\"\u003cbr\u003e\"Garner has an easy way about his storytelling, one that draws you in and puts you right alongside the characters.
