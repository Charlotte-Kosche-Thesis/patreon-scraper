    "summary": "The VSCA has been around since 2008, publishing games such as \u003cem\u003eDiaspora\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eHollowpoint\u003c/em\u003e. Recently we\u0027ve got the team back together to get our teeth into \u003cem\u003eElysium Flare\u003c/em\u003e, a space opera Fate game that we hope will rebuild Fate to the same degree that we did with \u003cem\u003eDiaspora\u003c/em\u003e to deliver something novel and exciting. We\u0027ve done it before -- we\u0027ll do it again. In order to put in the level of work necessary to produce first class product, we need an influx of cash. This lets me take time off work, buy high-grade Colombian art, and pay writers. If this works, we will even have the resources to come back to \u003cem\u003eSoft Horizon\u003c/em\u003e which needs a lot of input -- your input I hope -- to re-launch."
