All rewards will take place once the pledges have been processed, usually around the 6th of the month!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is Hardy, and I\u0027ve been making Youtube videos for the past 7 years. It\u0027s my passion, and my addiction. I\u0027ve gone through several phases, from Stop Motion, to Skating, to Call of Duty, to Let\u0027s Plays. Currently I run two channels on Youtube...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/hardyt3kyoyo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHardyt3kyoyo\u003c/a\u003e - Highly edited videos about the Pokemon world, including Countdowns, spotlights on certain things in the Pokemon world, reviews of Pokemon games and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/tangledcontrollers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTangled Controllers!\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eA channel I run with my roommate Culurrien. We play through video games together and talk about a lot of inappropriate things!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking these videos, which has spanned 1/3rd of my life now, has helped me through incredibly difficult times. Being homeless, having no friends, a period of self loathing, the community that I built is arguably the only reason I\u0027m alive right now. I\u0027ve also touched dozens, if not hundreds of peoples lives. I\u0027ve had people tell me that I helped them with their depression, and even had a person tell me that my videos helped them not commit suicide. My presence on the internet is something very dear to me due to these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, sometimes life likes to step in the way. Youtube isn\u0027t what it used to be for a variety of reasons and I need to turn to outside sources if I want to continue this passion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve attempted Patreon in the past and failed due to my inability to stay consistent, however I truly feel this attempt is different as the goals are much more manageable for me now and I feel a motivation I didn\u0027t have before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf everyone who watched my videos were able to give just $1 a month, I would meet all my goals and then a lot more. And really, content creators,not just myself, put hours and hours into creating a single video, so a single dollar doesn\u0027t seem like a lot to ask, in my opinion! That\u0027s less than one bag of chips!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hopefully a few of you will come along with me on this journey! Until then, I\u0027m hardytekyoyo....peace!"
