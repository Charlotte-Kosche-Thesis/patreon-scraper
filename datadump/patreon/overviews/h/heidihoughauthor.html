    "summary": "My Story \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was little, I couldn\u0027t stand to see injustice. If I saw someone being picked on, I was the first to run over and confront the bully. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, when I was eight, the Brothers in my Christian fundamentalist cult sat me down and told me I was a flirt and a Jezebel. I felt that familiar sense of rage in the face of wrong rise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut over time and constant pressure, I gradually forgot my warrior spirit. Just like the cult wanted me to. I forgot my child\u0027s sense of self-love and innocence. I began to believe what they said: that I was inferior, worthless, bad, nothing without them, and The Church. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomehow, I escaped. But what happens when a cult is all you\u0027ve ever known? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t know who you are. You end up in abusive relationships. You consider suicide. You feel completely alone. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMore than a decade later I\nstill work through these challenges everyday. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat keeps me moving forward? Healing with Story. Rewriting My Life. Choosing the Next\nChapter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday I\u0027m writing a memoir and making a documentary in which I seek to shape my future, even as I journey into my past. I grapple with the pain of time-travel into trauma and the worry of hurting my family even more. But I believe the cost of ignoring the past \u2014 of ignoring\nhistory itself - is a greater threat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA girl that speaks her mind and sticks up for herself in a patriarchal Christian fundamentalist group is also a threat. But when she grows up and tells her story, and hopefully, helps save other little girls from a similar fate, she wins in the end! That is the warrior spirit I stand for, just like my name, Heidi, which means, \"noble warrior.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help me finish my story of that bullied little girl who stood up for herself and escaped a cult against all odds, please donate $1 / month towards my book at Patreon.com. Every drop in the bucket makes a difference! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me I will privately\nshare each new chapter with you, monthly, starting from the first, before it is published anywhere else.

Now I come home from work exhausted, and find it almost impossible to write at the end of the day. The gift of being able to harness\nmy strength and energy and put it into full-time writing will make all the difference,\nagain thanks to You! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have whittled down my expenses to only needing $1,000 a\nmonth to survive. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way Patreon works is a reader can donate\nwhatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after\nthat.
