Our team believes that every family has a story worth telling\u2014but not every family agrees on how the story should be told. \u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s What I\u0027ve Heard\u003c/em\u003e will explore a new story each season to find the truth behind each family\u0027s collective memory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSeason One\u003c/h4\u003eOn November 6, 1965, the Kline family was traveling northbound on the Avenal cutoff when their vehicle was hit head-on by a drunk driver. Gerald and Linda Kline, along with their baby daughter, Theresa, were killed almost instantly. Their two young sons, Jerry and Paul, survived\u2014but would forever wonder about the life that could have been.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the premiere season of \u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s What I\u0027ve Heard\u003c/em\u003e, we\u0027ll follow Jerry\u0027s daughter, Courtney, as she searches for answers about the accident, speaks to those involved to learn details about the tragedy and uncovers an aftermath that\u0027s steeped in romance, revenge and murder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWho Would Like \u003cem\u003eHere\u2019s What I\u2019ve Heard\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/h4\u003eIf you like true crime, history or storytelling podcasts, \u003cem\u003eHere\u2019s What I\u2019ve Heard\u003c/em\u003e is probably perfect for you. The producers were inspired by a number of similar podcasts, such as \u003cem\u003eSerial\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRadioLab\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCrimetown\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThis American Life\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eSomeone Knows Something\u003c/em\u003e, among others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat You\u0027re Funding\u003c/h4\u003eProduction on \u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s What I\u0027ve Heard \u003c/em\u003eis already underway, but there are costs associated with podcasting that we need help covering. In addition to web hosting, administrative tools and mixing fees, our producers will need to travel as they conduct interviews and visit the scene of the event. The faster we receive funding, the more quickly we can bring Season Two straight to your podcast feed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/h4\u003eAll \u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s What I\u0027ve Heard\u003c/em\u003e patrons get access to bonus content and a shout-out on our website.
