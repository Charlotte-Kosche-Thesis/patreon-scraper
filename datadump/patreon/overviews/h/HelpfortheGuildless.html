    "summary": "Greetings Ladies and Gentleman,\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for becoming a patreon supporter, it means a lot to me. You see, I want to do something with my channel. I love to entertain as well as Inform. I am not a pownage channel, I am not an \"Anti\" channel persay, but what I like to do is point out stupidity. What do I bring for your entertainment? I bring a biting wit, a wonderful sense of humor, an amazing and alluring voice, as well as a humble host that knows he wants to entertain his fans constantly. If you chose to be a Patron, my gracious thanks is not all I can give.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you may be asking, why I started this? It is simple. I make social commentary videos on Youtube, and as of right now it is a hobby. I don\u0027t monetize my videos, because Youtube has become a harsh and desolate landscape for people like me. Now I DO have a normal full time job, but as of late, I have been coming in to problems with the rising rates of gas, bills, and pretty much everyday life. Youtube is my hobby, and as Mark Twain once said: If you turn your Hobby into a Career, it will never be considered work. Do I want youtube to become my career? Not necessarily, but to take the time and effort I put into my videos as well as my full time job, I feel I am working 7 days a week, with half of it I am not getting any revenue from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for even viewing this account and if you do happen to support me, I will think of something for rewards, be it a hangout, guest spots on videos, or even doing a personal reading of your choice, it is something we can discuss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo from the bottom of my heart, thank you once again, and thank you for helping support Help for the Guildless. Hopefully I will be able to entertain you and the masses for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely, Antwon"
