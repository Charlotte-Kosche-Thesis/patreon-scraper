    "summary": "First and foremost, my goal with Hey Best Self is to remove all the barriers \u2013 mental, physical, and emotional \u2013 that keep people like you from changing your life for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m what I like to call a best-self in progress. After struggling to get myself fit and healthy for many years and finally finding some success, I knew I wanted to start helping others like me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u2019t see anybody helping out people like me: women with desk jobs that love books, and movies, but also know they need to take better care of themselves and make healthier choices in their day to day lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re an ambitious woman who is more than ready to make some small changes that create big impact and become more of the woman you\u2019ve always known you could be, The Hey Best Self Society is for you. My only request is this, BRING ALL OF YOU: the quirks, the baggage, the struggles. The Hey Best Self Society want to help you work through those things and become the best version of yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting on the 1st of January I\u0027m diving into a year of the Best Self Experiment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals are based on my vision of my best life, my biggest goal for 2018 is to reach my goal weight. I\u0027m going to get in there and do it the old fashioned way, healthy eating and hard work. No fad dieting, no surgery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been overweight my entire adult life. In 2016 I hit the biggest weight I have ever been, 135kgs (275 pounds), and while I have been working on losing weight I\u0027ve stalled at 125kgs. This is no where near where I want to be so I\u0027m getting online and making myself accountable.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you guys some in. I want to share my progress and keep myself accountable to you. Not only will I talk about what I\u0027m doing I\u0027m going to pass on all of the things I\u0027m learning as I go. I want you to be part of my transformation and I want to bring you along for the ride. Whether you have some big fitness and weight loss goals and want to get accountable, or you want to just follow me along it\u0027s up to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to wake up feeling clear-headed, full of energy, organised and calm. You need to join me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cSix months seems like a long time unless you\u2019re looking backwards... all you have to do is just a few things everyday and remain consistent, and time will fly just as fast as it flies if you\u2019re working hard or not. If you just cut the crap out of your diet, and if you spend an hour a day doing something physical that will make you sweat, six months will pass by, you will feel better mentally, physically, spiritually -- it all is tied together.\u201d Chris Pratt\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow am I going to get this all done you ask? I guess like anything I decide to start, I\u2019m going to figure it out! I\u2019ll be using a 90 day planning strategy to plan out my meals, workouts, challenges, and booking times for reviewing progress.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions you want to ask before you join feel free to email me! kathryn (at) heybestself.com\u003cbr\u003e"

You\u2019ve tried different jobs, reading books, diet after diet only to wind up back where you started?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou want to feel more connected to the people in your life, eat healthy foods while not feeling deprived, feel happy and confident in your own skin, and do the things you\u2019ve been putting off for \u2018someday\u2019\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have been there \u2013 neglecting my health and happiness, feeling tired all day, uninspired by the life I had made for myself. How did I change it? I made a choice\u2026 I would no longer stay stuck.\u003c/strong\u003e I made it my job to learn, experience, and uncover everything need to live the life I want to live, shed the weight, and discover my true life, body, and happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only have I learnt how to make these changes, I\u0027ve done the hard yards and can help you skip the mistakes I\u0027ve made and fast-track you to your best self!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work full time as a Personal Assistant and I love my job. Being organised, getting things done, and bossing people around suits me to a tee. I love my job so much I didn\u2019t realise that it was the only thing going right in my life. I hadn\u2019t noticed because it all seemed to happen so slowly. I\u2019d gained weight and as a result I\u2019d stopped going out with friends as much. I\u2019d stopped reading and instead was spending my free time either working overtime, watching TV, or asleep. I was getting sick all the time, prone to sinus infections and headaches, and I was miserable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only was I in bad shape physically, I was missing balance, I knew I wasn\u2019t living my life the way I wanted to. I\u2019d daydream about places I wanted to see and things I\u2019d always wanted to do. I was enjoying my work but when I got home I\u2019d just veg-out on the couch or do a bit of housework (boring!). I felt like I had this never ending list of things I\u2019d do \u2018Someday\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t getting any smaller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided that I needed to shake things up, I needed to do something \u2013 anything! \u2013 to take my life back and stop this default style of living. This is where Hey Best Self was born. My side hustle to help me do more of the things I love, keep me accountable, and help me become the person I\u2019ve always wanted to be. It\u2019s all here, the good, the bad, the weird \u2013 my processes for picking myself up out of this slump and changing my life for good.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m thrilled that you\u2019ve found the Hey Best Self site and want to know more here on patreon! This is your space on the internet you can get inspiration and real tools for creating a life you love. It\u2019s the perfect place to visit while you eat breakkie and enjoy your morning cuppa. This space exists to inspire you each day and to help you become your best self.\u003cbr\u003e",
