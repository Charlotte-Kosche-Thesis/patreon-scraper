I am also interested in global health equity, social medicine, and health and human rights, and use a political ecology of health and disease approach to understand psychoactive biotic commons enclosures, seed sovereignty reclamation and use depathologization movements, and related therapeutic landscape formations. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI conducted the first research with state-authorized medical cannabis-using patients in the United States under NIH-issued federal Certificates of Confidentiality, recruiting 176 subjects both from a pain specialty clinic and an urban medical cannabis dispensary along with interviewing the owner, defining pain and symptom burden and relief, health-related quality of life, and social psychological\u00a0 distress levels in such patients.\u00a0 In conducting this work, I was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first-author 2009 review article in the Journal of Opioid Management, \u201cMedicinal Use of Cannabis in the United States: Historical Perspectives, Current Trends, and Future Directions\u201d has been cited 146 times according to Google Scholar Citations tracker, including by the UN World Drug Report and has been translated into Spanish by the Social Science Research Council and cited in several textbooks. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo facilitate closing the translational gap between cannabinoid medical science and clinical practice, I led the AMA to call in 2009 for a review of Cannabis Scheduling. My review article: \u201cCannabinergic Pain Medicine: A Concise Clinical Primer and Survey of Randomized Controlled Trial Results\u201d was featured on the cover of the February 2013 issue of the \u003cem\u003eClinical Journal of Pain\u003c/em\u003e, the 8th top-ranked journal in Anesthesiology, as per Web of Science. A poster based on the findings of this article received a poster award at the 2013 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine Annual Assembly. I have helped develop accredited clinician educational modules based on this work. I also wrote an entry \u201cCannabis for Symptom Control\u201d for Fast Facts and Concepts, a standard reference that provides concise, practical, peer-reviewed and evidence-based summaries on key palliative care topics important to clinicians and trainees caring for patients facing serious illness. They are cross-published in\u00a0 the \u003cem\u003eJournal of Palliative Medicine\u003c/em\u003e, and are indexed by Medline. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI recently co-wrote a chapter in a first-of- its-kind collection, \u003cem\u003eThe Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy of Pain\u003c/em\u003e, on Pain and Controlled Pain-Relieving Substances in which I describe 3 \"faux health science\" logics: 1) euphoria pathologization 2) asocial addictionology 3) pharmacologicalism.\u003cbr\u003e"
