But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you help me make this milestone, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don\u0027t, I will look for you... I will find you... and I will kill you.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[yes this is a joke]\u003cbr\u003e",
