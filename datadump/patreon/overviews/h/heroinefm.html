    "summary": "Hi heroines! Majo here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched Heroine in April 2016, and it regularly ranks among the top Design podcasts. It has been selected by Apple as one of \"iTunes New \u0026amp; Noteworthy\" and has even made the Top 200 Chart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing this show allows me to share one-of-a-kind conversations with female creative leaders, entrepreneurs, artists, designers, feminists, writers, and so many fascinating women on a regular basis. I\u2019ve gathered the heroine journeys of 30+ top creative leaders in design, arts, tech, and business with headliners like author and activist \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Allende\"\u003eIsabel Allende\u003c/a\u003e, fashion icon \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Fisher\"\u003eEileen Fisher\u003c/a\u003e, design educator \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Millman\"\u003eDebbie Millman\u003c/a\u003e, letterer \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Hische\"\u003eJessica Hische\u003c/a\u003e, and New York Times award-winning photojournalist \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynsey_Addario\"\u003eLynsey Addario\u003c/a\u003e. Since the show began, we\u0027ve published at least 60 shows and have received more than 250 five-star reviews.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of this podcast is that women on their own heroine journeys can listen to these conversations whenever and wherever they want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to devote the necessary time to these empowering stories, Heroine must at the very least cover its own costs for production and editing. Now, \u003cstrong\u003eyou can sponsor the show directly through Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting the podcast is an action that shows you believe in women\u2019s stories and empowering female creatives, and that you want these incredible interviews to continue to support your growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world where we\u0027re used to getting our online content for free, becoming a patron also shows you recognize the effort and skills it takes to make it all possible and truly believe\u00a0our content is worthwhile.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s really cool is that you can contribute on a per episode basis \u2013 anywhere between $1 to $50.\u00a0And when you sponsor, you get awesome Heroine rewards you can\u2019t get anywhere else!\u00a0For example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Heroine community membership, which includes a monthly hangout with me and other listeners, exclusive previews to upcoming episodes before they air, \u0026amp; other goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0An on-air shout out that mentions your project, initiative, or website and goes out to 5,000+ pairs of ears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach show costs about $500 to edit and produce. This is a baseline estimate, which doesn\u0027t include my time or the time it takes to reach out to women to interview, or any marketing/promotion. And we\u0027re publishing one episode per week in the active season, adding up to $2000/month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe great news is that over a six-week period, each episode gets about 5,000 downloads. So many of you are loving the show and benefiting \u2013 it makes my heart sing! Together, \u003cstrong\u003ewe can definitely hit our baseline goal of $500 per episode.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease show your continued support by becoming a patron and giving as little as $1, $2, or $5 per episode (for as little as the price of a cup of coffee). \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m tremendously honored to have a community of women who value what I do and want to see women rise. I look forward to continuing to offer in-depth and meaningful conversations with top female creative leaders.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for your help, heroine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMajo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
