    "summary": "Hi,\nI\u0027m Trevor Strunk. You might know me as Hegelbon on Twitter. This is No\nCartridge, a new way of doing games criticism. No Cartridge is a podcast and a\nblog that approaches the games you love, old and new, as keys to understanding\nand navigating the world around you.  Our\ngames deserve criticism that situates them at the center of our late capitalist\nlives, treating them not simply as something we do for fun, but as part of who\nwe are. So far, my guests and I have explored topics as different as the\norigins of popular indie games in the social dynamics of a creator\u2019s hometown,\nwar and the aesthetic, and how gaming changes as you age into new real-life\nroles. With your support, No Cartridge can keep searching out unconventional\npathways through which to explore games, and follow them wherever they lead.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo why me? I have a Ph.D in American literature, and I have written extensively\non the ways that art helps us diagnose and critique the structures of our\ncapitalist society. I also have played way too many videogames and have long\nfelt games deserve the kind of rich critical explorations we give to literature\nand film. So I started No Cartridge, first as a blog and then as a podcast. And\nit has grown from an experiment into a passion project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo Cartridge updates 3-4 times per week, with either audio or written work. As\na patron at the 5 dollar level, you\u0027ll have access to bonus audio content,\nwhich includes full extra episodes and bonus interview content with my wide\nvariety of guests. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd ultimately, you\u0027ll be contributing to a new kind of voice in games\ncriticism. I would love to turn No Cartridge into a full publication, with a\npaid staff and the works, and that begins here, with you. With your help, No\nCartridge can keep reinventing the way we all think about and play games. Thank\nyou!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
