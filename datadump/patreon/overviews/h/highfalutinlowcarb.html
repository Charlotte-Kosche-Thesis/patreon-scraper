    "summary": "What a wild ride! When I started \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHighfalutin\u0027 Low Carb\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, I had no idea how quickly our little low carb tribe would flourish on YouTube. \u00a0I cannot thank my fans and subscribers enough for joining me along my keto journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a cord-cutter. You know, one of those people that eliminated traditional cable and satellite television. Most of my content consumption these days is done via internet streaming. One thing I missed after cutting the cord were my beloved cooking shows. Particularly the old classic favorites like Good Eats, America\u0027s Test Kitchen, Barefoot Contessa, Sarah Moulton, Mario Batali, Emeril, and many others. So one day, as I was lamenting the lack of good cooking shows to stream, and bored to tears with the 2-4 minute cut-to-the-chase YouTube cooking videos so prevalent these days, I decided to put one of my hairbrained ideas to the test.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e I started my own cooking show\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. I figured that if I appreciated long-form cooking content, then maybe others would, too. \u00a0And since I was experiencing renewed success with a low carb way of eating, I decided to combine the two ideas into what is now \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHighfalutin\u0027 Low Carb\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, the weekly web series where we find and test the best low carb recipes this crazy internet has to offer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for coming along on this journey with me.\u003c/strong\u003e Running a food vlog is very fun, but it\u0027s also a tremendous amount of work (have you \u003cem\u003eseen\u003c/em\u003e one of my \"battle\" videos? \u003cem\u003eOy!\u003c/em\u003e) and a considerable amount of money. Patreon is a way for fans and subscribers to directly contribute to a content creator to thank them for their work. It\u0027s the proverbial tip jar on the giant piano that is the internet. If you like what I do here, and would like to contribute, even the smallest contribution is greatly appreciated and helps keep the Highfalutin\u0027 Headquarters stocked with low carb ingredients, memory cards and camera batteries. \u00a0Recipes don\u2019t test themselves, ya\u2019know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love to each of you that are helping me live my life-long dream of hosting my own cooking show - whether by watching, subscribing, sharing or even patroning. THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, let\u0027s get cookin\u0027!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
