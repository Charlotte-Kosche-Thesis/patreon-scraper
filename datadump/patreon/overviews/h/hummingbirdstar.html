I\u0027m letting it gather momentum before I put it out to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat that means, is that if you sign up now, you\u0027ll get all kinds of special perks that won\u0027t be offered to Patrons later on. These include a 30-minute astrology reading; the first ever Hummingbird Collectible; an early draft of my first full-length astrology article (coming by the end of May); and an invite to a Neurosculpting course I\u0027m developing on social media purification. Perhaps other treats as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e***End Important Note***\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello, beautiful souls!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Hummingbird Star. I\u0027m an American spiritual activist, dedicated to furthering the causes of Resistance and Revolution through astrology, art, and all kinds of ideas. I use she/her pronouns. This page is where you can access (and contribute to) my developing body of work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m an astrologer and an art model, but my background is diverse. My training and education includes politics, eastern mind/body practices, the chakra system, neuroscience and tantra, and my offerings integrate all of these influences and more. My community is for anyone yearning to make positive change in themselves and the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in tragic and beautiful times. Long-suppressed darkness is bubbling to the surface of our society; yet simultaneously we are witnessing incredible courage and unity as the oppressed raise their voices and \"call BS\" on ALL the powers that be. Astrologically, the US is completing a 248-year Pluto cycle--that basically means we\u0027re in a death-and-rebirth phase like nothing this country has known before. As we navigate these wild waters, we need perspectives that help us make sense of the chaos. We also need each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it is our responsibility to bring the darkness out into the Light... to let in both the heartbreak and the joy. So that\u0027s the foundation of what this Patreon community is about. We\u0027re really all figuring it out together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJump in at the lowest tier, Hummingbird Hangouts, to be part of the conversation! Upper tiers are avenues for accessing my intentional art, my creative process (ie my life), and my one-on-one work.

I teach you how to ground deep into your body, feel your emotions fully without getting lost in them, and re-wire unwanted neural pathways. I help you shift your perspective on life by choosing new stories that empower you; and - through energy training and working with the physiology of the brain - \u00a0I help you make these stories real on the cellular level, which is when things really start to shift. Sessions can be tailored to a specific issue you\u0027d like to focus on, or intended to cultivate general self-awareness and healing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI typically work in series of ten sessions, but you\u0027re welcome to subscribe at this level for a month or two and then drop down. The techniques you\u0027ll learn can quickly become self-sustaining, even for beginners to meditation and mind/body practice. Feel free to send a private message for more information.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e",
