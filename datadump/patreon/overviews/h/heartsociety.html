Our music combines elements of folk, soul, Southern gospel, blues, and easy-listening pop. We have both been performing music for over two decades, and being musicians is our dream job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May of 2015 we successfully completed a fundraiser to buy a travel trailer and perform music full-time. In June of 2015 we sold most of our possessions, purchased the trailer (a.k.a. the Tiny Musical House), and transitioned to a life on the road with one goal: spread a message of love and equality through great music. We currently travel North America playing our original songs for loving audiences, and we try to connect listeners more deeply with themselves and each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly contribution will help us sustain our life on the road, providing money for routine expenses such as fuel, vehicle maintenance, overnight fees, and food. \u00a0Your commitment will also provide the stability for us to spend time writing and recording new music in between performances. We have even started producing a periodic video series entitled \"Teneia \u0026amp; Ben on the Road,\" which features interviews with other artists and creators, as well as insights into our traveling lifestyle. We want to bring you along on our journey by consistently publishing new music and video content, and with your patronage we can do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider supporting our music and our message, and thank you for taking the time to learn about our passion.\u003cbr\u003e"
