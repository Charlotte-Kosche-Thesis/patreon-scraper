Then they went and started making videos too. They put a lot of time and effort into these podcasts and videos and the relationships they\u0027ve built through them. So now they come to you, hat in hand, to ask for a little help in making them even better. With your support Jake and Josh can make more podcasts, videos, and other cool stuff for you to enjoy!"
