    "summary": "Why? Let\u0027s do this in FAQ fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: All your stuff has been free for so long. Why ask for money now?\u003cbr\u003eA: It\u0027s still free. All the stuff that\u0027s been free will remain free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How will you use the money?\u003cbr\u003eA: Easy Answers: hosting fees, URL-purchase fees, equipment, all this sort of thing. I\u0027ve been operating at a solid loss for...ever. So it\u0027d be nice to break even. \u003cbr\u003eHard Answer:\u00a0It\u0027s about time. If I can make a few bucks, I can work a little less, which gives me more time to make things. It\u0027s about what the money can buy, which is more time to devote to all the projects I\u0027ve got in store.\u00a0If I worked 32 hours instead of 40, I did the math, and there would be about 50% more time in my life to make stuff. That\u0027s HUGE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Do you think you deserve money?\u003cbr\u003eA: It doesn\u0027t really matter what I think. It\u0027s what you think. It\u0027s your money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: You make more money than I do. Why should I pay?\u003cbr\u003eA: Because you want to. If you don\u0027t want to, then I would advise against it. If it\u0027s your opinion that I haven\u0027t earned the money, then don\u0027t provide it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Aren\u0027t there better ways I could donate to save whales or the planet or something?\u003cbr\u003eA: Almost definitely. I\u0027m not trying to take anything away from a good cause. I\u0027m giving everyone an option to compensate me for the stuff I make. Just like any other business or endeavor, I make a thing. Unlike most businesses and endeavors, I do it for free and give you the choice to pay, and to pay not what it\u0027s worth, but what it\u0027s worth to YOU. $2 a month is a different amount depending on how tight your budget is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How do I know the perks are worth it?\u003cbr\u003eA: They aren\u0027t. They are what they are. If you\u0027re donating for the perks, you\u0027re making a mistake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I don\u0027t care for project X that you do, but I like project Y. How can I be sure that my money isn\u0027t going towards something I don\u0027t care about?\u003cbr\u003eA: Money that comes in buys my time back, and I hope to spread that time proportionally amongst the things I do. But I\u0027m a human being, and sometimes my whims and ideas take me onto tracks that aren\u0027t for everyone. It\u0027s a risk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How will this affect me if I donate?\u003cbr\u003eA: You\u0027ll get the perks. And hopefully, you\u0027ll get more of the content you like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How will this affect me if I don\u0027t donate?\u003cbr\u003eA: Almost not at all. However, you\u0027ll miss out on the perks, and you\u0027ll be yet another freeloader suckling at the teat of those more generous than yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: About these bonus pods. Are you going to save your best stuff for these?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: No. BUT, if I reach the end of a month and have to make a choice between releasing the bonus episode or the same episode on the regular feed, it\u0027ll end up as bonus. That\u0027s a promised episode. Them\u0027s the breaks. Money talks. Into microphones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s sorta cheating, setting up a monthly payment instead of doing a one-time thing?\u003cbr\u003eA: I think it makes it much easier to donate, yes. It\u0027s harder to quit something than it is to just let it ride, so I suppose I\u0027m taking advantage of that part of human nature. To the tune of $2 a month. My advice is to start very small, $1 a month, and see how you feel about it after a couple months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: You\u0027re barely making anything. This is sad.\u003cbr\u003eA: It is. For some reason, these things hit a critical mass, and when they do, they tip over into making a lot more money. Right now, I\u0027m just looking to pay a little less to do the things I do, so any small amount really helps me out.\u003cbr\u003e"
