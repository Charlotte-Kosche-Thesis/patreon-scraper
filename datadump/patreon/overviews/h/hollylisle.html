Because I\u0027ve discovered that the only person I\u0027m actually happy working for is ... me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrue for a lot of indies, especially those of us who cannot squeeze ourselves into neat categories and then stay there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write science fiction, fantasy (both high and urban), paranormal suspense romance, and things that nobody including me can precisely describe. Like, ah, weird theosophical humor romance? A.K.A. God turns 200,000-plus devils, demons, and assorted hellspawn loose in North Carolina because someone who truly believed sort of asked him to. (Sold and published back in my commercial days, but the series did not burn up the charts.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, my readers have been asking me to put together a Patreon page,\n because I\u0027m not writing much fiction right now, and they want some new books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want that too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a fast writer, but my best work is long.\u003c/strong\u003e 100,000 words to 200,000 words.

I did. Barely. And it sucked. \u003cstrong\u003eBut when I wrote it, I came home to the place I didn\u0027t know was home. \u003c/strong\u003eAnd in 1991, I sold my first novel to Baen. And then thirty-plus more novels to other big publishers. I went indie a few years ago, because if you get paid twice a year, and you pay bills twice a month, that\u0027s a problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with writing fiction, I write really good classes ABOUT writing and selling fiction professionally, but that part of what I do pays for itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eI want to write fiction every day,\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e but I have to put my time into what pays me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eMore to the point, I have to put it into what pays me monthly, because that\u0027s how often bills show up.

I\u0027ve been writing fantasy and SF novels (and the occasional paranormal suspense romance thriller) since 1991, and full time since 1992. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially, I was commercially published -- more than thirty novels over seventeen years published by Baen, Time-Warner, Tor, Harper Collins, Scholastic, Avon Eos...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I supported a family doing this. Fed us, kept a roof over our heads, kept the bills more or less paid -- and it was the toughest job I ever loved. Tough? Yeah.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause no matter how hard you work and how much your readers love your work, you\u0027re getting paid once or twice a year, and bills come in every few days. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney in twice a year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney out twice a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably see the problem in this model right away. \u003cstrong\u003eIt took me seventeen years, but I eventually spotted it, too.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I created some writing classes to show people how I do what I do, and they\u0027re great classes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I decided to go indie with my fiction so that I could get paid once a month. And I\u0027ve been doing that for some years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, writing how-to-write-and-sell-your-fiction classes became where most of my money is coming from, and where almost all of my work time is going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to be writing FICTION. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery.

Because there just isn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a small but passionate fan base.
