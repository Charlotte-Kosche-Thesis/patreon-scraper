A brief history of my work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMelby Comics had it\u0027s beginning back in High School, by the time I was in college I began making my first Indie Comic, What would eventually become Melby Comics #0.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.heymelby.com/patreon/melby_comics\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs I was drawing Issue one \u003ca href=\"http://www.scleroderma.org/site/PageNavigator/patients_whatis.html#.VprvDSorKhc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eScleroderma\u003c/a\u003e began to rear it\u0027s ugly head. I had had issues before hand but, no doctor could put a name to it. Long story short, Scleroderma was taking my hands from me. Over the next several months my hands went from normal movability to near total loss of function. All the joints stiffened up like rigamortis basically. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eToday they look like this...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.heymelby.com/patreon/hands\" style=\"float: right; width: 358px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eThey haven\u0027t changed much in the\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eten years or so. I\u0027m able to grasp with my thumbs against my fingers, that\u0027s it, the rest done move much at all. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel bad, there are many folks that have it much worse.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt took some time (\u003cem\u003eand alot of Prayer\u003c/em\u003e) but I managed to keep drawing and re-train myself to draw with my newfound restrictions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI self published Melby Comics #1and #2 in 2005 and continued until 2007. I never finished issue 4 which was going to be the first Full color book. People simply did not buy them. I went to a few comic cons here and there, but I was a nobody (still kinda am) and at some point you gotta move on. \u00a0I gave up on printed comics and started my first webcomic \u003ca href=\"http://www.theduckwebcomics.com/Chad_the_Fat_Kid/4923030/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eChad the Fat Kid\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Chad was great, for me personally I was able to vent some repressed anger leftover from high school. Bullying was a consistent theme in Chad\u0027s life and at one point it was the number 2 comic on Drunk Duck!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThen in 2009 \u00a0I left comics altogether. After trying \u00a0some other things I decided to focus on just developing my skills and so my fanart was born. I\u0027d always had a love/hate relationship with my cartooning I wanted to get into realism and so I started digital painting, focusing on likenesses.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/imaginefx\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eImagineFx\u003c/a\u003e magazine became my guidebook.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://heymelby.com/patreon/hulkim\" style=\"width: 282px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eHere you can see two of my early digital paintings, Photoshop is no stranger to me, but I had always used it more like a coloring book filing in black lines. If I learned anything in Art School it was how to teach myself. \u003cem\u003eScleroderma on the other hand, has taught me not to give up but to adapt\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far, thank you. I may write a book some someday, there is so much more to this story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt any rate, I\u0027ll be happy if earn enough to make a few ends meet and I promise to make it worth your while.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
