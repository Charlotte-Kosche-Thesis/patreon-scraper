It\u0027s hard to be funny + draw comics when you\u0027re starving and worried about being stranded in a random city, forced to trade plasma for sandwiches or hustle gas money from vacationers. We like to do odd jobs for the experience, but we\u0027d really rather our comic be about the fun weird stuff that happens to us in nature, not the skanky things we had to do to survive. The money really helps us be productive and stay safe on the journey. Thank you for supporting us.",

When it comes to food, we try to carry cheap, nutritious staples that don\u0027t have to be refrigerated. We buy meat and produce about once a week, keeping our eyes open for sales, and shopping at food outlets along our routes to get the best values.

You can stay on BLM land for next to nothing, if not actual nothing. National Forest camping starts around $10 and can go over $25 in some areas. State and National Park Campgrounds commonly start at $25. None of these prices usually cover power, showers, or park entrance fees. It all depends on where and when you are. We budget for a $20 per night average.",
