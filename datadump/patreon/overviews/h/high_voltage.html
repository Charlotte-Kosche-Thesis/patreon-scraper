Because we\u0027d love to tell you the story of High Voltage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.iamhighvoltage.com\"\u003eHigh Voltage\u003c/a\u003e\n was created by a group of passionate music lovers in the Fall of 2003. \nWe wanted some way to give back to the musicians who were helping us \ndiscover who we were, break us out of our shells and define us. Eventually we branched out from only covering music to \ncovering all types of fandoms \u0026amp; entertainment. Over the years High Voltage has been a print magazine, a radio \nshow on the Independent FM, a web publication, a YouTube series and \neverything in between. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current \nteam that keeps High Voltage afloat dreams to do this for a living, \nfull-time. What we want to do is be able to cover all the events that \nnerds, like us, can\u0027t attend around the world (premieres, conventions, \nconcerts, festivals, etc). We want to bring your favorite musicians and \nactors into your living room via our videos and articles. We want YOU to\n be involved in what we cover and what we ask. We want High Voltage to \nbe for the people, by the people. An outlet that lets those who can\u0027t \nbreak away on their own adventures for whatever reason feel connected to something in this \nworld. We want to provide hope, laughter and joy by sharing\n the arts in ways that haven\u0027t been done yet. Sort of like the way \nTwitter makes you feel connected to your favorite personalities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Your Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIt\u0027s been 14 years since High Voltage started and every year it gets a little bit harder to maintain, financially speaking. We know we have a quality product. We have an audience that we adore. We don\u0027t want to go anywhere, but we need your help to make this a self-sustaining situation that allows to create content full-time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, we could add more advertisements but \u003cstrong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e We aren\u0027t sales people (nor do we want to be) and \u003cstrong\u003e2)\u003c/strong\u003e We hate websites that are covered in ads on the top, left, right, bottom and middle of the article you\u0027re trying to read. Let\u0027s not do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, we\u0027ve come to Patreon to find people who want to be involved in this dream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDo you dream of connecting with a certain actor or musician? Are you a pop culture collector who can\u0027t always make it to the events with the exclusives you want? Do you long for quality over quantity in your products? Or wish that you could attend a certain music festival or comic convention? Have you wanted to be part of the fandom culture you love in a bigger way? Then please, help us make our dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use The Money For\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eReinvesting in High Voltage:\u003c/strong\u003e\n A certain amount of the funds will be allocated to boosting posts on \nFacebook, growing our YouTube channel, MailChimp, \u003ca href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Players-Wanted/\"\u003eMeetup.com\u003c/a\u003e and other \ntypes of marketing that allow us to grow the High Voltage community. \nThen some funds will allow us to purchase and/or upgrade our equipment \nso that we can produce higher quality content. One member of our team \ndoesn\u0027t even own a laptop and writes reviews on a smartphone! Other \nmembers are using laptops so old that Apple considers them \"vintage\" and\n will no longer service them. Then there\u0027s the standard bills like Web \nHosting and Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eCreating Content:\u003c/strong\u003e\n The majority of the funds will allow us to create content on a \nfull-time level. We have dreams of other YouTube series\u0027 and podcasts \nand more we\u0027d love to bring you. Plus live streams from events, etc. But\n while we all work other jobs full-time, our options are limited in \nterms of what we can produce. For example, we have a pile of books to \nreview that stretch from floor to ceiling twice, but no extra time to \nget through more than two a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re just discovering us, here are some highlights from our various YouTube series:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/14BZwJoiRNA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu_jkMkVMVA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmPLVIx5RsU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that\u0027s our story.
