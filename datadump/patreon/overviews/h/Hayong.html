I would like to thank every one of you for even coming on this page. Seriously, it really means a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough it is not the most important thing, I would really like to get my own website set-up. I do have a full-time job, but I also have a family and I am trying to avoid making my son experience any sort of hardship because of my writing. So, this is why I am setting this Patreon up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to get a fully-immersive site set up. I mean, most of my stories are tech, so it just seems appropriate that, one day, I will be able to provide a site where you can feel like you are the main character in all of my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you guys so much. The support and response I have received so far have been beyond anything I have imagined. You guys are really the only reason why I have been able to continue writing, and why I want to keep writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHayong"
