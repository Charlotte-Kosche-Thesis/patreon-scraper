While I haven\u0027t uploaded many, I\u0027m currently working on my first release \"He\u0027s Just Mashing\" which will include covers from a variety of fighting games. I hope to be able to put more time into this one as music has been my passion since I was 9 years old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Wpl0ngc.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are heavily edited, and scripted pieces of fighting game history. Usually I take an old fighting game from my past, record and replay it and generally just to make fun of the game in a variety of ways. This means doing anything from sketches, to having guest appearances from friends on, to me just solely talking to the camera or doing something silly for your entertainment. Most of the time these videos take me the longest amount of time to do, sometimes upwards of 40+ hours and that\u0027s while maintaining a job that takes up a majority of the week. I\u0027ve done\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJESLE3nzmhKnGQIUyXzpBuRADygse_3N\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea few already,\u003c/a\u003e and I hope to make this one of main reason you come to my channel in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to put in perspective how much work goes into one of these I\u0027ll show you a screencap of what my typical project looks like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fnY4eF8.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrazy, there\u0027s so many tracks I can\u0027t fit them all on one page haha. And this one was one of the easier projects. Basically outside of a friend helping me shoot these reviews 100% of the content is recorded, voiced, played by, edited, rendered, and uploaded by me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I guess you\u0027re asking \"well why patreon?\" Well it\u0027s simply because it\u0027s here for creators to use! While I have had people in the past ask if they can donate and I fully accept them over on my Twitch channel, I\u0027ve wanted a place where I can actually justify taking donations for what I do. and Patreon is the perfect platform for that. It allows me to give back to you guys with rewards that I hope are good enough for you to pledge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still trying to figure out what is the best thing to do with this page, even though I\u0027ve had it for a while I\u0027ve never felt justified in advertising it as I\u0027ve never had a well thought out reward system and clear goals. That\u0027s going to change in 2018 and I hope you continue to enjoy my videos, maybe even start watching if you\u0027re new here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for checking out my little patreon page. Whether you donate or not I will continue to make better content and upload quality videos that everyone will enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting guys, take care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
