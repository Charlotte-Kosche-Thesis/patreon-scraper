My stuff is mostly non-explicit cheesecake and I don\u0027t draw weird fetishes, though tasteful nudity is fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards of my Patreon page are intended to give you greater participation in the kind of artwork I produce, and thus they are mostly focused on empowering you to vote on which sketches I will develop into full works. With your backing I can devote more time and effort into making my drawings. I get financially supported, and you get more drawings of cute girls. Everyone wins!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal that as support for my art increases, I can add new reward tiers and funding goals. My philosophy behind this page is that it is not a store for selling you access to look at my art. It\u0027s still my goal for my published art to be available to everyone, although by supporting me you can get some extra perks, such as new ways to influence my work and new ways to enjoy my finished images. And more importantly, you will be funding the time I need to work on my art, so I can bring more of it to you!"
