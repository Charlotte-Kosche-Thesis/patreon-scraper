So some of you may be asking \"Why are you guys even on Patreon? Your videos are fine as they are now!\"\u003cbr\u003eFirst off: No they\u0027re not.

Have you seen our first 10 videos? Yeah, we\u0027ve come a long way.\u003cbr\u003eBut we need more than just experience to make these videos, we also need better tools. Starting out we\u0027ve learned to do with what we have and do the best job we can with that. In fact, we still use Premiere Elements and Photoshop Elements 9 to create all our content.\u003cbr\u003eBut if we could afford new gear and software, we\u0027d not only be able to improve the content we create, but we\u0027d also be able to make new content \u003cem\u003efaster! \u003c/em\u003eWhich brings us to the next point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#2 - Making More Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating these videos and podcasts takes a lot of time.
