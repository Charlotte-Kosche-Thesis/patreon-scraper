I\u0027ve wanted to figure out how to make assisting people in need stable/sustainable for myself since it\u0027s largely out of pocket right now (Sometimes you just need cash to buy items, even if they\u0027re REALLY cheap!), and Patreon came to mind - what an amazing community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating a blog or stream of the people I help is something I\u0027ve wanted to do for a long time. Patreon provides the perfect platform for this dream to become a reality, and for people everywhere to get involved and make a difference, regardless how difficult it may seem.\u003cbr\u003eMoney goes towards things like food, school supplies for children, furniture for struggling families, etc."
