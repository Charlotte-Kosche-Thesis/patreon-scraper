     "about": "\u003cbr\u003eWhen a pretty significant death/trauma hit our family, I eventually found my escape again into pots in 2014 at the Chehalem Cultural Center pottery studio.\u00a0 Because I wanted to work on pots more often than they were open, and because they were an art gallery first, there was a parting of ways which caused grief that surprised me, as clay had helped me cope with so much falling apart.\u00a0 My wheel in the dining room purchased in 2015 was tolerated by my husband, but he didn\u0027t love it, and I was making a mess. The kiln in the garage sent the message that this was really happening.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne spring, he built me a pottery shed in the back corner of the yard.\u00a0 All the creating that I had been doing since 2015 finally was able to be processed, glazed fired etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI missed the community of the pottery studio.\u00a0 As an educator I saw how clay work not only heals, but it provides an escape and is constructive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted the pottery shed to not be just for me, but for whoever else wanted to create.\u00a0 I dreamt that perhaps I could cultivate a community of creators in my town.\u00a0 Few things give me more joy than encouraging people in creating and appreciating the small interesting things children make, as well as giving them a place to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have had one clay party on the back patio of the creating space and I hope that we will be able to have more.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
