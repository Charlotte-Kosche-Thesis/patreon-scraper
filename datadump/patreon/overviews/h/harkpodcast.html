    "summary": "Hello all you Herald Angels and welcome to the HARK Patreon page! \u003ca href=\"http://harkpodcast.com\"\u003eHARK\u003c/a\u003e is a \u003cstrong\u003eyear-round holiday music podcast\u003c/strong\u003e in which your hosts, \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/rjmakes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRJ Edwards\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/Ian_Holliday\"\u003eIan Holliday\u003c/a\u003e, listen to every Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, New Year\u0027s, winter, holiday, etc. song, review them, and rank them from best to worst in an ever-growing list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn some episodes we dissect the worst of the worst Yule-themed audio garbage for your entertainment, and in some episodes we get teary-eyed about music that touches us, transports us, and inspires us to be our best selves. Sometimes that\u0027s the same episode. We\u0027ve been doing it every week for nearly three years, and we\u0027re not anywhere close to running out of songs to talk about. We\u0027ve launched this Patreon so that we might be able to make the show self-sustaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we create the show every week at a loss. We love doing it, but that\u0027s the financial reality. We\u0027ve never had ads or sponsors. We know that talking about holiday music year-round is always going to be a niche, and Patreon made sense as the best way to fund a show like ours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re incredibly grateful for the folks who have embraced our cheerful little niche and supported the show in a variety of ways over the years. When you support HARK on Patreon for just $1/month, we\u0027ll say a personal thank you in an episode. If you donate just $2/month, you\u0027ll get access to bonus audio content - outtakes from the show, and exclusive mini-episodes on holiday-related topics (food, movies, books, and more). If you\u0027re able to support us at $5/month, we will send you a holiday card from the two of us every December. Like, a real one, in the real mail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening, thank you for your support, and as always... happy holidays!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/7182b7317e2bd6a8ba8ca12e49567852/tumblr_nzqbulUNlh1u6c2v1o1_400.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Pictured above: RJ, Ian, and the world\u0027s tallest living Christmas tree)\u003cbr\u003e"
