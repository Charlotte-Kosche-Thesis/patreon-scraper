I am a musician, multidisciplinary artist, explorer, entrepreneur, et al.  As of 2018, I am FINALLY choosing to let music and art take center stage as I create audio and visual salves for the soul.  I am pouring my playful lil heart into this project in hopes that these seeds that bring me such a harvest of happiness might bring joy to you as well.  I am inviting you to be an interactive part of this creative journey, to be my patrons, My Veggies, my creative support, helping ME to make content for YOU to enjoy at your leisure with pleasure.  In a world so fixated on the ugly and divisive, let\u2019s come together and make something beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow Does Patreon Work?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nFirstly, I\u0027m honored that you would want to support what I\ndo!  Patreon functions similarly to\nKickstarter, but instead of a large sum of money going toward a single project,\nit represents small, reoccurring \u201ctips\u201d for each output (in this case, for each\nmusic video).  If you are into it, please\nconsider supporting a dollar (or more!) per video that I upload \u2013 I aim to\npost 2 music videos per month to begin.  If\nyou\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can set a monthly\nmaximum during the signup process. I never want you to go beyond your means,\nand I appreciate every one of you regardless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nRight now, I am doing this on my own, and your patronage\naffords me the time to focus on creating content, recording music, shooting and\nediting video, and creating pieces for DanDannDesigns.  The funds from the project will make it\npossible for me to acquire proper recording equipment and software for better\nquality videos and to begin building the mobile pop-up shop/stage.  With you along, I can finally focus on MAKING\ngreat music and art, for YOU! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eBenefits for My Veggies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u2022 Early Access to new uploads\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Exclusive access the Patron-only feed\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Exclusive access to online performances and chats\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Access song downloads \u0026amp; chord charts \u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Vote on new music\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Get discounts on DanDannDesigns\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 See your name in video credits\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Receive annual personalized videos \u003cbr\u003e\u2022 See your name or business name etched into the wood of the pop-up shop\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Hang out with DanDann in person\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Gardener Trolley\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nSince my underlying goal is to inspire community, my desire is to\ncreate a space that invites others to witness creative efforts, to share their\nown creativity and to collaborate with fellow creators.  I have thought of hundreds of ways to do\nthis, and even considered renting a fixed storefront and venue in Valencia,\nbut y\u2019all know I can\u2019t do anything normal. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith a little influence from my days as a bicycletaxi driver,\nmy dream now is to create a little Gardener Trolley, or rather, a booth on\nwheels, which can function as both a mobile store for my curios, and as a mobile\nperformance venue.  Imagine a bicycle\nattached to a rolling pop-up shop with garden lights, a sound system, the whole\nshebang.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe majority of the art in the pop-up shop and music\nperformed will be mine, but various artists may also be featured at any given time. One day,\nthere may be a solo performance by me on the beach boardwalk.  Another evening, I may invite a full jazz\nband to perform in the park, complete with Lindy Hoppers.  Another evening may feature an open mic in\nsome architecturally fascinating plaza in the old city.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach performance will be filmed and shared, first with you,\nMy Veggies, and then with the larger community. \nPerhaps, some of these performances will even be live, although, such footage\nwould initially be without subtitles \u2013 I can only multi-task so much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSharing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u201cCommunity\u201d has been a running theme through my\nendeavors, and this project is no different. \nAs such, 10% of each donation will be going toward an organization that\nalso helps to foster creativity and community. \nAs My Veggies, you will be able to vote on which organizations to\nsponsor each season.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThank You\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nWhile my art and music are meaningful to me, the fact that they\nmean something to YOU makes them all the more worthwhile.  I create art in an effort to understand and express\nemotion, and knowing that you are out there understanding, feeling, and sharing\nmeans the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf supporting my creation in this way is not something that\nyou can or want to do right now, that is fine! \nMy music and videos will be released as normal, and my art will be out\nthere waiting for you.  There will always\nbe some way for you to get involved when you are ready.  My ultimate goal is to foster a sense of\ncommunity, and my medium right now is art and music.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for believing in me, all of you.  \u003cstrong\u003eAnd to\nyou, those Special Someones who have truly pushed and pulled me when I thought\nI couldn\u2019t take another step on my own, thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e  Thank you. \nI wish I could even begin to express what your support has meant to me.  But for now, thank you.  All of you. \nThank you for\nmaking my art possible, for being my support, my family, My Veggies.
