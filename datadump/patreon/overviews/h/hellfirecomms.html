You\u0027ve arrived on the Patreon page for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hellfirecomms\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHellfireComms\u003c/a\u003e - the internet\u0027s #353646356th Let\u0027s Play and Commentary group. We love to talk (especially over games and movies) and we\u0027ve been doing it for almost \u003cstrong\u003eten years \u003c/strong\u003eat the time of writing.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eOur commentary style is a mix of riff (similar to Mystery Science Theater 3000) and review while trying to maintain a tonal balance of lighthearted commentary with critical analysis. In addition to this we\u0027ve helped to raise over $50,000 for various charities around the world and supported such causes as Child\u0027s Play (a group dedicated to providing children in hospital with games and games consoles to ease their stay), and MIND - the mental health charity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly though, with all the games and such that are required to run every aspect of the group, coupled with dwindling ad revenue rates across YouTube (and other factors) it\u0027s currently impossible for us to do more than we\u0027re currently doing on our own. As such, we\u0027ve decided to turn to Patreon, and to you, the viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant videos early? Want exclusive Q+A sessions with NTom (we\u0027re sorry in advance) or other fun perks? Well, we\u0027re giving you the option to support us in exchange for all this and more. With our Patrons backing us, we\u0027ll be able to bring you twice as much content as ever before while being held accountable by the people funding these endeavors.\u00a0This won\u0027t replace regular uploads on YouTube, but it\u0027ll be something to help us along in regards to purchasing new equipment, games, or just helping out in a pinch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve lots of good stuff planned for the rest of 2017 and beyond, so be the first to pledge and see the new HFC content before anyone else!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
