I didn\u2019t have any expectations for my vlog. It was more of a way for me to reflect on my journey and track my progress as a newbie entrepreneur. However, in sharing my struggles, insights, knowledge, and experiences, I\u2019ve discovered my capability as a creator and vlogger. \u003cstrong\u003eOver 150 videos, 117,000 views, and 2,660 subscribers later, I\u2019ve realized that what I create inspires and empowers so many people from all walks of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/heatherjustcreate\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick here to visit my YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSince becoming an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to help more people than I ever thought I could.
