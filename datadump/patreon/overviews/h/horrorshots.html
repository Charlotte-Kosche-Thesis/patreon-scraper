    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Horror Shots?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s an excellent question. I\u0027ll start with who I am. My name is Casey, and I\u0027m sort of a jack of all trades and a master of none - at least that\u0027s what some would say. I\u0027m a photographer, a writer, and a podcaster, but ultimately I\u0027m a guy with an insatiable thirst for horror. That goes hand in hand with my government issued Private Investigators license, in a sense. Why is that important? Well, it gives me the skill set to look into mysteries and cases associated with the topics I research for my podcasts. \u003cbr\u003eNow, why Horror Shots the name? That goes back to my photography background, where I specialize in spooky and scary pictures, usually involving models, sometimes props. It\u0027s a passion of mine, and it\u0027s still an art that I\u0027m perfecting. With that said, I\u0027ve been doing it for the better part of a decade, so I don\u0027t think I\u0027m awful at it either! :D\u003cbr\u003eI do like to keep my art tasteful, but that does also include some nude works, some sexy, but all classy. These shots will mainly be for the middle and upper tier patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Subscribe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, subscribing is 100% totally up to you. But what it does is help me produce higher quality and more frequent content. Models are expensive, and these podcasts are very time consuming. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love all aspects of what I do, but working minimum wage at full time hours doesn\u0027t bring in a lot of disposable income, nor leave me with a lot of time to spend on these projects. If you like what you hear, read, or see, please lend me your support. It would be beyond appreciated, and honestly, it would bring a tear to my eye every time I see a new sub come in. Also, I\u0027ll release hidden content for patrons periodically, this may be new photos, unreleased short stories, and/or transcripts from my latest cast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAgain, that is completely up to you. I have incentives for you ranging from shout outs and transcripts, to photo prints, and even digital or physical copies of of my books! Plus, you get to hear some interesting podcasts, and see some spooky, creepy, and downright scary pictures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRegardless of your decision on subscribing, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking a look at my page, checking out my website, or having a listen to my cast. Support comes in more than just a monetary form, it comes from you just having a listen or a look. So thank you, really. It means more than you could ever know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully I\u0027ll be able to do an intro video in the near future. Again, time constraints have been near crippling lately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
