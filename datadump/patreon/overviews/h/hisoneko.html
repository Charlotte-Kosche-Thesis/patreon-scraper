    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHELLO AND WELCOME\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d just like to start off by saying that I will in no way, shape or form EVER stop posting the content I do now on any of my current networking platforms! There is absolutely no pressure to support my Patreon, and all those who have supported me with their comments, likes and encouragement throughout the past 2 years mean just as much to me. I created this specifically for those who have asked if there is a way to support what I do in a financial sense, and in turn can receive rewards for their support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that that\u0027s out of the way, my name is Tessa! I am better known as Hisoneko, a cosplayer from Portland, Oregon here in the US. I started this journey about 2 years ago now when I vaguely got my hair cut like Mikasa Ackerman and decided to cosplay her at my first ever convention, Sakuracon. I fell in love with the people, the environment, the feeling it gave me, and from that weekend forward cosplaying become my most beloved hobby and a way to express myself and my creativity in a way I could share with others!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn all honesty, I really and I mean REALLY struggled with making one for many months. I was apprehensive about how it would be perceived, and didn\u0027t want people to think they owed me anything other than the support they already provide. With much encouragement from my followers, friends and family, I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s worth a shot! When it comes down to it, cosplay is an art form and like any other art it deserves to be supported by those who want the option to. Cosplay can be very expensive, and having patrons means I will be able to afford crafting materials (such as worbla/EVA foam, fabric), wigs, makeup, full costumes (if it\u0027s beyond my crafting ability), etc. much more readily than I can with my one current job! It also means more time can go into creating content, sharing my progress with you and hopefully in the future make tutorials and travel to more conventions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing platform because it will allow me to give back to those who support me in any way that I can, and that\u0027s what made me decide to make one in the end. Whether or not you choose to become a patron, thank you so much for taking the time to read this! I appreciate it more than I can properly express!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA NOTE ABOUT CHARGE UP-FRONT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharging up front means when you become a patron, you will be charged immediately and subsequently on the 1st of every month after! To get the most out of your experience, pledge on the 1st of the month rather than the end, because you will be charged again at the beginning. If your financial situation changes or you decide it\u0027s not for you, be sure to delete your pledge before the 1st!\u00a0"
