    "summary": "Welcome! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Joel Byars and I am the creator and\nhost of Hot Breath! Podcast. Friends like you have helped me develop an awesome\ncommunity, or what I like to call the Hot Breathiverse. Whether you have been a\nfaithful listener since the beginning or if you have recently discovered my\npodcast, I want to say thank YOU! This\npodcast is special thanks to my listeners and to folks like you who are jumping\nin to help me along in my journey. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUntil now, Hot Breath! Podcast has been an\naudio only experience for my listeners. While I gladly invest around 15 hours of my time each week to\nprovide you with the best content possible, I have found an opportunity for you\nto join me in transforming the podcast you know and love into an interactive\ncommunity and an audio-visual experience. How cool would it be for you to not\nonly hear my interview with influential creators but for you to be able to see\nit as if you were there with us? I know\nI\u2019m excited about this possibility, and I think you will be too. Thanks to the\ngenerosity of supporters like you, this could soon become a reality for all of\nus. Will you join me in transforming our\ncommunity?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet me tell you a little more about me and how\nthis podcast was created. In the summer of 2015, Hot Breath! Podcast started as a platform to\nhighlight Atlanta comedians on Last Comic Standing. It has since evolved into a weekly journey of\nlearning from accredited experts in a range of professions including: comedy, social\nmedia and branding, photography, and entrepreneurship. Combined, a vast array of creators share the inspirational\npursuit of their passions and confide in the listener the insights and tips\nthey\u2019ve accumulated along the way. Every Monday you can rely on Hot Breath! to\nprovide well researched and insightful interviews with inspiring people. How\nbetter to get your educating entertainment than directly from the source?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs we now surpass 100 episodes, or Hot\nBreathisodes, my goal with Patreon is to create a collective experience\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efor listeners through interactive\nvideos, secret podcasting tips and fun behind the scenes footage. While I have\ngladly invested my time and resources into creating this podcast, I need your\nhelp to take my vision to the next level. Whether you are able to contribute $5 or $500, I will be tremendously\ngrateful for your support. It\u2019s friends\nlike you who will help make Hot Breath! a more robust experience for this\ncommunity and will expand all that I am able to offer you, my Hot-Breatheren\nand Hot-Sisteren. It\u2019s only with\nyour support that I will be able to document these one-of-a-kind interviews so\nthat you can go from being a fly on the wall to having a seat at the table with\nus!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI genuinely appreciate your generosity\nand guarantee you will see and hear your contributions at work every\nweek. Thank you for your part in transforming the Hot Breathiverse and\nhelping me bring you the best product possible. I couldn\u2019t do it without you! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you, \u003cbr\u003e\nJoel Byars\u003cbr\u003e"
