Over the last few years I have hiked - a lot - and I spend most of the year out in the backwoods and deserts of California working on building routes for new hiking trails - I do not get paid for it, it is simply a passion of mine. I have two trails I am currently working on, a 250-mile trail through the heart of the Mojave Desert in Southern California, and a trail that will be about 700 miles located in Northern California that will be on established trails, a bunch of wilderness hiking, and even involve some pack rafting! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have been publishing articles on the topic of \u003cem\u003ehiking lighter\u003c/em\u003e over at my website \u003ca href=\"https://hikelighter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehikelighter.com\u003c/a\u003e for the last five years, and at another website \u003cem\u003e(no longer online)\u003c/em\u003e before that for about three years. Even though I spend a lot of time out on the trail, I try my best to publish about 30 article a year, and I currently have over 150 posted articles at this point. I am also very active on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HikeLighter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efacebook page\u003c/a\u003e throughout the year.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSome of my articles are \u003cem\u003ehighly detailed\u003c/em\u003e articles that become de facto resources for hikers around the world - including articles on the lightest fully enclosed solo shelters on the market, the lightest two-person fully enclosed shelters, and I am pretty sure that nobody has published more about Dyneema Composite Fabric \u003cem\u003e(formerly Cuben Fiber)\u003c/em\u003e products than what I have over the years - ranging from tents to garments to industry insider interviews!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am also one of the very few people in the world that publishes articles on outdoor gear that are \u003cem\u003etruly\u003c/em\u003e \u0027long-term use reviews.\u0027 I have articles where I have used a piece of gear for 1000, 1200, even 15000+ days of use. I want to be able to share even more long-term use reviews each year, but wow is it hard to accomplish. Not a lot of gear out there that can last that long, and not a lot of gear out there that I \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to use for that long!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am also \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HikeLighter/videos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon youtube\u003c/a\u003e, though to be honest, doing videos is just not my thing all that much. I do try to get a couple of videos out each year, but to call them \u0027good quality\u0027 is not something I would even be willing to admit to. I tend to approach my youtube videos as just \"\u003cem\u003ehey, here are some thoughts\u003c/em\u003e\" and not so much anything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFine print notes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider this my \u0027\u003cem\u003edisclaimer\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 of such.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring a good part of the year, I am out hiking or working on new hiking trails, and I simply cannot commit to posting something of significant value during those months. Long distance hiking and trail routing are what they are... a tiresome ordeal, mixed in with some amazing places, views, and people... but the honesty has to be, well, honest. There may be times when I am just not able to get something of value posted. I suppose that is the \"risk factor\" in becoming a patron of mine here on Patreon. Usually, around August to September of each year, I start scaling back my time on-trail and from there until March or April is when I do a good part of my detailed writing. I spend those months planning the next year\u0027s adventures, working on new products to bring to market, writing up articles on gear I have been using, and all that good stuff. Those of you who follow me on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HikeLighter/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efacebook page\u003c/a\u003e hopefully knows how the cycle goes for me! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlso, there are times when some of my articles are such that I just cannot do \u0027early access\u0027 with them - for example, when I am doing a product release announcement with a company that is bringing a product to market on a specific date, and the article has to be published on a specific date. Such situations prevent me from doing early releases. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd just to define \u0027early access\u0027... well, that can be anywhere between a few hours to a week or more - it will all depend on how important \u003cem\u003e(or not)\u003c/em\u003e it is that I get something published on my website - it is rarely something is super urgent, but it does happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Sponsorship:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get asked a lot if I get a bunch of free gear from my sponsors and the answer to that is no. I receive very little in-production gear for free from my sponsors - probably about 1% of the in-production gear that I have I received for free - so the question is a rather moot issue/point for me. I do know of other athletes that receive a massive amount of their gear for free from their sponsors, however as my sponsors can confirm, the majority of the time I just prefer to buy my gear. \u003cem\u003eTo me, sponsorship is about having the ability to work closely with companies and not about getting free gear.\u003c/em\u003e Read more on my website page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hikelighter.com/sponsored-hiking/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSponsored Hiking\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThanks everybody!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+John Abela \u003cbr\u003eHikeLighter.Com"
