I\u0027ve been a software developer for a long time, and have created and participated in a multitude of personal projects, as well as having worked under contract with Sega on the Sonic the Hedgehog brand\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy primary focus is the \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.headcannon.com/HCGE\"\u003eHeadcannon Game Engine\u003c/a\u003e, which is already available for use while its development continues. For more details regarding all of my projects, please visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.headcannon.com\"\u003ethe Headcannon website\u003c/a\u003e, as well as its sub-section for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.headcannon.com/hchc\"\u003emy personal hobby projects\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you using Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.headcannon.com/Patreon/stealth-pc.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nBasically, I want to make this \"my job\".

Then please consider helping me continue to do it! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe funds I receive from Patreon will be used to cover daily living expenses first-of-all, plus any additional equipment/services for my projects, and then, indeed, anything else I may need/want (What else do you use money for?). Every cent that I don\u0027t have to earn from somewhere else gives me that much more time to spend on developing the things that you and I both enjoy!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said, if another desirable opportunity presents itself, I may take another contract job (and thus, temporarily suspend personal projects). In that case, you should feel free to reduce or delete your pledge for its duration as you see fit. Any funds I receive from Patreon while on a contract will be considered \"a tip\" (given specifically to myself), and will add up to help fill in \"gaps\" of low-to-no income (Note that these contracts tend to generate one-time \"milestone\" payments - I don\u0027t receive recurring \"royalties\"/\"commission\"/etc)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to send a one-time tip through PayPal?
