    "summary": "This is a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://historyofgreecepodcast.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emonthly podcast about Ancient Greece\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e from the Paleolithic to \nthe Battle of Actium. It alternates between history and historical \nmethodology, i.e. how we know what we know. started this podcast because I wanted to create a history of Greece that would parallel the wonderful and engaging \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHistory of Rome\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n podcast that I enjoyed so much when I studied for my Roman history \ncomprehensive exam. My aim here is to provide a detailed, but \naccessible, account of the history of Greece. The podcast form offers \nthe opportunity to move beyond the various constraints by which a class \non the same subject would be bound. I also hope to offer a story that \ncan stand on its own without requiring supplementary reading. However, I\n will provide a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://historyofgreecepodcast.wordpress.com/overall-bibliography/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebibliography\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for those who are interested as well as a list of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://historyofgreecepodcast.wordpress.com/supplementary-resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esupplementary resources\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love making this podcast! It\u0027s a joy to write and research. I also love having the opportunity to reach out to people in the field and ask them about their work, and make what I hear about accessible to the public. However, this podcast takes a lot of time and effort to create. I am trying to keep up to date on the newest research, which is difficult in fields that are advancing at a rapid pace based on new discoveries and techniques \u00a0as well as fields which are way outside the scope of my training. The podcast also requires equipment, hosting, and research materials (my university library is good, but it sometimes fails to have the resources I need). I also need to provide some compensation for those people who have generously offered their help along the way. Pledges help me do all of these things and fund my habit of buying those books which I really desire or to which the library affords me limited, difficult, or no access. I am hoping to use pledges in the future to also help fund travel so that I can meet with scholars in the field and bring in more original research from hard-to-access sources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease come visit the podcast at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://historyofgreecepodcast.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehistoryofgreecepodcast.wordpress.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and check it out on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/history-of-greece\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play Music, TuneIn Radio, and Podcast Republic.\u003cbr\u003e"
