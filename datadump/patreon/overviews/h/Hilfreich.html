    "summary": "My goal for life is to create something new everyday. Literally \nanything. Draw a line one day - and the next paint over it. Keep \nbuilding. Decorate time with music,\u00a0and space with prints, paintings, illustrations, digital, sculpture, crafts, collages, videos (seriously too much stuff).\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a bachelor\u0027s degree in Fine art so I have an appreciation for those works, and do them often. I also am an event dj and/or emcee. I enjoy organizing small or larger events for the community - different reasons for different events and times. I produce and commission other artists to collaborate and make something fun, and cool. I\u0027ve organized an international print exchange with 26 artists. Always trying to do more (beginning to think \u003cem\u003emore \u003c/em\u003eabout doing \u003cstrong\u003eless\u003c/strong\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I am a creator, and I\u0027ve fallen into this crisis we all seem to be in with money. Stocks going up and down - they somehow effect me, so that is why I am here asking for support from this earth community. Those who are, have been or know an artist know that in order to create with freedom, a\u00a0 sense of freedom is required. Freedom to create without the pressure of others \"needing to like\" your work in order from them to appreciate it and purchase it. I\u0027m seeking this freedom again. I had it momentarily when I was a student in Germany, but have since lost the physical reality of that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLater in 2018 a little after the new year, I wish to travel to New York City with colleagues from Art School and then from JFK fly to Japan to learn how to make paper, calligraphy, and also study the culture. I would really love to be there studying for 3-6 months. Please join me on this journey :D \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and Love to all those out there\u003cbr\u003e"
