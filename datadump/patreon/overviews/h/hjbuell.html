Not one of them had a clue that we were about to shoot. I suppose if the taxi driver was smart, he would have left, but he wasn\u0027t.

In part because they are often a source of inspiration for me, but also because if you\u0027re a patron it\u0027s important for you to know that a lot more goes into my writing process than me just sitting down at a desk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put up quite a bit about me on Patreon, and will be adding more as time passes.
