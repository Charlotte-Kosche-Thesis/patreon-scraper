    "summary": "ABSTRACT\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-five years ago, while getting a\nscience degree, I also attended film school. Life took me in other\ndirections for a couple decades. Fifteen years ago, I returned to\nthat passion for filmmaking and helped others make their films.\nDuring that time, I wrote a stack of my own scripts. Some have done\nvery well in contests (top 10% more than once.)  Several years ago, I\nbecame disabled and my income shriveled up.  I can barely make ends\nmeet, let alone pursue my artistic endeavors. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are crowd-funding platforms for\nfunding the films themselves, but I also need a steady amount of\nextra income to keep my car operational, buy some supplies (I also\npaint, when I can), pay for software upgrades, and fill those gaps\nwhich project funding doesn\u0027t cover. I would love to be able to\nafford an exceptional sale of film gear (where a fellow artist is\nbuying new equipment and clearing out their old). So I am appealing\nto any benefactors who could help me turn out one short film after\nanother. These short films will be posted for free viewing up on\nYouTube and other venues. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDETAILS\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve loved watching movies my whole\nlife.  Stories fill my mind. But I also love science. I was a science\nnerd and a fan of sci-fi. I watched the original Star Trek episodes\nwhen they first aired.  Since movies were made only in several places\nback then (and I was no where near those), I went for a degree in\nscience. My first job after graduating was at the university itself.\nThe pay was paltry but I could take courses at a tiny fraction of the\nregular cost. So I took film and photography classes. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA series of life events happened before\nI got more than half way through the film curriculum. I married, and\ntook jobs in the manufacturing automation industry. Some of the work\ninvolved travel and extensive stays at the work site. My spouse and I\ngrew apart and we ended the marriage mutually and equitably. More\njobs followed. I also did some vol. FF/EMT services.  (It runs in the\nfamily.) Then, my father passed away (he had developed cancer from\nworking in the steel mills).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt my mother\u0027s request I returned home\nto help her out, eventually becoming her caregiver. I had been\nworking part-time jobs, such as instructing at a community college.\nThere I found another passion - writing. I was always dyslexic, but\nin-line spell checking was a huge benefit! I sold several short\nstories and began writing film scripts as well. After my mother\npassed away, I thought I\u0027d be able to resume full-time work and get\nback on my feet again. That didn\u0027t happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI continued to write while working\npart-time. I did jobs such as scanning and sorting parcels at FedEx\nor UPS. I started to volunteer on student and independent film\nprojects when I could. I never felt more in my element than on a\nmovie set. A brief writing partnership led to the brief publication\nof a novel. One of our two scripts did well in one of the top movie\nindustry writing contests, the PAGE Awards, where we made it to the\ntop 10% of thousands of entries. I started entering my own scripts\ninto other contests. Half the time they did well, getting into the\ntop 20% and even 5%. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was gaining confidence in my writing.\nBut then my hip blew out while doing yard work and things went\ndownhill from there. Other ailments reared their ugly heads.  My\ndoctors convinced me that I should apply for disability. That process\ntook over a year to finalize, with a federal judge agreeing with\ndoctors that I was unemployable. Disability payments keep me from\nbeing homeless, but not much more than that. Paying the necessary\nbills doesn\u0027t leave much for making movies. Yes, there are\ncrowd-funding websites, and I have tried several. But it\u0027s difficult\nto get people to invest if you have nothing to show them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have continued to write and so far\nhave a growing stack of scripts (around 25 as of this writing.) I\u0027ve\nbeen working at finding an agent. Studios don\u0027t buy scripts directly\nfrom writers - you have to have an agent.  But even to get an agent\nyou have to be referred by someone in the industry. Doing well in\ncontests alone isn\u0027t enough. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think if I can finish 3 to 5\nprojects, then I could get crowd-funding for more projects. But I\nneed those first several projects. Here are some of those starting\ncosts -\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCopyrighting scripts, $35 each,\n\tthrough the US Library of Congress. They say you should not send out\n\ta script without copyright protection. I have yet to copyright all\n\tmy scripts. \n\t\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eKeeping the old car I have up and\n\trunning. To pass inspection, it needs exhaust work and two new\n\ttires. And I need help with buying fuel and car insurance.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eInsurance for the film projects.\n\tIt\u0027s highly recommended to have some insurance in case someone gets\n\thurt, or drops a camera down a manhole. Most locations require proof\n\tof insurance. \n\t\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eKeeping up with software. A\n\tgrowing number of companies no longer sell their software. They rent\n\tit out by the month. And it\u0027s cheaper to pay by the year, than by\n\tthe month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying for online cloud storage. \n\tFilm footage can take up gigabytes of storage space. Online cloud\n\tstorage is the easiest way to get movie clips to an editor or music\n\tcomposer. It\u0027s also an excellent form of data backup.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReplacing gear as it gets worn out\n\tor broken.  Most of the gear I have has been previously used. \n\t\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEntering finished projects in film\n\tfestivals. Most film festivals have entry fees. Winning awards can\n\tmake it easier to secure funding for future projects.  \n\t\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuying props, wardrobe, and gear\n\tof opportunity. I buy a lot of these items at thrift stores, but\n\teven those purchases add up.  (I\u2019ve had some incredible finds at\n\tthrift stores, such as a 1960s Geiger counter, a complete army\n\tuniform, a SCUBA wet suit, and a vintage Japanese geisha dress).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd other costs for details that\n\tincrease the film\u0027s production values. \n\t\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA steady flow of modest income would\ngreatly boost my ability to make an equally steady stream of short\nfilms. These films would be made publicly available. Other filmmakers\ncould even use them as background elements for their own films, such\nas something playing on a television. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is a list of some of my scripts,\nall of which have done well in contests. Other scripts have yet to be\nentered into any contests as I can\u0027t afford that right now. Making a\nfilmon my current income puts everything else on hold. It would be\ngreat if I didn\u0027t have to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nWHAT YOU KNOW (96-pages, crime thriller)\u003cbr\u003e[2015 Screencraft Action\n\u0026amp; Thriller screenplay contest semi-finalist (top 5%)]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nQUESTERS (feature, medieval fantasy, co-written)\u003cbr\u003e[2014 PAGE Awards\nquarter-finalist (top 10%)]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nSMALL BLUE (123-pages, science fiction)\u003cbr\u003e[2015 Scriptapalooza\nScience Fiction screenplay contest quarter-finalist (top\n20%)]\u003cbr\u003e[Zoetrope 3rd highest reviewed screenplay for the month of\nNov. 2014]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nMECHANITY pilot (60-pages, science fiction) (aka UNITY)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n[2015 Screencraft Pilot Launch teleplay contest quarter-finalist.\n(top 20%)]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nSICKLE MOON (112-pages, horror)\u003cbr\u003e[2015 Screencraft Horror\nscreenplay contest quarter-finalist (top 20%)]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would really appreciate it if you\ncould help make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHenry Tjernlund\u003c/p\u003e"

I will risk telling you that I\u0027m disabled.\nNo, don\u0027t automatically think wheelchair. Not all disabilities are\nvisible. Mine is madness. At least so agree my doctors (yes, plural)\nand a federal judge. In fact my one doctor discourages me from using\nself-deprecating (is that a hyphenated word?) humor.
