In fact, up until the day she was magically transformed into the G-Girl, our Billi Jayne was a teenaged \u003cem\u003eboy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.heroicmultiverse.com/patreon/ggirl_covers.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eDuring the course of her several appearances in issues of Heroic Publishing\u0027s \u003cem\u003eChampions\u003c/em\u003e comic book, and more recently in her own magazine, Billi Jayne has had to deal with a wide variety of peculiar and dangerous adversaries, including the abominable Ogre, the sinister Spiderbaby, the Maul Rat King, the Norse god of mischief Loki, and the super-stretchy Rubber-Band Man, all the while having to do deal with the consequences of suddenly becoming an extraordinarily attractive young woman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the other part of it is that at the same time this happened to her, the villains who transformed Billi Jayne into a girl also kidnapped her superhero mother, the Nemesis Girl. It\u0027s a coming of age adventure combined with a classic quest. Everything else aside, the G-Girl\u0027s mission is to find the bad guys, rescue her mom, wreak vengeance upon the evil doers, and figure out whether or not she might actually be happier as a girl than she ever was as a boy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis adventure will play out over the next few years across issues of \u003cem\u003eSensational G-Girl\u003c/em\u003e and other Heroic Publishing comic book titles. Your support for this endeavor will be greatly \nappreciated. There are a lot of great rewards available for the G-Girl\u0027s backers, so come on board and help our young heroine complete her rather remarkable quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
