    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there! \u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Harris Dixon. I\u0027ve come along way from struggling to find my place in what I consider the long term for my life. I\u0027ve been writing since I was little around 10 years old, filling notebook after notebook with weird sci-fi short stories that came into my small little mind. Now as an adult and still having a starving passion for writing, I want to continue that childhood dream of mine and publish actual works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy helping me with my Patreon you will be directly contributing to supporting me as I write what I hope to be a series of novels revolving around a grand story I\u0027ve had growing in my mind over the last couple of years. I have spent many years writing short stories for myself to get ideas out of my mind and on paper, but now as I realize I would like to start a career, I feel this is the most opportune moment for me to try to achieve that dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I am working on what I plan to be a series focusing on a group of kids living in a Dystopian future, in which humans now have the gift of telekinesis. Over the years the world government, afraid for their own safety, has begun attempting to suppress the outbreaks of humans given this ability, going as far as declaring them non-human. This resulting in them to be disposed of them for the safety of humanity. The group of kids mentioned are considered last of the first generation. They aren\u0027t even aware of their abilities, only that they know people who become labelled as TEKS eventually go missing without a trace. It isn\u0027t until they become targets for the purging of this branch of humanity do they finally realize what is going on around them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting honestly means the world to me. I\u0027ve been fascinated with writing long novels that are deeply connected because when I read, watch movies, or become interested in a good story for a video game, when it all comes to an end I wish I could know more. I wish I could be able to see the story past what was written, so for me that had always translated into creating my own stories. Creating massive universes is something I\u0027ve set as an aspiration of mine, and hopefully with your help that can be realized and everyone can enjoy my stories, experience the worlds within my imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am new to all of this and plan to release my stories chapter by chapter for those who subscribe, as well as have a compiled work when each novel is finished for people to read at the own leisure. I can provide rough copies of each chapter as well if people are interested, so that people following my work can see raw copies of what I write and can compare to the final product, but again only if those of you are interested in that sort of thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for contributing to my dream career of writing and I hope to share many stories with you all. You have my sincerest gratitude."
