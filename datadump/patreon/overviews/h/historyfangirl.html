    "summary": "I am a full-time history travel blogger. I have added the podcast as a way to share my love of historic places with a new audience. I have been a die-hard history podcast fan since 2009, and this is my way to give back to this wonderful community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast costs me some money to produce each month. I spend about five hours on each episode and pay to have it produced, in addition to equipment and hosting fees. I am looking for support in covering these costs so that I can continue to focus so much time and energy on the show. In addition, I hope to be able to expand to two episodes a week in the future, which I will be able to do when I can cover the costs of producing two episodes a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, I would love to be able to focus on the podcast as my full-time business. This means I can always choose travel destinations that are the most interesting to our listening community and spend less time on the business-side of travel blogging. The more I can focus on the podcast, and the less on my blogging business, the more fun we\u0027ll have together.\u00a0"
