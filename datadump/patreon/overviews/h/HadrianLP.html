First and foremost, my reasoning is similar to many content creators: I want to ensure that I can continue to make top-quality videos for a \nhealthy, growing community to watch and enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApart from that, here are my particular reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022 To accommodate charitable viewers with an expressed or unexpressed wish to support the channel directly, at a monthly amount of their choosing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u2022 To accommodate conscientious viewers who wish\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e to use ad blockers while still feeling as though they are supporting the channel monetarily.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u2022 To accommodate viewers who are b\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eoth of the above.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e=======================================================\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. Don\u0027t you already have income from ad revenue?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. Yes, I do. Happily, YouTube is already helping me to realize the dream artists and creative people share of being able to sustain some form of income from their own creative endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, let\u0027s get at the meat of this question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e=======================================================\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Why should a YouTuber be seeking incremental income from Patreon? What justifies charitable support from viewers as a revenue stream on top of ad revenue?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. Any content creator that relies on ad revenue lives with one anxiety above most others: \u003cstrong\u003eThe vast proportion of their income that is being \"blocked\"\u00a0by ad blockers\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s nothing wrong with using an ad blocker. Ads these days can be frustrating, so the prevalence of blockers and their use by many people is understandable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe downside, though, is that the amount of income generated by ads on YouTube and other streaming content has dwindled precipitously. The revenue proportions affected/blocked are significant, and this is just as true for full-time, high-income content creators as well as part-time hobbyists such as myself. One 2015 report estimated that $22 billion had been lost in the overall internet economy that year as a result of ad blockers, and the number would double in 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, giving my viewers the opportunity to \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003esubscribe and support me via Patreon is a great way to completely eliminate this concern on my end. \u003cem\u003eCompletely\u003c/em\u003e eliminate it. And it\u0027s done through negligibly small, totally voluntary donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e=======================================================\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. Wait, how can Patreon \"COMPLETELY\" eliminate the entire problem?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. Even a single \u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e monthly subscription from \u003cstrong\u003eone person \u003c/strong\u003eis enough to make up the revenue of \u003cstrong\u003eseveral hundred\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eviews for that month, ad-blocked or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink about that. $1 a month is worth hundreds of ad-enabled views.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMultiply that by 10\u2014whether that\u0027s one person paying $10, or ten paying $1\u2014and you\u0027re offsetting \n\u003cstrong\u003ethousands\u003c/strong\u003e of individual ad blockers. \u003cem\u003eWith just $10!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eNow, keep adding orders of magnitude (10, 100, 1000, etc.), and Patreon\u0027s usefulness as a buffer against this prevalent issue is, I hope, profoundly clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what this means is that all you really have to give to make a massive difference in the life of the channel is $1. This is especially true considering how well $1 a month can add up across a growing base of subscribers. Until the channel grows to such a size that monthly donations no longer fully make up for the number of ad-blocked views, the problem will be truly and completely gone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e=======================================================\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ.

I do not provide any incentive for contributions from channel Patrons apart from the content I already make on YouTube. More on that in a moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, know that you will have my gratitude, and the knowledge that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(a) You have complete amnesty to use whatever adblocking software you\u0027d like,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(b) You have, even at the minimum amount of giving, made a more sizable contribution in a single month than you\u0027d make watching 1,000 videos (which, assuming you watch entire videos without stopping short, is 17 days of YouTube binge-watching with no breaks).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e=======================================================\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther channels provide special rewards for Patrons. Why don\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. Firstly, not all of them do. But, I don\u0027t mean in any way to comment on the correctness or incorrectness of that decision in general. To each, their own. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any one \"right\" answer to how to use Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, the answer to this question has solely to do with what is right for my channel\u0027s community. This community has always been and will always be one in which privilege, or status, is determined by someone\u0027s behavior toward me and toward other people; in other words, their overall civility. If I come to enjoy having you as part of the community, it\u0027s because you earned my good opinion by treating me and my other viewers with respect. That\u0027s how one earns favor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, regardless of how well you participate on the channel itself... coming over here and becoming a Patron makes me grateful to you indeed! But it can\u0027t make me like and enjoy your presence in the same way that genuine, positive participation can. Never like good manners and common decency can \u0026amp; will.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, being totally candid with you, the idea just doesn\u0027t sit well with me that an ill-behaved $10 subscriber could have access to anything that a stellar, long-time,\u00a0\u003cem\u003enon-paying\u003c/em\u003e subscriber does not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing against channels that do provide special rewards. More power to them. But, if you become a Patron of my channel, I\u0027d ask you to consider your donations just that: Donations. Because you like my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf looking at it this way is at all an issue with you, I understand and I urge you quite sincerely not to donate at all. I am totally happy to have you enjoy the channel without contributing monetarily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e=======================================================\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. I want to give more than $1. How much should I give? Tell me what you NEED, Hadrian!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. I understand the temptation to feel like $1 is not impactful enough. At the same time, you might feel like any amount higher is tough to justify in your budget (especially if you are a Patron of multiple channels). Suddenly, you end up in a weird place where you don\u0027t donate because you can\u0027t afford to be as helpful to the channel as you want to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey. Stop it. You stop that right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot stress this enough: (A) $1 is \u003cstrong\u003emore \u003c/strong\u003ethan\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eimpactful enough,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(B) How much you give beyond that is totally up to you. I\u0027m serious. Don\u0027t worry about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the questions above, I believe I\u0027ve made a compelling case for why $1 is all you need to worry about giving if your desire is to support the channel in a meaningful way (beyond simply watching and taking part in the community). Another reason a $1 monthly donation works so well is that it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eso \u003c/strong\u003esmall. I don\u0027t want anyone worrying even remotely about whether their donation is something they can afford. That\u0027s silly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would have you bear in mind though, if you do choose to give more than a dollar, you\u0027re (at the very least) \u003cem\u003etripling\u003c/em\u003e that already substantial individual impact. So, all that being said, I leave it to you and ask you not to feel \"cheap,\" or guilty, for giving the minimum. The minimum is awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e=======================================================\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.

It\u0027s weird. Every $1 of my own money I don\u0027t have to spend on the channel because you gave me $1 for the month could also count as money you put into my pocket and the rest of my non-channel budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the reality. Patreon was created to help guarantee artists a reliable income from their creative endeavors, thanks to fans who are voluntarily willing to contribute to that cause. I acknowledge it\u0027s easy to hesitate when considering donating; my reaction upon seeing Patreon for the first time was that it seemed odd to directly finance another person\u0027s livelihood simply because you believed in their creative work. The more fiscally conservative voice in all of us might ask, \"Shouldn\u0027t purchasing their work (or, in these cases, watching ad-enabled videos) be enough?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, when you consider that (a) many people are perfectly willing to donate when we like what someone does, and (b) a bunch of negligibly small donations can add up to a big difference in a creator\u0027s quality, potential, \u0026amp; personal well-being, the existence of Patreon actually makes good sense. If it doesn\u0027t hurt anyone, just let people do what they want to do; that happens to be the same reason I set up this Patreon page. Because people willing to donate asked me about it and urged me to launch it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has become a viable platform, including for much more successful YouTube creators in my own niche. That\u0027s why I use it, and I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting the channel on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e=======================================================\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis concludes the Q \u0026amp; A.
