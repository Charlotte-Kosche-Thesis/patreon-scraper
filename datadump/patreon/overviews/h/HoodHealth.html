I am a writer and editor at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://supremedesignonline.com/\"\u003eSupreme Design Publishing\u003c/a\u003e. In 2010 we published \"The Hood Health Handbook: A Practical Guide to Health and Wellness in the Urban Community\" volumes I and II. In these two books we laid out our vision on bridging the gap between race, the inner city and health. From these two books we developed a platform to addressing health issue faced by the urban community. In plain language,we draw on well-known examples to illustrate what works...and what doesn\u0027t. Focusing on natural and affordable approaches to everything from asthma to ulcers, our platform started to grow exponentially beyond the books. All of the work that we are going id being chronicled at www.ThisHoodHealth.com. You can also catch us on IG at www.Instagram.com/HoodHealth and on Twitter at www.Twitter.com/ThisHoodHealth\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Brought Me To Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe vision that we have for the HoodHealth platform requires investors. Normally a work of this sort would be backed by an institution that can provide support both financially and physically in terms of research resources or it would be through private investors. Historically patronage is an ongoing, direct support relationship between the artist and their patrons. Envisioning this relationship in a investor mode my patrons work as a supporting institution. My patrons have confidence in me. My patrons motivate me. My patrons inspire me to generate the work at the highest level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want the space and time to do the necessary research,writing and development that is required of a project of this magnitude. This project has had many starting and stopping points due to space/time not being able to be reserved. With the right patronage the full platform of HoodHealth can be realized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe full platform involves\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Having our blog fully functional, the full layout of our website (www.ThisHoodHealth.com) and it\u0027s security set\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Our calendar of speaking and workshop events set\u003cbr\u003e-Our podcast fully functional\u003cbr\u003e-Our Yelp like HoodHealth section functional\u003cbr\u003e-Our online classes fully listed\u003cbr\u003e-The next three volumes of the HoodHealth Handbook under production.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow Will Your Patronage Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEventually I would like to quit my day job and fully immerse myself in everything HoodHealth. At this moment that cannot happen. What your patronage does allow me to do though is not have to pick up a part time job and grow the HoodHealth platform. We are already at a point where we are able to offer many of these services (the blog, the podcast, lectures/workshops nationwide, etc) yet there is so much more that we want to give and we know that with the right support we can (and will) do it all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheck out that column to the right of the screen. The tiers are progressive. That means with each higher level you get everything from the levels below plus something new. All patrons will have access to the patron only post that will detail all of my activity behind the scenes (photos, short author chats, brainstorming sessions, etc). The naming of the tiers is based on neighborhoods that were historically traditionally Black and/or Brown.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you decide to rock with me thank you. Watch as this whole thing unfolds!"
