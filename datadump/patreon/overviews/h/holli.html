I\u2019m the college student that joined the Army ROTC without talking to a recruiter and loved every minute of her training because it was incredibly challenging and rewarding (that\u2019s a lie I didn\u2019t love any training that involved gas masks). I\u2019m the backpacker that visited 50 countries, bungee jumped off the Victoria Falls bridge, floated in the Red Sea, learned to SCUBA dive in Bali, and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

I took a year, lived off my savings, and focused on teaching myself writing. The support I received here kept me motivated and paid for conferences, books, and workshops. Now I am back at a paying job but I am far from done learning and growing as a writer. \u003cbr\u003eThere was a time when \u201cwrite a novel\u201d or \u201cget published by the end of the year\u201d were my New Years Resolutions. I know better now. I know that on average aspiring authors take 10 years to get published. I know that being a writer is a long and difficult journey. These days I am more realistic but no less determined to be a writer. That\u2019s why I have decided to start what I am calling my \u201cwriter apprenticeship\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn apprentice is a student of a craft who works for years learning from other masters. An apprentice isn\u2019t expected to be perfect but they are expected to learn, produce art, and develop mastery. In my writer apprenticeship I will do the following: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u2022Engage with other writers through my writing group, workshops, and critiques.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u2022Read something every day.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u2022Write a short story every two weeks.

Patrons give money monthly and receive rewards in return. In this journey it is hard to believe in yourself or to know if you are any good. Having patrons that I know believe in me and my ability to someday be published is priceless. Patrons also provide accountability and makes this apprenticeship a little less lonely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll money I receive from my patrons goes towards funding my apprenticeship. I use it to buy books, pay for online courses, pay entrance and submission fees for contests and magazines, and go to writing conferences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and for any and all support you are able to give (even if it\u0027s just verbal or written). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eYou are my Hero!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
