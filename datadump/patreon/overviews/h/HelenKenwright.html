    "summary": "I\u0027m Helen Kenwright, and I\u0027m a writer. I write all sorts of things, but my desire is to create stories that inspire people, entertain people and give them hope. At the moment I am doing that by writing speculative fiction: solarpunk, science fiction and fantasy, with a dollop of romance and humour. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecurrent themes in my fiction include sustainable futures, ecology and a celebration of diversity. My characters and their relationships are often queer in one way or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy writing as a creative outlet and for the entertainment of readers, but I also want to help others to find their own creative voice and to improve their wellbeing. To this end I am growing a small business offering creative writing classes online, and I teach on a project called \u0027Converge\u0027 at my local university, providing creative writing classes for people who have lived experience of mental ill-health. The more I do this, the more I see the benefits of creating art in terms of improved wellbeing and mental health. Not as therapy (although that can be very valuable too) but because we can all use art to help us explore the meaning we find in the world around us, to entertain ourselves and our friends and to express our emotions. I see it as a fundamental part of being human, and something my own society chronically undervalues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I joined Patreon to achieve two things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I am asking for support to help me find the time to write my own original fiction. My current projects are two novels: \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eThe Fletching Stone\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a steampunk/solarpunk novel about\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ean archaeologist investigating the life of an adventurer from the age of steam; and \u003cstrong\u003eMoonside\u003c/strong\u003e, a fantasy novel about a hairdresser, a photographer and the nature of home and family.\u00a0 I\u0027m also writing a series of fantasy short stories, collectively called\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eThe Women of White Water. \u003c/strong\u003eThey are about a wise-woman, Berta, who has a particular talent for unearthing secrets that people often wish to keep hidden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0You can read some of my work on \u003ca href=\"https://helenkenwright.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I would like to blog for my patrons about writing, and particularly writing for well-being and pleasure. In the current climate art is so often undervalued, and I think this is a huge mistake. I believe art is as essential to human mental health as food and shelter is to our physical health, and I would love to explore and discuss ways of helping art in the written form to blossom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am English, and as such my disposition cries out against asking for help, especially of a financial nature. But I am also well aware that the realistic chances of generating income from writing are slim. Over the next five years I aim to grow my business to a point where I can make enough income to survive as a teacher and writer, without the need for another day job - but for now, as I work towards that goal, I need help. It would also mean the world to me, money aside, to know that people are interested in what I am trying to do, and willing to support me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
