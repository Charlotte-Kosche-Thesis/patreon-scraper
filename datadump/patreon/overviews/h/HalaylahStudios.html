    "summary": "Hi, my name is Stephanie Brown of Halaylah Studios. My official title is Artist, Artisan, and Dilettante Extraordinaire!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been drawing and painting my whole life.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could do everything - I long for eternal youth, just so I could have time to learn all the things I want to learn. Since I can\u0027t do that in this life, I have chosen to put my time and energy toward painting, doodling, and some textile arts. For now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never really had much to say with my art - even as I have become more active politically, I\u0027ve only ever wanted to paint pretty things. I see that as my own way of making a statement - that no matter how hard they beat us down, no matter what they take away, there will always be something beautiful to celebrate. And as I am being subversive in my own way, by celebrating the beauty that our leaders can\u0027t destroy, I am also exploring the boundaries of what I am willing to say that I find beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, your support will help me buy art supplies so that I can keep exploring and keep making things. Really, it\u0027s about that simple. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do also have some larger goals: \u003cbr\u003e1. I would like to be able to purchase health insurance, something that is sadly out of the reach of many artists in the United States.\u003cbr\u003e2. I would like to eventually generate enough income to allow me to work on my art full-time.\u003cbr\u003e3. I would like to be able to rent studio space outside of my small apartment, where a corner of my bedroom currently functions as my studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your support, I will release sneak peeks at things that I\u0027m working on, some work-in-progress shots and maybe technique videos, as well as a series of small prints and collectible cards. For the more dedicated supporters, I will even take requests.\u003cbr\u003e"
