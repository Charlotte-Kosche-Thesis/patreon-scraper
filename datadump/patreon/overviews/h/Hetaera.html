Just the fact that you\u0027re here tells me that you\u0027ve thought about the time and effort that goes into making a working relationship. Thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? Supporting Hetaera on Patreon will allow us to do cool stuff like getting more articles, videos and podcasts up! This would be a huge help to make more frequent content and free up some of my time to do important things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow? Several cool reward levels allow you to tailor your subscription.  I would like to convince you to choose one, even at $1, so you have access to the Hetaera feed here at Patreon.  Sometimes YouTube\u0027s subscription methods are unreliable, and if you sign up via Patreon you\u0027ll be notified directly when I upload a video, which is pretty awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat? If you\u0027d like to go above and beyond to help me do things like travel for an episode, invest in equipment, do giveaways, bring on more people with a unique point of view; picking any of the larger support levels will certainly help do these things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate your financial support. I\u0027ll say it anyways though: Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI greatly appreciate it. The Patreon model has given us a place for rewards here to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re both honest... you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027m trying to do with Hetaera, and you think the hours I put into most articles, each video and the podcast are worth it! You \"get it\". You\u0027re a fellow thinker and doer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarm Regards, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaRasa,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHetaera\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003etl;dr\u003cbr\u003e- Pledges are per month-\u003cdiv\u003e- I release 4 articles, a podcast episode and a video per month on average\u003cdiv\u003e- Thank you so much for stopping by, every little bit is appreciated!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
