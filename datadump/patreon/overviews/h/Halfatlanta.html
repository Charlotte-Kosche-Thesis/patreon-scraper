While I enjoy writing, editing, creating art, and editing, it is often extremely difficult to survive on a freelance basis this way - which is where you come in, lovely patrons! As you probably already know, freelancing means surviving between paychecks that are often quite small, rarely paid on time, negotiated somewhat unfairly; sometimes my pitches are stolen and pieces have even been plagiarized recently. The point of all this is to say that until I have a staff writing or staff editing position somewhere (a goal I am speaking into existence!) freelancing makes paying for things like rent, phone and internet bills, and groceries stressful and unsure at times. Which is why I\u0027m asking you, faithful people, to invest in me, my labor, and my budding career. With so many followers on social media, particularly Twitter, it has become a platform I\u0027ve decided to dedicate towards educating, spreading resources, sharing important articles, and creating critical discussions (in between tweets about how my day\u0027s going, Nicki Minaj, and other random things of course). So many people enjoy engaging with my work both in full written articles and within tweet form, so I am now asking those same people to engage with my bank account to help me continue to create create create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DETYpTqUAAAxkJV.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get Out Of This?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be frank, I thought about this section long and hard. It quite honestly goes against my personal politics to offer exclusive contentbased on how much one can (or can\u0027t) afford. I believe that the socialization of knowledge production, and subsequently of knowledge itself, we must break monetary barriers of engagement. At the same time, however, I understand the need to see and feel the fruits of your donations; you want to feel the tangible benefits of supporting me beyond just mere articles and Twitter threads. So here\u0027s what I\u0027ve come up with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor those of you who pay $5 or more every month, you will receive access to a biweekly column I will write.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThis will be a Patreon-exclusive column that will exist independent of my freelance work at various platforms. I have wanted to write a biweekly or monthly column for some while now, so this is a perfect way to finally make it happen! The column will cover topics such as current events, race, gender, hip-hop and reflection on love, life, relationships, and spirituality. The focus of this column will be more personal, and along with covering a range of topics I will also include updates and links to whatever new essays, blog posts, art, and interviews I create for that month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with the exclusive column, I will begin recording a weekly podcast soon and will also allow you to have input on the topics of discussion. Aside from just allowing your input and suggestions, as well as receive your criticisms and reviews of the episodes, I will allow yall to send me questions for the \"Q\u0026amp;A\" portion of the podcast. This can be anything from the person to the political, and especially where they overlap!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9Tk-6EXoAEsZZv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOkay, Okay, Okay...

I hold solo exhibitions/shows/gallery events a few times a year (\u003ca href=\"http://www.urbansoulatlanta.com/interactions-blackness\"\u003eyou can view one here\u003c/a\u003e) and the costs to create my art, which ranges from photography prints to installation pieces, are often a huge strain on me. \u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is why I\u0027ve decided to allow patrons who pay $10 or more a month into my Art House,\u003c/strong\u003e where you will receive exclusive sneak peaks at what I\u0027m working on, two free printable photography downloads a month (I normally charge $25 for one digital download), and monthly art tips, advice, history, and discussions.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Along with this, I will come to you with new ideas I am thinking of and allow you to have input, give opinions and suggestions, and be a voice to help guide my work ins mall but significant ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I have art shows I am very, very selective and secretive of who I tell about my plans and what I tell them. Out of my closest friends and family there are a few who always lend me advice and hear my art ideas out, and I began calling them my \"art house\" a few years ago. When someone is in your house, the assumption is that they are someone you are close to, or have built some level of trust between. Now, you can join my art house family and be involved in my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C-lzVoKXsAIaIh9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Where Do We Go From Here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell... now is supposed to be the part where I end my long spiel about needing money to survive under a capitalist system which routinely devalues the creative sector and exploits people\u0027s creativity to the point of pure denigration, all for the sake of bolstering the pockets of a select elite class. And what do I want to say if you\u0027re reading this and you\u0027ve made it to this part? Thank you! Whether you give $2 a month just because you like my tweets or $7 because you\u0027re interested in my column, thank you. If you\u0027re just a white person who wants to send a few bucks my way every month as a form of personal reparations, or if you\u0027re someone who has been to one of the art shows, panels, or discussions I put together and you are interested in helping sustain that important work, thank you too. If you are someone who has enjoyed the small free political education discussion circles I do in Atlanta every month and you want to show appreciation, or if you are just someone who took the time to read all of this but decide not to give anything to me, thank you. Thank you to all the warm followers, comrades, literary fans, and avid readers who engage with my work, my personhood, and my career as a writer and artist on any level. No matter what, I will always be a writer and artist transgressing against this white supremacist capitalist imperialist patriarchal beast, one step at a time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"

While I enjoy dong these things, it is often extremely difficult to survive on a freelance basis this way and, more than that, difficult to financially survive while searching for a position as an editor - which is where you come in, lovely patrons! As you probably already know, freelancing means surviving between paychecks that are often quite small, rarely paid on time, negotiated somewhat unfairly; sometimes my pitches are stolen and pieces have even been plagiarized recently; most months I have to publish at least 5-8 articles just to pay rent, on top of the work I do as a construction worker in Atlanta. The point of all this is to say that until I have a staff writing or staff editing position somewhere (a goal I am speaking into existence!) freelancing makes paying for things like rent, phone and internet bills, and groceries stressful and unsure at times. Which is why I\u0027m asking you, faithful people, to invest in me, my labor, and my budding career.

I want this Patreon to exist for the people who often tweet me saying \"what\u0027s your CashApp username? I want to pay you for your educational labor.\" I want this to be a place for people who often tell me they love my writing, and want to have my opinions on more topics, subjects, and events.
