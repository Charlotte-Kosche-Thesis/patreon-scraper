I live in LA with my dog, Maeby, \u0026amp; I have a passon\u00a0for helping women reclaim their power \u0026amp; live their best life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eMy mission is to help you feel strong, capable, healthy \u0026amp; confident in your own skin like the Badass Babe you are. My purpose for being on Patreon is to further my ability to create resources (coaching, programs, podcasts, etc.) to help badass babes everywhere learn to love, care for, celebrate, and accept themselves more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThis year, I intend to:\u003c/h3\u003eIn addition to building my coaching \u0026amp; consulting businesses, I am launching an Honestly Badass Babes Podcast where I\u0027ll talk about various topics and bringing in other Badass Babes to hear their stories \u0026amp; learn from their experiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTopics covered on the podcast will include\u00a0Building Your Life After Hitting Rock Bottom,\u00a0Self-Love \u0026amp; Acceptance,\u00a0Body Image,\u00a0Self-Care,\u00a0Relationships, Mental Health, Holistic Healing, Sexuality, Rocking Business Goals, Work-Life Balance, Health \u0026amp; Fitness, \u0026amp; more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy why:\u003c/h3\u003eI feel called to do this. I feel so compelled to do this work that I want to take a risk for it. But, while I would love to dive head first into this, I think it makes more sense to ask for some help getting it off the ground first \u2013 and then eventually moving into dedicating myself to coaching and creating these resources full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow you can get involved:\u003c/h3\u003eSo I\u0027m asking for Patreon patrons to help\u00a0 \u2013 through opportunities to connect with me personally, receive readings, \u0026amp; other resources \u2013 for as little as $2 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start, my goal is only to reach a collective $500 per month \u2013 just enough to pay a portion of my rent. This will allow me the ability to focus my time, energy, and talents to put the resources that you want and need out into the world while giving back to the gracious community that has always supported me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e are who I do this work for. But when I\u0027m being pulled in multiple directions (I can only handle so many \"side hustles\"), content creation always gets put on the backburner. But it\u0027s the one thing that you need; it\u0027s what you ask me for. And I have so many ideas to share with you \u2013 and the world at large. And I think that with a little support, at least at first, I could create something life-changing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I\u0027m asking is simply for you to consider if you have the space in your budget to send me five or ten dollars per month in exchange for some really awesome perks for you (check \u0027em out to the right). It would make all the difference in the world for me, and I truly believe I could use it to make a difference in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThanks again for checking out my Patreon page!\u003c/h3\u003e"
