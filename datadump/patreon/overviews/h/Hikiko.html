I\u0027ve been on YouTube since August of 2010, when I started an experimental comedic project called \u003cem\u003ePhil Hatley\u003c/em\u003e. It was intended to be a satire on the game reviewer trope, but ended up becoming a dark comedy that I shared between my close friends... And some of them even laughed. It was the first project I wrote, filmed and edited - it was the calamity that started it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the mini-series concluded, I joined a local film group and worked on several short films as an actor, writer and producer, doing whatever I could to learn the trade.

Which is fine! I love what I do and what I\u0027ve created so far... and I hope you do too! I\u0027ve operated and financed the channel independently creating over 150 videos and although, I believe the production quality has improved over time, I would like to see it continue, as I work to make the channel better in every way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has allowed me to post content for free on their platform, which is a pretty good deal in my opinion. As you may know, YouTube is nearly impossible to profit from in the current state and that\u0027s just how it is. With ad revenue being a joke and content creators getting censored, it\u0027s definitely a difficult choice for many to find the motivation to continue outputting quality content with the risk of having your work claimed by big gaming companies claiming the work of creators or false content claims in general. I\u0027ve shied away from reviewing Nintendo games for this reason and having my work claimed is a huge motivation killer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to use the funds raised by the generosity of Patrons to continue making videos on my own terms and improve the production quality significantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I mean by improving the production quality?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 60px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoney is a great motivator (for me):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 60px;\"\u003eHonesty is the best policy.
