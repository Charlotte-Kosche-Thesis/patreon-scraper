Why now? It seems like the worst time to refocus on my creativity with a 6 month old baby... and yet it\u0027s somehow the best time. I know myself. I wouldn\u0027t ever make anything if I didn\u0027t have a deadline - preferably an external requirement of some sort. Putting my creativity on a schedule is the only way that it\u0027s gonna happen! Plus being a creatively fulfilled person makes me an infinitely better mom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here then you may have heard me\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/w4DSTrwDSsc\"\u003eplay harp\u003c/a\u003e, seen a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/3mkSY8Qz0nM\"\u003eperformance\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dangerdiva.com/\"\u003efilm\u003c/a\u003e I did music for, or explored an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.robertmcginleyphotography.com/photo-galleries/magic-hour-at-horizon-farms/\"\u003eart installation\u003c/a\u003e with one of my soundscapes.

Either way - welcome to my little corner of Patreon.com! I\u0027m in excellent company here! In addition to using this platform for myself, I also support several artists on it. Even a tiny bit helps, and I feel proud every time I see that charge on my credit card.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call myself the High Priestess because my creative journey is also a mystical journey. I\u0027ve always used art to try and understand the unusual experiences I\u0027ve had. My connection to nature, and to the unseen spirits that dwell there have long been an inspiration to my creativity. \u00a0To me, the Goddess is in all acts of beauty and creativity. Whether it be a kind act or a surge of the Muse, each act can be sacred.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Priestess I want to connect people to the sacred, magickal, life altering magick of their own creative expression. \u00a0I hope by sharing my process, methods and experiences as a mystic, a creative, a human I can help others in their own journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few creative projects I would love to have the ability to work on. First and foremost is Faerie Archives volume 2. I\u0027ve already recorded the harp parts - all that is needed is editing and adding other instrumental layers. With just a bit of support here I\u0027ll be able to finish and release that album. Have you heard the story of the first album? My fellow patreon.com user\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/AlexanderPolinsky\"\u003eReverend Alex Polinsky\u003c/a\u003e and I brought beautiful bits of nature back from the local old growth oak forest. From those bits he created an amazing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnuIVL7sA9o\"\u003efaerie house\u003c/a\u003e that we used in our rituals calling the Fae. We made offerings of milk and honey and song, and asked the Fae to use us to share their magick with the world. Sure enough much of the album was recorded and edited in a state of trance. I am normally a very type a creative person... but this project just blossomed in the times I surrendered myself completely to the magick of the faeries. A series of coincidences and good fortune brought several incredible musicians to the house as I was finishing the mixes... and the final result is an album that I constantly hear new things in. Truly a masterwork - and the piece I\u0027ve had the least amount of preconceived notions about. I want to explore more co-creative art. Collaborating with the magick of nature via Faeries has changed my creativity forever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother project I have waiting for time and a little funding is a series of pieces based on the Vision Keys of Faery Seership. Much of what I know I learned from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.orionfoxwood.com/\"\u003eOrion Foxwood\u003c/a\u003e. His beautiful book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.orionfoxwood.com/books-a-cds/the-tree-of-enchantment.html\"\u003eThe Tree of Enchantment\u003c/a\u003e taught me so much about how to manage my connection with the subtle planes around me. Together we would like to offer an album of meditations based on the key beings one encounters on their journey into Faerie. Woven together with the spells of calling, you will fall into a deep trance that allows you to communicate with the elusive Earth spirits. In musical ceremony the Other World will come alive for you, and you will journey back carrying gifts of great importance from the spiritual planes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to do weekly releases. That would mean that you get charged per official upload (I\u0027ll do free blogs and updates as well).\u00a0I\u0027ll release articles about the New and Full Moons, as well as the solar holidays. I\u0027ll endeavor to get footage of my various harp performances, as well as do a regular twitch stream on harp and piano. And ultimately, with your help, I\u0027ll be able to bring some of these more complex projects into the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a patreon intro video yet so I included my composer intro video. Keep your eye out for a new video explaining who I am and why you might want to support me up here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a heart full of gratitude - Thank you\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyour High Priestess\u00a0Regan"
