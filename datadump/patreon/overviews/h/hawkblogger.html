My original hope with HawkBlogger was to create a respectful and passionate community that could come together to discuss what they love in a safe place. I believe Patreon will help us form that community because you have to pay to enter. Just being a random fan with a smart phone is not enough. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to be writing for you, and providing the coverage you care about, and spend less time caring about the masses. It can make being a Seahawks fan even better. I know, because I have met many of you over the years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, join us.

They were on the 50-yard line in the very last row of the Kingdome\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2000 - Started writing a season preview for friends via email\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2007 - Started my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hawkblogger.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehawkblogger.com\u003c/a\u003e on the advice of a friend\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2012 - Started accepting ad dollars and donating over 100% of proceeds to charity (Ben\u0027s Fund)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2013 - Watched front and center as my dream came true when the Seahawks whooped the Broncos in the Super Bowl\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2015 - Crossed the $50K mark in donations to Ben\u0027s Fund\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2017 - Started a Patreon page to create a closer connection with the most passionate Seahawks fans and turbo-boost annual contributions to charity\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSports are an escape. There are precious few safe places to care passionately about something while actively disagreeing. Politics, religion, and even the food we choose to eat highlight what divides people and pushes them into smaller and smaller corners. People across all those divides come together to cheer, celebrate, and even hug one another in the name of sport. No sports community is stronger than the 12s who stand behind the Seahawks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal when I started \u003ca href=\"http://hawkblogger.com/\"\u003eHawkblogger.com\u003c/a\u003e in 2007 was to create a place where Seahawks fans could gather and share in their obsession. I had graduated American University ten years prior with a degree in print journalism, with an eye on becoming a sports writer, but instead found success in technology working for Adobe Systems, Inc. The Seahawks were always my favorite team, and the blog provided the outlet I craved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings started slowly, with just a handful of readers. That was plenty for me. It was a small community, but a community nonetheless. It grew into much more. Tens became hundreds and then thousands and now the top independent Seahawks blog on the web, visited by millions of people. It has been a thrilling and humbling experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike typical sports coverage, Hawkblogger.com prioritizes analysis over superficial breaking news. Long form articles are the norm. People come here to learn not only about their favorite team, but about the game they love. They hear from someone who has seen every Seahawks game since the mid-80s, and who obsessively catalogs every detail about team performance. Articles range from deep analytics to pure emotional experience. Reading \u003ca href=\"http://www.hawkblogger.com/category/columns/morning-after\"\u003eThe Morning After\u003c/a\u003e column has become a Seattle sports fan ritual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy job at Adobe means I do not need the revenue generated from this blog, so I made the decision in 2012 to donate all proceeds to charity. I have a two sons, and the youngest has special needs. John Schneider, GM of the Seahawks, has a son with autism. His wife, Traci, started a charity called Ben\u0027s Fund that benefits parents who cannot afford expensive autism treatments. It seemed like the perfect way to complete the virtuous cycle I had in mind when starting this blog. Every person who joins the Hawkblogger community, or just reads a story, gives back through this system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
