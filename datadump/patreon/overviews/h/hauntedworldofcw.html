    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the heck is a GG13?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eG13: The Haunted World of CW has been scaring up shocks and laughs with full length (22-30 Min) weekly episodes for 3 years on YouTube. Independently funded and produced, we\u0027ve always aimed to create scary, fun, and exciting content that pushes the boundaries of what is expected from a small budget series. By taking a very meta approach to paranormal reality shows, the horror genre, pop culture and storytelling in general we\u0027ve been able to create a quirky voice all our own in a noisy YouTube landscape.\u00a0Over these 3 years we\u0027ve been so lucky to amass a dedicated cult following for our supernatural shenanigans and even win a few awards along the way for Best TV/Web Series at the 2014 Pollygrind film fest, the 2016 Horror Hotel Film Fest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eProducing a weekly web-series takes time, equipment, and a team of people and resources. We are continuously shooting, writing, creating graphics, editing, and maintaining a plethora of social media. The work literally never stops, and life has yet to develop a pause button, though we\u0027re holding out on that one. As our strange little show has grown thanks to our amazing \"Scooby Gang\" of subscribers, we\u0027ve always wanted to offer them more. More locations (Amityville we\u0027re looking at you...) more ways to view the action, better equipment, improved sound, lighting and most importantly, cool creatures of all shapes and sizes. Making monsters isn\u0027t easy (or cheap), especially when we\u0027d rather have practical creatures made by hard working FX artists over CGI any day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid we mention all those jobs listed above are performed by people we have to feed? Just leaving that right there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll jokes aside, Patreon or not, \u00a0we will continue to pour as much of our own resources into the series as we have these past 3 years and deliver the best we can each and every week for many season\u0027s to come for free on YouTube. Thanks everyone and \"beast wishes\" to you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
