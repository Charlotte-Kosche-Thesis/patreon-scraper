    "summary": "Hello, my name is C Cody Anderson (the \"c\" is for Christopher. \u00a0Shhhhh). \u00a0I have joined Patreon to fund my comic project called \"Hiero\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHiero is the story of Illis Noch\u0027tal, an elderly woman who works as lead scribe of the Capital Library who is given the difficult task of searching her world for dangerous oddities to verify and document. On her journey she will meet a number of strange characters and creatures, both friendly and hostile. \u00a0Among her companions are a young Psychometer, who can read the past of any person or object through touching them directly, and a mysterious Golem who shows an unusual amount of intelligence. \u00a0These are just two of the many friends she will make as she explores the strange and wondrous world of Hiero.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing this comic for some time now. \u00a0I say writing, but the vast majority of it is still in my head. \u00a0I hope to transfer it in to comic form so that I may share what I believe will be a highly enjoyable story of love, life and death. \u00a0The story that I want to share will take many years to complete, meaning that this will be no small task.I hope to create an epic with my very first comic series, but I will need help to keep it going. \u00a0That is where funding comes in. Funding this project will give Patrons complete access to each issue as it is finished. \u00a0I hope you will enjoy my story and that you will help me make it a reality. \u00a0Thank you for your consideration, and I hope you have a quality day."
