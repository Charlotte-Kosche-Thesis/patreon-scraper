    "summary": "My name is Irvin, \u201chpboy13\u201d on the Internet, and I\u2019ve been\nwriting essays about \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e for\nMuggleNet.com since 2011.  I remain a\ntrue HP fanatic, and I firmly believe that there is always more to discuss\nabout the \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter \u003c/em\u003ebooks.  To that end, I keep writing essays about the\nbooks, as well as the \u003cem\u003eFantastic Beasts\u003c/em\u003e\nmovies and the Potter fandom in general. \nI\u2019ve also given presentations about \u003cem\u003eHarry\nPotter\u003c/em\u003e at various HP conventions, like Leviosa 2016 and every single\nMISTI-Con.  I love every minute of it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut real talk: I have never made a single cent from the\nalmost fifty essays I\u2019ve written over 6+ years. \nI may be a columnist with MuggleNet, but I am still a freelancer, and\ndon\u2019t get paid.  And that\u2019s okay \u2013 it\u2019s\nan honor to write for MuggleNet, and I\u2019m reasonably certain they\u2019re not rolling\nin Galleons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m in a different place than I was when I started.  When I signed on as MuggleNet\u2019s columnist, I\nwas a nineteen-year-old in my first year of college, with nothing but free\ntime.  Now, I have a full-time job, and\nam toiling away on getting books published whenever I\u2019m not working.  I hold myself to a high standard when it\ncomes to my writing \u2013 I make sure to quote and reference anything I bring into\nevidence, and I diligently research both the apocrypha Rowling creates and the\nwritings of other HP essayists.  I never\nbothered with things like listicles, but always strove to provide something\nworth reading and thinking about.  It\u2019s\ngetting harder to justify spending as much time as I do writing HP essays for\nthe fun of it, but I really want to continue doing so.  That\u2019s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you believe that continuing discourse about the \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e world is valuable, please\nconsider contributing a small amount of money for each of my essays.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI generally try to produce an essay about once a month, give\nor take \u2013 sometimes there\u2019ll be a lull, sometimes there\u2019ll be a flood of\ninspiration.  If you wish, you can set a\ncap on how many essays you\u2019ll pay for in a month, lest I get too prolific for\nyour wallet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo be clear, I will not be putting any of my essays behind a\npaywall, regardless of how this all turns out. \nThey will continue to be posted on MuggleNet for all to read, because I\nwant every HP fan to be able to engage in the theorizing.  But I do hope to create a community here on\nPatreon for discussion of HP, so we can engage in some quality analysis!  I\u2019m always looking for ideas for essays, so\nI\u2019ll be happy to hear your thoughts on anything to do with HP \u2013 and in return,\nI\u2019ll share mine, even if it\u2019s something not quite ready for a full-fledged\nessay.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you choose to support me, take a look at the reward\ntiers: I\u2019m offering everything from just joining the conversation to one-on-one\nnerding out with me\u2026 and I promise to love you forever!  Even if you can\u2019t, thank you for reading, and\nhopefully we can all work together to keep the \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e fandom thriving. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor an example of the kind of content you\u2019d be supporting:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/2014/11/seven-obstacles-for-seven-books/\"\u003eSeven Obstacles for Seven Books\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/2016/03/the-revised-forty/\"\u003eThe Revised Forty\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/2016/11/big-bads-grindelwald-vs-voldemort/\"\u003eThe Big Bads: Grindelwald vs. Voldemort\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
