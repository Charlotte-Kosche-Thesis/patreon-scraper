    "summary": "Hey guys my name is David Mitchell and I run a popular youtube channel called Hood Gaming TV. I have been on youtube for the past two years now and have grown a very successful fan base I like to call the SkuuWoop Nation. SkuuWoop Nation is about positivity and bringing together the bloods, crips, blacks, whites and etc... I started this nation because I wanted my fans to feel in some way connected, not just to themselves but also me in a since. I wanted to be that one youtuber who people could touch and reach out too.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0  The origin behind the word \"SkuuWoop\" derives from a couple terms, Suuwoop (a popular blood call), the crips, and Zulu Nation. The original spelling behind the word \"SkuuWoop\" is ScuuWoop Nation. This was meant to be a mixture between the popular blood call and the crips due to the \"c\" being in the word. The spelling was later changed to \"SkuuWoop\" due to popularity behind the spelling with a \"K\" instead of a \"C\" from my subscribers. Also nation was thrown in the wording because of my love for A tribe Called Quests (A popular 90\u0027s hiphop group) music since they shouted out Zulu Nation in a majority of their songs.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 My youtube channel consist of a huge mixture of videos from prank calls, pranks, NBA 2k videos, GTA 5 skits and more. Over time my fans have grown accustom to my variety of content produced on my youtube channel allowing me to be such a versatile youtuber. My most popular videos that really capture my audience is my prank call videos. These form of videos such as pranks and prank calls was never intended to be my main content on my channel but since my fans loved it I let it be the primary content on my channel. Over time youtube start enforcing newly added TOS policies making it almost impossible for my primary content to generate revenue.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Youtube is a site that is ever change externally and internally. That being said new rules are applied to youtube creators who want to monetize (make money) off their videos. Youtube has to follow a specific guideline in order to keep the advertisers happy, if advertisers are not happy it will more than likely will\u00a0result in a pull of their ads which displays on content creators videos. So youtube has been cracking down heavy to the videos that are uploaded to the website making it even more difficult for content creators like me to generate revenue off our content. And since videos like prank calls are considered \"shocking content\" to youtube policies it makes it impossible to monetize.  \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0For a while now the primary videos of my youtube have not been monetized due to youtubes TOS system demonizing my videos. I have uploaded video after video knowing I wasn\u0027t going to make money off of it but I did it to make the fans happy. After a while of uploading video after video with no funds backing up my youtube channel it becomes increasingly hard mainly because of how much of my money I invest into my channel that I never make back. I love the content I push and I dont want to have to stop uploading the type of videos I do just to make money to back my channel, so heres where your help comes in as a potential patron.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 With your help as a patron I can continue to make the same videos with out having to do \"family friendly content\". I can also buy new equipment needed for the channel for a new segment of pranks I have planned for my channel. Camera equipment is very expensive and can lead up to spending $5,000 just to deliver a good video with 1080p settings. Youtube is a very expensive risk that leads alot of people into dept and I don\u0027t want that to be the case with me. I want to continue to drop the content you guys really want without going into any sort of dept whatsoever. If you really enjoy my content it will be much appreciated if you can become a patron today and support the SkuuWoop Nation. When you become a patron I will do a video once a month and tell my fans where exactly the money has went so you guys know that I wont take your money and buy a BMW I8 like some youtubers (no shots at anyone or anything like that). Thank you for your consideration on becoming a patron for Hood Gaming TV, one love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
