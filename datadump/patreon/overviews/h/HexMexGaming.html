    "summary": "We\u0027re a few struggling game designers living on minimum wage. We are working to start a game creation company, first with board and card games, and eventually moving in on the video game arena. We hope to make this a thriving business, but until we take off, we can\u0027t survive off the games alone. Any help is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main two projects currently are a board game called Dead Run, and a deck-builder card game called Sigil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDead Run is a completely cooperative game for 2-6 players, where you are working together to collect supplies to bring to your base camp while avoiding the ever-growing zombie hordes. Gameplay typically lasts 30-45 minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSigil is a competitive deck builder based on the Norse (or Viking) runes. The focus of the game is planning ahead, paying attention to what your opponent is building into their deck just as much as you watch for your own cards. The more you play, the more options are available to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are several other games we have in early testing stages, as well as a ton of games we have in development. The only thing we are missing is the funding for production!\u003cbr\u003e"
