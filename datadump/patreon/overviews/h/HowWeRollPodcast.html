However, if you can donate even a little, not only will you receive our undying gratitude for your support, but each level of donation comes with its own \"thankyou\" package; this starts with access to our private, super secret Patreon Newsfeed, and also includes all sorts of goodies, from How We Roll swag, to the chance to play with us!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you that can donate, it means a huge amount to us, and we will love you forever. \u00a0If you can\u0027t donate right now, we still love you and hope you still keep enjoying the show and spreading word of our antics to your friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for tuning in,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe HowWeRoll Podcast team."
