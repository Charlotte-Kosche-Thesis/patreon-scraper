    "summary": "Hi, my name is Albert \"H4xDefender\" Ong, and I\u0027m a high rated League of Legends player who has\u00a0dipped his feet in almost every thing league related at some point in my career. I\u0027ve played competitively at the high school, collegiate, and NA challenger level, (LCS next hopefully) I\u0027ve done team coaching and analyst work for pro teams, 1-on-1 coaching, guide writing, maintained a tier list, and I\u0027ve created multiple instructional videos about league.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently not in school in an effort to pursue my dream of making a living off league of legends, whether that\u0027s through streaming and content creation, or through playing professionally, which is what this Patreon is for. I\u0027ve got a decent amount of money saved up from previous team salary, previous jobs, coaching, and other sources, but it won\u0027t last me forever unfortunately. I\u0027ve always had a pretty analytical mind when it comes to league, so I\u0027ve taken to uploading a variety of videos to help educate people about league. (and maybe give them a laugh or two in the process)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got a ton of ideas for content I want to put out already, but at the same time, I have to play a high volume of games to keep up my skill to the point where I can compete for tryouts on professional teams to earn a salary, so having your support will help give me incentive to put out more content than I would otherwise, and I can also give back by providing perks on my stream, as well as coaching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re simply looking for a one time donation rather than a monthly commitment, paypal is probably a bit more appropriate, and just as appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you only can support by giving my videos and stream some extra advertisement via word of mouth, views, and/or likes, that\u0027s completely fine too. I understand the struggle, and I don\u0027t fault you for it at all. Just the fact that you care enough to even check this patreon and my videos/stream out is plenty of support in and of itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
