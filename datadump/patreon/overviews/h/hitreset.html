This project is publishing crowdfunded video game analysis videos that rely on the support of an incredible and dedicated community of patrons.

Is it worth your time? Are there loot boxes? This is a perfectly valid, consumer-facing way of doing criticism, a way that I dip into from time-to-time, and perhaps the most prominent method of reviewing video games around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond,\u003c/strong\u003e you have the \"game design\" critics. These are the people asking if a game is breaking new ground, mechanically. The accuracy of the controls, the fidelity of the frame-rate, and other technical aspects of a game are where these writers are most proficient. Critics in this camp will often praise an excellent platformer before they talk about a top-tier visual novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThird,\u003c/strong\u003e you have the \"literary criticism\" critics. These critics highlight themes and tones in a game; the structure of a narrative and character arcs. They\u0027re the ones talking about political and philosophical nuance and how that influences the game\u0027s characters. They\u0027re not afraid to speak on religion, when the game necessitates it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo self-identify, I am pretty heavily in the third category, and will sometimes dip my toe into the second. The profound moments of a game and the meaning behind certain symbols are \u003cstrong\u003ewhy \u003c/strong\u003eHit Reset exists, but man, I \u003cstrong\u003esuper \u003c/strong\u003ecan\u0027t ignore the brilliance of something like Super Mario Odyssey; a game that doesn\u0027t advance the medium due to it\u0027s superb storytelling, but because it has created a world so slick and near perfection that it demands analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the inherent subjectivity of this form of criticism, some may sharply disagree with the ideas put forward here, and \u003cstrong\u003ethat\u0027s fine.\u003c/strong\u003e Let\u0027s talk! As a critic, the worst thing I could do is have an experience with a thing and then demand everyone else to have the same, or similar, experience. That\u0027s not the goal of Hit Reset. I am not striving for objectivity in criticism or a uniformity of opinion, but subjectivity that is responsible and philosophically, theologically, politically, and historically informed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a solid groundwork of issues and ideas, my aim is to analyze the video games we know and love and, hopefully, show them in a respectful light that both the game\u0027s creators can appreciate and fans can learn from and have dialogue with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nitty gritty: this project is \u003cstrong\u003every \u003c/strong\u003etime consuming as I play the game, often multiple times through, research the prescient symbols and ideas found therein, write a 2,000-3,000 word essay, and then edit a video that can range from 10-20 minutes, possibly more. Don\u0027t get me wrong I\u0027m not complaining, at all. This is what I love to do. My education is in philosophy and theology and I\u0027ve been writing for most of my adult life. And I mean we\u0027re talking about video games, come on, that\u0027s the best part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not complaining. I am expressing to you, dear reader and hopeful patron, that the time investment in doing just one video is pretty steep. I\u0027m talking about two to three weeks worth of work when I\u0027m off from my 9-5 and on weekends. It\u0027s a big ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you are interested in the thoughtful analysis I am putting forward, want to be in the conversation, or simply want to see someone succeed in an intensive but beloved project, consider becoming a patron. Your support is a direct line to me, allowing me to free up more time and more areas of my life so that I can pursue this passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis isn\u0027t about the money, but it kind of is?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I\u0027m not trying to get rich off of this. True, there are creators on Patreon making nearly seven figures from this thing, but that\u0027s not my goal, nor is it a reasonable expectation. My ambition with Patreon is simple: to be in the game\u0027s industry full-time: writing and creating videos. And the figure to get there is actually pretty tangible, just peep the goals column there on the left.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut whatever you decide to do, dear reader, thank you for getting so far in this wall of text. You\u0027re a soldier, that\u0027s for sure. If you\u0027re considering supporting Hit Reset, quickly look at the rewards there on the right. I have arranged what I think is a pretty nice list of rewards to help patrons decide on their level of support (not to turn this into a banal back-scratching affair, but there you go).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys are the reason I even attempt to do anything public like this. Find me on Twitter @tgraysawyer and hit me up with ideas for the channel or to discuss the goings-on in the gaming world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all, so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Tyler\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHit Reset\u003cbr\u003e"
