We continuously want to bring more value to our viewers, and by supporting us we\u0027re able to provide more fantastic supernatural content at a higher quality. Patreon is a platform for enabling just that very thing, and by using it, patrons (or Mad Hatters as we call them on Edge of the Rabbit Hole) receive some nice bonus perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mikericksecker.com/images/gears1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week Haunted Road Media creates 2 - 3 videos on YouTube featuring a variety of paranormal topics. Throughout the month we have other blog posts, articles, and stories that are released, including content that is release here on Patreon. Each time we release something we will mark it here as a piece of content you\u0027re supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the sidebar there are all the different monthly subscription tier levels you can enter into to help support Haunted Road Media and the different perks you will receive for doing so. Whichever tier you decide to enter into you will also receive all the perks from the lower tiers as well. So if you enter into the $10 per month tier you will also receive all the perks from the $3 and $1 tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMerchandise items that are a part of a tier (such as Ghostie) is a one time perk and will only be rewarded during the first month of your subscription. That is why we include a number of other great perks within that tier to which you\u0027ll have access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mikericksecker.com/images/coins1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables us to invest into producing free YouTube paranormal videos, ghost stories, and blogs for those in the YouTube and paranormal communities that would like to learn more about haunted locations, real experiences, and theories about the supernatural.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create valuable content, not to mention a whole lot of travel, which requires money.

We also help support haunted historic locations that are battling to stay in existence and stave off the wrecking ball.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a patron also helps us replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of our time to do more important things, like investing time into our loved ones!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, darn...
