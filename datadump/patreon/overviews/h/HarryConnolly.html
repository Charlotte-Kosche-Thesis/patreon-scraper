    "summary": "If you\u2019re here, you probably already know who I am, but just in case: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI wrote the \u003cem\u003eTwenty Palaces\u003c/em\u003e urban fantasy series and the apocalyptic epic fantasy trilogy \u003cem\u003eThe Great Way\u003c/em\u003e, along with some stand alone novels and short fiction. My debut novel, \u003cem\u003eChild of Fire\u003c/em\u003e (Del Rey), was listed in Publishers Weekly\u2019s Best 100 Books of 2009, and the two followups received starred reviews. In 2015, \u003cem\u003eThe Way into Chaos\u003c/em\u003e, the first book of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Great Way\u003c/em\u003e, received one of only 21 starred reviews given that year by Booklife, which is Publishers Weekly\u2019s self-published review wing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhich is to say that I write fast-paced adventure fantasy novels. Some people find them unconventional, and some people like them. The overlap of those two sets is where the best people ever get sorted. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHowever, writing these books takes time, and sometimes my finances get pretty thin in between releases. It doesn\u2019t help that the cost of living in Seattle keeps going up, and I won\u2019t be able to move my family out of here for a few years yet. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhich means we have a monthly shortfall. It\u2019s not a large shortfall, because we live cheap: no car, no cable TV, no phone and phone plan. But the shortfall is still there. If I have to, I could go back to temp work, but that would take up a huge chunk of my writing time, and I would be even less prolific than I am now. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking if you could pledge a small monthly token of support so I can keep my bills paid while working on my books full time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA lot of writers offer fiction rewards to Patreon backers, but I\u2019m not going to do that. As I said, I\u2019m not prolific, and there would be no point in running the Patreon if it required me to spend a week and a half out of every month on short fiction. What I will offer instead is a mini-essay/blog post that will cover books, film, storytelling, art in general, or the publishing business. No politics (for this space, at least). At most, the essays will be posted once a month, but I\u2019ll skip months when I\u2019m up to my eyeballs in fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support.  \u003cbr\u003e"
