    "summary": "HELLLLO EVERYBODY this is Havoc and welcome to my Patreon page. If you\u0027re here, then you are somewhat remotely interested in choosing to support me. Which is 100% awesome. But the down and dirty question is, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhy should you support me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s why. \u003c/strong\u003e2017 has been a revolutionary year for YouTube. What has hit hardest for me personally is the combination of people using ad-block software to bypass ads on YouTube, and the advertising fallout from the 1st quarter of the year. SO MANY YOUTUBERS are seeing their lives being wrecked with 40%+ of their revenue drying up right before their eyes, myself included.\u00a0Not only that, but the rise of ad-blocking apps also limits how many videos can actually be monetized, further decreasing a content creators ability to generate income.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a way to support your favorite YouTuber outside of just watching videos. Even the most basic pledge of $1/month provides more income for me than you watching every single video w/ads.\u00a0I know that doesn\u0027t sound believable, but let\u0027s break down the math behind it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Logic behind Patreon Support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMonetizing Transparency\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI love being transparent with my audience, especially when it enlightens them on the way YouTube works. As of right now, my Cost Per Mile (amount of money I get per 1,000 total views) sits at about $1-1.50.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal to average, 2 videos a weekday \u0026amp; 2 on the weekend for a total of 12 videos a week. That\u0027s around 600 a year. In order for a single viewer to watch my content 1,000 times to equate to my CPM, you\u0027d have to watch every video every single day for almost \u003cstrong\u003eTWO YEARS.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTime Transparency\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile this isn\u0027t as \"private\" in terms of analytics, it goes with the theme. On average my videos are 35 minutes each, every 10th part of a series is an hour. That means you\u0027re looking at close to 8.5 hours of video a week, around 35-40 hours of content a month, near 500 hours a year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour average movie ticket alone is $15 for only 2 hours of (hopefully enjoyable) content. Watching a movie a week could cost upwards of $60, not counting concessions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy point? For even $1/month, you are supporting me more than you could generate ad-wise in nearly years of watching my videos, AND you can use ad-block guilt-free. Even at $15/month, you are getting 10-20x more content than you would from a single movie. Are my videos more entertaining than a movie? If you\u0027re here reading this, then I believe that answer is yes!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeed more? How about I give back to you with reward tiers full of content and access to some private cool things such as Discord access, my artwork, ability to name characters, and more votes in future campaigns? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut really, this is a great way for me personally to interact with people as well. And not just people, but people who really truly want to help the channel and are able to go beyond front-page interactions and views. You all are absolutely amazing, and I hope that I\u0027ve given some insight as to why I\u0027m here on Patreon, and how you can help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all everyone. I\u0027ll see you late, this is Havoc and I\u0027m out of here....PEACE.\u003cbr\u003e"
