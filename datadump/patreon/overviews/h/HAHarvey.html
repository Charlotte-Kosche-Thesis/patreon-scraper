    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 I am a native of Arizona who grew up on the White Mountain Apache reservation, and lived all-over the state before enlisting in the Marine Corps and spending my enlistment overseas in Okinawa, Japan.\u00a0 From early in elementary school, I have had a deep love of history, mythology, fantasy, science-fiction, and the art of story-telling in all its forms.\u00a0 Growing up among the Apache people, combined with my studies into the peoples of history, their cultures, and their myths, all combined to give me a great appreciation for the many different perspectives of life . . . and how they are reflected in the stories we tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 I was introduced to the concept of role-playing when I was six and, by the time I was ten, I was using the medium to generate my own stories, and worlds within which to set them, and inviting my brothers and friends in to explore.\u00a0 It became clear (more quickly to everyone else than to myself) that I had a gift for storytelling.\u00a0 Repeatedly, family, friends, and even acquaintances that barely brushed the surface of my stories, each recommended, advised, and even pleaded that I start to write them down.\u00a0 However, I always viewed it as a hobby to be shared with friends, rather than a career.\u00a0 One needed a \"real\" profession, and being a starving artist never sounded like a good idea to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Then, after decades of generating my hobby for free, two things happened almost simultaneously.\u00a0 I found myself in a position where the daily grind life left me closer to the starving artist position than it was supposed to, and a family member finally convinced me to sit, stay, and \u003cem\u003ewrite\u003c/em\u003e!\u00a0 I sat.\u00a0 I thought.\u00a0 Finally, I found a starting point and . . .why hadn\u0027t I done this before?\u00a0 \"Pastimes\" became a thing of the past.\u00a0 Any moment that I was not absolutely required to be at my day-job, or collapsed asleep, I was writing.\u00a0 I\u0027d forget to eat.\u00a0 What was going to be a short story to see if I could actually do this \"writing thing\" became a 450 page epic novel that, while its core story was finished, only brushed the surface of the larger story that I had unearthed.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 I had my friends, family, and a few other interested parties \"beta-read\" my work, and they raved about it.\u00a0 However, I wanted to see if it was really any good, or people that knew me just didn\u0027t want to hurt my feelings.\u00a0 So, I self-published \"The Emissary\" as an e-book on Amazon (and requested that my friends/family \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e review it at all, so I could be sure of the results).\u00a0 When it received nothing but 4 and 5 stars, I was effectively hooked.\u00a0 It was settled.\u00a0 Going forward, whether or not I actually can make a living at it (yes, I\u0027m fully aware that something like 90% of even great artists\u0027 work never earn money until after they die . . . a fact I\u0027m sure they\u0027re \u003cem\u003eever so\u003c/em\u003e grateful for), I am a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, this meant life felt the need to test my resolve.\u00a0 I\u0027d hardly begun work on my second book when an unexpected and mandatory move was sprung upon me . . .followed by medical issues of a close friend that required attention.\u00a0 Still, progress continued, if more slowly than I would have liked.\u00a0 Then, when I was halfway done, catastrophe struck, and I lost my original copies of my first novel, over a decade of graphic-design work, and (of course) the work-in-progress book 2 . . . not to mention my computer.\u00a0 However, I was bitten, and there wasn\u0027t any turning back, so I borrowed money from a friend to re-equip, tracked down old beta-manuscripts that I had sent to my friends to replace the first novel, and then started back at 0 on the second book.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 My writing style seems to be uniquely my own, at least to me.\u00a0 Both when beginning my first novel, and while starting (both versions of) book 2, people ask how my outline is going.\u00a0 I have no answer for that, since I don\u0027t work off of one.\u00a0 Perhaps from my background in role-playing and cooperative story-telling, I am used to the characters in my stories having minds of their own and acting in ways that are difficult (but not impossible, therein lies the crux) to predict.\u00a0 I have a point of origin.\u00a0 I know what is going on in the world around my characters.\u00a0 I have a handful of key points of the story that they will encounter (though \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e precisely that happens is open to change).\u00a0 However, each character acts differently and however I may plan a scene as a \"director/narrator\", it always changes (sometimes slightly, sometimes drastically) once I place myself within an actor and their worldviews, experiences, and desires take hold.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 I love deep, rich characters, and abhor flat \"placeholder\" cutouts . . . so even minor characters are often so (off-page) developed that they could well have a novella exclusively about them.\u00a0 I like to write from a subjective viewpoint, immersing the reader into events as seen from the perspective of one character or another.\u00a0 Not just the dialog, but the tone and nature of the story\u0027s narrative changes depending upon who the reader currently \u0027rides\u0027 with.\u00a0 Sometimes, it is a tactical, direct evaluation from a hunter/warrior, other times, it becomes a wordy, easily-distracted narrative of an educated (and yes, a bit arrogant) noble.\u00a0 My studies of world history, as well as the time I have spent within other cultures besides my own, have given me a great appreciation for the spectrum of human perspective, and I try to convey that in creating characters who do not all think the same, or hold the same values.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 One of the most frequent compliments from my test readers is how immersive and intense the action sequences are, as well as their visceral realism.\u00a0 Credit for this goes in equal part to my rather intense high-school grammar and literature teacher (Mr. Howell, if you\u0027re still kickin\u0027 out there . . . you were right.\u00a0 I \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e cannot watch a full movie without mentally making corrections), and to my combined experiences with close-quarters combat in the Marines, amateur swordplay from a young age through adulthood, and brief foray into the world of Ken-do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why do I need Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 I\u0027ve already decided that writing is what I want, and am determined, to do, regardless of whatever else happens.\u00a0 However, I also like to think of myself as an at least semi-functioning adult and responsible family member.\u00a0 I need to make a living and be able to help my family while I keep writing.\u00a0 It\u0027d be oh, so nice if one could feed into the other.\u00a0 It would also mean that I could finish more works, and earlier, than I otherwise would be able to.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 The series I am currently working on is a saga on an epic scale.\u00a0 The first four books essentially compose act 1, and the series will likely be at least a dozen full-length novels when complete.\u00a0 I already have had requests to write spin-off novellas or smaller series on some of the characters from my first book, which I\u0027d love to do.\u00a0 I\u0027ve also been approached about collaborating on a sci-fi novel, and had a separate opening to write for a graphic novel series.\u00a0 I would love to do all of the above, but even simply completing the current series could well take me into old age while my writing is a non(or barely)-paying hobby, and the other projects are unlikely to be more than pipe-dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 If I can get funding through my writing, then that will give me time to finish the series, and devote time to the extra side projects as well.\u003cbr\u003e"
