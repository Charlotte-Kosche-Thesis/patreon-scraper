It\u0027s been a wonderful experience, especially thanks to the rhythm game community that has helped me and supported me through thick and thin. Thank you all, I truly appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, as music is hard to make a decent living from, I\u0027m working really hard to make my second dream come true...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA stable income so my best friend and life partner can move from the US to Sweden, so we can continue making more music under our alias \"Fractal Dreamers\" together with my Helblinde stuff. Patreon gives me a chance to get a somewhat stable income, as sales are always random, and also be able to direct content especially for you (sneak peeks of upcoming tracks, personalized content etc)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s okay if you can\u0027t support my goal, I value you equally for listening and enjoying my music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have someone else to fight for as well, that makes it all even more worth it."
