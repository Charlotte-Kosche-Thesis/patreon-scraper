    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Ame! I\u0027m a monster that like to make games!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently working on a few projects that I\u0027d like to release ! By supporting me here, you will get some builds and full releases before anyone else ! \n\u003cbr\u003e\nBelow is a\n\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e. You can scroll down to the \u0027\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"#projects\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eProjects\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027 section to read more about the games I\u0027m making !\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How does your tier system work?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA: My tier system is organised like a crowdfund; all tiers technically work the same way, but with separate tiers for each major project. I get to know what games you guys wanna see and whichever ones are backed more I will work on more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is the \u0027Support\u0027 tier?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA: The \u0027support\u0027 tier is a general tier people can use if they don\u0027t feel like supporting a specific project. If more people choose the support tier than anything else, I\u0027m also more likely to develop independent projects that will be released under my name rather than my team\u0027s name.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I\u0027d like to pledge, but can\u0027t afford it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA: Hey, that\u0027s alright ! This is entirely optional. I\u0027m always up for chatting about my projects and getting feedback from others, especially on \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/R_CADEZONE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Twitter\u003c/a\u003e. Pledging just enables me to start getting off my feet and being able to support myself. Thank you for your interest !\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why monthly rather than per project?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA: Having it be monthly rather than per project allows me support myself greater and keep track of interest. It\u0027s also more regular, so it\u0027s less of a hassle for others to keep track of financially and is less exploitable. (Patreon charges users on the first of every month !)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are the \u003ca name=\"projects\"\u003eProjects\u003c/a\u003e I have in development !\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMORI:\u003c/strong\u003e Mori is a primarily mobile game a lot like Animal Crossing ! It will borrow a lot of elements from similar RPGs and allow you to build up your town using resources collected. The game especially emphasises self-expression and will allow you to play as any of five different species along with different \"skin tones\" and gender expression. If you back mori, you can get a sneak peek at what this will look like !\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSAKURA:\u003c/strong\u003e Sakura is a semi-surrealist open world game about dreams inspired by Asmik Ace\u0027s \u003cem\u003eLSD\u003c/em\u003e and aims to further expand upon the concept of players forming the world around them. What you do in the world will affect how the world is presented to you and how the world interacts with you. You can make your dreams better, worse, more chaotic, or more static by destroying dreams and nightmares or by building up the dreams and nightmares. There is no true ending to the game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCUR\u0027S STORY:\u003c/strong\u003e Cur\u0027s Story is a game styled similarly to the \u003cem\u003eSonic the Hedgehog\u003c/em\u003e series. It is a collection puzzle platformer, kind of like joining mechanics of \u003cem\u003eSpyro \u003c/em\u003einto \u003cem\u003eSonic the Hedgehog\u003c/em\u003e and allows freedom for players to choose which play style they want to focus on more. \u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a summary of the story of the game:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCur, a lonely tanuki, is outlawed (to an extent) for their history of mob crime. As punishment for their sins, he has secluded himself in an outskirts town primarily as a rice farmer. To help support the town, he goes treasure hunting and sells the spoils. During an adventure, he is brought in by a tribe and asked for help to ease their wrathful god(s). Begrudgingly, Cur sets out to collect artifacts that will enable him to lay the god(s) to rest (or, perhaps, he will keep them to himself to sell in the city ?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eARCADE COLLECTION:\u003c/strong\u003e Miscellaneous games that I work on outside of my major projects will be part of the Arcade Collection. These games can range from racing, to puzzle, to rhythm, and even shooters ! Whatever ideas I may have and try to flesh out for a small game will go here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThose are the major projects in a nutshell ! If there\u0027s any more questions to ask, feel free to email me or even hit me up on twitter ! I love talking about my games and game mechanics, so I\u0027m open to just about any questions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you all so much!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e~Ame\n\u003cbr\u003e"
