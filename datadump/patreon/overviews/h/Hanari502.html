I\u0027m Hanari Solomon and I\u0027m a National Competitive Cosplayer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough if you\u0027re here you probably already knew that. And if you didn\u0027t....surprise!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/4e3283fb2f118eee2a954889f167e995/tumblr_owvbyzurhk1rkwx2po1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m originally from Springfield New Jersey, but I moved down to Florida in 2007 with my dad to get a fresh start on life. I ended up discovering conventions around the same time and immediately fell in love with them. It wasn\u0027t until 2011 that I started cosplaying at conventions, and it took until 2014 for me to consider competing in them. I\u0027ve grown to love the creation and crafting aspect of cosplay, as well as the performance aspect of it, and want to continue to compete in competitions across the country, and hopefully one day around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut cosplay, while fun, costs quite a bit. Especially costumes at the competitive level. These kinds of costumes can cost hundreds of dollars and take several months to complete. For some people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to get to a point where I can focus on cosplay not just as a career, but as a gateway into the professional world of costuming and design and armor making. My ultimate goal one day is to work for a major media company and make costumes and the like for actors and dancers and models alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping, with the help of all of the people who appreciate my work and want to help support me in it, that this dream can be realized. It might take a while, maybe up to ten years even, but I\u0027m not going to give up this passion any time soon. I\u0027m here and I\u0027m going to put all of myself into it for as long as I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/5bde4da121fa188c5b8853bbe11d0bd3/tumblr_owvbyzurhk1rkwx2po2_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons pledge a set amount per month that I produce content for. That content varies from private photoshoot picture previews to HD downloads, to physical items like prints, Tshirts, and a variety of other things depending on the tier they pledge at. Content is produced on a weekly basis, at minimum, and is deleted at the beginning of every month to prevent pledge fraud. This is to keep the content new and relevant and to keep a cycle going of what is available.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nContent explanation:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePatreon exclusive Cosplay Of The Month photos are released on a weekly basis. There is no set schedule as each COTM photo amount varies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eVideos are released at random and can range from video game streams to cosplay streams to tutorials on how I make several of my props\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePhysical items of the previous month are shipped out on the 2nd, after the pay period is up. So if you were a pledger for July, your items would be shipped out on August 2nd for the July pledge period. Your August items would be shipped out September 2nd, and so on and so forth.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eHD digital download zip files are released on the 30th of every month and will be taken down on the 5th of the next month. This gives pledgers 6-7 days to download them before they\u0027re gone forever!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBikini and Fashion photoshoots will be taken every 3 months once the #500 goal is hit, and released sporadically throughout the months. Shoots will vary, but prints will always be announced to each tier.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMore tiers and pledge prizes will be added as each milestone is reached. There are 4 milestones that I\u0027m reaching for so help me get to the next one!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThere is also an option to pledge without receiving anything in return. You can do this, but I think it would be better for you to get some cool stuff out of it, don\u0027t you think?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve worked so hard to get to where I am, and working on cosplay in this gigantic field of nerdisms is something that I know I want to do for the rest\u00a0of my life. I would absolutely love if you were to become one of the ones to help me get there.\u003cbr\u003e"
