We\u0027re Horrible People Productions, and we\u0027re a trio of friends who like to make card games (and maybe board games?) for fun. We like to focus on lightweight games that are easy to pick up and explain, fun and quick to play, and easy to cart around. And best of all, we release them all \u003cstrong\u003efor free\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0so you can print them out and try them at home! We make games because we want to see more cool games out there to play, and that means there\u0027s more cool games for YOU to play too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat have you made?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47848137/TSSSF-Patreon-Pic.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47848137/BABOC-Patreon-Pic.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47848137/etc-Patreon-pic.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eOur first game is \u003cem\u003eTwilight Sparkle\u0027s Secret Shipfic Folder\u003c/em\u003e, which is a (very unofficial) My Little Pony game. In this game, you are Twilight Sparkle, Equestria\u0027s most prolific and horrific fanfic writer, and you are shipping* yourself, your friends, and your family together regardless of blood-relation, orientation, or harmonious mane and coat color combination! It pokes loving fun at shipping and fan culture, and of course ourselves.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tsssf-tcg.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYou can check it all out here\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(165,165,165);\"\u003e* What\u0027s shipping? Shipping is what happens when \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0decide that two characters love each other very much. It comes from the term \u0027relationshipping\u0027.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also working on another game with the working title \"Build a Better OC\"! This would be a game in which you compete to make the sparkliest, specialest, awesomest, best-worst, deviantart-est OCs ever! \u00a0If you\u0027re interested in this game, you\u0027d like the $7+ tier for this Patreon: we post all of our playtest notes and diaries here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s with the Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMaking games is a fun and fulfilling hobby, but we can\u0027t really spend the time we want to spend on it without some financial assistance. Plus, taking our games to conventions takes a lot of extra dough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t presently make money personally on card sales -- especially not Secret Shipfic sales -- so Patreon is the only way we earn cash back for what we do. So if you want to support us, this is a fantastic way to do it! As we learn and grow, and hopefully get a non-licensed game out there and ready for sale, our situation will change, but for now, this is it, sugar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, regardless of whether or not you support us, we will always be making games and our games will always be released for free. The Patreon just helps us get there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight, but what IS Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBrilliant question, invisible question-asker! Patreon is a\u00a0crowdfunding platform that allows fans of our games to pledge recurring support. You determine the amount you\u0027re willing to contribute per version release of our games. Luckily, you can also set a monthly cap of how much you\u0027re willing to spend, so if we go CRAZY GO NUTS and do like fifty releases in a month, you\u0027re only charged at the maximum you want to spend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part is that you\u0027re not charged a cent if we don\u0027t release content first! So you\u0027re never left wondering where your contribution went and when you\u0027re going to get something in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat counts as a \"version release\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eA version release, for the purposes of earning your contribution, is a new release of one of our games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhile they\u0027re still in playtesting, that means each time we release a new alpha or beta version with significant updates, that\u0027s a version release.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen a game is completed, that\u0027s a version release.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen a new version of an expansion is released, that\u0027s a version release.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e...and so on, and so forth!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt our current pace, we are aiming to get 1-3 releases out each month, so make sure you set your monthly cap as necessary!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA significant release means that it has to have real \u003cem\u003emeat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to it. For the most part, we can\u0027t just update three cards and call that a new version. The only time that\u0027s not true is when a game is past 1.0 and we are making the last fiddly changes necessary to really make it shine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOtherwise,\u00a0to qualify, a release must have significant updates in the form of art, rules changes, mechanics updates, and/or meaningful wording updates and must be different enough to qualify as a separate version from the last!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eObviously, you get the satisfaction of knowing that you\u0027re helping a group of creative independent folks create more fun games! But you ALSO get cool stuff, depending on what tier you pledge to! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that all tiers come with access to every tier that has come before it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor \u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e, you get access to every release we put on our Patreon. That means alphas -- which are otherwise never released to the public. That also means you get betas a whole week early, too. When we do the weekly art stream, you\u0027re invited to that, and you always get access to our general Patreon posts. That\u0027s a LOT of stuff for a dollar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor \u003cstrong\u003e$7\u003c/strong\u003e, you get to see all the art we do for all the card games as we release it, even though it\u0027s otherwise not public. And you can vote for whatever cards you\u0027d like to see us draw next! You also get access to our many and sundry Playtest Diaries, where we talk about our triumphs, our failures, what worked, what definitely didn\u0027t work, and more. Ever want to see how we put together a game? Check it out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor \u003cstrong\u003e$15\u003c/strong\u003e, you get access to ALL the art livestreams we do for HPP games! You also get to cast your vote for which game or expansion we work on next, once one is over and done with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor \u003cstrong\u003e$50\u003c/strong\u003e, you get a ticket for every release we put out, so long as your money went through. That ticket goes into a raffle. One people is chosen each release to have 1 custom card created for them, art and all. ALL PATRONS will receive access to the digital file for this card.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, you get access to our new monthly Chat with the Devs that we\u0027ll be starting in 2015! Join us in a chatroom and ask us questions or just shoot the breeze."
