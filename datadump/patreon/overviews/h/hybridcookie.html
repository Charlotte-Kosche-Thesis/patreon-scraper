I appreciate you stopping by my Patreon page to\nhave a gander. Come in, rest your feet, have a cuppa tea, just, y\u2019know. Ease\nand unwind, I say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn all seriousness, My name is Tony, and I like to draw things. Lately, my love has been for comic related things! My ultimate goal is to entertain, to share stories I otherwise just tell to myself, and to simply give folks stuff that they haven\u0027t seen before.\nWhile standalone pieces are fun to do (and will be showcased here, too!), I want storytelling to be my main priority, and I would love for more and more people to enjoy the work I have to share. I currently have two ongoing stories that I am actively working on, which are as follows;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tapas.io/series/Hybrid-Cookie\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://devoidcomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cookies-transparent.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://devoidcomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sample001.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAt Least We Have\nCookies\u201d has gone through a few iterations before finally taking the form of a\ncasual slice-of-life story that just sort of goes where the wind takes it. It\nstars one of my oldest characters, Tony Caline, as well as his friend/sister figure Silvia, in a tale about makin\u2019 friends, learning general life lessons, and of course, consuming baked\ngoods whenever applicable. This one is the\nlower priority of the two I\u2019m running, but it is something I\u0027m working on when I have to take a break from the adventure story. Speaking of which...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://devoidcomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://devoidcomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017LOGO-transpar-e1499649089733.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://devoidcomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sample002.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003c/div\u003eDevoid follows the adventure of one lone doggy creature by the name of Meryl\nthat winds up in the afterlife due to an unfortunate clerical error of sorts, and, determined to return back to the way things had been before, she embarks on a journey to find out a way to return to the land of\nthe living. The story will proceed to chronicle her adventures as she makes new\nfriends, battles new foes, and continues to uncover the secrets of the Second Plane. Unbeknownst to her, a\nwar looms on the horizon, and before long she and her companions will soon be at\nthe center of it all. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFurther Thoughts, and the Future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u2019ve stated, I wish to create comics and stories\nfor folks to enjoy. It is my actual dream to one day be capable of surviving\noff of my craft entirely. At present, I am having to rely on an\non-again/off-again IT job that has yet to bear proper fruit, and the path has\nbeen rickety. If I can get to a point where art is my living, it won\u2019t be an\nissue any longer and I can literally focus on my artwork. While I don\u2019t expect\nthis to take hold anytime soon, I will keep working toward it as an eventuality\none day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut that\u2019s where you come in! By supporting my work via Patreon, not only do you bring me one step closer\n(oh, EVER-so-closer) to my ultimate goal, but you\u2019ll be rewarded for it, as\nwell! Check the tiers for extra details, but patrons will potentially gain\naccess to special art just for them, desktop backgrounds of\ntheir favorite characters, anything of that nature. Maybe even postcards per\nthe holidays! (We\u2019ll have to see about that one, but, regardless!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe comics, if all goes well, will be here FIRST! Devoid (and eventually At Least We Have Cookies) has its own webpage that you can visit, bookmark, and indulge in the material at your leisure. However, Patrons will be able to take a peek at pages at least a week (maybe even two!) in advance! In addition, you\u2019ll get sneak\npeaks to the stories I\u0027m working on well in advance, AND,\nif all goes well, certain tiers may even gain access to side-stories I create,\nfeaturing either characters from my main series\u2019 on their own little\nadventures, or even one-shot stories with original characters not inclusive to\nmy current storylines! The latter options would require more time to handle, so essentially, the more support I receive, the more time I can put into the artwork!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat being said, I hope you decide to pledge to my Patreon,\nand if you think my work is worth it, feel free to point others in my direction\nas well! Your support is vastly appreciated, and I look forward to providing\nproper content in the days and weeks to come.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u2019s shoot for financial independence! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e( Maybe! ) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e((\nSomeday. )) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e((( Goodness, I hope. )))\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(((( Thank you for your time \u0026lt;3 ))))\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
