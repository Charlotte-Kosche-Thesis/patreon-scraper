    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWhat makes a fairytale? Magic and witches, knights and princes, evil sorcerers? But if the witch doesn\u0027t know she\u0027s a witch, and the prince doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s a prince, and the evil sorcerer doesn\u0027t...Well it can still be a fairytale, as long as you start with \"once upon a time\"...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there! My name is Hayley (\"Hi Hayley\") and I am a writer. It\u0027s an affliction I\u0027ve grown familiar, comfortable, with over the past twenty-two years. But when I was sixteen I had the idea for a story. I could go into the whole sob story about how the inspiration for the idea came from the aftermath of my brain working correctly after being diagnosed with some chronic illness and properly medicated for the first time ever, but that\u0027s boring. And probably an oversimplification.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing back to the story idea I had, I sat in my English class on February 17th, the day after I had this idea, and I started writing a list of characters. That was the start of a four day weekend, so I went home, pulled up a word document, and started the character sheets. I think I went to sleep around three in the morning - a time of night I was rapidly going to become familiar with. On May 16th, I finished the first draft. It was 258,000 words give or take, approximately 900 double-spaced pages in 12pt Bell MT font, and it was trash.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was complete trash, and I realised as I started editing it that there was no cause for there to be six first person narrators. So (completed) draft two had only three. But then I scrapped that version, and went down to one narrator and set it in a town instead of a boarding school, and wrote three or four versions in the town of Lucittia, and then scrapped all of those and came up with an island - the Island of Light.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntermittently throughout this process, I would send query letters to agents, wait my 6-10 weeks for a rejection, and then rewrite the book again. And again. And again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe version I\u0027m publishing now, the version I\u0027m publishing as a serial novel on tumblr.com, was started on August 3rd of 2016. I don\u0027t remember exactly when I finished the draft, but it was definitely before August 29th. And it was finally time to do \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with it. I was inspired by the success of various webcomics (namely Ngozi Ukazu\u0027s delightful and wonderful webcomic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://omgcheckplease.tumblr.com \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck, Please!\u003c/a\u003e) and thought to myself that maybe it would be fun - and in character for the fictional universe I\u0027ve created - to publish it as a serial novel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is just a long winded way to say I\u0027m writing a YA fantasy novel and publishing it as a serial and hopefully that inspires you to take a look, see what kind of bizarre hybrid Downton Abbey and X-Men make when they\u0027re set in a land that\u0027s half Greek Mythology and half Arthurian legend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lucittia.wordpress.com\"\u003eYou can find the story here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
