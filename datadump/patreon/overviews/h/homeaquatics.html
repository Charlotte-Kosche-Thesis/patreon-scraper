    "summary": "Hello everyone! My name is Jorge (George) and I am the owner\nof Home Aquatics; A YouTube channel where I make weekly Vlogs related to Guppy Fish Keeping. I believe in creating a community among aquarists and enjoy\nteaching others while learning from them at the same time. Because of this I created my YouTube channel where I release weekly videos. I also have a Facebook group dedicated to keeping Guppy Fish to allow hobbyists to help one another. Additionally, I\u0027ve always been interested in photography and have recently added this skill to my existing hobby. I prefer to take pictures of nature, wildlife, and everything encompassing the two. With your monthly patronage I hope to be able to\nexpand Home Aquatics and my skills to a new level!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon will help me with the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. Allow me to put out more videos more often with new and\nhopefully exciting content\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. Fund the supplies required to keep the fish as well as\nsupplies for new projects\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3. Help me give back to the community; excess funds if available\nwill make for giveaways for my supporters\u003cbr\u003e4. Fund the build of my next fish room\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEvery donation will be put back into Home Aquatics including;\nthe time spent making videos and taking photos, fish supplies, project supplies, giveaways\nfor subscribers and supporters, and my new Fishroom. Every penny counts and even the smallest donation means the world to me. Thank you for the great support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube Channel (Home Aquatics):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqll8XNwabGNwE3EWwo8bA?view_as=subscriber\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqll8XNwabGNwE3E...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook Group (Guppy Fish Enthusiasts): \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1221279571251984/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1221279571251984/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to Aquarium Co-op, \"Sure some are skeptical the money won\u0027t make channels any better. That is the beautiful part of Pateon. You can choose to stop supporting a creator. I can only imagine what I could do with the extra funds....\u00a0$1 per month would outweigh all the revenue from ads by far for creators. With the majority of people using ad block, this is a simple way to say \"thank you, keep making content I enjoy\" at an affordable price for a lot of the world. I hope that with a minimal sacrifice we can vastly improve the quality of the fish youtube community. \""
