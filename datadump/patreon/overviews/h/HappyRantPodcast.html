We have even been able to start doing live events and \u003cem\u003eloved\u003c/em\u003e the interaction with you, our listeners. As the Happy Rant podcast has grown over the past couple years so too have our costs - hosting, recording, editing, equipment, and events. We want to continue bringing the decadence (and occasional sheetcake) and have the opportunity to do even more! We are so thankful for you as a listener and would be even more appreciative if you would consider supporting the podcast monthly with even a small donation. \u003cbr\u003e"

Too \nmuch Christian interaction with culture is angry and vitriolic, so these\n three bring the humor, pith, and occasional irreverence to bear on it. \nThey rant about church, culture, sports, the arts, entertainment, and \noccasional nonsense in a manner listeners enjoy and wish they could be \npart of too.",
