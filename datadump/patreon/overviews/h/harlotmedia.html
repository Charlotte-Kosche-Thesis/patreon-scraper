And we need your help to make this dream a reality! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike what we\u2019re doing? Want to see us continue? Consider becoming our patron to help us keep signal-boosting voices from the margins - sex workers, trans and nonbinary people, people of color, people with disabilities, refugees, immigrants, queer folks, and others without a platform. Every $1 you give goes directly to site maintenance, our diverse staff of writers and workers, and community events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis \u003ca href=\"http://harlot.media/donate\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003einfographic on our site\u003c/a\u003e shows the numbers of people in various marginalized identities that we have employed (as writers, artists, and admin staff) in the last 30 days. Supporting us means supporting marginalized communities, in so many ways."
