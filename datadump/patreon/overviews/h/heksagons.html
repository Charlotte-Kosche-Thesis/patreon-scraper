Since piracy won\u0027t go away, there is a need for a new way to fund artists. Patronage is that way. Patronage is just throwing some change in our hat. If you throw some change in our hat we\u0027ll give you a wink and a grin - and some extra special goodies that nobody else gets!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can tip as little as $1 or as much as you like. \u003cbr\u003eThink of it as a kickstarter that supports artists in the long term.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe promise that you will get at least one new \u0027thing\u0027 every month. \u003cbr\u003eA song, a video, a mash up, a remix, a puppet show...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDifferent levels of tip will mean access to extras. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor only $1 a month you will get blog posts that the public can\u0027t see and early access to the music, music videos, video blogs etc. You can also feel awesome because you are an early adopter of the future of music and art funding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $25 you can get an ongoing music production course from Bobby. Bobby has produced music for DIOYY?, remixed Linkin Park and 50 Cent and made music for films, computer games and commercials. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can even become a full partner and Executive Producer of the band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think Patreon could be the way in which alternative music will be saved.

We make music that we like and we hope that others like it. We want everyone to have it. If you can\u0027t afford music we still want you to have it. We are happy to work for tips. Because that\u0027s all this patronage thing is. Being able to tip artists who give art away for us all to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last time there was a revolution in music, it was punk embracing the DIY ethic. Kids pressing their own records, creating their own fanzines and bypassing the established industry. That was 40 years ago. Now artists have the technology to make our own recordings, shoot our own videos, create our own blogs and fanzines and have access to a potential 7 billion fans. Now that there\u0027s a mechanism to show support to music again, things could get really exciting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ee can all be patrons of the arts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBobby \u0026amp; Hinhin x\u003cbr\u003e"
