    "summary": "The first time I learned how to burn a CD was mind-blowing. It was 1999 and YouTube didn\u2019t exist. Most of the web was brochure sites with marquees and hit counters, so there wasn\u2019t a great place for learning how to do literally anything. Instead, my cousin came over and showed me. He brought a blank CD, opened software on my computer, dragged the songs I wanted into this window and clicked, \u201cBurn.\u201d A few minutes later, BOOM. I had my very own mix CD. What jumped out at me the most was how easy it was when someone was there to show me the way. I felt \n\u003cstrong\u003eaccomplished\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nThat experience did 2 things for me. It allowed me to have a very successful mix CD business in high school, and it made me realized I just needed to try things in order to learn them. I felt \n\u003cstrong\u003eempowered\u003c/strong\u003e by the fact that someone showed me the way. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to feel empowered too.\u003c/strong\u003e That\u2019s why I started this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Donate?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI love being an educator. Because of that, I put out a bunch of free content. My weekly podcast, YouTube videos, blog posts, and eBooks to name a few. I\u2019d love to do a lot more of that. I\u2019d actually love to focus on the full time! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m lucky enough to work for myself. I support my family with sponsorships, online courses, and freelance work. With your support, I can switch focus away from freelance work, to creating more great content. I want to make better resource for learners and educators, spend more time researching interesting topics, and tell more great stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIs Donating for You?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have a confession. Asking for donations has never come easy for me. But I\u2019m also really passionate about teaching, and Patreon is a great way to get the freedom to do that more. For just $1/month, you can get access to not only incredible content, but more access to me. $12/year is like one month of Netflix!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s a big but though. You should only donate if you find value in what I\u2019m doing. There\u2019s lots of great content out there, and lots of people vying for your hard-earned money. I only want you to donate if you dig what I\u2019m doing. Rest assured, my blog, podcast, and YouTube channel will continue to have quality free content. Donating (and reaching my goals) just means more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThank You! \u003c/h3\u003e\n\tI wouldn\u2019t be able to do this at all without the incredible support I\u2019ve gotten so far from family and friends, guests, sponsors, and of-course, you!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
