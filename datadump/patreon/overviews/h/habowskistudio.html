     "about": "Hi - Thank you for checking out my Patreon page. Let me give you a little background about myself.\u003cbr\u003eBIO\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was born in 1966 in Orlando, Florida, I have been creating art since I can \u003cbr\u003e\n\nremember. After moving to Maine from Florida in 1991, I began in earnest to pursue my art career. At first I experimented with various mediums, but since 1993 the focus has been working exclusively in oil . The medium\u2019s range of \u003cbr\u003e\n\nexpression enables me to fully realize the potential of my artistic ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy award-winning work has been exhibited in many juried shows across the country and has been included in the 2001 and the 2003 biennials at the Portland Museum of Art in Portland, Maine. In addition they have also been \u003cbr\u003e\n\nexhibited in the biennials at the Center for Maine Contemporary Art in \u003cbr\u003e\n\nRockland, Maine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nABOUT MY OIL PAINTINGS\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo characterize my paintings would be to call them Events of the \u003cbr\u003e\n\nEveryday. It is in these events that I extract the unexpected. Being a self \u003cbr\u003e\n\ndirected artist, my education has consisted of reading about and studying the work of artists that have informed my work: Richard Diebenkorn, John Register, Robert Bechtle, and Linden Fredrick to name a few. By far, though, the most influential artist has been Edward Hopper. It was his work and vision that \u003cbr\u003e\n\nencouraged me to pursue the idea of painting my contemporary existence.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause of this desire to reflect the times, my paintings encompass a range of subjects, from back alleys of urban sprawl to intimate interiors. For me, this diverse approach reflects all facets of life, for I believe that we do not exist in one space but experience many in the course of our lives. Everything affects us in some way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo strengthen my message, I blend the realist tradition with poetic \u003cbr\u003e\n\ninterpretation. This melding of visual facts with emotion allows me to infuse my \u003cbr\u003e\n\npersonality into the painting to arrive at a new restructured reality. This new \u003cbr\u003e\n\nreality is further enhanced by my affinity with light. It\u2019s ability to dramatize is \u003cbr\u003e\n\ncritical in revealing the subjects full potential by elevating it from the mundane to the magical.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI imagine, thus it becomes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",
