Yikes, eh? The next game in the series is an RPG/FPS that shall be simply called \"Half-Rats\", and it is currently being developed on Unreal Engine 4. We are currently in the planning/pre-production phase. The game will once again take place in the 1880s and will feature the intrepid \"Half-Rats\", a diverse cast of relate-able characters, as well as continue the paranormal/horror motif with an evolving story line that begins as an action/adventure and ends in a fight for survival against an other-worldy host of supernatural horrors. The game will feature period-accurate architecture, clothing, speech and weaponry, as well as fantastical elements such as a spellcasting/enchantments system and wondrous retrofuturistic sci-fi technology. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSounds like a neat idea, but whah?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll just rip this off our IndieDB page and paste it here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"A Paranormal \nFirst-Person Shooter, based on the story, \"The Rather Extraordinary \nCircumstances of \u0027Half-Rats\u0027\".
