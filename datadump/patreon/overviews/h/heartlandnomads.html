For those of you who don\u0027t know us, my name is Chi and I\u0027m the singer-songwriter of the band and Greg is our guitarist. We\u0027re an American-roots band based in Brooklyn, NY.

I don\u2019t think any of us will ever forget that day. Their passing reminded us how precious life is, how quickly it can come to an end, and that we are never guaranteed tomorrow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wanted to carry out their legacy of being fearless and brave, and we knew the best way to honor their lives was to do the thing that scared us most. So in 2015, we decided to become musicians. And that\u0027s how we became the Heartland Nomads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been a band since 2015 and the ride has been wild. We moved across the country, from California to New York. We released our first EP last fall, \u003cem\u003eSmall but Fortunate\u003c/em\u003e. We\u0027ve played for thousands of people. We\u0027ve gone on two tours, going on three!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of 2016, we decided to take a giant leap of faith and quit our part-time restaurant jobs to become full-time, independent musicians. It was a terrifying decision, but we knew it was our next step. And by the complete grace of God, we\u0027ve been able to get by, by the skin of our teeth. But we want to be a band for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eJOIN THE NOMAD FAN CLUB!\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to invite you to be a part of our Nomad Fan Club!\u00a0Patreon is a complete gamechanger for us.

The two met in Los Angeles, California while working at Liberty in North Korea, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rescuing and resettling North Korean refugees. With powerhouse vocals, lyrically driven songs, and stripped down instrumentation, their music tells compelling stories that speak to the human condition. They are pursuing music independently, performing at venues, festivals, and nursing homes across New York City. They have completed two tours \u2014 one cross-country tour and one Northeast tour with Sofar Sounds. In October 2016, they released their debut EP, \u003cem\u003eSmall but Fortunate. \u003c/em\u003eThey are going on their second cross-country tour with their EP in August 2017.",
