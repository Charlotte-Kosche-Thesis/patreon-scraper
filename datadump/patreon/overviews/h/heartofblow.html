    "summary": "To $lick, becoming an adult is the most misleading + foolish idea ever! It\u2019s where majority of people live the rest of their lives working, making money for others, bills + barely have enough left over to do what they want, how they want or to buy what they want. Luckily for him he lives in America where if you\u2019re at least still in some type of school, they let you get away with a bunch of $#!*. So using this as his loophole to avoid this tragedy from happening to him, he enrolls into PoP University + vows to learn, progress + enjoy life every day + not just when it\u2019s convenient. Aware that you also need funds to do so he sets up a scheme where he converts classmates to patrons who help finance his way through school + life by viewing his online Notes - Filled with his ideas, thoughts, opinions, projects + would be life hacks to never grow up + childi$h triumphs for a small fee, where they learn to do + live the same. The twist is they also fund his bad habits of creating $#!* which they receive for free or at a discounted rate. Guess he\u2019ll never have to grow up after all if he\u2019s always doing what he loves, which some look at as Trouble, especially his cousin Richie Rich.
