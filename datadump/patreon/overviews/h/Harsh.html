I loved popular culture so much I became an illustrator and writer. Now I have stories of my own to tell, and would love to hire other creatives to join me in the effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron Benefits\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst, Patrons joining me \non this journey will forever have my gratitude. You are making my dreams possible, and I cannot express how thoroughly grateful I am for that. \u003cbr\u003eSecond, Patrons will gain access to behind the scenes content, my\ncreative process, insights into design and development tasks, and a\n variety of high resolution downloads. Some Patrons may also acquire \nmerchandise discounts and customized and/or personalized artwork. Additionally, the more Patrons we gain the more creative talent I can hire to help me bring my projects to life.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePassion Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Art of Harsh has been the vehicle through which I have freelanced as an artist/illustrator and graphic designer for many years. To begin producing my own characters, stories, and worlds, however, I have also become a game designer, publisher, and writer through Harsh Realities. As I move more completely into creating these projects and properties - and there are many! - I hope Patrons will join me in the excitement of watching it all come together and seeing it all published. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Projects and Properties\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked for other people\u0027s dreams and imaginations for nearly twenty years now. During that time I kept dozens of sketchbooks and notes of characters and worlds I would someday bring to life. I\u0027ve dreamed of animated features, comic books and graphic novels, film projects, novels, tabletop games, sweeping video game concepts, and I can see many of these properties taking on lives of their own into other media as well. I am placing no limitations on where these properties could go, or how expansive they could be. I believe in dreaming big, and I am sincerely seeking kindred spirits to join me on this amazing journey. \u003cbr\u003eMy big dream is to establish a production studio in the Austin, TX area, hire a staff of capable creatives, and produce various story-based projects and products in a variety of genres, genre mash-ups, and sub-genres. I want my staff to employ their imaginations, be creative, and present amazing stories and spectacular visuals. My motto is to be unbound by the restraints of adult life. Let your imagination run free - #beunbound! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been creative. I started drawing at age four. I started plotting genre mash-ups when I decided to make my G.I. Joes into the Knights of Camelot with a roll of masking tape and cereal box cardboard. My professional career began in October of 2002 when I was contracted to do two creature illustrations for the Bestiary of Krynn, a Dragonlance source book for the 3.x D\u0026amp;D game system. In one fashion or another, I have been working as an artist ever since. \u003cbr\u003e"

I have always loved comic books and roleplaying games, both tabletop and console/PC, and enjoy a variety of board and card games as well. \u003cbr\u003eIn 2012, my game company Harsh Realities, published Sixcess Core, a 6-sided dice based tabletop roleplaying game system. I am currently working toward the creation and publication of Sixcess 2nd Edition and several Setting and Mini-Setting books, as well as several support and source books. It is through this process that I have come to realize I have stories to tell. Over the years I have toyed with the idea of writing and illustrating comic books, web comics, and even a graphic novel, but never saw any of it through as it is a major undertaking for one person alone. I believe these stories may yet find an outlet through Harsh Realities, however, and sincerely hope they do. \u003cbr\u003e",
