    "summary": "\u003cimg\u003eHow did you discover Healthy Words? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve always enjoyed the magic, power and flexibility of words.  Seeking the word \"joy\" and all that it means literally saved my life and granted me access to a positive state of mind.  I was 18 years of age and could have only dreamt of the wonderful journey that quest would take me on.  It would be 18 years later, 17 of those spent instructing creative-writing workshops, that I would find myself being led on this extraordinary discovery in language and the power of words.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was standing in front of approximately 60 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders preparing to create a walk of inspiration - inspirational messages in chalk - outlining their school on the sidewalk.  I asked the group for a positive message, and they told me stop the violence.  Years prior to this moment, I began to challenge students to communicate from a positive state of mind.  Following that train of thought, I asked if anyone knew the opposite of violence.  I waited.  For the first five minutes I thought they were just giving me a hard time.  It was in the next five minutes that their frustration, combined with my disbelief, revealed a silent epidemic.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, none of those 60 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders that day knew peace, tranquility, harmony and love are the opposite of violence.  Second, and I believe most importantly, the overwhelming majority of students in underprivileged and at-risk environments lack a healthy literary diet and, therefore, do not have the necessary tools and vocabulary to combat unhealthy ideas, beliefs and choices - in essence, isolating them within a negative state of mind that can manifest itself in a variety of unfortunate outcomes.  This discovery, combined with the request from a local boys\u0027 and girls\u0027 club to create a positive vocabulary-generating process, prompted me to create Healthy Words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Benefits of Healthy Words\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProvide millions of young people and their families with the necessary vocabulary to grant them access to a positive state of mind and beneficial ideas, beliefs and choices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Improve self-esteem, self-efficacy and self-respect by improving one\u0027s self-talk. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.

Provides the necessary vocabulary to create positive personal, home and social environments, granting everyone with more opportunities for personal and collective success and prosity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6.
