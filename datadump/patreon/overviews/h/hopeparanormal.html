Most paranormal investigators look for proof of ghosts, I speak to them and record their messages. My approach is different than most, as my goal is always to help them. Whether its to try and move them on to a better place or just know someone is listening, my approach is always with compassion. My group is called H.O.P.E. Paranormal and stands for Helpers Of Paranormal Entities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W6HsAMPg5Ic\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s not just the deceased that I\u0027ve tried to help. The living are a big part of my life as well :) That means YOU! I have created a Youtube Channel that has organically grown over the course of time and I\u0027ve had the opportunity to virtually meet so many amazing people. Together we are on a spiritual journey. But so many of you have asked me to connect with your loved ones and like STEVE HUFF, a great friend and mentor in this field, I\u0027ve created this PATREON page to do just that. Try and connect with your loved ones on a monthly basis. This page is a symbiotic way for us to help each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve done in the past, I will intuitively and with technology I own (Best there is to date), connect with your loved ones and try and receive a message for you. In turn your small contribution allows me to continue the work and be supported doing so. I will have 3 different levels of support with rewards to choose from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a couple videos showing the group sessions I\u0027ve done in the past where I successfully was able to contact souls on the list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Du73v3M5GXw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iukn2PduVmQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE read the rewards and goals to learn more and I thank you for JOINING me on this AMAZING journey!!"

One where I\u0027ve received so many answers and amazing pieces of evidence. I\u0027ve spent so much time and money doing these sessions and reviewing what I\u0027ve captured. Editing the videos and then posting and discussing the findings with all of you amazing people. It\u0027s been so rewarding but difficult to keep up with at times. Truly this is what I love to do and honestly, my GOAL is to continue to do it on a more serious level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I hit 200 Patrons, I will expand yet again what I\u0027m doing and put more of what is made through this platform, into creating more content for all of you.
