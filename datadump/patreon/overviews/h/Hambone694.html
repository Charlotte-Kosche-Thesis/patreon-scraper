    "summary": "For the past six years, I have spent countless hours creating what I feel is the best YouTube channel in the world for premium Oklahoma Sooners football highlight videos. I now need the support of all of my subscribers to continue doing what I love. I have been blessed with an opportunity that I have dreamed of for many years, which is to attend the University of Oklahoma. And as I\u0027m\u00a0sure you are all aware, tuition is VERY expensive. And while my family has been very gracious to help pay my way through school, some sacrifices will have to be made. Luckily, with your help, my YouTube channel doesn\u0027t have to be one of them. To continue making OU highlights I need a new laptop that I can take with me to college that has the capabilities to run all the programs necessary for me to make such great videos. I\u0027m also having to save up for college which means picking up more shifts at my local job. But the more supporters I have from my Patreon page, the less time I can spend at work, and the more time I can spend making content for you all to enjoy. So I hope that I can count on your support and continue on this channel\u00a0for many years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I structured my rewards on a per video basis so that if I\u0027m not making videos, you\u0027re not having to contribute. I also spend a lot of time on my videos which means I rarely post more than once a week. So you don\u0027t have to worry about paying a ridiculous amount of money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!"
