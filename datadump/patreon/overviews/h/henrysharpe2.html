    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/hCFDZS\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/nhKwon/who.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Henry Sharpe however in the gaming community I am known as \u0027Ruskie\u0027. On YouTube I create videos that analyse gaming culture. What makes a game great or bad? How does a mechanic done right transform a good game into a legendary one?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI poke my nose into everything related to gaming culture and ask all the questions that nobody else is asking.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is what I try to do, Ultimately in reality all I make are shitpost gaming videos that are 5 times longer than they need to be and I am one step away from making a Minecraft survival lets play.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/drWFg7\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/eGPqES/how_help.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy financial situation is currently very unstable. I am doing YouTube full time (With the help of my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9DUIgtRGHNH_HmSTcfUbA\"\u003eother channel\u003c/a\u003e) while barely scraping by financially and the amount of money I earn is directly linked to how many views I get. This presents a big problem. If I have a really interesting video idea on the art of how videos games terrify the player or anything that is not total click bait like \"The Day (Insert Game) Died\" I don\u0027t make it. I want to make that kind of stuff however, I need to at the end of the day be able to pay my rent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more successful this page is; the more creative control I can take with my work. Every extra dollar is one step closer not only to helping me achieve a stable, reliable income but also giving me the ability to make the videos I genuinely want to make rather than the ones I know are going to get more clicks.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/muTYZS\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jNt0ES/what_are.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn my channel I make video essays. Video essays are a revolutionary new form of conveying ideas.  A handsome, deviously brilliant person (such as myself) will use a commentary backed up by visuals to illustrate specific points about video game culture. Then that individual will have his videos immediately copyright claimed because YouTube hates him. Then after sending a repeal request he will wait for weeks on end and just a few days before the deadline the copyright holders deny his request because apparently \"Ooooh! Video Essays are not fair use\". Twats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/dgQDZS\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/bPGbon/thanks.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support is not only giving me more creative control to step away from click bait and onto topics I genuinely find fascinating but also it is having a tangible effect on my life and you are helping me achieve my dreams, words are too simple a form of communication to convey how much that means to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is only one form of communication that can truly express how much your support does mean to me and that is a Peruvian tango filled with dynamic passion and affection. However my feet are as agile as a dead slug and that dance would probably get me demonetized so I guess words will have to do."
