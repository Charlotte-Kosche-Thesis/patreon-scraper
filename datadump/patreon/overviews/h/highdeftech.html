    "summary": "[Introduction video coming soon]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everyone, thanks for checking out my Patreon. Let me explain what I do and why I created this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince a young age, I\u0027ve been passionate about two things: technology, and video production. So it seems fitting, that I make videos on a YouTube channel called High Def Tech. I\u0027ve accumulated over 400,000 views, and nearly 1,000 subscribers, and I am proud to say that channel is growing quickly. I cover a wide range of topics, and in doing so, spend many hours working on each video which really adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWhy I Started a Patreon Page\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, like many other creators, I\u0027ve been affected by YouTube\u0027s recent changes to the Partner Program eligibility criteria. Although close to 1,000 subscribers, my monetisation has been terminated because of this new threshold. This means I will no longer be able to finance my time, equipment purchases, products to review etc through the Partner Program. I also wanted to give back to my most loyal subscribers by giving out rewards and exclusive benefits. Rather than just give people a PayPal link to help me out, they can get some rewards in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eExclusive Benefits of Becoming a Patron\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main reasons I decided to use Patreon over any other service, is because of my desire to give back to my subscribers. This platform allows my viewers who enjoy my content to help me out, and get some neat perks in return. I\u0027ve set up several reward tiers which offer benefits such as exclusive bonus content, including vlogs and behind-the-scenes clips, and also exclusive early access to my YouTube videos without ads, so you can watch my videos before everyone else. And as time goes on, and more Patrons sign up, I plan on giving back even more, both to existing and new Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027d like to help, and get some awesome goodies in return, simply select a reward from the right-hand side, and you\u0027ll immediately get access to your benefits. Either way, thank you for taking the time to visit my page, and I hope you continue to enjoy my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid\u003cbr\u003eHigh Def Tech\u003cbr\u003e"
