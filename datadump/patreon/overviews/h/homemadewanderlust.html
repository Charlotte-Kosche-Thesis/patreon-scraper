Thanks for taking the time to check out my page and allowing you to share my aspirations with you.\u00a0Hiking has been a passion of mine since I was a little girl. After putting off my dream of thru-hiking the AT for years, I decided it was time to live it. I documented my 2015 thru-hike in videos and blog posts hoping it would help encourage others to get out and live their dreams, as well. I enjoy not only creating long-distance videos, but also highlighting local trails, gear reviews and tutorials, etc. Anything to show people: \"If I can do it, so you can you!\" After all, I had never been on an overnight backpacking trip until my first night on the Appalachian Trail! \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eAlthough my AT journey came to an end after 2,189.2 miles, my dreaming didn\u0027t dwindle on Mt. Katahdin. In fact, accomplishing one of my bucket list items created an insatiable desire for more. I decided I would love to share the full Triple Crown journey which consists of hiking the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eThanks to the support of my faithful patrons and subscribers, I was able to conquer the second leg of my Triple Crown journey on the PCT last year in 2017, and will be attempting the CDT this spring. All patrons will be part of exclusive live Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s prior to my third leg of this adventure!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/87/bf/ca/87bfcab0b19bf2f3eb54a9eea5ee15f0.jpg\" style=\"width: 581px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
