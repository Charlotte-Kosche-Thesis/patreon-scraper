    "summary": "We have set some high goals for the Hinsdale House and the surrounding property. Everything is being done in stages. This next stage is a big one. We want to add an additional building with a base/camp for teams and a physical museum. We also want to be able to bring the museum items/documentation to you. We will travel to different events throughout the country and bring the Hinsdale house and it\u2019s history to you. We also want to take back the full property for investigations {10 Acres}, and upkeep this almost 200 year old farm house for future generations to love and investigate. With every $300 pledged total we are going to add additional live stream cameras to the property and inside the house, these streams will be avail 24-7 on vidispace."
