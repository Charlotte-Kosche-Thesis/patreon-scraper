    "summary": "This is Hymnalysis! My self-appointed job is to listen to, analyze, and regurgitate the central message of Christian Hymns, while providing my own respectfully scathing atheistic commentary.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReligion is mostly an emotional experience. Worship is a way of manipulating the believer into a sense of a \"personal relationship\" with God; this is done by repetition of lovely phrases within hymns. Brainwashing through music is rather easy to accomplish. In the bible, it says that Satan himself uses music to tempt people to his way of thinking. Looking at it objectively, God does the same through his followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very passionate about bringing down organized religion, or at the very least chipping away at it. I\u0027d like to reach a point where I am able to work less and fully dedicate myself to the cause of ridding society of illogical thought. I also have a lot of fun making these videos (imagine that!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMainline work on this channel is, of course, the hymn analyses. Other things I plan on doing include readings/reviews of Christian Apologetics, Vacation Bible School reviews, and hopefully engagement in meaningful dialogue with Christians and Atheists alike."

     "about": "The mission of this channel is to provide a constructive criticism of Christian liturgy. One of the central underpinnings of church services anywhere is the praise and worship portion. This channel will be primarily dedicated to exploring the components of praise and worship, most notably the hymns. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe analyses will be structured in such a way as to provide sufficient evidence of an understanding of the Christian religion, rather than an outright disrespectful attack video at the outset. However, the main goal is to deconstruct the arguments within the songs, and provide people with a way to see that the emotional ties to their religion (which are the hardest to break), can be as easily severed as the biblical/logical ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer: If I plagiarize a main idea, component, or snippet of any well-known  content, it is completely without foreknowledge, and I will readily credit any inspiration I may have had.\u003cbr\u003e",
