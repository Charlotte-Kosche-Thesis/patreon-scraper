As a self-taught producer, I write, narrate, edit, and publish all content in addition to finding stories, setting up interviews, recording, and traveling for episodes. Making quality radio takes a lot of time. Your monthly pledges buy more time and resources that allow me to make more great episodes for you. Even making raising enough to work 32 hours/week instead of 40 drastically changes the amount of content I can produce each month. This is invaluable time that you would be contributing to the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, I hope to produce Hungry full-time. With Patreon, we can start small with your direct contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money also allows Hungry to put uber-talented musicians and artists to work. From composing unique music for each piece, to illustrating cover art for the episodes, there is endless potential for Hungry to collaborate with artists across all mediums to make creative, exciting content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb style=\"text-align: center; background-color: initial;\"\u003eThank YOU.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBy becoming a patron of Hungry, you are helping to reveal stories from behind the kitchen doors that might have otherwise remained untold.\u00a0If you like the podcast and believe in what Hungry stands for, I would be honored with your patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and Stay Hungry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Otis Gray\u003cbr\u003e"

There are a lot of talented people I am dying to collaborate with. But, artists have to make a living.
