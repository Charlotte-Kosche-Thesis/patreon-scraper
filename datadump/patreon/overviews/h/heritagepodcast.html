To this end, my target audience has been \u201cAnyone, anywhere, free of charge,\u201d and it always will be! Nevertheless, website hosting, audio file hosting, and my own education materials all add up to a serious cost for producing the show.

If you have found the podcast to be informative or entertaining, please consider sponsoring the show through PayPal at heritagepodcast.com/donate ~OR~ by donating on a per episode basis here at Patreon.
