    "summary": "Thanks for coming to our Patreon Page!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cHoney for the Heart\u201d is a vision for a ministry to\nchildren.  Instead of telling you in\ndetail exactly what the vision is, let me first tell you the story of how it\ncame about.  See, while the name \u201cHoney\nfor the Heart\u201d came to me at the kitchen sink one day recently while washing\ndishes, the actual daily living out of \u201cHoney for the Heart\u201d started about a\nyear ago at our kitchen table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSTORY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbout a year ago, I began the practice of having daily\ndevotions and memorizing scripture with my (now) 4 year old.  It began out of necessity, because he was\nterrified of storms, so we memorized Proverbs 18:10 and began reciting that\nscripture in our home ALL the time.  But\nas we memorized more and more scriptures, it came naturally to me to set the\nscriptures to songs that were quick, catchy, and singable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI began to feel a growing excitement in my heart, and\na keen sense that these moments (go back to Molly\u2019s face) of\nbreakfast-table-songwriting with my bible wide open and my kids\u2019 hearts wide\nopen, were probably the most significant moments of that entire day.  I kept having the thought \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing\nright now is going to last forever\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eIsaiah 40:8\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \nThe grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will endure\nforever.\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cOur kids friends and even teachers and\neven parents will fail them.  Their\nculture will tempt and seduce them. \nMedia will lie to them.  They will\nsuffer, they will doubt, they will search and seek.  And what will endure and remain sturdy and\ntrustworthy?  The Word of God will endure!!\n\u201c \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI began to share these little quick, catchy, singable\nscripture songs with my friends and their kiddos over texts and voice memos,\nand share them at my son\u2019s preschool, and sometimes even at concerts, and other\nkids seem to be really latching on to them! \nThis FILLS me with joy, because I am having SO.MUCH.FUN. giving the very\nbest I have to give as a songwriter and creative to the next generation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT NOW?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have now recorded five of these scripture\nsongs, and I have probably 25 more already written and waiting to be recorded\nand SHARED with my friends!  So, through Patreon, we\u0027re asking that you\u0027d consider supporting this ministry by giving $5 a month to\n\u201cHoney for the Heart\". Your regular support will help us record these songs at a faster pace and get\nthem in the hands of other parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, children\u2019s\nministers and teachers...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis $5 monthly support will get you the\nfive songs we\u0027ve finished, access to all the future\nrecordings we make, access to free printable coloring sheets that correspond\nwith the scripture songs, and access to motion videos as they are created, and\nyou will also be connected with our patron-only news feed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTHANK YOU so much for coming to our page and we look\nforward to sharing this ongoing ministry of \u201cHoney for the Heart\u201d with you and\nthe kids in your life. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "For Molly and Patrick, nothing is off-limits when it comes to writing a song.  Since even things like strong coffee, hiking trails, honeysuckle, and parenting \u201caHa\u2019s\u201d are arrows pointing to the most generous, greatest Love of the universe, they choose to engage with theology through heartfelt, one-of-a-kind songs.\u00a0They\u2019re probably making up a tune right now, as you\u2019re reading.  Well they\u2019re making a raucous of some kind- that\u2019s for sure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrick works full-time for their local church, and M\u0026amp;P both work part-time for a wonderful local ministry.  Parenting two little boys who can already climb 8 feet before you say the words \u201cbroken appendage\u201d is their biggest, best job of all.  What they\u2019d love to do on a Friday night, if not cozy up together in their Nashville burrow with hot tea and their latest read-aloud, is to share their songs in your living room, for your friends and neighbors.  The hope they\u2019ve found is too good to keep to themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\"Honey for the Heart\" songs\u003cbr\u003e",
