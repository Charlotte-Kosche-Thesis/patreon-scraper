The Have Seeds House looks \nto be in service of connecting you, our international community, to the \nliving network of change happening in this city. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\n has been clear to us for some time now that a house in L.A. could serve\n a larger movement of change. When in December the opportunity arose to \nmove into a new home, we took a leap of faith and got a large enough \nspace to host the ever-growing stream of people coming to participate in\n our community here. The yard is ripe for tilling, the garage stands \nbeckoning for creation, and we can practically smell the feasts wafting \noff the six burner stove. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving made this leap of faith out of a vision for what is possible, we are now inviting you to co-create it with us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo\n allow this space to be one of service and available for guests and \ninterns of our L.A. network, we are looking to our wider community to \noffer monthly pledges towards the rent. These pledges will make it \npossible for us to hold the large space open for the ever-changing \nstream of guests. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\n are grateful and excited to simply share the Have Seeds House with you.\n If it feels inspiring to contribute a pledge of even just a dollar a \nmonth, it will help us make this vision a reality.\u003cbr\u003e"
