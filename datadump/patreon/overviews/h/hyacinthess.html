My name is Elise Rosberg, and this is my Patreon page where you can support my artworks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a comic artist and manga artist from Sweden who is working professionally with illustrations and making comics. I have been published in several Swedish anthologies and books - for example Bonnier Carlsen which is one of Sweden\u0027s biggest publishers of literature and manga. I also study bookmanship at the university and work as a manga teacher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make comics on\u003cstrong\u003e queer\u003c/strong\u003e themes (\u003cstrong\u003eyaoi, yuri\u003c/strong\u003e) as well as\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ecomedies\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eromances\u003c/strong\u003e.

I usually use either \u003cem\u003eCopic markers\u003c/em\u003e when I work traditionally, or digital mediums such as \u003cem\u003ePaint Tool Sai \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eManga Studio\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money I gain from the patreon will help me make sure that I don\u0027t have to take other side jobs aside from what I already do. That will therefore allow me to work more on my art, to produce even more art, so there\u0027ll be more art and comics for you to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will also be making lots of more tutorials,\u00a0speed paints, livestreams, online lessons and so on!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are you waiting for?
