    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Hillary Monahan/Eva Darrows/Thea De Salle, a NYT bestselling, critically acclaimed author of Stuff. I like monsters. I like humanizing monsters. I like making humans monstrous. I like making people laugh. I like kissing books. I like serious books.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI just . . . I really like words, y\u0027all.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEating is also really cool, which is where Patreon comes in. Publishing is a fickle mistress, and there are long stretches where the coffers get empty. Like \"rattle a bean in a can\" empty. Months between pay checks is a long time to budget for especially when you don\u0027t actually know if it\u0027ll be six months or seven or eight until your next check and your mortgage really does have to be paid in between. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m hoping to even out this problem with Patreon. I\u0027m calling it \"Two Beans in a Can, Please.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA long time ago, arts funding was a thing. People contributed to organizations that would do what Patreon does, which is provide living expenses to artists while they art for the public\u0027s enjoyment. Those days are over. The demand for art is up, the value of the artist is down. The onus is on the artists to make or break ourselves. I understand some people don\u0027t like the Patreon or Kickstarter model. This is not for them, then, and I thank you for reading this far without lighting me on fire. But for the people who are okay with throwing a buck to an artist they like every month so they can get more art? Cool!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSecret that\u0027s not a secret? I\u0027ll keep arting for you either way, readers, with or without Patreon. But if you can help me cover some small living expenses in between, I can do more arting, faster. And in doing so, I promise that I will do my best to write inclusive, feminist-friendly material that loves all colors, genders, orientations, and sizes. I try hard not to punch down. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOUT NOW:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/178108324X\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTHE AWESOME\u003c/a\u003e by Eva Darrows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29456585-dead-little-mean-girl?from_search=true\u0026amp;search_version=service\"\u003eDEAD LITTLE MEAN GIRL\u003c/a\u003e by Eva Darrows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mary-The-Summoning-Bloody/dp/1423185196\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMARY: The Summoning\u003c/a\u003e by Hillary Monahan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Mary-Book-Unleashed/dp/1423185390\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMARY: UNLEASHED\u003c/a\u003e by Hillary Monahan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29430516-gods-and-monsters?from_search=true\u0026amp;search_version=service\"\u003eSNAKE EYES\u003c/a\u003e by Hillary Monahan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Girl-Hillary-Monahan/dp/1524701866\"\u003eTHE HOLLOW GIRL\u003c/a\u003e by Hillary Monahan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/King-Bourbon-Street-NOLA-Nights-ebook/dp/B01JZPA9DS/ref=la_B06WD55R99_1_3?s=books\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1512406221\u0026amp;sr=1-3\"\u003eTHE KING OF BOURBON STREET\u003c/a\u003e by Thea De Salle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Queen-Dauphine-Street-NOLA-Nights-ebook/dp/B01JGQAHJW/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003eTHE QUEEN OF DAUPHINE STREET\u003c/a\u003e by Thea De Salle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Royale-Street-NOLA-Nights-ebook/dp/B01M2YHFFK/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003eTHE LADY OF ROYALE STREET\u003c/a\u003e by Thea De Salle.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCOMING SOON:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35128563-belly?from_search=true\"\u003eBELLY\u003c/a\u003e by Eva Darrows.\u003cbr\u003e\nUNTITLED HAVISHAM YA by Hillary Monahan.\u003cbr\u003e\nGUNSMOKE \u0026amp; GLAMOUR by Hillary Monahan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
