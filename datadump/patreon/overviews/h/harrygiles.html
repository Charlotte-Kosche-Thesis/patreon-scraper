    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHello! Thank you for coming here.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Harry, and I make shows and poems and games and stuff in the cracks in between. I want your help to make more radical art, and to make it free: free for you, and for everyone else too. Your monthly contribution joins everyone else\u0027s, building into a small reliable income that pays for my time: time I can spend making art that\u0027s more radical, less traditionally fundable, more exciting, less bogged down in admin, and more free.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI make art that\u0027s about what it feels like to live in a scary world, and how to find ways to survive and resist. I like being disruptive, and making good jokes, and talking with audiences, and driving a wedge into crunchy political moments. In \n\u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/portfolio/this-is-not-a-riot/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThis is not a riot\u003c/a\u003e I used teddy bears to roleplay riot survival tips; in \u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/2015/01/26/precariat-a-game-about-getting-by-together/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePrecariat!\u003c/a\u003e I co-designed a game that makes being at the bottom of the economic heap a good story to tell; in \u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/portfolio/everything-i-bought-and-how-it-made-me-feel/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEverything I Bought And How It Made Me Feel\u003c/a\u003e I turned consumer anxiety into a year-long absurdist social experiment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI already put as much as I can out into the world for free. So when I wrote the poetry publications \n\u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/portfolio/oam/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOam\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.farmform.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFarmform\u003c/a\u003e on residencies, I released the texts under Creative Commons; and when I make tiny things like the game \u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/portfolio/ghost-highland-way/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGhost Highland Way\u003c/a\u003e, my instinct is just to give it away; and when I do shows like \u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/portfolio/i-want-to-blow-up-the-palace-of-holyroodhouse/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI Want to Blow Up the Palace of Holyroodhouse\u003c/a\u003e, I put full videos and write-ups and reflections \u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/2015/01/01/post-explodem-i-blew-up-the-palace-of-holyroodhouse/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eonline for free\u003c/a\u003e so remote audiences can enjoy it to. I like giving it away.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I still need to live, so sometimes that means selling books or tickets, and sometimes that means endless grant-writing and buck-chasing and limiting my work to what I can get funded, and sometimes that means taking day jobs here and there. And sometimes it means doing it anyway. Stuff like my sideshow \n\u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/portfolio/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-the-downfall-of-globalised-late-capitalism/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAll I Want For Christmas Is The Downfall Of Globalised Late Capitalism\u003c/a\u003e is completely bizarre and unfundable, but I love doing it. Stuff like my gameshow \u003ca href=\"http://harrygiles.org/portfolio/class-act/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClass Act\u003c/a\u003e takes so much unfunded development time that I can\u0027t afford to perform it for free. I want to make more of that art, and give away more art, and be under less pressure so that I can make the art I want to make for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first big target is to hit \u00a3300/$500 a month. That pays for around two or three days of professional rate work: enough to make a new small piece of art every month. If we hit that together, that\u0027s what you get: every month I\u0027ll make a new thing each month for all of you: a wee sequence of poems, a little game, a flash performance, freely available.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like what I do, and you can afford to tip me something, it would go a very long way to creating artistic independence. Even just a buck a month is a huge deal to an artist like me \u2014 apart from anything else, it\u0027s a great confidence boost and show of faith.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFAQs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut don\u0027t you get grants and fees and commissions for all this stuff?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAye, some of what I do is funded, but lots isn\u0027t. Patreon means I can make the art I want to make, rather than the art that sells or that the state will pay for, so it makes for more radical art. And Patreon offers reliable income, rather than precariously dodging from grant to grant. Here\u0027s the deal, though. If all my income together tops the Scottish Living Wage (\u003ca href=\"http://scottishlivingwage.org/what_is_the_living_wage),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://scottishlivingwage.org/what_is_the_living_wage),\u003c/a\u003e I\u0027ll tithe the extra Patreon money back into art and protest. And if I ever hit that target on Patreon, I\u0027ll stop competing for arts funding fees entirely. Which would be lovely.\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAm I going to end up paying twice for all your stuff?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003eNo, definitely not. Most of my work is released for free anyway. But when I do something that is paid for \u2014 a book, a ticketed show, a game download, whatever\u00a0\u2014 all my Patreon supporters will automatically get it for free. If it\u0027s a physical object, I\u0027ll post it to you (yup, anywhere); if it\u0027s a show, I\u0027ll hold tickets for you; if it\u0027s a digital file, I\u0027ll give you a DRM-free copy.\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m in!
