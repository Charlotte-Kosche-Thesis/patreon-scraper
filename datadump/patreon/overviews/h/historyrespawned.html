Where can\ninterested players turn for knowledge about the past? \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyx1mPZXobOxCyzO2CwmDZA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHistory Respawned\u003c/a\u003e is a\nvideo series where professional historians provide background for players\ninterested in knowing a bit more about their favorite games, and answers\nquestions such as: Is this game historically accurate? Am I getting the full\nstory or is there more to know? What led to the events depicted in this game\nand what happened after them? With History Respawned, you don\u2019t need to turn to\nan unreliable Wikipedia entry or even go to the library (you should absolutely\ndo that if you have time, though!). We bring world-renowned scholars, with\ntheir decades of reading and expertise, to you to talk about the games and\nhistory you love. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\nseries has already examined the history of piracy as depicted in \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C9h3p5Efa4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssassin\u2019s Creed IV: Black Flag\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, experiments with alternate\nhistory in \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIeYceC4OP4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWolfenstein: The New Order\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e,\nrepresentations of witchcraft and demonology in \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssxOjMHDkf8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDiablo 3\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and more. History Respawned looks at the way video\ngames represent the past and how these depictions, narratives and\ninterpretations interact with discussions already going on in academia. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe\nshow is the brainchild of Bob Whitaker, a history professor from Austin, Texas.\nBob wanted to find a way to bring his two loves of history and video games\ntogether. In particular, he wanted to expose historians to developments in the\nvideo games while also presenting gamers with expert scholarship about the\npast. Thus, History Respawned was born. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn\nearly 2015 Bob invited John Harney, a history professor in Kentucky, to join\nthe project. John teaches a class on history and video games each January and\nshares Bob\u2019s passion both for encouraging gamers to build on their interest in\nthe history and for introducing experienced scholars to an enthusiastic\naudience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are\nlifelong gamers and history PhDs. We have the expertise to think about\nhistorical issues knowledgably and critically, and we also have the ability to\ntranslate games and gaming conventions to scholars. We love these games and we\nhave faith in the medium\u2019s ability to host and help progress informed\ndiscussions about the past.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nWhy are\nwe looking for patrons like you? Since starting the show, we\u2019ve been weighed\ndown by other commitments (writing, research, teaching, and children). The show will continue without patrons, but with patrons\nwe\u2019ll have the ability to make the show more consistent and better. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn\naddition to the regular show, we look forward to developing a professional and\nwelcoming website to host the series and other content. We\u2019ll build Bob a PC\nthat incorporates bleeding-edge technology as well as making it\npossible to capture high-quality footage of important games from Triple A\ntitles to indie projects. We will be able to justify to our spouses the\nimportance of meeting biweekly to broadcast playthroughs of historically themed\ngames on YouTube. Finally, we hope to be able to offer honoraria (i.e. money) to\nour interviewees, both to expand the show\u2019s pool of experts and to show\nappreciation to those scholars for the devotion of their time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the\nhistorically minded gamer, our show provides a way to gain historical context\nand knowledge in an easily digestible format. For historians, our show provides\na new way to present their scholarship to a new audience that is thirsty for\nexpert knowledge, but often doesn\u2019t know where to look for it. With your help\nas a patron, we will be able to continue to bring gamers and scholars together\nfor the benefit of both sides.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThank\nyou for your support!\n\u003c/strong\u003e"
