    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Rick!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have a YouTube channel about dirt biking, dual sporting and other motorcycle related things. The channel features 100% original content and it\u0027s nice not to rely on a film crew but things can get tricky and hard to do alone! I do plan on getting into ADV bikes in the near future but for now its mostly dual sport and enduro riding type stuff. I have a series on exploring the back country on a dirt bike. I give riding lessons on my channel as well as make enduro \u0027edits\u0027 showcasing the funner side of dirt biking around my home province of BC, Canada! \u003cbr\u003eI have over 40 years of riding experience and have competed in professional freestyle motocross for almost 10 years I made a living doing this from the late 90\u0027s - 2006 now retired from FMX. I competed at a world class level in venues all over North and South America.\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page will act as a direct way for viewers to help support the channel as the videos on Youtube have been, and will always be free. There is no obligation for anyone to contribute, but those who do are greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003eThanks\nfor reading this look forward to hearing from everyone, Rick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have no plans to change the format of my YouTube\u00a0channel making my videos as often as I can, always continue watching me there for free, any content posted here is supplementary.
