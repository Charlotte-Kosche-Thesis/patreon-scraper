Since then I\u0027ve written and published a lot of poems, have founded a very successful literary journal, and have completed a PhD in Literature and Creative Writing at USC. \u00a0As the author of two books of poetry and a poetry chapbook,\u00a0the challenges of planning book tours and scheduling events are ones I\u0027m well acquainted with. \u00a0Rather than wishing something existed that would make my life easier, I resolved in 2015 to build this site and make something that could help other authors, hosts of reading series, and others interested in connecting with authors who might not initially be on their radars.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is this needed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eProblem 1: \u00a0Most authors aren\u0027t well known outside of their own state and/or literary community. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWithout major national/international media coverage, \u00a0it can be hard to achieve the type of visibility and notoriety that leads others to contact you directly. \u00a0Authors have to hustle to be seen and noticed. \u00a0But how will people know where to find you if they don\u0027t know you exist?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eProblem 2: \u00a0Most reading series aren\u0027t well known outside of their communities and regions. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0While reading series sponsored by major universities and a few well-known literary non-profits may have a brand that is recognized and remembered, most reading series tend to feature authors predominantly from their local community and neighboring cities. \u00a0While it may be good to support local talent, many of these series would also love to attract authors who are traveling through on book tours, but do not know how to reach them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eProblem 3: \u00a0Most creative writing and literature instructors are familiar with only a small pool of authors who would be willing to visit their classrooms.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Often these instructors end up inviting authors they know personally or local authors who have been recommended to them, while wishing for a larger more diverse pool of voices and experiences to call on. \u00a0With video conferencing technology (Skype and similar programs), it also possible to bring in a guest author from anywhere via the internet -- but which authors are available and how best to approach them?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat HBWT (Have Book Will Travel) accomplishes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy providing a single online destination that gathers both \u00a0profiles of authors interested in traveling to and/or videoconferencing in for a reading and profiles of reading series interested in attracting authors from outside their community, HBWT creates a one-stop searchable database to bring authors and reading series together.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou can use HBWT in the following ways\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1. \u00a0Look for reading series in your state or in a state you would like to visit.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. \u00a0Look for authors in a particular state\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. \u00a0Look for authors within a particular genre (Creative Non-Fiction, Fiction, Non-Fiction, Poetry)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. \u00a0Search for authors and reading series that match particular keywords.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n5\u00a0.
