    "summary": "Hyperbolic Game Chamber is a comedy podcast about video games. More specifically, the writing in said video games.\u00a0Plots in video games tend to be completely absurd, bizarre and sometimes nonsensical journeys into insanity, and that\u2019s exactly why we love them.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re not talking about the gripping emotional story of The Last of Us or the memorable personal stories you\u2019d find in something from Telltale Games. No, we\u2019re talking about the really wild stuff, like werewolves fighting vampire Hitler (Operation: Darkness), a desperate race to stop a monster lady from artificially inseminating herself (Parasite Eve), or really anything that happens in any given Resident Evil.\u003cbr\u003eThat stuff is bananas, and THAT is why we love them. Video games are full ridiculous weirdness and we want to celebrate that. And mock, but mostly celebrate. Every episode, we\u2019ll highlight a different game and focus almost entirely on the story. We\u2019re not a review show, so our goal isn\u2019t to tell you whether or not a title is a good \u003cem\u003egame,\u003c/em\u003e but rather to point out the really silly stuff, talk about it, and have a good time.\u003cbr\u003eBecause that\u2019s what video games are for: having a good time. And sometimes watching Dracula punch Satan in the face, but mostly the other thing.\u003cbr\u003e"
