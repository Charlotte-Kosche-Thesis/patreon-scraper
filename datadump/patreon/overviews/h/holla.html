Is it really possible to create global change with \"just\" change (namely your $1 bills)? Is it really possible to create a world where what you need to take the next step on your journey is available and out there, for you, or anyone, with just a curiosity to know more, and an internet connection? All without paying a dime to access because it was funded by $1 donations made by and lots of other cool, caring people like you, a movement that is literally by the people for the people?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think it\u0027s the coolest social experiment for global change. and we\u0027d like YOU to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eFinding the I\u0027m possible in the Impossible by leveraging change for change\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eSound Utopian or Impossible? Yes maybe, but why not have a little Utopia in the mix, and why not take the impossible and add a little space and punctuation mark for a different meaning, \"impossible\" becomes \"I\u0027m possible\", and yes we are crazy enough to think we can do this. In fact we don\u0027t just think it, we know it in our bones, and we hope you will feel it too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you join us in our crazy adventures to bring these tools of change to the world, by making a donation and becoming part of the coolest revolution for global change? In return, we will continue \u00a0to dedicate our time and resources to share the tools of change that have helped me, my clients and more than 1/4 m people on YouTube, out to the world, all supported by your $1 a month (or more) donations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s just so cool we can barely contain ourselves, will you bother to send your dolla? Because if you do, if you realize the power of your dolla to make this change we will be taking this global in your name, talk about cool! Leveraging change for change, what\u0027s not to love about that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eOne dolla for global change?

There is power to the dolla. As to whether we are quite mad, I think the answer is probably another resounding yes, absolutely bat shit crazy. Possibly certifiable. You might be as well, or maybe you just like hanging around those of us who are, either way, welcome to our world. If we weren\u0027t certifiably mad we wouldn\u0027t be here, we would be looking for jobs and \"security\" rather than following our hearts. stepping in trust and sharing our passion, and so here we are. As for the spelling, we are funky like that, you probably are too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eIt takes an army to start a revolution, introducing Give 1, Tell 1\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eAnd yes, it a starts with a dolla, one from you, one from your coworkers, family and friends, and then their family and friends. This is how true change happens, on a global scale, not from the number of dollas given but the power of the number of hearts involved in the project. When we put those dollas with all the other ones, we really have leverage, and this is where massive change happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t have to stop with giving a dolla, what if you told your friends, family and coworkers and they did the same? What if we all Give 1 and Tell 1, how far and wide can the dollas take change across the globe? With the power of Give 1, Tell 1, we are truly leveraging everything at our fingertips in the name of change, we\u0027re not kidding when we call it the coolest social experiment for global change! And we want you to be a part of it. And we want you to tell your friends about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThe Power of One is underestimated, nothing begins without the first one\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThough we often think it\u0027s not enough, there is so much power in ONE. In fact it is where all power begins. One minute, one person, one dolla! You see we cannot have 2 or more without the first ONE. It all starts with the one. Without one you cannot have more, period. But with one, you can have many more, ad infinitum in fact, and when you bring all those ones together, you create power mightier than one, this is leverage in action and this is is where true revolutions begin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eTogether, how far can we go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis all got me thinking about the true power of one. After all we are the ones who say, alone we can do so much, together we can do so much more. So I wondered what change could we make together? You and me? Well, you and me, and a lot of other people. How far could we go? What changes could we effect together? Could we really keep the YouTube channel humming with new, free, content and travel in person to lead global change work-ins the 135 countries that tune into our channel, all on the power of your dolla, leveraged with the power of many more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eAngels fund forward, the power of one doesn\u0027t stop here, 10% to 10 causes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWe truly believe that everything comes from source and 10% belongs to source. We also know that power of seeding forward, just like the dollas for this project, they all add up and, when counted, they have so many hearts involved, how can they not bloom the brightest flowers? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are working on the list of recipients, check out the Rewards section to see how you can name a (charitable) organization when you become a sponsor to this project.

Before I found these tools I was seen as \"super successful\". I had arrived from the UK to the Bay Area\u00a0 as a BigLaw Corporate Securitization attorney. I had \"made it\" in the eyes of society. While this might have looked like the case on the outside, the inside truth is, I was more sad and unhappy than I thought possible. My dream life had become a living nightmare. And my body showed me every day; at 215lbs and often in hospital, I knew something needed to shift. And finally I got the message that shift was me, I had to make it, but how?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eBe the lighthouse, accessible to all\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eOnce I knew I had to make change of a different kind and asked how, I was fortunate to find someone who helped me find what\u0027s inside. He introduced me to Kundalini Yoga, taught me about the first nibble about food to set me off on a (thus far) 16 year quest to better daily living and health. He sparked a fire in me I didn\u0027t even know was there/ Life for me would never be the same again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone is as lucky as I was, and times have changed since I started out, we have Google and YouTube at our fingertips. I know that often when people need these tools they either lack money, time or access to the very tools that could transform how they feel in their skin. When we started our Youtube channel and saw the demographics of 40% men, with viewers in 135 countries, we knew we had found a way to make the teachings accessible. And now, together with you, we can actually make this happen. Through YouTube, and with your donation, our content will always be free and accessible when people need it most. This way these precious teachings can be the lighthouse that is accessible to all who come near the shores looking for guidance! How cool is that? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eIt\u0027s true what we need is inside, sometimes we need a way in\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/span\u003eIt\u0027s true what I needed was inside of me, but in order to find what was inside, I needed to find tools on the outside. And it took me nearly dying in my bed to get to even that point. I was truly stuck thinking there was no way out of my life. You, or someone you know, may be stuck like this, there are more of us than we let on. After 16 years on this path I know I am not alone in needing to do this. Why not be the lighthouse for others to find their way?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eYouTube, 2.5 years, 3/4 million views, more than 150 countries...how it all started...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eOur tool box blends Kundalini Yoga + Meditation, Buddhist teachings, along with every day practical wisdom, inspiration and community support, to take care of body, mind and spirit.

We made more videos. And more came. Over 3/4 million views to date in more than 150 countries!

It has doubled in the past year. There is a thirst for this work to be openly available, people are using it and feeling better because of the inner courage, strength and stamina it connects them to. We all deserve to wake up and go to sleep feeling like we were present to life in our power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery morning we are blessed to wake up to comments and thank you notes from all over the world sharing how much the channel means to our community.

Just see what we can do when we get here, of course it will all be caught and shared on video. Alone we can do so much, together we can do so much more. We just couldn\u0027t do it without you.
