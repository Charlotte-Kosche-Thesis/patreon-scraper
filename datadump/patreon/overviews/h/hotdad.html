    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m Erik, also known as HOT DAD, and I create emotional/weird/funny music/videos/content. I work with a terrific video editor named\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bjornd.al/\"\u003ePeter\u003c/a\u003e, the man also behind all of my graphic design/album covers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe make a lot of content together, and if you\u0027re here right now, you\u0027ve probably seen at least some of it. I\u0027m proud and extremely grateful to be a content creator, and I\u0027m so happy that you\u0027re here right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrior to working with Peter, due to my extremely lacking visual art skills, I did a lot of alternative theme songs (TV themes/WWE themes). My recent focus has been \"emotionally-charged weird songs,\" as I frequently call them, with lush+funny+creative music vids from my buddy Peter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOKAY, SO YOU DID AN INTRO\u2014WHAT\u0027S THE \"\u003cem\u003ePOINT\u003c/em\u003e\" OF THIS PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027re helping me \u003cem\u003ecreate\u003c/em\u003e and\u003cem\u003e grow\u003c/em\u003e. I do this full time, at least 5 days a week, all year long, and I\u0027ve been doing it that way since 2014. I don\u0027t make a lot of money, but I\u0027m very happy with my life. And like many other non-PG channels on YouTube, I basically make nothing from ad revenue (about $50 a month right now) because my content is frequently \"not advertiser friendly.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I make stuff that\u0027s extremely wholesome and SFW, and sometimes I don\u0027t. I want that choice to be a fun/creative decision that\u0027s up to \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e, not dictated by what YouTube supposedly wants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of y\u0027all really care about what I/we make (and I/we love ya big time for that), so if that\u0027s you, this is just a direct way to get involved and make sure that sweet content stream (SCS) keeps on flowin\u0027. With more money, I\u0027ll also be able to pay for professional mixing and mastering + purchase additional equipment/software/whatever to make music with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re also helping me pay Peter for his time/effort. Peter signed on as a volunteer back in early 2016 (wow!), and our relationship has evolved far more than I could have ever anticipated. I consider him a crucial part of the HOT DAD VISION\u2122, which means I need to do my best to make sure he\u0027s got the free time to be involved ($$$).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford to contribute, I understand. This is a luxury good, not a necessity, and I\u0027m really, really, really, grateful for every cent I get. THANK YOU! And if you can\u0027t afford to support me, enjoy the videos and songs anyway!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMUCH LOVE x 25,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eErik\u003cbr\u003e"
