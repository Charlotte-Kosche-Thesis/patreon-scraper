My goal is for people to be able to easily find an herbalist in their neighborhood, and for herbalists to be able to in turn grow their business.

The blog excites me because it is an outlet for me to write on all things herbalism, but also have different teachers and herbalists share their knowledge. The monograph page is one of my favorite projects thus far. I will be adding 1 - 2 new monographs from various herbalists every month. The plan is to increase that number over time, and have hundreds of well-written, lengthy monographs by many, many herbalists.

I love herbalism because I feel it\u2019s one of the best ways for us to reconnect with nature. When I first got into herbalism, I read a lot of books and bought a lot of dried herb\u2014which was great\u2014but I knew there was more out there. So I registered for\u003ca href=\"http://www.botanicalstudies.net/\"\u003eColumbines School of Botanical Studies\u003c/a\u003e in my hometown of Eugene, OR. After taking its two-year apprenticeship, I never looked at the herbs (actual plants!) and nature in the same way.
