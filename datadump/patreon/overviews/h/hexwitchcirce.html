    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Circe, programmer extraordinaire (I\u0027d like to think at least) and creator of all sorts of neat things. I\u0027m here to help fuel all the creative stuff I do, which includes fun programming stuff, making videos on Youtube, and writing, both technical and fictional!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I make all of these things more or less when I feel like and have the energy. And this is the place where you can send a bit of money to show that you enjoy what I do, and give feedback on what you\u0027d like to see more of. Like my Let\u0027s Plays? Wanna hear more about NES emulation? Want to see me stream stuff? Let me know what interests you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still figuring things out, so stuff like goals and reward tiers and such may be subject to change. However, my core goal will not; this is all in service of being able to make cool things that I hope people will enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the time being, this\u0027ll be more of a tip jar than anything else, while I work out how I want to structure things. If you actually want to toss some money my way, I\u0027ll be eternally grateful, and I\u0027ll definitely be listening for what you want to see me create. I wanna keep all my work free for everyone, and every little bit helps me to make more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, if you\u0027re looking for the definitive place to find all my work, you can find...\u003cbr\u003eVideo here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SabakuKitsune\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/SabakuKitsune\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCode here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sarospa\"\u003ehttps://github.com/sarospa\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eStream here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hitbox.tv/Sarospa\"\u003ehttp://www.hitbox.tv/Sarospa\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hex-witch-circe.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttps://hex-witch-circe.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ePodcast here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://effervescencenetwork.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttps://effervescencenetwork.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about moving NSFW stuff to AO3, watch this space"
