Well, hopefully the following below will answer your questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, its not easy to make any sort of living on what I\u0027m doing. I\u0027m currently un-employed and renting out a room away from parents. Much of the funds I currently make are really just for basic living needs and not much else, and I\u0027ve admittedly never been the best with managing my funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e is largely being made as a way in order to help find the funds that I need in order to not only help give myself more to work with, but also be able to use it as a way to help improve the content of the channel to give you guys the best work I can possibly make. My eventual dream goal is to make my work become a full-time job, even if that job takes many years to attain. Such funds would largely be used to help improve my hardware and equipment to up the production quality, as well as help with the funds I need for my daily life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite all of this, I wish to make clear that\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI NEVER see my work as something that should be kept behind a paywall.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt has, and always will remain FREE for the foreseeable\u00a0future. All I want to do is to give you guys the absolute best out of my work, as I feel it is the most important thing I can do for all of you. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould you decide to donate or become a supporter,\u00a0I offer you my sincere gratitude and thanks to you for the support you\u0027ve given me. It greatly means alot that my work is something you enjoy and I\u0027ll continue to hopefully produce content that you can enjoy. I want to be the best that I can be, and though it is \u003cstrong\u003eIMPOSSIBLE\u003c/strong\u003e to please everyone, I will do my hardest to please as many as I can, because \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ewithout you guys, my content would amount to NOTHING\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you very much, and as always, I\u0027ll see you guys on the next one.\u003c/em\u003e"
