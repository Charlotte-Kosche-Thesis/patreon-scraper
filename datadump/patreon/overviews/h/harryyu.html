With my art and writings, I hope to inspire inner dialogues, motivate new discoveries, and nourish feelings for the world.

You can be my motivator, my connection to humanity, the energy that makes my art possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on Patreon, I will post first drafts, sketches, creative tips, and random thoughts to share with patrons. Your feedback is most welcome! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are different tiers of rewards a patron can sign up for.

My original artworks are available for purchase on saatchi art, and also you can find them in digital designs on society6.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will find something uniquely invaluable here to take away with you on your journey.

     "about": "Hi, I\u0027m a Boston-based artist. My artworks are often whimsical and experimental. Abstract expressionism is one of my favorite styles. When I am not making marks on canvas, I read, mostly poetry, and I write. My writing interests include children\u2019s picture books, flash short stories, and cento poems. One of my poems was on view at Boston City Hall, April-October 2016. To me, the definition of good art is that the artwork does some good for the world in some way. This is the view I\u0027ve gathered from the masterpiece mentioned in the short story The Last Leaf, written by O Henry. And as a contemporary musician Pink has said, one of the missions as an artist is to \"help other people to change so that they can see more kinds of beauty.\"",
