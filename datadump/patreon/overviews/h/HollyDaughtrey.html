Thank you in taking the time to stop by my page. I\u0027m here to introduce you to my comics and art. I\u0027ve been an artist all my life, drawing illustrations, character designs, animation, coloring books, comics, even a few hobbies like jewelry and acrylic paintings. But it has always been comics that I always come back to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to submit my current comics, Fallen and Plush, to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GmEMrnk.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo sum it up, Fallen is what you might think of as a romantic comedy. It delves deep into the mythos and creatures found in various Christian/Hebrew religions existing in a present day situation. I\u0027ve always wanted to do a comic that touched myths and legends on all levels with a deeper meaning as well as comedy, parodies, and a sweet romance as well as a hint of adult.\u00a0Each comic of Fallen comes in 26 page installments including covers. The collection already contains tons of pencil sketched pages, bonus material, gag comics with the characters, and hundreds of random character sketches and art.\u00a0Fallen has been an endeavour of nearly 6 years in my spare time to develop into a final comic format from an original story idea. With the help of my co-writer, Dan Horton, I hope all of you will enjoy the process of start to finish of this awesome story.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6kKUDtd.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlush happens to be a spur of the moment story idea I randomly came up with that has gained popularity quite quickly. A plushie maker and artist protagonist has lost a great deal in her life and is coping with the help of her late mother\u0027s gift, a special cat plush\u00a0that suddenly comes to life to help. It\u0027s a collection of short stories that despite touching on depression, is light-hearted and comical while the main character learns to continue to live with her loss. Yet not everything seems right. Was this really magic? Or is it all in her head? Each chapter is split between 6 and 12 pages in length with covers and the first two chapters currently completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x9rTNeh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to do comics full time, and I have plenty of stories (a few years worth of material). I invite you all to come to my page, discover my art, and read the stories.\u00a0My ultimate goal is to make a living doing what I love and eventually have my comics collected for my patrons to hold in their hands to treasure. If you enjoy it, please share them and pass it along.\u00a0I thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/B7CjwKT.png\"\u003eI do apologize for being completely new to Patreon and not knowing how to do everything on here. Please be patient with me as I get accustomed to working and scheduling through here. I would LOVE input when I post questions to the audience. Again, thank you everyone!
