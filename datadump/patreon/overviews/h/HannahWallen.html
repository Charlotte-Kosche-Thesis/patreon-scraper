Along with that I have planned articles on a variety of topics, including geek culture, due process rights, history that social justice warriors don\u0027t talk about, parenting rights, the reality of intimate partner and sexual violence, relationships, and many others. You can see from my various writing feeds that I have already explored these topics somewhat. I also have a few ideas brewing for photo series with a men\u0027s issues theme. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport will help me to set aside time to work on these projects and ensure that I am able to use decent equipment, hardware, and software for the videos and photos. If I get enough support, it\u0027ll also help pay for research that may require access to studies and articles currently out of my reach behind pay walls. \u003cbr\u003e"

My work is largely inspired by things I have witnessed, including women\u0027s use of criminal and family courts to abuse \nmen in five different counties. I began writing after I saw one man\u0027s ordeal drag on for \u003ca href=\"http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/domestic-violence-industry/seven-years-in-hell/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eseven years\u003c/a\u003e, continuing even when authorities \nhad substantial evidence that the accuser was gaming the system. My main blog is \u003ca href=\"http://breakingtheglasses.blogspot.com/2012/05/restraining-order-abuse-and-vexatious_31.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBreaking the Glasses\u003c/a\u003e, written from an anti-feminist \nperspective, with a focus on men\u0027s rights and sometimes social issues. \nBreaking the Glasses refers to breaking down the \"ism\" filters through which people view the world, replacing thought in terms of political rhetoric with an exploration of the human condition and human \ninteractions without regard to dogmatic belief systems. My youtube channel is also called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7Bt0vnvdJqAwF8Ow8iT0g/videos\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBreaking the Glasses\u003c/a\u003e.
