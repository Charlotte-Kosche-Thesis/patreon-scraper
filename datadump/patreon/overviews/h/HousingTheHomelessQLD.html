     "about": "We produce bicycle-camper-trailers for homeless people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is a conglomeration of many great projects that good people are already doing to help and lift humanity up. We\u0027re massively grateful for all those who\u0027ve been walking this road before us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bike and trailers include electricity from solar, an elec motor to make pedalling easier, a solar heated shower, lights and warmth to provide the occupant with comfort, security and privacy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project already has fantastic support and is welcomed by those on the front line currently helping our homeless people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe already have a number of volunteers excited and keen to assist, though we need more cash to assist with materials and the admin staff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s 30,000 people and families on the list of housing support in Australia?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s 100,000 people who are homeless each night in Australia?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I know if I were out in the cold, and dark, on the concrete, I\u0027d appreciate someone building me a little shelter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach bike \u0026amp; trailer kit looks to cost around $800, plus the time \u0026amp; location to assemble. We think that\u0027s a reasonable amount for indepedence with little to no maintenance. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBuilding units has been costed by other projects to be around $12,000 for 1-2 ppl. And that\u0027s still cheaper than the costs of our (society\u0027s) homeless in hospitals, police etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome homeless people prefer to keep moving about, and that\u0027s something these bike campers allow. They need to move around for meals, and doctors appointments also...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027d like us to build a trailer setup with your name on/in it, please pledge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf your business would like some extra exposure, we can print your business logo on the side of the trailer for an extra fee and the appropriate level of support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe great thing about this project is that the people who will be using these trailers won\u0027t need to feel forgotten anymore. They can know that people do care about them. And I\u0027d love to include a growing list, of the patreons who support us, in every trailer we offer, just so the occupant can look at that list anytime and see who cares for them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping us to support others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmly\u003cbr\u003eMatt",
