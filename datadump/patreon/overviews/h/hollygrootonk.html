It can be tough, money is always tight, and sometimes I can\u0027t even afford to buy new supplies that allow me to continue doing my art, such as paint or canvases. By supporting my art, you literally enable me to keep making new art all the time by making sure I never have to wait weeks to replace an empty paint tube, or a frayed brush.\u00a0You also help me with things like covering the cost of showing my art in public, such as at the Riverside Arts Walk that I attend as frequently as I can, or the cost of making prints. Further, it means that I can spend more time creating original art instead of relying so heavily on custom commissions. Aaaannd I will appreciate you! :)"

It\u0027s always been my dream to be a paid artist, and I would love to be able to show my work more often and in more places, and to make more art in general.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to paint things that play with my vision and create contrast, not just with value but with themes and images as well. My work changes a lot because like to do a lot of different things and capture different feelings and thoughts, but with my art you\u0027re guaranteed to get colorful, vibrant, and playful, even while the theme may be serious. I like to try to bring a sense of discord and apprehension into the image, even if it\u0027s a happy one. But most of all, I like to decorate space with strange beautiful things. Hence, \"There\u0027s beauty in the bizarre.\"",
