    "summary": "Thank you for joining me. This is brand new territory\nfor me, but if you\u2019re here, I am grateful. I hope that you will find things here\nto challenge you, illuminate your world, make you laugh, fill you with wonder.\u00a0In this space, I will post writing, and perhaps some short\nvideos, maybe even longer lectures or, ultimately, series of lectures, on\ntopics that are all over the map. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn evolution space, the questions often begin with \u201cwhy.\u201d Why\nare so many birds monogamous? Why does infanticide persist in lions and langur\nmonkeys? Why do we have a dominant hand (foot, eye, ear), and why are 10% of\npeople lefties (like me)? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI might also write about the evolution of jaws and flight and language; and about sexual selection and the evolution of mating\nsystems and territoriality and parental care; and about the crazy chromosomal\narrangements of frogs, and how songbirds learn to sing, and what dolphins,\nelephants, crows, parrots and apes have in common.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the somewhat narrower domain of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYJFgyqs0sM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehuman sex and gender\u003c/a\u003e,\nsome questions I\u2019m interested in include: Which differences between men and\nwomen are immutable, and which aren\u2019t? What do lipstick and fast cars have in\ncommon? What if the most critical gender gap is one of confidence? Why is\n\u201cbelieve all women\u201d bad policy, and bad for women, men, and society? How can women\nnavigate the distinction between hotness and beauty? We hear a lot about toxic\nmasculinity\u2014what about toxic femininity?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI taught undergraduates for 15 years, and didn\u0027t think,\nbefore then, that I would ever think of myself as an educator. But I came to\nlove teaching, and I have a lot of \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@heyingh/the-twin-virtues-of-trust-and-uncertainty-d713c5dbc50f\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethoughts about education\u003c/a\u003e, too. Some of those are focused on the intolerance and anti-Enlightenment ideology that is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-they-came-for-the-biologists-1506984033\"\u003etaking over universities\u003c/a\u003e, and\nspreading outwards to \u003ca href=\"http://quillette.com/2017/08/11/stop-equating-science-truth/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eplaces like google\u003c/a\u003e (also: \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@heyingh/on-the-dangers-of-read-only-activism-e4891ebacaac\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e).\nMany of you already know what happened at Evergreen, and while I\u2019d rather that\nstory not be primary in what happens next, if you don\u2019t know it and\nyou want to, you can start\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/bonfire-of-the-academies-two-professors-on-how-leftist-intolerance-is-killing-higher-education/article/2642973\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B46GHNi3M4U1Mmc2VGlIeVo2c0k/view\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNature\u003c/a\u003e will be a theme as well,\u00a0especially tropical nature, especially the jungle. Also: the value of doing\nthings with your hands, and your body and, not unrelated, about risk and\nadventure (a literary magazine is soon due to publish my piece on being mugged at knifepoint, and what that reveals about sensory memory). I may write about food, and play, and childhood, and music\u2014in every\ncase, with an evolutionary lens. I also care about numeracy, which isn\u2019t\nconsidered as important as literacy, but should be. I may write about math, a\nlittle, probably basic statistics, and if you\u2019re a math-phobe, you should stick\naround for that, because math is fun, and powerful. And did I mention fun?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also write fiction. Science fiction, mostly, and no, none\nof it is out there in the universe, yet, and I don\u2019t know if I will post any\nhere, but I might.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo this is kind of a black box yet, but a fun one, and, at\nleast when I\u2019m doing non-fiction, we\u2019ll minimize assumptions and try to figure\nout what\u2019s what as much as possible. \u003cbr\u003e"
