I have been telling stories and drawing comics since as far back as I can remember. I\u0027ve always had a fervour for spinning fantastical tales and creating worlds for others to get lost in. With Patreon\u0027s\u00a0and\u00a0your\u00a0help, I will be able to continue working on my comics, spend more time on them and increase their quality as well. With love and support, I can make my dream job a reality!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eAbout My Comics\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCinder \u0026amp; Smoke\u003c/strong\u003e; just two small words that can describe so much. These words can describe a spark of something new such as life, love, or an event. Or something that leads to chaos like that of death, the past, or of failure. The story that unfolds dabbles in all of these and more, with a mystic and powerful touch that plays and pulls at the heart strings. Will the world burn bright like cinders of a flame, or go up in smoke, the tale will surely be shocking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo read this comic, please go to:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHokousha.com/cinder-and-smoke\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e24 Karat\u003c/strong\u003e takes the reader on a journey that follows a young boy who has a heart of gold, quite literally, as he discovers what it means to love and to be loved all while being under the watchful eyes of a covetous dragon.\u003cbr\u003eIn ancient times, far before humans roamed the earth, the first dragons saw their offsprings fight one another and decided that only one needed to rule; one that could find that which is most valuable would be the heir.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo read this comic, please go to:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHokousha.com/24-karat\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow Firing\u003c/strong\u003e follows a wizard boy and his were-dog on a wild endeavour to find the right job all the while a gang is steadily growing in the shadows, taking out wizards one by one.\u003cbr\u003eWith the usage of polls, this comic was designed with the readers in mind, giving the readers a way to determine the next course of action for the comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo read this comic, please go to:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHokousha.com/now-firing\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003ePatron Love\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me will grant you access to sneak-peeks, early access, secret streams, and other doodle goodies.
