However I think that\u0027s what\u0027s best about me. I feel like I can enjoy and communicate with all types of people. Because of this attribute I like to create multiple types of content.\u00a0Hence the name Halloween (scary side) Heartthrob(the cute side).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what does it all mean and why should I pay for it?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked. Patreon is a site for creators to be able to continue making content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt helps provide a source of income to the artist to make bigger and better things. It helps pays bills and gives the creator the ability to focus on their craft and giving them the ability to get better.All thanks to your love and support we can make it and make it GREAT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk so what am I getting out of this deal?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eNext to the satisfaction of helping out one of your favorite people ...\u003cbr\u003eYou get early accesses to my videos. Special Patreon exclusive videos .dedicated drawings. Previews into what I\u0027m creating currently ,Public supporter listing such as video shout outs and even your own special stop motion!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course you can still get my regular content for free\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/halloweenheartthrob\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE.\u003c/a\u003e. I will keep posting on my channel as normal.If you can\u0027t support me I completely understand.However if you can there are different tears or rewards you can subscribe to. As low as \u003cstrong\u003e$1 A MONTH! \u003c/strong\u003eSo if in one month I happen to have tons of content go up it wont break the bank. You can change or cancel your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart I would like to thank you. One for reading through this and for just being amazing.If you decide you don\u0027t want to or can\u0027t support my through Patreon your support just by watching and/or subscribing\u00a0to my Youtube channel \u003cbr\u003eis more then I could ask for.Without you as a viewer I could not have gotten this far.\u003cbr\u003e So once again.
