    "summary": "HELPSY is an online platform for ethical fashion that I created in 2012. It is the first and only site of its kind directed toward young people. Since then it has become one of the go-to resources for people looking to shop from ethical fashion brands and find ethical fashion content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started with $3000 and have never put more into the company that that. I do 98% of everything on the site and it\u0027s tough. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep providing the best content and brands possible and to also expand the amount and quality of content I provide. But I can\u0027t do so without more financial backing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never gone to outside investors as I\u0027ve always wanted complete autonomy and to do business my own way. The fashion industry is largely influenced by shareholder decisions and this causes a lot of the problems that the industry has gotten itself into. The pace of the fashion cycle, and all the human and environmental destruction it causes, it is all money driven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently quit my full time corporate job to give this my all and now I\u0027m crowdsourcing your help, no matter how small, to keep the dream alive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on converting HELPSY into a more content driven platform. The issues that face us in ethical fashion, the world at large especially women, minorities and underrepresented people, and those trying to live with a semblance of consciousness and a bit of rebellion. This is what\u0027s most interesting to me and if my gut is right, what\u0027s most interesting to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will still be ethically made clothes, beauty and home goods to buy. But it will just be well, more. The shopping will be secondary. I need to stay as interested as you are and this is where I feel I need to go. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProduct pushing is not really my thing. I like the stories behind the products. The humanness in them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all costs money. More than you\u0027d think. Paying people fairly for their writing, graphic design, and all the behind the scenes stuff that goes into producing something of quality. Not to mention the costs with spreading awareness about the brand - entry fees to trade shows and conferences are often upwards of 1K and travel and meals are definitely not included. There are so many things I\u0027d love to do, without partnering up with bad brands and companies who might give me a ton of money but then, what would be the point?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help me stay independent!"
