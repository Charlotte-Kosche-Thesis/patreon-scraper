     "about": "My name is Ashley and I have been an artist my entire life. I was fortunate to grow up with a lot of encouragement from my family - I am so thankful for the patience and support they have always given to me. My father was especially awesome! He didn\u0027t mind if I took over the entire dining table for days on end with painting projects and even gave me my own art cabinet which was stuffed with oodles of creative things from paint and glitter to ribbons and beads and even my silly Colorblaster machine (does anybody else remember the Colorblaster?! It was hilarious - you had to hand pump it forever to get just a tiny little bit of \"airbrush\" spray but gosh it was fun!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I grew up and everybody starting asking me what I wanted to do for my career it was an easy answer - I just knew I had to pursue my career in art and become a professional artist. I got into art school and worked really hard to succeed - I got my bachelor\u0027s degree and graduated with honors. From there I went to work with a large studio where I focused on 3D modeling, texturing, and environmental design. It was an amazing experience and I loved doing it - but the location wasn\u0027t ideal because I was so very far away from my family. After a few years I made the decision to move closer to my family and my husband and used my knowledge and experiences to transition into being a more varied freelance artist. In 2012 I decided to give sewing and plush making a try and I completely fell in love with it. Plush making has been the main focus of all of my time and energy ever since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love being an artist and I hope that you enjoy seeing my artwork! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig11.deviantart.net/4329/f/2015/276/5/3/dogs_by_hollyivydesigns-d9bsf7n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThank you from me, my husband, and my two furry babies!\u003cbr\u003e",
