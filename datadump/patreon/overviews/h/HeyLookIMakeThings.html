    "summary": "Thanks for checking out my page! I\u0027m a fiber artist, and I use my patreon to share photos of my work and give stuff away to my patrons!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFiber art can be an underestimated art form. The commitment required to complete a project isn\u0027t just in the varying levels of pattern complexity, but also having the dedication to see a long project from start to finish. I make everything from very intricate and time consuming lace patterns, to silly little toys. Often, I use yarn I\u0027ve spun myself in my nicer projects.\u00a0I love creating beautiful things and sharing them with my friends and family! However,\u00a0due to the often intricate and time consuming nature of my work, my finished items can get pretty expensive. That\u0027s where you come in! When you\u0027re supporting my patreon, you\u0027re saying, \"hey, I think your form of art is valid and I want to support you in it!\" . After months of trying to figure out how to manage an etsy store, I\u0027ve finally decided to give that idea up and just do frequent item giveaways to my patrons themselves, this idea is one that I\u0027ve only recently constructed, but it seems like it\u0027ll be more fulfilling for me as an artist as well as something that\u0027ll make my patrons happier! It feels like the perfect combination of giving things away to a good friend, and being supported as an artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to message me if you have any questions - pardon me if I take a day or two to get back to you, it\u0027s probably because I\u0027m knitting!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
