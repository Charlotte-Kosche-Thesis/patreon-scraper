I love the idea of people being able to\nsupport their favorite creators and to receive perks for that support.  I especially loved that, in most cases, support\noptions start at just $1/month.  Most of\nthe time when people \u0026#8220;subscribe\u0026#8221; to something, it\u0026#8217;s a much larger financial\ndecision.  However, if you like what\nsomeone is doing and want to support them, $1/month is fairly easy way to say: \u0026#8220;Hey,\nI like what you\u0026#8217;re creating \u0026#8211; keep it up!\u0026#8221; \nI think it\u0026#8217;s very exciting for both patrons and creators too.  It\u0026#8217;s taken me a little while to gather my\nthoughts on what I\u0026#8217;d like to do with my very own Patreon campaign and I hope\nyou like what I\u0026#8217;ve come up with!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I\nhere?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy answer is\nthreefold: first, I want to explore this new (to me) and exciting platform to\nreach others, share what I\u0026#8217;m doing, and - hopefully - build a community.  Secondly, I\u0026#8217;m excited to share this platform\nwith others who may benefit from it, by finding creators they\u0026#8217;d like to support\nand maybe even creating a campaign of their own.  Third, I\u0026#8217;d like to earn some income to allow\nme to further my knowledge, continue my creative journey, and be able to better share\neven more exciting discoveries along the way! \u00a0More on\nthat can be found in my goals on here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to go on a journey with you, bring you into the fascinating world of horses in Japan (plus other places in the future... *hint*) \u00a0and also the fascinating and fun world of model horses. \u00a0And if you are there already a part of either of those worlds, of course you are still more than welcome to join in on the fun here! \u00a0*smile*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be most appreciative of any level of support that someone feels like giving. \u00a0In an attempt to show that, I\u0027ve spent quite a bit of time trying to come up with some fun rewards. \u00a0They are all listed to the right side of this page. \u00a0They may change over time, I might add more, or tweak what I\u0027m offering - feel free to give feedback on what you might like to see or think would be a good thing to offer. \u00a0One thing I can say is that I will not take away any rewards, if at all possible. \u00a0Meaning that if you choose a reward and I decide later on to change something, I\u0027ll still honor what you chose, or discuss it with you if I think of something better! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
