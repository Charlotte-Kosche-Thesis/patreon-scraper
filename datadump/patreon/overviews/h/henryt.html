    "summary": "Thank you to the patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am writing a series of books which depict a humane future\u2014where each country unfolds into three independent bodies: a cultural body founded on Freehood, a human rights body founded on authentic Egalitarianism, and an economic body founded on Altruism. Such a future has never yet been fully pictured by anyone in the whole wide world. The first five volumes are available through my \u003ca href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/threefoldnow/the-books\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThreefold Now website\u003c/a\u003e, as free PDFs, or as softcover books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons supported my writing a fifth book, entitled \u003cem\u003eNations and States\u003c/em\u003e, which shows\u00a0what each of the 193 nation-states could look like if we were to consciously separate national culture\u00a0from political governance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are potentially twelve volumes. My books are presently self-published via CreateSpace; yet\u00a0in the further future, they could be published\u00a0more widely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no rewards for being a patron. I ask that you either support my work as a freely-given gift, or not. The funds will provide daily bread as I\u00a0continue to work as a janitor, while steadily trudging through this daily practice of image-writing, as I have for the past seven years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: Because I sometimes write about Twelve-Step recovery, a few of the posts are patron-only, simply because those posts are based on the Recovery principle of anonymity and self-effacement, and so they\u0027re not fully displayed to the public at large. Yet there is no fee to see the posts - if you\u0027re not a patron, but would like to see those patron-only posts, send me a message at traversetravis (at protonmail dot com) and I\u0027ll send the post(s) to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurplus funds have been used to make and ship complementary\u00a0\"Threefold Care Packages\" to\u00a0the national and international\u00a0leaders whose work\u00a0is mentioned in my books. Each package costs between $30 and $90 (in the case of international shipping). This is a continuation of my successful crowdfunding campaign from 2014\u2014there are \u003ca href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/3foldcare\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ephotos there\u003c/a\u003e which show what a\u00a0care package contains.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach book which makes it into someone\u0027s hands, is one more seed-point\u00a0for the best possible future.\u003cbr\u003e"
