    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\"Oh, well, that\u0027s just the way things were back then, it was the dark ages.\" \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, they weren\u0027t. As a medieval scholar, author, and activist, I work with a broad array of social, cultural, political, and historical material to challenge myths and reveal connections: how the medieval crusades influence the post-9/11 \u2018war on terror\u2019, how the Middle Ages were a vastly diverse, dynamic, and fascinating period that still shape our modern world, how the enduring appeal of an imagined medieval past is fertile ground for epic fantasists and political nationalists alike, and the deep-rooted questions and assumptions around its study and use. I am currently a third-year doctoral student in medieval history at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom, where I am also junior faculty in the department. I am building a career as a professional academic and a socially engaged historian, to diversify and deconstruct the old school of medieval studies and to offer intelligent and critical scholarship on both past and present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, as someone who majored in history and English as an undergraduate, and who wrote her first story at the age of seven and has never stopped since, there is a deeply artistic and creative element to my work. As a published author and longtime writer of fiction in many formats, I aim to create deeply engrossing, beautifully-told stories that combine extensive research with imaginative details, thoughtful plot and complex character, and relevant social commentary and historical adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMost importantly, I hope to use my skills as a writer, teacher, and historian to empower people\u003c/strong\u003e. To allow women, the LGBT+ community, people of color, and others excluded and marginalized by troublesome present politics to find their heroes and inspiration in history, and to overcome all notion of \u2018that\u2019s just how it was back then.\u2019 To challenge simplistic narratives of medieval and modern alike, and to teach young people to think critically, carefully, and broadly. To encourage those of all ages to write and share stories of all kinds, and find joy in their construction and creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a full-time scholar, student, writer, and blogger, and as someone who struggles with severe depression and anxiety, patrons are not just providing financial support, but the freedom to be me and to create a reality in which I can follow my passions without the ever-present fear of paying the bills. Your support is deeply felt and most appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn addition to making a pledge here on Patreon, you can also support me by \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hilary-Rhodes/e/B00L4RZ0R6/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1506260391\u0026amp;sr=8-1\"\u003ebuying my books\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve published five historical novels, one historical/modern thriller, and a sci-fi dystopia co-written with my sister.
