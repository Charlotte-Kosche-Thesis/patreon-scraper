    "summary": "Firstly, thanks for making it this far. If you\u2019re not already aware, Patreon is a platform designed to help creators like me raise cash from those of you who really appreciate what it is we do, and ultimately would like to see us do it more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d like to see 35mmc.com grow bigger, better, stronger, faster, more productive etc, then please consider chucking few quid (or in this case dollars) my way a month. In brief, the more people that chuck me a few quid, the more time I will be able to spend on 35mmc, and ultimately the better it will become!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your cash, you will either get yourself an ad-free experience, or if you punt for one of the higher tiers, you will get to see my early attempts at vlogging, loads of behind the scenes updates, and get to have a direct influence in the future direction 35mmc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf just 1% of the people who look at 35mmc gave me $2 a month via Patreon that would equate to near half my current annual salary. It would mean I could go part time, and dedicate loads more time and effort to 35mmc. That\u2019s less than a magazine subscription!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, take a look at the rewards and get involved!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA bit of backstory (in case you\u0027re interested)\u003c/h3\u003eAs some of you may or may not have noticed, the volume of content being posted on 35mmc has recently quite drastically increased. The website reach and readership has also significantly increased. These two facts are of course directly proportional. The more people read the website, the more people wish to contribute to it. What is also proportional to this growth is the amount of time this growth is taking me to manage. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am becoming increasingly aware that if I wish to maintain this growth whilst also not sacrificing the quality of the content - especially the quality of the content that I produce - I need to find more time in the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may or may not know, I currently only maintain 35mmc outside of my normal working hours. This is a struggle, but I must admit for the time being it is just about sustainable. That being said, at the rate of growth the site is currently seeing, it\u0027s likely it won\u2019t be sustainable forever. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCreating a Patreon page is, in fact, my third attempt at finding a remedy to this. My first attempt to remedy the issue was to ask for PayPal donations - this worked to a degree, but I only received donations in dribs and drabs so wasn\u0027t really sustainable. The second attempt was to add google advertising to the website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may or may not have noticed, very soon after I included the adverts on the website, the speed of the site increased quite significantly. With the advert revenue, I dramatically upgraded the server the website sits on, as well as invested in some technology to make sure that the website is served to everyone around the world as quickly as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe website is now much faster, and in the months since - at least not counting the value of my time - has broken even, on average (it used to cost me money, so this is a step in the right direction). Of course, with it not making any money, I\u2019m still unable to dedicate more time... but hopefully, that\u2019s where this Patreon page will come in. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMy personal goals\u003c/h3\u003eMy next goal is to go part-time at my day job and dedicate more time to 35mmc. By becoming a patron of 35mmc, you will be directly supporting me in the steps toward that happening. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMy goals for 35mmc\u003c/h3\u003eIn the process of setting up this Patreon page, I have read a fair few others to get ideas for how this might work. Many people who use Patreon quite specifically define how the money they raise is going to impact on what they do. I have plenty of ideas myself. As mentioned, primarily, I\u2019d like to go part-time at work so I can dedicate more time to the site. But additionally to this, I have ideas around paying for more professional writers to write more for the site, I\u2019ve also considered the benefits of employing a part-time editor to proof and correct mistakes in the content (something I\u2019m acutely aware that I\u2019m not great at). I\u2019d also like to be able to reward those who write reviews and larger posts for 35mmc with maybe a roll of film or two, or perhaps even some sort of merchandise if that\u2019s what tickles their whistle...\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eUltimately though, I\u2019m not sure which of these paths is right for either me or the website. 35mmc is after all as much about the community that reads and contributes to the site as it is about me and my thoughts, if not more. So to make those decisions alone doesn\u2019t feel quite right. As such, as you can see, the higher rewards include the opportunity to help me decide the future direction of 35mmc!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers for reading (sorry it\u0027s a bit waffly as always)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHamish"
