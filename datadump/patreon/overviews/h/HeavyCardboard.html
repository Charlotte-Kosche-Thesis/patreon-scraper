We are Edward and Amanda, the hosts of the Heavy Cardboard podcast \u0026amp; YouTube channel. We like the heavier side of board games. I mean, we \n\u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003elike the brain-burning, stupor-inducing, mind-melting games that are often overlooked by many in the hobby. Attempting to fill that niche was the impetus of the show. We focus our in-depth reviews on those (often) fantastic games and help folks make informed decisions on whether they may be ones that they will want to check out and enjoy themselves. In addition to the podcast, we also host a plethora of live teaching and play-through sessions of those games on our YouTube channel, along with interviews and other content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have been producing content under the Heavy Cardboard name for coming up on 4 years now and during that time, it has been one of the (if not THE) central things in our lives. The show has become more popular than we ever expected and it\u0027s showing no sign of slowing down, thanks to our incredible listeners and viewers! So while it\u0027s awesome that the show keeps on growing, with that growth comes increased costs. Since late 2017, we have counted on you, our beloved listeners \u0026amp; viewers, to help us create the content that we (and you) enjoy. We love what we are doing and are planning on continuing the show for a long time, but as the show continues to grow, we want to continue improving the quality and breadth of the show. With your support, and the support of others like you, we can continue to improve the production quality of the show as well as expand the coverage of the people and games that help make this part of the hobby so great!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the right side, you\u0027ll see the different levels of support and what benefits each level offers to our Patrons. On the left side, you\u0027ll notice our goals when we reach various milestones (use the arrows to see what Team HC is working towards).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you very much for your support and we look forward to interacting with y\u0027all!"
