From my work (and personal experience) so far, grief seems to sit at the centre of so many of the issues that drive people to seek counselling - be it early griefs that are now manifesting in unhelpful ways of thinking or acting, or perhaps a more current bereavement or loss. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrief is a topic that my heart feels such warmth towards, and to be honest most of the people I work with are grieving something. I think its at the root of a lot of what troubles us, this turning away from our grief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA wise friend whose counsel I very much appreciate often says to me \"Grief, unattended to, wreaks havoc in our lives\". \u00a0I know this has been true for me. I have discovered that it is important for my wellness to be present to my grief. When I am not, I run the risk of becoming enslaved to the many and varied conscious and unconscious methods I run to so as not to feel it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this way, Grieving leads us all to greater freedom. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel I have a good story to tell about why engaging with grief is healthy, life-giving and actually connects us in with more joy and contentment in our lives.

I literally cannot pay all my bills, and due to the nature of the work I am doing, I do not want to get totally stressed out (and take on more work on my one free day p/t, which actually needs to be used for my postgrad research and assignments). Too much pressure makes it much harder to be present to the people I am working with.

I may well buy a cup of coffee with the money you offer each month; or I may put it towards other expenses I have during the year. But one thing is for sure, a cup of coffee here and there certainly won\u0027t go amiss. :-)\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAsking for support is also about me making a stand for the kind of world I want to live in, a world in which it is a good thing to ask for help. If you know me, you\u0027ll know that I believe in support, collaboration and asking; and so creating a network of patrons is all about that.\u00a0Having a community behind me means I\u0027ll be able to do the work \u0026amp; study I need to do in 2018 in a more relaxed way so I can launch this new chapter of my life in an environment of support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart for becoming my patron...in this, my true-north year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith love and appreciation\u003cbr\u003eHilary \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
