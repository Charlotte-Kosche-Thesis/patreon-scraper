Your daily dose of history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Pete and I\u0027m your host.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me today as we delve into the incredible, captivating, devastating and awe-inspiring human story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBIG things are happening in 2018. I already spend the vast majority of my free time on this project, and I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. However I\u0027d love to be able to quit my day job and dedicate ALL of my time to it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my life\u0027s work and I can\u0027t see that ever changing...however it does cost me quite a lot of money to maintain. Your support will help me to buy books for research, better software and equipment for video creation, coffee to keep me going, and eventually it will enable me to visit some of the incredible historical sites I talk about in my videos and step it up a notch with a series of videos called History Time Live. We\u0027re talking detailed histories of Hadrian\u0027s Wall, Offa\u0027s Dyke, the old Mercian capital of Tamworth, Tintagel Castle in Cornwall and a wealth of other castles and fortresses in Britain (Hopefully abroad too).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to gaining my eternal gratitude patrons will also eventually be given early access to scripts and videos as well as getting a chance to vote for the next topics I cover. I\u0027ll even take direct requests from patrons for subjects they are interested in and would love to see a video about.\u003cbr\u003e"
