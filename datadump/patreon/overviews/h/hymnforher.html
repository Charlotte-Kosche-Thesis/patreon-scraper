Many of these inspirations don\u0027t make it to an album, but we would like to share them with you along with the stories and ideas of where they came. We are also parents of a now 11 year old daughter who has been on the road most of her life. We will share parenting ideas and stories as well, answering questions that might help you continue to be an artist while being a parent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe currently have 4 releases and are working on a 2018 Fall release. \u003cbr\u003eThanks for checkin it all out and becoming a part of our team. \u0026lt;3 Lucy \u0026amp; Wayne\u003cbr\u003e"

(Vance \nPowell, Mitch Easter \u0026amp; Jim Diamond). \u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, they returned to the UK and Europe playing many festivals, including Glastonbury, to promote \"Drive Til U Die\" to their overseas audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA new release recorded with Vance Powell is due out in the Fall of 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThey recorded their 2nd album, \u201cHymn for Her Presents . . . Lucy and \nWayne and the Amairican Stream\u201d, in their vintage 1961 Bambi Airstream \ntrailer at locations stretching from Philadelphia to Malibu on a \nthree-month tour.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor their 3rd release, \u201cHymn for Her Presents . . . Lucy and Wayne\u2019s \nSmokin Flames\u201d, the twosome kicked it into high gear. They traveled to \nGhetto Recorders/Detroit to work with Jim Diamond. They recorded live \n\u0026amp; mixed 12 original songs in just one week.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe duo certainly covers a lot of musical territory in Smokin Flames.\n Their wild-eyed mash-up of country, blues and punk led U.K. music \ncritic Steve Bennett to call H4H\u2019s sound \u201ca riotous, rocking roadkill \nstew,\u201d while others have referenced such diverse bands as Captain \nBeefheart, Primus, X, R.L. Burnside, JS Blues Explosion and the Ramones.\u003cbr\u003e\nImpressively, the two create their \u201cripsaw sounds\u201d (Los Angeles \nTimes\u2019 Randy Lewis) with only a few instruments. Wayne (with the \ndevilish voice), mainly playing the kick-drum, high-hat, acoustic guitar\n and harp, serves as the group\u2019s rhythmic driving force. Lucy (of the \nfallen-angel voice) delivers a gritty squall on her \u201cLowebow\u201d \u2014 a \ncustom-made cigar-box guitar: \u201cThe Riff Monster.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nCatch this duo as they burn down the highway and tear up your town like a Wichita twister.",
