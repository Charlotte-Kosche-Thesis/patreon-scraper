    "summary": "Haircut Harry is on a mission to indulge in a barber shop experience in EVERY country of the world as an adventure in barbershop experimental travel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur original YouTube video emerged out of a desire to travel, film, and share these experiences. It was not until we filmed an Indian haircutting experience in a small local barbershop in 1999 that we got what we were truly seeking \u2013 a unique cultural experience that interacted with the local people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe HairCut Harry YouTube Channel was officially launched in August 2012 with \u201cThe Original HairCut Harry Indian Barber Shop Experience YouTube Video\u201d and followed shortly after with \u201cThe Turkish Barber Haircut\u201d. \u00a0Since these first two videos we have filmed and interviewed at barbershops across the USA, Europe, South America, and India. \u00a0 We continue to strive to share this exploration of people and places in all our videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar you contribute helps with the direct expenses of video production which includes but is not limited to the research, travel, filming, editing, and maintenance of camera equipment.  The cost per video fluctuates depending on filming location, but we are in a race against time to document as many original classic barbershops as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron of this adventure we look forward to giving you a closer personal virtual journey as we travel in search of the most unique and interesting barbershops, people, and places!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for your amazing support!\u003cbr\u003e"
