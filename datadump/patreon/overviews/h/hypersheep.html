Please make sure that your given payment account has the funds, not expired, etc, otherwise the pledge will be automatically declined by Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons, please be aware; pledges begin processing on the 1st of every month, regardless of when you pledged. If you pledge on the 31st, for example, you will be charged the following day. We will not issue refunds as all of the chapters are available to you as soon as you pledge. The pledge is locked at 00:00 on the 1st of each month, PST, and Patreon will charge the amount pledged at that time regardless of changes made to the pledge on that day. Please keep this in mind.
