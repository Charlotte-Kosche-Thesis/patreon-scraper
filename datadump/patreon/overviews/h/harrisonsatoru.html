I\u0027m an artist- I like to paint, draw, construct- and a musician. Making music with friends was something that defined my life prior to choosing the monastic route. I finished up three years of intense monastic training two months ago and am now exploring my life and the world with fresh eyes. I would like to invite you to join me on my exploration. By becoming my patron you\u0027ll get to witness and comment on expressions and fresh insights from my journey- likely in the form of song, image, vlog or blog. I would like to lend some of my experience into how to go about meditation- I plan on making some instructive vlogs. But I also just want to create!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSatoru (Harrison)\u003cbr\u003e12/1/16"

Luke and I were in a band together as young folk- and for the first time in 8 years, are planning on making some serious music together. By that I mean, we\u0027re planning on taking the first three weeks of January to ourselves as a kind of intensive, music- making residency. Luke has the studio- and I the time. Help me reach my goal of making $2000 to finance the project and make working with Luke in the future a sustainable possibility. We\u0027re planning on pumping out the tunes- and recording what we create- so you can bet on getting a handful of recordings, an ep or even possibly an album from helping to contribute towards making this goal a reality.\u003cbr\u003e",
