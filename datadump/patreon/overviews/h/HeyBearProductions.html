    "summary": "Hello, welcome to this extremely long Patreon introduction to Hey Bear Productions. If you make it to the end of this, I think I\u0027ll owe \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a contribution!...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, my name is Wayne Johnson and I love pretty much everything - apart from sport, and all the bad stuff in the world - not including sport into all the bad stuff, just saying, I can\u2019t really be doing with it, so I ignore it intensely. Luckily though, there\u2019s so much great stuff about, once you get all the bad stuff out of the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThings that I would include in the \u2018good stuff\u2019 list are (in no particular order) art, drawing, computer graphics, digital painting,3D stuff, video games, animation, music, patterns, graphic design, colours, all the animals and all the plants and trees and the clouds and the stars and all that crazy universe stuff that is just mental!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYeah, anyway, for some weird and still unknown reason, making these Hey Bear Productions videos has somehow managed to encapsulate and include all of those things on my good things list. Not really sure why, but I just love making them - they\u2019re short, sweet, fun to make...I \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e learn something new with every single video I make, even if it\u2019s how to do something that I do a lot just that little bit more conveniently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe biggest problem that I have right now is that I have very little time available to make all the videos on my \u2018I want to make a video like this\u2019 list!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Hey Bear Productions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHey Bear Productions began quite a few years ago now - tell you what, I\u2019ll have to go and look it up, and insert it, around about....here \u0026gt;  \u2026 Ok, so it looks like I uploaded the first version of Hey Bear\u2019s first game on Oct 2, 2010 at 2:55 AM ! , which tell you a little about the time of \u2018day\u2019 that I am normally able to do this stuff - Hey Bear Productions is most definitely a 3am kind of operation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, really, by YouTube terms, that\u2019s pretty much small fry. There are hundreds of channels out there that get 20 times the amount of views, but for little old (yes, I am actually officially old now, just turned 46!) me, it\u2019s kind of mind boggling. So, naturally I would like to continue this, and make more videos. Much more! And, I guess, that\u2019s where you, dear patient reader can help me!\u2026?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs stated, Hey Bear is currently a very, very late night operation\u2026and Fridays. It\u2019s a Friday today, and on Fridays I am able to do Hey Bear stuff, like this, rambling on to you! Other than today, I only manage 2 more days a week making videos, and those can\u2019t realistically be called \u2018days\u2019 because I actually manage to begin working at about 10 pm at the earliest and generally finish somewhere either side of 3 am. It\u2019s probably not that healthy, but I seem to be holding up ok, and have been doing this for nearly a decade now, so I guess I could continue like this; but I\u2019d really rather not\u2026 I\u2019d really like to do Hey Bear stuff for a full 5 actual \u003cem\u003edays\u003c/em\u003e a week, and maybe get a bit more sleep and possibly even some exercise! Well, you never know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, if you\u2019re still here; and if you are, I really must congratulate you, even thank you profusely. Really, thanks for listening! So, if you\u2019re still with me: you\u2019re on Patreon, \u003cem\u003eI\u2019m \u003c/em\u003eon Patreon, and I am asking you, as nicely, and as honestly as I can, if you would help me make Hey Bear a properly full time occupation. The best thing about this is that, not only would I get to do something that I am thoroughly enjoying all day, I would also (and this is the real benefit) be able to make more videos, more often, and those videos would be of a higher quality, as I would be spending \u003cem\u003equality\u003c/em\u003e time making them, rather that the current \u003cem\u003eI\u2019d rather be in bed, asleep\u003c/em\u003e time. Seriously, it seems that Hey Bear has already got a YouTube reputation of hardly putting any videos out, so I do think that there is an appetite out there for more Hey Bear content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m sure that even the smallest contribution will help out, that\u2019s what people say, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the case - full disclosure though - I\u2019m only just starting this whole Patreon lark, so I haven\u2019t even finalised what form the contributions and their relative rewards will be! To be honest, I think a lot of people contribute on Patreon for the love more than for the perceived monetary value for any rewards, at least, that\u2019s my assumption. My current plan is to pretty much open up my entire work process for all Patreons to see and peruse, will probably make a load of wallpaper type images, or printables? Process videos, Google Hangouts? One to one Skype calls? Personal home life videos? Pictures of the cats? You know, that type of thing. I\u2019m going to be listening out for what Patreons actually want as well, so if there is something that you really would like to see, or have available to you as a Patreon, please do get in touch - even if you aren\u2019t currently contributing - please get in touch and let me know what you would like, and I\u2019ll do my best - I\u2019m new to this, and am guessing what people would like, so let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOk, I think you\u2019ll agree that that\u2019s quite enough for now; almost certainly much more than enough - so I guess you\u2019ve got an idea of what Hey Bear Productions is all about, and once again, thank you so much for taking the time to read all this! Oh, there\u2019s more? Oh.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have realised that Patreon contributors are enabling artists and creators to produce the content that they really want to make without needing to go out and make what someone else wants them to make.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve got so many ideas that there\u2019s not enough time in the day, or even the night to produce them all - I\u2019m currently working on Hey Bear videos only one day, and two nights, a week, and on those nights I\u2019m up until gone three in the morning.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you paying for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou are paying for time - that\u2019s it - only time! \u003cbr\u003e\nIt takes a long time to make each video and your contribution will allow me to spend more time making videos more often, and allowing me to really take the extra time necessary to really push the quality of each video.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs far as resources go, I have literally everything that I need to keep making videos, so I really don\u2019t need to buy anything like cameras, computers, software or art materials - I have more than enough of everything.\u003cbr\u003e\nYour Patreon contribution will only go towards me being able to afford to take the time to make more and more videos, and to spend more time making them so that they get better and better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will it help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHey Bear can make and release videos more often and those videos will be of a higher quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nQuite honestly, I really don\u2019t know yet. Basically, if you want something, just let me know, and I\u2019ll do my best to put it on the list! Mostly though, you\u2019ll get more Hey Bear videos more often, and of a higher quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eRewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you video\u003cbr\u003e\nIt means so much that you would take the time and effort to contribute to help me make more videos!

     "description": "This is like the Secret Folder (which you\u0027ll also get access to anyway if you were to choose this tier) but it\u0027s probably quite a bit messier. It should be pretty interesting though, as it will contain lots of work in progress stuff, like early renders (I do a lot of test videos that don\u0027t make it all the way to YouTube), psd files of the videos that I am currently making, so you can poke around and get an idea of how it\u0027s all done, and also a few behind the scenes videos, maybe time lapses of work in progress, or even some voice overs of stuff that I\u0027m working on that will explain a particular way that I\u0027m going about making the videos. It might not be as finished or as pretty as the Secret Folder, but it could be faaaairly interesting?\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll time date each folder so that all previous bits and pieces are still available for anyone that arrives late to the party. This will also help seasoned Patreons to find the newest stuff in the pile!\u003c/p\u003e",
