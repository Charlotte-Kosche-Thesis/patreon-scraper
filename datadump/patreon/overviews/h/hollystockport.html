I\u2019ve been writing stories for many years but only recently have been able to pursue a self-published route. My debut novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Ascension of Melanie Winters\u003c/em\u003e, was released in February 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWait a minute...haven\u2019t I heard your name somewhere else before?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hstockportwriter.co.uk\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIf you spend a lot of time on YouTube, you may have! As well as being a self-published author, I\u2019m also a \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/hollystockport\"\u003eyoutuber\u003c/a\u003e with over 3.4K subscribers where I discuss things such as beauty, skincare, fashion, mental health and anything else I feel like talking about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE YOU WRITING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy childhood dream was to become an author; I spent a lot of my free time writing stories and creating vivid, populated worlds that I could put down on paper (or keyboard when I became older). No matter how many different career paths I\u2019ve attempted to take, being a published author is the only thing that has remained constant. It\u2019s a passion that makes me who I am and keeps me going through every emotion. It\u2019s also a huge distraction for me when I\u2019m going through a tough time, particularly as I have mental health issues that can sometimes make life quite overwhelming. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, I went through a number of changes to my life that made me take a step back and re-evaluate what I wanted to do. I decided that being an author was something that was still a huge goal of mine and worked on my first novel which was released to great success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, writing is a crucial part of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FIRST BOOK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Ascension of Melanie Winters\u003c/em\u003e is my debut novel which released in February 2018. It\u2019s a science fiction young adult read and follows the title character who leads a life with the power to move whatever she wants with her mind. But, she has no idea how she got the powers to begin with. After causing a freak accident, she moves to the Welsh countryside with her mother to start again; strange occurrences happen instantly upon her arrival and she soon discovers the horrifying origins of her telekinesis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to purchase the book, you can do so via my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.hollystockport.co.uk/books\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eofficial website.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE YOU ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a self-published author hasn\u2019t come without a substantial cost; my first book was professionally edited, I\u2019ve bought a hosting package for my official website, the website I use to distribute my books has a small fee if I want to order copies and so on. All of the money thus far has come completely out of my own pocket. By supporting me on Patreon, you\u2019ll be directly funding all future books I write and take a huge weight off my shoulders when I need to get costs together. Even if you can only pledge $1, it makes a massive difference. You can find out more about the goals that I have on the left hand side, which will give you an idea of the things I\u2019m currently paying for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDO I HAVE TO SUPPORT YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely not. I\u2019m not going to force you to become a Patreon if you don\u2019t want to / if you can\u2019t afford to, whatever reason you have. This is all simply optional; you can still purchase all of my books and access my work without becoming a Patreon. To be honest, the fact that you\u2019ve chosen to purchase my work regardless is supporting me in itself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT KIND OF REWARDS DO YOU OFFER?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s plenty of rewards that you can access depending on how much you pledge. The rewards range from access to an exclusive private Instagram account, digital downloads of work that\u2019s been directly funded by Patreon and even free copies of my books forever! There\u2019s a wide range of rewards to suit everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do chose to support my dream of becoming a fully fledged self-published author, then I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e"
