I live in Somerset, England, and I make a living building and renovating but I\u0027m determined to spend less time on building sites and more time doing what I love, which is drawing. Having enjoyed drawing as a youngster I\u0027ve returned to it recently and felt I needed to discover some tricks and techniques\nthat would allow me to improve quickly and make up for some lost time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eThis became a mission. It worked. And I want to share what I found with you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.redd.it/wgjoauit4yh01.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was dissapointed to find that this information wasn\u0027t neatly packaged somewhere, waiting for me to discover it, so I set about\u00a0sifting and distilling all the useful advice I could find. Eventually I arrived\nat something as close to a recipe for success as I could get, essentially a set of\ninstructions I could follow every time I draw, to produce an accurate likeness, by eye (not using\ngrids etc), a reliable method that would improve the quality of my drawings as fast as possible, allowing me to give more and more energy to \u0027artistic expression\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving\ndecided I\u0027m going to learn a new skill, whether I stick with it or not usually depends on how fast I make progress. The drawing techniques\nI\u0027ve come to rely on force me to improve noticeably every time I draw. There\u0027s\nno substitute for practice but  it\u0027s\npossible to bypass a LOT of frustrating hard slog just by making sure you\u0027re practicing the\nright things. If you can write your name then you already know how to use a pencil. It\u0027s all about learning how to see in a new way. We\u0027ve had our eyes open since the day we were born but drawing requires us to look at the world differently. Once you learn how to do this everything falls logically into place and you start to make drawings you\u00a0wouldn\u0027t have imagined you were capable of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.redd.it/84toqmmw90i01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mantra now is: ANYONE can draw. Really - it\u0027s easier than you think! And it\u0027s a great way to get \u0027in the zone\u0027 and forget your stress. Having made some fast progress I\u0027m now committed to spending the rest of my life getting better and the more people who come on that journey with me, the more fun and fulfilling it\u0027s going to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the\nfirst few weeks I\u0027m going to make all my posts free and visible to the public\nbut it would be amazing to find enough people who are prepared to make a small\nmonthly contribution to enable me to continue learning, finding out what really works,\nand passing that information on to my patrons, along with links to a lot of other stuff that will keep you informed, interested, amused and motivated - incredible artists, discounted materials, recommended books, advice on how to make money from your art, and loads more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease\npledge whatever you feel it\u0027s worth to you and come along for the ride!
