WHY AM I DOING THIS? WHY HERE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs far as why patreon instead of another site, I chose patreon over google sites or facebook because those are such giant monopolies and I don\u0027t want a Facebook or Google file. My technical skills are poor so this prefabricated site is easy to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago I developed some electromagnetic/wireless sensitivities and assumed the world would quickly change with notice. I actually became very sick, and went doctor to doctor asking why my symptoms arose around these exposures. I eventually met a doctor, in a specialty, who said he had many patients who shared similar complaints though he didn\u0027t treat for that problem. In order to get better, I had to reduce my daily exposures as much as possible, meaning that I eventually was able to be around common exposure setting for a short time and not feel very badly.\u00a0 As a result I began looking at research and found support for my symptoms, even when many doctors have never been trained about this. I have met others with this sensitivity and formed new friendships. To me this story shows exposures can cause anyone to become suddenly ill. This is also what is called an invisible illness or disability, and the fluctuating health of the sensitive individual in relation to exposures can be quite confusing for others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing a non-wireless computer is surprisingly bothersome these days, and so I minimize use just to improve society or my situation. Still, I would like greater awareness on this issue, and would like to help change this situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recognize that pollution keeps extending and past property lines: telecommunications signals traverse the globe and chemical spills ignore boundaries. So, for this reason, I wish to work on legislation to change these kinds of circumstances and help create an environment that is much more supportive and environmentally sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to this sensitivity and extensive accompanying research, I am very suspicious of the attitude by some that \"reducing\" exposure is the simple answer, and by advocacy of small warnings such as against cell phone use exclusively.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe attitude that reducing wireless exposures is the answer is a bit of distraction from reality: a safe level of exposure or safe frequency has never publicly been identified. Researchers are searching for a safe level and still that has not been identified. I can only consider taking someone seriously if they admit this fact, well known among scientists in the field.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe field of reducing exposures is plagued with individuals who are cranks, selling fake \"protections\" or psychological cures, or who have only partial understanding of mitigation and refuse to admit this fact. Of course no one has all the answers, but some won\u0027t admit it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is still a lack of understanding among scientists as to working of biological effects, with some suggesting very weak exposures even have a non-linear, sometimes stronger effect. Sam Milham discusses the issue of electrical wiring providing dangerous exposures even barring high fields in his book \u003cem\u003eDirty Electricity\u003c/em\u003e. Electrical wiring could be designed to be safer, but currently because risks are not admitted, electrical design is very poor nor is the public informed so as to insure that electrical wiring in residences is tested for safety. Digital electronics and surging or pulsing electrical design poses special problems to our health even when non-wireless, and so the answer is more complicated than just hard-wiring computers to reduce wireless exposures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why does this site exist, when perhaps other groups could be joined? Finding the right group to share many different views is difficult. Being published in a paper is also difficult, when one is not conventional, or when one mentions risks of electromagnetic exposure. So this is a bit of a no strings site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I called different groups, I realized many environmental groups were conflicted by wireless or utility interests due to advocating for clean energy and receiving funds and support for such advocacy. The Environmental League of Massachusetts even advocated for the Smart Grid, i.e. wireless grid. Other nonprofits have a mission which precludes taking up all or some political topics, and many are too strapped for funds and members to consider a new campaign. Regarding a lawsuit to prevent wireless exposures, I contacted the ACLU, the present and last state attorney general, and organizations dedicated to disability law. Those last two have received plenty of calls from me and others. No go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had been looking for a group to join to advocate for some of these ideas but pretty much have given up by now. Even some groups actually working on the electromagnetic issue in Massachusetts are working in a different direction, such as Piti Theatre which does great work on their own. Trying to get friends who are not part of a group but who are spread thin over many tasks to work on creating our own nonprofit seems a bit much. And some prefer anonymity. In the Pioneer Valley there are people working with me on this issue, but much of our work is ad hoc and not formally enshrined.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCONTACT?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePlease email concisely only regarding legislation, to move these issues forward, to inquire about meeting someone in Pioneer Valley for rental of Acoustimeter, or for questions on events posted.
