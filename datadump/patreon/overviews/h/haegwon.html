    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHere is Je Hae Gwon, Hi everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe video above is my YouTube channel introduction, which you might have watched already. I am a Korean gamer, and I especially enjoy playing Elsword and Closers now.  My real name is Haegwon Je (\u8af8\u6d77\u6b0a), and as of right now my main job is to make videos, play games, and do gaming livestream with you guys! Several years ago I was studying in a University, and my major was Western History: as you know now, I am making videos for you guys, which I love. I really want to and am eager to continue doing this. That is the reason I started Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what is this, where is here, why Je is in Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I do take some income from YouTube, yes. But as you know, YouTube\u0027s strict copyright policy and contents ID usually stop me; therefore my income isn\u0027t stable. So it\u0027s hard to ensure my living budget. Sometimes I seriously wonder whether I should get another real job and put the YouTube thing as my hobby or not, but I don\u0027t want to leave this work which I love and you may also love.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, in our videos, that means my income is solely based on the advertisement companies and Youtube. I\u0027d rather have more fun time with my fans, rather than having to worry about those advertisement people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, Let me make this point clear.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eEven though I will get support from people here, it doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll make videos only for my benefits. Loving what you do and doing what you do for business is quite different, I\u0027d say. I will keep on making videos at a same pace, or even more. Patreon is just a special option. You could pledge for however amount you could; I will be grateful for any amount of pledge. I prepared rewards and milestone events for you; check the on the bottom of this page for more info! I hope the seceding events will be fun events for us and I wish to continue this on with a happy mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThese are the kind of videos I want to keep on making and have fun with you in the process :D\u003c/em\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/tXwjzAcns6M?rel=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you always for watching on my videos, staying in my livestream, and having time with me whether or not you decide to pledge. I appreciate you checking out the campaign with fun which I prepared!\u003cbr\u003e"
