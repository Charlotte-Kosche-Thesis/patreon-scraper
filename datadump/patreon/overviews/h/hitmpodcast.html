If you exploit a class what does resistance look like? What\ncharacters from the past have made huge gambles that either saved or destroyed\nan entire society? What government springs up after peace compared to\nrevolution?  These questions are best answered with stories. Stories\nthat shape us today both on a personnel and societal level. John Adam sums it up well.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\u201cThe\nfoundation of every government is some principle or passion in the minds of the\npeople. The noblest principles and most generous affections in our nature then,\nhave the fairest chance to support the noblest and most generous models of\ngovernment.\u201d \u2013 John Adams\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTogether\nwe can find the \u003cstrong\u003epassions that cause\nnations to be born\u003c/strong\u003e, societies to flourish, and, occasionally, cause them to\ncollapse. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nWhy create a show? Why start with Greece?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn early 2016 I was learning about Greece via\nthe founding father\u2019s relationship with Sparta, Thucydides\u2019 History of the\nPeloponnesian War, a pretty sweet video game (not gonna lie\u2026), and when my wife\nbought me Melissa Lane\u2019s The Birth of Politics it sealed the deal. Almost\neverything I was interested in had something to do with Greece. I decided to go\nfull bore and really learn about Ancient Greece \u2013 Its general history, culture,\npolitics, the way they reacted to hardship and how their thinking shaped us today.\nThen, I thought to myself \u201cI\u2019m already doing 90% of the work with all the\nreading I\u2019m doing so I might as well start a show!\u201d \u003cstrong\u003eI was very, very wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nResearch is only one part of the show\n(obviously\u2026). There is also behind the scenes tech stuff, recording, editing,\nsound effects, music, storytelling and various other learning curves. After a\nyear and a half of production and learning the trade I have an established\nvision of what I want the show to be and now \u003cstrong\u003efeel I now have something of value to offer\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy episode 21 I estimate I\u2019ve put about 1,000\nhours into the show (that includes everything, building the website, learning\nthe technical side of things, creating artwork, etc.). \u2013 That is on top of a\nnormal day job. \u003cstrong\u003eHere is where\nyou come in.\u003c/strong\u003e On top of hours there are a surprising amount of\nexpenses for running a podcast (audio licensing fees, hosting fees, website\ndomain, etc.). It\u2019s a pleasure to produce this show for a great audience \u003cstrong\u003ebut it\u2019s your support that keeps it going!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to bring history alive and donations you\nmake will help me do that. Whether it is $1 or $10 an episode it makes the show\ncome to life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
