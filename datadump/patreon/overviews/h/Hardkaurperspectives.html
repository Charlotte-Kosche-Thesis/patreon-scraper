We\u0027re on YouTube, we\u0027re on a blog, and we have a podcast. We just want to get our voices out there. We think our name, Hard Kaur Perspectives, tells you a lot about our work. Kaur is the last name of Sikh females and it essentially means warrior. We grew up with a unique lens as first-generation Indian Americans of immigrant parents, and also as females. Growing up in this split culture - American and Indian - showed us that there was no one way to look at the world. It left us with many questions, and our podcast is an attempt at further investigating these questions and sharing them with people in hopes of having a meaningful conversation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe discuss everything from dating and pop culture to religion and science. So, if you\u0027re interested and curious to hear more on this, welcome to our podcast. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eGET TO KNOW US\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m\u00a0Gia\u00a0and I\u2019m pretty happy about it. I was born in Kalra, a small farming village in Punjab, India to a Sikh family. We moved to America when I was two years old. I\u2019ve lived and grown up in the cradle of the ocean and shadow of the mountains and embrace of the forest in Everett, WA pretty much my whole 25 years of existence, except for my brief stints abroad in Rome and London. I graduated from The University of Washington with a Bachelors in English in 2014. I am the first in my immediate family to graduate from college. It\u2019s pretty awesomesauce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMovies, stand-up, music, podcasts, books, and current events are basically oxygen to me. I love compiling a mental database of fun facts to whip out at will to share with friends and strangers and make people think, smile, or become complicit in minor crimes. Wait no, scratch that last part. Basically, I just like knowing things. Did you know that a blue whale\u2019s tongue weighs 8,000 lbs? That\u2019s as much as one male African elephant! That\u2019s bonkers! I\u2019m pretty much just a big five year old that is constantly blown away by this world and I just have to tell people about it. Whether they like it or not. But honestly, they usually do. Cause people like stories and I like hearing theirs. Not all the things I learn are pleasant, though. But I want to know this world just as it is. And I can\u2019t do it alone. So let\u2019s share some stories \u2013 get to know each other, maybe understand the world better, maybe try to fix it. And have some rum. There must always be ample rum.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003e\u003cbr style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eHey I\u2019m\u00a0Anu. Not AnNA, not UhNuh, not HEY YOUUUUU. All of which I\u2019ve been called by substitute teachers to strangers to longtime friends who I\u2019ve just never corrected (LOOK HERE GUYS THIS IS HOW IT\u2019S PRONOUNCED! I still love you, though.) It\u2019s pronounced Uh-Nu (uh-huh). Ya dig.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a Washington native and like to say I\u2019m from Seattle because few know of the small, often weird place that is Everett. Though for technical purposes I am from Everett (represent). Briefly, though, I spent 5 of my years actually living in Seattle attending the University of Washington after which I picked up a job at the Courthouse. It was pretty neat but I think I enjoyed Seattle more when it was kept at a distant like a shiny snow globe that looks perfect and beautiful, minus the snow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am extremely excited to be working on this project with Gia. It\u2019s been a long time coming. I feel like I\u2019ve spent most of my time lost, not realizing the impact of being a first generation Indian American has had on me. I\u2019ve always known it was weird especially when kids would give me dirty looks for bringing curry to elementary school (haters). Or when people would ask if they could get slurpees from my family\u2019s 7/11 after which I felt betrayed because my family had never told me about no 7/11 and where were my free slurpees?! But, in all seriousness, it\u2019s taken me a long time to realize that the weird feeling wasn\u2019t weird at all and deserves some exploring. Especially after my recent trip to India where I had the privilege to talk to a lot of my family in my village, I got to thinking more and more. I\u0027m happy to be a part of this podcast and blog to share with you all the knowledge I happen across during this process. Let\u0027s figure it out together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWE NEED YOUR HELP\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027ve been doing this for a few months now and received positive feedback. People are interested in our cultural perspective, and we\u0027re loving doing this work. We want to keep bringing people quality content and entertainment, but are also working full-time jobs to sustain ourselves. In order to keep doing this and so that we can move out of Anu\u0027s mom\u0027s bathroom (where we are currently recording sessions) and buy quality sound equipment as well as to secure our iTunes platform, we need some funding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount of support helps. We\u0027d really appreciate monthly donations to support us and keep a steady budget. We cannot thank you enough for this support.\u00a0For being patrons you will receive exclusive content and bonus episodes as well as yearly surprises.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
