    "summary": "Thank you for being interested in HeadButler.com. And for reading this (I\u0027ll be brief.) And for -- please, please -- becoming a supporter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched\u00a0HeadButler.com \"for people with more\ntaste than time\" to praise books, movies, music and\nproducts I like. Unlike every other cultural concierge or online review, I had an original insight: I didn\u0027t have to write only about new stuff.\nBecause just about everything ever released is available on Amazon, I could\ntell you about my all-time favorites, whenever they were created. As I say, \"If it\u0027s new to you, it\u0027s\nnew.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince 2004, I\u0027ve been publishing four days a\nweek, except for a few weeks in August and again in December. (Even butlers need time off!) There are now\nalmost 2,000 pieces in the archives. (I hesitate to call them\n\"reviews\" --- they\u0027re more like emails from an enthusiastic fan.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve loved writing these pieces. And your emails. And the close friendships I\u0027ve formed with people I\u0027ve never met.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never saw Butler as a big money-maker. I just wanted it to stand on its own two feet --- to pay for itself. But\u00a0the business model no longer works. Month after month, Butler is a cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\nI\u0027m to continue regular publication, I need some of my readers to help me pay the bills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: Patreon\u0027s screens suggest that a donation of $1 is fine. Not to be an ingrate, but unless \u003cem\u003ethousands\u003c/em\u003e of you pledge $1, that small a donation is of no help to me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat will you get if you make a monthly pledge?\nSimple --- you\u0027ll get exactly what the readers who don\u0027t chip in will get: Butler four (or maybe three) days a week. Does that seem unfair? Well, that set-up --- some subscribe, some get it free --- seems to be working pretty well for NPR and my favorite radio station, WFUV.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally?\u00a0Nothing extra? Sadly, no.\nI have a book to write, a play to promote, a movie that needs a production\nteam, and a teenager I help and annoy. I simply don\u0027t have\ntime to create something \"extra\" for subscribers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I don\u0027t raise enough to cover my costs? I\u0027ll have to stop publication. But I\u0027ll leave the site up, and, if so inclined, you can read your way through the archives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest case: Butler lives. And with the financial crisis solved, I can continue to\nchallenge, enlighten, educate and amuse you --- I can go on being the best possible\nbutler for your head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----\u003cbr\u003ePatreon encourages me to make a video \"that\u00a0shows how real this is to you and how much you value their participation in your journey.\" Better idea: offer a video from the site. Something you might never have known about if I hadn\u0027t showcased it. So here\u0027s the Allegri \"Miserere.\" (It\u0027s just 8 minutes. Click \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/GxOriO0dz_I\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/GxOriO0dz_I\u003c/a\u003e to watch the Tallis Scholars perform it.) It was written in 1638 and held by the Pope for his personal pleasure until.... well, why not go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.headbutler.com/reviews/miserere/\"\u003ehttps://www.headbutler.com/reviews/miserere/\u003c/a\u003e and read about it?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
