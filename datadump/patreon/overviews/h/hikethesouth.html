Or maybe getting bitten by a copperhead or timber rattlesnake. Or contracting Lyme disease from a deer tick. Maybe you\u0027re worried about bees, wasps, or hornets. Or being the first on the trail and walking through all the fresh spider webs (the worst).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nScary, I know. But what you shouldn\u0027t worry about is not knowing the length or difficulty of a trail. Does it have a million side trails? You should know. Is the trail rocky or covered in roots? Is is a wide gravel path or a narrow overgrown trail? What\u0027s the number for the ranger station I should call if I want more info or up to date open/closure information? There\u0027s a lot of things you can\u0027t control, but you should know what kind of hike you\u0027re getting yourself into.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"color: #88B04B;\"\u003eEnter Hike The South\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you live in the Southeast US,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.hikethesouth.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHike The South\u003c/a\u003e has you covered. Many other hiking sites only have a few images and usually these are just the view or waterfall at the end. Some sites allow users to upload images so you get 200 of the exact same waterfall. Some sites have elevation graphs but are too small to read or don\u0027t have enough axis markers to really tell what\u0027s going on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI built Hike The South with a focus on data driven design. The goal was to answer one question: \n\u003cem\u003eDo I want to go on this hike?\u003c/em\u003e So how is this site different?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eImages that show you what the trail is like from beginning to end.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFull screen width elevation graphs and Google Maps of the trail topography.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA difficulty formula based on exponential elevation differences (twice as steep = more than twice the difficulty rating) between each GPS Trackpoint.

First and foremost, I recently did a complete redesign of the site and left out some functionality I wanted to spend more time on so I\u0027ll be adding that soon. The most pressing of which is the map view for search. Beyond this I have plenty of ideas, some vetted and others not so much.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFeature pages to focus on...\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eStates with breakdowns for major cities, waterfall hikes, paved paths, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eMajor trails like the AT and the Mountains-to-Sea trail\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eMajor parks/areas like the Smokies and the Blue Ridge Parkway\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eOther fun/random classifications such as Southern Sixers\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eUpdates to search to include location/distance filter options and split map/grid view.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eQuestion and Answer sections on each hike.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMore hike details such as bathroom condition, park hours, and similar hikes based on length and difficulty.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMore user options like saving favorites and side by side hike comparisons.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
