Getting money for actors, props, games, and equipment is hard.\u00a0 I also want to shoot some videos on location but need money for travel expenses. This will help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of my videos (Trailer breakdowns, reactions, reviews) are time sensitive. I need to have a video out within a few days or sometimes a few hours for it to get any kind of traction. Some times things get in the way and when I finally have time to film the moment is gone. Over the last 2 years I have come up with tons of funny ideas but wasn\u0027t able to execute them because it wouldn\u0027t have been worth the time and effort. If I am able to make decent money from this I can finally start doing a lot of the ideas I\u0027ve had to scrap. So you will be getting exclusive content!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what I will always keep creating videos and content. This will just make it better...or less shitty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
