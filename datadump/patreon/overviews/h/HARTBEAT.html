There is nothing I love more than making videos. Spreading awareness towards serious issues that I feel strongly about, being silly, \u0026amp; making music has always been my passion. For it to be an actual career where I can do ALL of those things at once is a SUPER surreal dream \u0026amp; a true blessing. BUT we have bigger plans to achieve at the highest level possible! The people who support ALL of my channels really make me feel like my life is worth living . I have several task that I\u0027d like to complete this year \u0026amp; I won\u0027t be able to do them with out the help of you guys! .^_^.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy was this petreon page created?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#1) A portion of all of the money made on Patreon (10%) I will donate to \u003cbr\u003eGLAAD, The Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation. The fight for \u003cbr\u003eequal representation is being fought for by so many queer \u003cbr\u003efolks on YouTube, but GLAAD has fought the good fight for decades\u003cbr\u003ebefore us to make sure that we have equal representation in the media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#2) Having a secure monthly income for PURELY making videos \u0026amp; music will allow me to reach for the STARS on all of my future projects! I\u0027d be able to hire a film crew to make the stories I create come to even more LIFE. I\u0027d be able to produce short films, host events, visit schools, buy more music studio time, better equipment, \u0026amp; collaborate with some of my favorite people whom I NEVER thought that I could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#3) I really want to be able to fund a worldwide tour, make better T-Shirts, \u0026amp; finally make that Lesbian Web Series I\u0027ve always wanted to produce \u0026amp; see come alive one day. I JUST WANT TO DO MORE! While giving back to the community that\u0027s rooted me on the past five years of doing what I love doing. I\u0027d like to travel \u0026amp; spread the word to young adults out there who need to HEAR that no matter your exterior, character, sexuality, or gender... ALL things are possible! .^_^.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNO - Pay in any currency!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs this is US based website, everything is written in Dollars,\u003cbr\u003e but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron? \u003cbr\u003eYAS! \u003c/strong\u003ePlease only sign up to donate\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ewhat you can easily afford.\u003cbr\u003e Even $1 per month will make a huge difference\u003cbr\u003e and would be greatly appreciated. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes of course!
