Simply put, we love horror. Whether it\u0027s the latest indie sensation or an obscure 70\u0027s title, a throwaway slasher flick or a masterpiece, we watch them all. We want to bring you the good stuff, and the so-bad-it\u0027s-good stuff. And we want to help kick-ass horror creators find the audience they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, we presented a short film festival at Twin Cities Horror Fest IV. It was an astonishing success. Over a hundred people attended our sessions, and we were able to bring some amazing work to a larger audience. Sitting in a darkened theater listening to laughter, gasps, and applause was an electrifying experience. It made us want to do more with our little podcast. We\u0027d like to make the recordings more professional-sounding, find a larger audience (while making it better for all y\u0027all who already listen), and make more cool stuff happen for the horror community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help balance our plans for Horror Show Hot Dog with our other responsibilities, we\u0027re asking for you to contribute some of your hard-earned cheddar. Or skrilla, if you have any. What\u0027s the going skrilla-to-cheddar conversion rate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, If you don\u0027t want to contribute, that\u0027s cool--we\u0027ll keep releasing an episode a week as long as anyone is listening.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you\u0027re a fan of the show, and you\u0027d like to see it evolve, please consider signing up for a monthly pledge. You\u0027ll get early access to shows, bonus audio, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to all of you who have made this podcast a success in the past. Let\u0027s work together and do some great stuff in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003eJosh, Matt, Charlie and Chip\u003cbr\u003e"
