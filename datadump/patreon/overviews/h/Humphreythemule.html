    "summary": "I want to thank all of the supporters of Humphrey and his journey. He is an amazing mule and I am proud to be his mom. Without donors, Humphrey\u0027s fate would have been horrific. Most animal\u0027s fate relies on humans. We can be the change!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Humphrey and this is my story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn July 2017, I was pulled from the horse slaughter pipeline. The blonde woman who untied me from the pole that I had sat at all day with no food or water was so kind and gentle. She walked me down an alley way and into a trailer. She gave me a kiss on my nose and told me I was finally safe. I was in so much pain and so tired, I honestly did not care where I ended up. A short time later, we arrived at a strange place with strange people. It took me a couple days to realize that these people weren\u0027t so bad; they gave me fresh water and hay everyday, they gave me medications that eased my pain, and they even began to soak my feet, (although I did not like it because it hurt so bad, I was on my best behavior because they were so nice to me). A few weeks later, I saw the blonde lady, she had come back for me! She told me I was finally going \"home\". I thought to myself what is a home? She loaded me back up in the trailer and off we went. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple hours later, we arrived at the farm. The blonde woman unloaded me from the trailer, I was so excited, there were horses everywhere! I was tired from the trip and kind of shy, so I stayed quiet. When I was introduced to my new bedroom (it was huge by the way), I loved the open back window. I was so interested in everything going on around me that it took me a few minutes to notice another lady standing next to me. She offered me treats, but I wasn\u0027t too sure of what they were so I declined. A few minutes later, this little lady came in my bedroom with these things that made a buzzing noise; she wasn\u0027t scared so I didn\u0027t think I had to be either. Within a half an hour, she had shaved a good portion of my long fur off, man, it felt so good to feel the breeze again!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next few months, I began to notice myself looking for this little lady. Every afternoon she would come see me. She would love me, soak my feet, bathe me (I smelled so bad), give me my medications, and teach me how life should be. She would even introduce me to all the little kids at the barn, gosh I love attention! We had our good days and we had our bad days; when I was having my bad days, she would try to make everything as easy as possible on me. Late nights when I wasn\u0027t feeling well, she would stay with me and read, I am quite the science buff now! A couple weeks after being around her all of the time, I noticed she would bring a man with her to visit me. He was pretty cool, he would scratch my head the entire time my feet soaked, he even found my itchy spot in my ears! When I was feeling my worst, he always tried to make me feel better with back massages. These are the two people I have come to know as mom and dad. I was so happy when Caitlin let me adopt them, I had found my furever home!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I am feeling much better these days, I still am having health issues. It seems when one issue goes away, another one arises. Mom keeps telling me to be patient and I will get through this. I am trying my best. Mom says once I am at full optimal health, she will rescue a long eared lady friend for me!\u00a0\u00a0Gosh I can\u0027t wait!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I still have a long road ahead of me and I know my vet bills are quite expensive. I know mom and dad are still in school, but I have been trying my best to get better! Mom and dad said they would never give up on me, so I will never give up on them. By choosing to donate, you will help aid in my medical care which would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I was tired, beat down, in pain and had just about given up hope. Caitlin untied me from the pole I was tied to and walked me down an alley way, loaded me onto a trailer and off I went. At this point, I don\u0027t recall even caring where I ended up because I was so tired of living. She dropped me off at a strange place and there were a lot of strange people. After spending a couple days at this place, I began to enjoy my stay; these people were friendly. They gave me lots of water, hay, medications to relieve my pain and love. They kept making me soak my feet, (even though it hurt I tried my best to behave because they were so nice). After a few weeks at this facility, I saw the blonde lady who rescued me! She came up to my stall and told me I was going home!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I arrived at the farm, Caitlin unloaded me from the trailer; I was scared but so excited! I was introduced to my new bedroom, gosh it was so big! I was so busy paying attention to everything else, it took me a few minutes to take notice of the little lady standing next to me. She was kind, she tried to feed me treats but I had no idea what they were... Shortly after that, she came into my bedroom with clippers and began shaving my heavy coat off! I figured she wasn\u0027t scared, so why should I be? Some time later, I was free of most of the long heavy fur that covered my body, man it felt so good! Over the next few months, I found myself looking for this lady every day. She would come every afternoon, give me my medications, soak my feet, give me baths (I smelled so bad), and love me. She would be patient when I was hurting and would always try to figure out a way to make things easier for me. She would introduce me to all the youngsters at the barn, gosh I love attention! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had good days and we had bad days, but this lady never gave up on me. She would stay late when I wasn\u0027t feeling well and would even read to me, I became quite knowledgable in the science field! After a few weeks, I noticed she would bring a man with her to visit me everyday. They would spoil and pamper me and when I was having really bad days, I even got back massages by the man!\u00a0 This man and woman are whom I have come to know as mom and dad. I was so excited when Caitlin let them adopt me! I have found my furever home!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I am feeling much better, I am still having health issues. When we figure out one issue, another one arises. I know it will take some time for me to get back to being healthy, mom tells me to be patient, I am trying. Even though I am bummed about my illnesses, my spirits get higher and higher everyday!\u00a0Mom says once I am feeling better and at full health, she will rescue me a long eared girlfriend! Gosh I can\u0027t wait!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know my medical expenses are high and my parents are both trying to finish their college degrees, so any donations towards my care would greatly help. They said they would never give up on me, so I will never give up on them.\u00a0",
