    "summary": "Hello my name is Michelle Guido. I am a Feminist Activist loud woman. I am a youtuber but I would say I am currently most known for my twitter account where I speak out a lot. I decided to make a patreon because a lot of the things I want to do can get costly. Also I never can seem to get involved and do as much as I want to do because I have to work a lot of hours at a \"regular\" job. I make my content for the greater good. So I will never make anyone pay to see my content that is not why I create it. I will however accept patreons from people who believe in me and want to see me be able to do more. I have a few different tier options with different rewards I have come up with. The money I receive here will go into different things. Better equipment for videos, some will be used for me to take some hours off work to spend creating and working on different things. Any travel expenses for future events I would like to go to so I can speak on and get more involved. I have so many ideas of all the things I want to do in the future and my biggest obstacle is not being able to cut back any hours from a corporate job. I always appreciate any supporters and you do not have to donate to me for me to think you are awesome. But if you want to see more from me your contributions are extremely appreciated!\u00a0"
