Anyway, now because of the internet, and with the help of my friend, Brian McGeorge, \u00a0I am able to share this knowledge with YOU through these great mediums; podcasting and blogging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003eProducing a podcast and blog takes time to build every episode and entry. \u00a0There is research, writing, recording, editing, publishing and posting. \u00a0For Brian and I, this has become almost like a second job; an enjoyable second job, but still... \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAND WE WANT TO BRING EVEN MORE CONTENT TO YOU! \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0But that\u0027s going to take more of our time, and we need your help do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, there are also hard costs to running the show. Website and podcast file hosting, audio equipment, and all sorts of other incidental expenses. Your Patreon support will help cover that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSo, Thanks!!!\u003c/h2\u003eEvery listener and reader makes a difference, and for that we thank you all. The show and blog are out there and free for anyone to listen to, read, and enjoy. Tell your friends and spread the word. And if you find that you want to help push \u003cstrong\u003eHISHTORY \u003c/strong\u003eover the next big hill, consider contributing a small amount each month. With your help, we can continue to grow and bring you a quality production every week.\u003cbr\u003e"
