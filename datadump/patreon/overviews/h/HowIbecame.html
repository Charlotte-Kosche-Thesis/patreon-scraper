Our aim is to show the effort and skill needed to become the YouTubers you look up to and watch everyday. Every YouTuber starts from 0 subscribers and we want to know their journey from there. From their username to their future goals, we discuss all aspects of a YouTubers rise to fame (and fortune!). Not every YouTuber starts off the same, many without any kind of professional video editing or formal production training at all. YouTube really highlights the American Dream, how anyone can become someone and nothing is impossible. Whether it be timing, luck or pure ingenuity, we want to find out the work behind making the videos which adds to the hundreds of millions of views YouTube gains everyday. YouTube has revolutionised the way we intake media, with on demand video blowing up since the launch in 2005. Advertisers, which didn\u0027t come on board straight away, now spend more on YouTube than most other traditional media services. YouTube has become a job for so many and will become a career for some, we want to talk to them and tell you how it all started!",
