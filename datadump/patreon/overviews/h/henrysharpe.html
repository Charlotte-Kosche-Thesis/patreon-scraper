What better way to use my passion than to help writers, directors and the general viewer know just what makes a scene tick :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Video Essays are made in a way so that they will be entertaining for the average viewer yet also be educational for aspiring writers and directors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KmcQ4fo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo Essays are a revolutionary new form of conveying ideas. \u00a0A handsome, deviously brilliant person (such as myself) will use a commentary backed up by visuals to illustrate specific points. Then that individual will have his videos immediately copyright claimed because YouTube hates him. Then after sending a repeal request he will wait for weeks on end and just a few days before the deadline the copyright holders deny his request because apparently \"Ooooh! Video Essays are not fair use\". Pricks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite simply for studying film there is no better way of doing so than by form of video essay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LD87tmY.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI upload a video once every 2-3 weeks. I firmly believe quality over quantity is the way to go and as a result I have less videos on my channel than I\u0027d like however each individual video is of a higher quality. It is a compromise I am glad to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral people have said \"I love your videos, please upload more.\" The problem is if I upload more, the people who say such things will grow disinterested in my content as the very quality they liked my videos for will drop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QTfLNXZ.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love providing my content for free for you guys but financially speaking working for free for the rest of my life isn\u0027t exactly a stable career plan. Patreon is a platform where I can communicate with my most loyal fans and bounce ideas off of. Please do consider donating what you can as every penny is hugely appreciated. Who knows, maybe one day I\u0027ll do this full time :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0Ehmbya.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just wanted to say, thankyou. The fact you are supporting me in this deep passion of mine means more than words can express :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
