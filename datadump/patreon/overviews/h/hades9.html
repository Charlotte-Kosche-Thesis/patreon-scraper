Your battles. Your choices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\n aren\u2019t building a game, we\u2019re building a world. A setting with depth \nthat will fully immerse you into the ruined galaxy of mankind\u2019s 6th \nmillenia. A galaxy that all of you will help shape as an Admiral of \nmankind\u2019s surviving fleets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want you to lead your fleet \nthrough victory and disaster. We want you to guide your people through \nthe ruined galaxy left behind by the Extinction and to do so with your \nCommanders, your loyal officers, fighting alongside you. We would have \nyou walk the ruined streets of Hades 9, the last bastion of humanity, \nstand at the void docks as your Flagship is refitted, or watch the \nsalvage teams work on a wreck you brought back to harbour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want you to experience command as never before.\u003cbr\u003eHell is real, Admiral, and you count it as safe harbour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://hades9.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Your_Choice.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who choose to back us via Patreon, THANK YOU. The \ndevelopment of HADES 9 can use all the support you can give it, be it \nthrough financial backing, sharing the news about it, or by volunteering\n your time (add link to volunteer page).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, our \nPatreon is still a bit bare-bones but for backers there will be a \nPatreon exclusive Discord channel where you can reach out to the devs, \nin order to talk about the game, Patreon, or anything else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe \nhope to add more possible rewards to our Patreon backers, so if you have\n any good ideas, don\u0027t hesitate to let us know!
