For the last nearly 2 years I have been doing this, I have footed the bill for everything myself. Equipment like more RAM for editing, a decent video card, a processor that can actually handle streaming, a decent microphone, a webcamera, a variety of games that had been requested, etc. It all costs money, and I\u0027m at a point in my life where I have to make very selective decisions about where I invest my time and money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m in no danger of starving or not being able to make rent, but I will be if I don\u0027t find more creative ways to make this work out. I have gotten very, VERY good at stretching every dollar to the max when it comes to finding solutions for editing, recording and streaming, but that money has to come from somewhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eIf you don\u0027t have anything to spare, don\u0027t even think about it. Your time and support has always been, and will always be more than enough. I will never EVER hide content behind a pay wall. This thing has always been about building a community and doing something that I love. You will never miss out on anything just because you didn\u0027t have money to give or because you didn\u0027t want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, for those people that decide to go above and beyond, and I can\u0027t let that go unnoticed.

I don\u0027t want anyone to be left out for not being able to donate to me, but I still want to be able to give back to the people who do! Right now it\u0027s pretty barebones, but you can find a general guide what you can get for your generosity over in the donation tiers. So far, I plan on having each tier include everything in the tiers below it, so bigger tips include more rewards, not more exclusivity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy personal motto has always been \"content first.\" That may sound weird, but I promised myself that money or internet notoriety would never be motivating factors for doing this. I want to iterate again that your time, support, and participation has always, and will always be more than enough, but to those of you that are considerate enough to leave a donation, you have my genuine heartfelt thanks.\u003cbr\u003e"
