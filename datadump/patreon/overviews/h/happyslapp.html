The longer version would be that I would love to be able to create bigger and better things, which would require an amount of money most likely.\u003cbr\u003eI create entirely free stuff, I expect no one to pay me for what I do, I think of Patreon as my tip jar, essentially, I don\u0027t expect anyone to pay unless they feel like I deserve it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIF I FEEL LIKE YOU DESERVE IT, HOW MUCH DO I PAY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePay whatever you feel like I deserve, or don\u0027t pay at all. All of this stuff I make is and will most likely always stay free, I guarantee it.\u003cbr\u003eBy the by, if you do pay, you will pay per month, on the 1st of said month, in the case that I don\u0027t make anything for an entire month, you may send me a message asking for a refund, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support\u00a0this, I give you my\u00a0absolute most sincere thanks for both making my day, and allowing me to continue making things, It really means the world to me whenever someone tells me that the stuff I make has made their\u00a0day better, words don\u0027t do it justice :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
