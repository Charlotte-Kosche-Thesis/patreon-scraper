    "summary": "Hello \u003cem\u003eHistory That Doesn\u0027t Suck \u003c/em\u003efans! THANK YOU for coming here! THANK YOU for your support. Please considering making a monthly donation, even at the lowest tier, to help us keep going. If you aren\u0027t sold already (what?! seriously?!) read below. I\u0027d like to tell you a story ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e***********\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027m a university professor with a Ph.D. in history, but don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not nearly as boring as that first sentence sounds. But if you\u0027re on this page, chances are you already know that, don\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched \u003cem\u003eHistory That Doesn\u0027t Suck\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0because I was frustrated. Frustrated with academia.\u00a0Now, don\u0027t get me wrong. I love my job. I love the university that employs me. I have many wonderful friends and colleagues there to boot. But I have come to believe that, in academia, we are generally rewarded for making history ... inaccessible and boring as hell. The more specialized my research is and the more esoteric my articles and classes are, the more I\u0027m valued by the academy at large. We unintentionally suck the joy out of history. We do this so thoroughly that we\u0027ve almost left it to others, to non-historians, to fill the void and make history accessible and enjoyable to those who aren\u0027t in the ivory tower (and hey, to you non-professional historians doing that, thank you!). And that got me thinking--I can bridge the worlds of academic history and entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe history can be rigorous and down right entertaining at the same damn time. Period. In my opinion, \"history,\" in the academic sense, isn\u0027t what people think of when they say \"I love history.\" I think they really mean \"I love \u003cem\u003estories\u003c/em\u003e!\" So that\u0027s exactly what I do; I tell you a story. But as I tell stories, I put my expertise and professional training to work by slipping in legit, academic analysis in my sarcastic, joking, and informal way. The end result is that you get to enjoy stories while (almost) imperceptibly taking in an academic and rigorous history. It\u0027s a win-win!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut making this podcast takes A LOT more time than I ever imagined. Each episode is a rigorously researched, 7,500 to 8,000-word essay, carefully crafted to remain narrative-driven and humorous while not compromising historical accuracy. Doing this requires countless hours every week; basically, it\u0027s all I do on the weekends and when I get home from my day job. And as the months have gone on, my solo act has turned into a small volunteer team, all of whom are giving their all! Seriously, these people have no lives!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut to keep this up, we can\u0027t carry on by ourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour choice to be a patron helps me and my crew keep the trains running on time. That includes researching, proofing scripts, editing, mixing, maintaining the website and social media accounts, as well as whatever other random things come up (as they inevitably do every freaking week). You also help me to grow the podcast. If your contribution isn\u0027t buying a slew of books or hours of Josh\u0027s and Cielle\u0027s time, it\u0027s buying advertising so we can help more people know that there\u0027s a non-sucky way to learn history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for reading this. And whether you become a patron or not, I hope to see you online ... where I\u0027d like to tell you a story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Friend and Professor,\u003cbr\u003eGreg\u003cbr\u003eHTDS\u003cbr\u003e"
