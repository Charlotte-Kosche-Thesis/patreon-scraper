    "summary": "HurricaneTrack.com began in 1999, long before the age of social media as we know it. Since then, the site and its reach has grown and is now trusted and followed by millions of people all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile our primary focus is information that helps people to better understand and prepare for hurricanes, we also offer a unique and innovative way to observe the effects of hurricanes and other severe weather when they happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2005, we began streaming live video and in fact, hurricane Katrina was the first ever event of its kind. In the years after the historic 2005 season, we have developed a fleet of small, unmanned camera boxes that we can place anywhere for just about any weather event imaginable. Our live feeds have been featured on CNN, NBC, ABC, The Weather Channel and numerous online news sites. In fact, our hurricane Hermine live cam was the most watched Facebook live event in the history of The Weather Channel with over 2.9 million views. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to grow our Patreon support to the point where we can expand and cover other weather events around the country and eventually around the world. What makes us different than \"storm chasers\" is our immersive live cam technology. Anyone can live stream from their vehicle or iPhone, etc. Only we have the ability to immerse you in the middle of the action, like you\u0027re there yourself! Our unmanned cams don\u0027t ever need to retreat for safety. That\u0027s what they are there for - to show us the raw power of Nature in ways conventional storm chasing cannot do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow us to not only deploy these cams during future events, but also to bring you along with us as part of the adventure - literally! I wish to get to the point where we invite our Patrons to participate with us in the field! Come with us to help set up the equipment that will measure the wind, the air pressure and provide incredible live video from places that no human has any business being in! We can do that but we need YOUR help to get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our video history on our YouTube channel. Its amazing what we have accomplished with shoe-string budget. Now, imagine what we can do if we had several hundred or perhaps thousands of patrons here - all with like-minded weather enthusiast goals in mind. We can and hope you will consider being a sustaining part of our future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
