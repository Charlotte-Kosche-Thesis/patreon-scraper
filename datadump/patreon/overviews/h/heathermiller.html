Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.\u003c/em\u003e ~ Howard Thurman\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow! You made it! \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for following whatever thread brought you here. I know there are a lot of internet rabbit holes you could have fallen down before getting here, so I do appreciate you coming to check this page out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am a singer-songwriter. \u003c/strong\u003eI wrote my first song 16 years ago. In the time since then, music has gifted me over and over, pushing me forward, bringing me to new cities, stages, festivals, classes, and corners of the internet. Music has introduced me to new friends, forced me to be brave, and created all sorts of connections.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnection is really my ultimate goal with my music\u003c/strong\u003e. Connection with my true self, and connection with the hearts and souls of the folks listening.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year I\u0027ve been writing a song almost every week. Not all of them are keepers, but it was good for me to write all of them.\u00a0When I\u0027m feeling lost or confused, pointing my compass toward music guides me to growth and happiness time and again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy wish is that my songs will help provide a sense of connection and comfort to others\u003c/strong\u003e in the way the songs of my favorite artists make me feel less alone. There might be a song I\u0027ve written that won\u0027t make it to a record, but speaks to someone\u0027s heart, and it would be a shame for them to not hear it because it\u0027s only living in my phone! Patreon is a great place to share that kind of stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of why I\u0027ve been so fascinated and excited about Patreon in the past few years is it\u0027s a great way to connect artists directly with the people who are true fans. As a Patron myself, I feel proud every month that in my own way, I am supporting a small handful of artists in creating their work. It\u0027s exciting to think I\u0027m helping to make a difference in making people come alive, even with a barista budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNuts and Bolts - How does this Patreon thing work?\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eYou choose a level you\u0027d like to support - it can be as little as one dollar per song, or even one dollar per month! (If you want to pledge per month instead of per song, there\u0027s an option to choose that at the end of checking out.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- You can also set a monthly cap, so even if I have a really prolific month, you won\u0027t go over your budget. Plus you can adjust the amount or stop at any time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027ll write songs and post them here before they go anywhere else public, and you\u0027ll be charged for the total at the end of the month. I\u0027m aiming for a song a week, but if I don\u0027t post anything, you don\u0027t pay anything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- You can stream or download the new song mp3s. I may also include some of those songs I mentioned from the past year of writing, and hopefully videos, photos, live concert streams and blog type things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Because I know that one person\u0027s dollar is another person\u0027s ten dollars, it\u0027s important to me that all Patrons have access to everything. I am equally grateful for whatever level you contribute!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is an experiment!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a vulnerable yet powerful thing to put yourself out there, and even more so, to ask for support. My secret big dream would be to get enough Patron pledges that I could work one day less per week as a barista and have more time and energy to put towards music! I\u0027d love to do stuff like make music videos, work towards a new professional record, add to or upgrade my performing and home recording equipment. Not to mention I\u0027d love to support more of the awesome artists already on this platform! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(And the super secret, super-big dream would be to go on tour, but one step, one micro-payment at a time!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut no matter what, I\u0027m going to keep creating and sharing music for as long as it feeds my soul! When I do that with a heart open to the results, magic seems to happen. I hope you\u0027ll join me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU! Let\u0027s make the world more alive together!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
