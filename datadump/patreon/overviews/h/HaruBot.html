    "summary": "This is (what I expect to be) a private Patreon to fund the hosting, upkeep and development of the bot currently known as HaruBot. If I don\u0027t know you, hi, glad to have you around. Contact details at the bottom if you\u0027re interested in the project.\u003cbr\u003eYou probably know who she is, as I suspect this will go nowhere except the small group of friends I\u0027m making it for, but for those who don\u0027t:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaru\u0027s Barrier Maiden\u003c/strong\u003e (name subject to change) is a Discord bot primarily focused on tabletop game-related commands and functionality. The basic commands available to everyone, at the moment, are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e/roll XdY+-Z -flag #comment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eStandard dicerolling function. Rolls X Y-sided die, and then adds or subtracts Z. Presently, the main flag is \u003cem\u003e-crit\u003c/em\u003e to allow crit explosions on d20 (reroll on a 20 or a 1, and add or subtract respectively), but if someone hosts, for instance, a L5R game with her, functionality can easily be added to support XkY notation, flags to handle specific types of crit explosions and handling, et cetera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e/stats -flag\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAt the moment, the raw \u003cem\u003e/stats\u003c/em\u003e function returns an array of 4d6 best 3, perfect for generating a standard D\u0026amp;D player character (or npc). The \u003cem\u003e-full\u003c/em\u003e flag presently allows you to see each of the rolls made. If more functionality is desired for other systems with a random generation element, functionality can easily be added for those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd a few irrelevant minor commands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommands that do not currently support use beyond developer use, but that could be turned into something with global use, include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e/log X\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eReturns a .txt with the last X lines spoken in the room of the command, formatted nicely. A \u003cem\u003e-timestamp\u003c/em\u003e flag would be an easy inclusion. Not currently supported outside developer use because it doesn\u0027t send the files, but this is a functionality that shouldn\u0027t be too hard to add in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe /combat suite\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eCurrently set up specifically for D\u0026amp;D 3.5, this command allows the user (with the command \u003cem\u003e/combat\u003c/em\u003e with the seed and then \u003cem\u003e/cstart\u003c/em\u003e in the room in question) to seed and populate a list of characters, ordered by their initiative rolls (which it automatically sorts). It then pings whoever\u0027s turn it is, until they (or the person who started the /combat) use the command \u003cem\u003e/done\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e/pass\u003c/em\u003e. The operator can also \u003cem\u003e/kill\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003e/rout\u003c/em\u003e, or \u003cem\u003e/cadd\u003c/em\u003e players, NPCs and creatures as they come and go. Currently, this is hardcoded, but it wouldn\u0027t take too much of a restructuring to allow anyone to use it, anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then, the other feature of the bot, partially implemented:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaruGame\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eA command available to everyone is \u003cem\u003e/makechar \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;\u003c/em\u003e. This generates a completely random character (by design) which is then assigned to your Discord account. The character\u0027s stats can then be displayed with the \u003cem\u003e/viewchar\u003c/em\u003e command. There are idle long-term plans to make something akin to a text adventure game with this, but I would rather not make claims that I may not get to back up or fulfill, and if I do end up making it, do not want to spoil any of the features; therefore, I will say no more about this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the... donation rewards and stretch goals or whatever, well:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t really believe in donation rewards, or pushing for specific amounts of money. I\u0027d like people to donate what they feel is right and what they can afford-- the first 5-10 dollars (updated when I\u0027m certain on what service I will use) go to putting the bot onto a Virtual Private Server so that its uptime is not based on whether I remembered to switch it on for the night. After that, everything goes to supporting me spending less time on a job and more time on development of the bot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably know where to find me, but if not, I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eHarudoku#4799\u003c/strong\u003e on Discord or \u003cstrong\u003eHarudoku\u003c/strong\u003e on Steam or \u003cstrong\u003eHarudoku\u003c/strong\u003e on Skype (for how rarely I check that anymore) and my E-Mail, surprisingly, is \u003cstrong\u003eHarudoku@gmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m happy to talk to anyone with any interest in new features, interest in getting the bot onto their server, or interest in updating existing features about those things. Or just in general. No need to donate, or anything, that\u0027s not really what this is about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for looking this over, and have a nice day."
