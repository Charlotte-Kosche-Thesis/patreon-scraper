    "summary": "Hazelnut Grove began in September, 2015, as a group of houseless individuals and advocates from the community organized people sleeping in tents between N Greeley and N Interstate. The City of Portland provided fencing, some gravel, access to water from Overlook park and two porta potties.  With an outpouring of community support the Grove went from being a group of campers to a village, a community resource for people experiencing houselessness. Many former residents have moved on to permanent housing, and the Grove has been building tiny homes on site for its residents. The villagers do a lot for themselves including communal food prep, community water supply runs, neighborhood clean up, and, of course, building pathways, movable tiny houses and communal structures. They are living essentially off-grid in an urban environment. Pioneering a new no-income housing solution. \u003cbr\u003ePlease help them get through the winter with donations for gas for their generators, soup for their bellies and building materials like insulation to help them keep warm.  Hazelnut Grove is changing lives. With your support, you can too. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
