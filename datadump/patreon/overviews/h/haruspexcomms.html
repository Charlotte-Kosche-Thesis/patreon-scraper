But even if I found employment in the fascist America of today, the fascist America of yesterday wasn\u2019t exactly welcoming to critical reporting.  Throughout my career, I\u2019ve been months - even years - ahead.  As a young reporter in rural California, I put my knowledge and skills to use by reporting on victims of police brutality from their perspective, such as the murder of former NFL player David Lee \u201cDeacon\u201d Turner, or the murder of David Silva. This was several months before the arrest of Huffington Post and Washington Post reporters in Ferguson compelled the press to take a second look at how their reporting was affected by a profession whose practices oriented themselves toward alignment with power; and in that second look, find that they were directly complicit in managing public perception of victims of police brutality as subhuman.  But no one manages the managers\u2019 perceptions, and managers, however well-intentioned they may claim to be, are no angels: rather than recognition for my acuity in reporting issues affecting rural communities, or validation of my skills as a professional reporter from a working class, immigrant background, I was instead chastised by upper class, white management in the metropole for \u201clacking objectivity.\u201d I was also obstructed from further reporting on the very same story which, over a year later, a more competent outlet would pick up exactly where I had been forced to stop by my \u201csuperiors.\u201d  Their failure to adapt to their surroundings and their lack of vision has cost them dearly. (Pacific News Service dba New America Media Announces Closure of Organization)  My professional career has also benefited from leveraging Theodor Adorno\u2019s lessons on fascist propaganda - over year before mainstream outlets like The New Yorker - and to the ruthless neglect by American employers (their time, like New America Media\u2019s, will come, too.)

But I can\u2019t promise consistency at that pace while I spend a part-time job\u2019s worth of time searching for full-time work elsewhere. While I will strive to deliver at such a pace, please understand that until I can get at least $1,000 per month, more of my resources will be spent trying to find work to get through an extremely difficult patch and keep offering this service as a part-time endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, drop me a private message if you need services typical of a communications professional for an estimate for fulfilling your communications needs: editing, copyediting, line editing; along with the products of a content generalist: memos and reports, newsletters, communications plans, blogs, editorials (op-eds, editorial board memos, and the like). If I had to name a specialty, it would be memos summarizing white papers, legal briefings, academic papers, and the like for non-specialist audiences, with demonstrated experience in energy and environmental policy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and I hope you\u2019ll lend your support for Haruspex Communications."
