    "summary": "Hi all, after a pretty serious health scare this year, I have had to drop\u00a0 out of my\u00a0 regular career. I\u0027ve been in the Video Game and Graphics business for approx. 20 years. Now I am looking to set up a business I can run from home, creating unique Video content, and also helping others with their channels and productions...I need a bit of support initially, to keep a roof over our heads while I get this up and running.....Think of it, as I am trying to set up a small, cheap (cheaper than Hollywood) digital effects company, that YouTube creators can hire to spruce up their own broadcasts. While also creating my own content. I know a lot of skilled Artists so this endeavour is scalable."

I used to love FPS games, but since the\u00a0Pontine Infarction\u00a0and having a paralyzed left arm that is numb, I have not been able to play. However, I have been working on a FPS game that you can fully control with just the mouse. I can handle the graphics, and\u00a0have been designing a FPS that is not only playable with one hand,\u00a0 but is also stress free with challenges based on time rather than kills (so one can monitor motor improvement). I feel a game like this would not only be some fun for stroke impaired people, but will also benefit stroke patients that have to learn how to use a new side of their body (I was lucky that my brain haemorrhage\u00a0 affected my left side, but I am Right handed, others are not so lucky). I have been making and playing physics based puzzle levels but need the help of a programmer for the front and back end, and under the hood functionality to turn in in to a \"game\".",
