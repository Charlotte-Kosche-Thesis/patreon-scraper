Money is sorta irrelevant to me philosophically, but my family wont shut up about me not having a job and being broke, so if you like what I do and would like to see me be able to do some of the more interesting ideas for projects that I\u0027ve had for a long time, then by all means you are welcome to drop some money into my patreon campaign. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dont know who you are:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a guy who makes gaming videos, picks apart the trainwreck that is Gen 4 MLP, and makes occasional hentai game reviews (Stickyhooves. Hehe, get it?). I also am getting into the magical world of indie game development!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what ideas do you have, Hanz?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked. Well, you didn\u0027t ask, but I rather asked for you.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always wanted to get an animator to be my art-slave, as I have a lot of series\u0027 that I wish to create and games to make, but simply cannot convince an artist to help me without the aid of money. In addition, I could cover more Early access games on my channel if I had a source of income, as well as purchase a decent capture card so that we can play Xbox 360 games for the channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Patreon. Its all around you right now, man. Look out for that. \u003cbr\u003eHow does it work? Its kinda like magnets, nobody knows how they work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should I fund you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou dont have to, I do everything I do for free and have no plans on changing that. This is of your own free will and out of the goodness of your heart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Is your page set to \"Monthly\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I dont know how your lives work or how Patreon works exactly, but I\u0027d be terrified of overdrawing someones account by drawing money in the middle of a month when everyone I know IRL would have a bank balance of \"0\". With it set to \"Monthly\", you and I both know that the money comes out around the first.\u003cbr\u003e"
