I fail at things and I call it HazeyFails on Twitch and the occasional YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main things I do is crochet amigurumi (aka plushies).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have four giveaways per year and so far I have been able to keep them going okay, but on occasion shipping does become an issue.\u00a0 I would love to be able to have overseas giveaways and such and am mostly gauging if people would actually like that enough to support my creations~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do everything myself, without patterns and I love making that one special character that someone loves but hasn\u0027t found a plushy for just yet! (Feel free to suggest those characters for the giveaways also).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do cosplay from time to time and I take pictures in said cosplay... A LOT of pictures... and I\u0027ll end up posting one on Instagram and one on Twitter... what a waste of the other ~50 pictures, right? So those will be available to second tier patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do the third tier you will be awarded the title of Loaf (my alternate word for \"Love\") and you will get a free plushy for your birthday! (Unfortunately some restrictions will happen because of overseas shipping or such but I will do my absolute best)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a sidenote, I want everyone to know that you shouldn\u0027t feel the need to do this... I love you ALL regardless and everyone does get ONE entry into the giveaways. Anything and everything that comes from you guys will 100% only be used for you guys, my lovely and amazing friends through the internets \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you all~!\u003cbr\u003e"
