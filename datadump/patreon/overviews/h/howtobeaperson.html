Why not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar, \"How To Be a Person\" is a podcast run by two comedy writers, Mike Drucker (The Tonight Show, Nintendo, Marvel) and Jess Dweck (The Tonight Show, Late Night, Netflix). As socially broken humans who don\u0027t know how to live their lives, they ask their friends to tell them how to be people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince Jess Dweck has moved to Los Angeles (surprise!) we\u0027re looking to both upgrade our equipment and hire an editor so we can keep bringing the podcast to our tens of dozens of listeners. And the more you pledge, the more we can achieve. Live shows, specialized episodes, and even extra content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt could all happen. Or it could die a thousand deaths in the flames of the Internet. That dramatic pressure is now on you.\u003cbr\u003e"
