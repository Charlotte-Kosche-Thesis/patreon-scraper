    "summary": "From the moment of its conception, as the cells divided and the first echos and squawks were uttered, Holy Sheboygan has been touched with a spirit of\u00a0independence. We have been able to make the music we want to make in the way we want to make it because of our dedication to the ideal that if something is worth doing, it is worth doing right. And as we all know, if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been at the reigns of every recording, every tour, every hour spent busking at markets and every cassette tape sold. What we have produced is no less than the very best music or musical experience we are capable of making at the time. As the band mutates into the next stage of its evolution, Holy Sheboygan will continue to push our limits, providing the same caliber of ingenuity and creativity, the same singularity of voice that we have always strived for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as the band continues to ripen, so do the challenges that face us. Up until now, we have worked without the support of a record label, a tour manager, a public relations consultant, a press consultant or a booking agent. We have also insisted that the members of the band be free to follow their own path, to relocate as circumstances or the winds of fate dictate. This has left us free to write our music the way we want to, record it the way we want to and perform it the way we want to. While we may no longer live together, we will continue to be reunited by our love for each other and the music we make together. As the band expands sonically and geographically, we face our greatest challenges yet navigating the logistics of booking ever-larger tours and producing more complex and arresting music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fates have called and the world is waiting! We hope that you will join hands with us as we march forward into the storm.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***How this works***\u003cbr\u003eWhen you sign up as our patron, you are in effect signing up for a HS! subscription (like Netflix, but your money goes directly to independent artists). You will be charged your pledge amount every time we make a release through this site. A couple times a year, we will have a major project, and will make multiple releases in a short span. Right now, we are finishing up THREE!, our third collection of songs. We are releasing this to our Patreon sponsors two songs at a time all in the month leading up to the March 15th public release. Seven songs, plus an exclusive bonus track, make it four releases this month. For example, a $2 pledge gets you the full album (plus bonus track) for $8 total this month. Check out the pledge levels below to see what other HS! swag we\u0027re offering.\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, as our subscriber you will continue to get access to all our work before it reaches the public. You\u0027ll get demo tracks, live performances, music videos, and anything else we do. Between our larger projects, we will only release content about once a month. Your support between these larger projects enables us to continue to tour, write, work, and make music together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***** If you\u0027re signing up now (or if you signed up late), you have missed some of the preview releases. Your thank you gifts may be slightly delayed until you reach a level of funding that will cover our cost for those items. All patrons will still receive our new album and all perks going forward. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
