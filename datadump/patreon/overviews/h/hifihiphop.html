    "summary": "There are tons of pro audio tutorials around the internet, however very few of them focus specifically on hip hop music. Hi-Fi Hip Hop with Willie Green is a podcast doing exactly that - exploring both the technical and artistic sides of urban engineering.\u00a0Hip-hop production has its own unique challenges and needs, and your support will help me create tutorials discussing the pursuit of the answers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Paul \"Willie Green\" Womack, a record producer and audio engineer from Brooklyn, NY. Over the course of my career I\u0027ve had the pleasure of working with artists such as The Roots, Wiz Khalifa, billy woods, Open Mike Eagle, ELUCID, Milo and others. As a classically trained percussionist, former jazz drummer, and graduate of Berklee College of Music, I have a very diverse range of musical experience. Yet for this series I thought it was important to focus on hip hop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past few years I\u0027ve become a lecturer and educator, and have found the amount of hip hop pro audio content is severely lacking in proportion to the enormous impact the genre has on the music industry. Urban music is still struggling for equal representation in the audio world, and my goal is to fill in some of these gaps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi-Fidelity:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi-Fi Hip Hop is a weekly podcast that is less about discussing specific gear or settings, and more about theories, techniques, and the reasons behind the sonic choices we make. I\u0027ve gained a lot of experience over the years and I\u0027d like to share it. As a full-time producer/engineer I\u0027m constantly trying new techniques and experimenting with new sounds. It\u0027s a great tool to understand how other people work, and if you can\u0027t be in the studio with them, having someone break their workflow down for you is a good alternative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me weekly for audio tutorials, guest interviews, and conversations on the creative process as we explore the artistic side of hip hop music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
