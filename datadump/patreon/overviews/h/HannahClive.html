I\u0027ve sung on BBC Radio and on records with the likes of Ray Charles. If you\u0027re here reading this, then seriously - you are amazing and thank you so much for taking the time to do so. \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S THIS ABOUT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you\u0027ve probably heard the music industry basically nearly died this past decade - apart from the big acts of course - and that\u0027s why I am so especially glad and excited you\u0027re here. Because whilst it\u0027s true downloading has affected us music makers catastrophically - necessity is the mother of invention and, the internet has also allowed an interaction between artists and fans never seen before. \u003cem\u003eF\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eor the first time allowing people like me, to build a music community for you. O\u003c/em\u003ene that\u0027s hopefully a bit fairer to fans and artists, than industry and middlemen previously allowed, in what was a war on artists and fans, seeing us fleeced to within an inch of our lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere\u0027s your chance to be part of that revolution\u003c/em\u003e because if artists like me, and fans like you, can band together and build a stronger core - then we can strike a better deal with an industry more willing to listen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the reality still is, the 99\u00a2 I\u0027m only allowed to charge at iTunes of which I get about 30\u00a2 on a single, really isn\u0027t enough to cover the making of my recordings, the promotion, the gigs, the tours I should be doing, much less sustain me and mine in between. The truth is I rarely get paid for gigs of original material, the venues are falling prey to developers and what money I do make goes straight back into covering my costs. So that\u0027s why I \u0027m asking for your help, to keep making you quality music whilst effecting positive change towards a better, fairer set-up for all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I DO...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sing and write from the heart. I\u0027ve done this professionally since I was a teenager and there\u0027s nothing else I know or want to do; it is my craft, creating music and singing to others is my lifeblood, and I\u0027m sacrificing everything to continue to do that. Fortunately, folks seem to like my music! I\u0027ve been called a torch singer: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\"A very distinctive and original voice, kind of a cross of soul and country and rock, as if Dolly Parton had a child with Marvin Gaye and the result was the new Janis Joplin....\" \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(\u003ca href=\"http://www.musictalks.xyz/music-reviews\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGhostly Beard, Music Talks, 2017\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps that\u0027s why people like Ray Charles and a few others had me on their records, when I was starting out. Backing vocals although hugely influential and an important try out, were a learning curve for me before becoming a solo artist and songwriter. And that\u0027s something I built by myself with no leg ups, because you \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to learn by yourself. I\u0027ll not lie, it\u0027s not been an easy road particularly being a woman but it was never going to be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m unsigned, I write old-skool songs of varying genres with a modern twist; I write them on my own and I write them with other people - often engaging some of the amazing talent I met on those previous records and always striving toward the same standard they taught me. I play the piano, the guitar, the flute and a mean tambourine, occasional shaker! I\u0027m currently working out how the heck I\u0027m going to tour my next EP, not least because I\u0027ve written it on the piano and I\u0027ll be needing a keyboard (and a band!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I DO THAT\u0027S DIFFERENT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from music and raising my child solo, my passion is supporting new music-makers, particularly at grass roots level. I grasp the need for music to \n\u003cem\u003eremain a viable career\u003c/em\u003e for the next generation coming through, because they need their own music heroes going forward and I firmly believe that music is medicine, transcends boundaries, connecting people and in today\u0027s world that feels especially prescient. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s why I choose to actively cross-promote fellow acts online or write reviews in support of them when I can; it\u0027s why I help them - for free - because if we don\u0027t help each other, then who else will? The days of music industry development deals are long gone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a grassroots new music activist, a singer and performer who knows what it means to be both sides of the track asking you to support me please as an artist, not just for me but because that helps me do the same for others and build a fairer, new way. I\u0027d love it if you could be a part of that please?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I\u0027VE DONE THIS YEAR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 has been busy! My music has been played on BBC Introducing London with DJ Gary Crowley saying it \u0027deserved to be rolled out across the BBC\u0027 networks. This was followed by a guest appearance and live performance on Gaby Roslin\u0027s BBC Radio London show alongside Busted, The Scummy Mummies and the Gandy Brothers. Two further BBC Radio interviews followed on BBC Sussex and Surrey and BBC Three Counties Radio. All of this was unpaid with travel expenses and other musicians fees covered by me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFollowing a summer of festival gigs, including writing a review of the grass roots Indies by invitation\u00a0for The Isle of Wight Festival, I won Artist of the Year in Canada\u0027s Starlight Music Chronicles and was runner up in Radio Wigwam\u0027s Best Female Artist music awards. November 2017 has seen me invited on as guest to America\u0027s Jimmy Star Show with Ron Russell to their weekly audience of 4M viewers, as well as the release of my first new music in four years - my new single REMEMBER TO BREATHE. This followed on from my successful remaster release of Kiss of Life 2016 - as heard extensively across independent radio networks globally and on BBC Radio London. The yellow brick road leads onwards...but the wolves are at the door and doing all of this costs money. But less so if you can help me please?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for coming here to support me in my own artistic endeavours - here you can expect all sorts of perks that to date I\u0027ve never EVER issued - so let\u0027s see what fun we can all have together eh? And if you can help me, I can support others \u0027cause really we\u0027re #InItTogether #NewMusicArmy\u003cbr\u003e"
