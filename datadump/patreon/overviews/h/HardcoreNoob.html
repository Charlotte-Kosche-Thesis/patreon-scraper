Mine has been this since I have watched my very first Youtube video of Markiplier. I have fun doing it and doing it the best way possible. Making people laugh and hoping to cheer up their sad and stressful day gives me enough joy to pursue this dream further.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever to make this less of a dream and more of a reality would require a bit of help from the people who support my channel and to the ones who are just recently discovering my channel. I plan to do good with any donations, going straight further into better equipment, better software and better hardware to give my audience the quality and enjoyment they deserve when watching my videos. Due to me stepping forth and taking relative big risks to try to make this dream a reality, I am dangerously close to going bankrupt, Making my dreams come true is well worth the risks If i do say so myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese donations and pledges you make for me will further help me keep my videos afloat and in the end once I\u0027m stable enough to give back to the community, to everyone who supported me. \u003cstrong\u003eNot only that, but when you pledge to me, you will be receiving something in return to give back to the community that is helping to support me!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much."
