    "summary": "It wasn\u0027t until last November I realized with a start what my cutie mark was - a dragonfly sitting on a piece of parchment next to a writing quill. That\u0027s the fancy way of saying My Little Pony and the wonderful FIMFiction community helped me discover what I was put on Equestria, er, I mean Earth do to. I was meant to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJobs are tough to come by right now, especially for someone my age (in my 50s). While the struggle to stay employed through temping continues, its stress does hamper my ability to function at times. Stress kills brain cells - especially the ones that allow the creative process to flow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I do not need encouragement to write, nor do not suffer from writer\u0027s block (unless it is stress-induced). I suffer from what we all do - a lack of time to get the words down on paper to entertain the FIMFiction community and to help others overcome their own creative writing hurdles. Your hard-earned and generously given bucks will allow me to devote more and more time  giving back to a community that welcomed my writing skills and utterly blind devotion to an underappreciated villain in the My Little Pony universe. This allowed me to blossom into what my cutie mark was telling me I am and should be - a writer who tells tales and tutors the next generation to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Nyx\u003cbr\u003e"
