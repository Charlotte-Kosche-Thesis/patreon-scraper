    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e My\nname is H. D. Harris, and I\u0027m an artist living in Michgan! Like many\nI grew up loving the art of comics, and eventually discovered\npaintings and drawings far beyond that being created on the internet\nusing\u2014of all things\u2014computers! I was amazed, but didn\u0027t entertain\nthe thought of myself ever being able to create that way. I didn\u0027t\ndiscover art as a personal passion until later in life, well,\nrelative to most other modern digital artists. I was already in my\nearly 20s before I discovered I loved art, but my initial experiments\nwith art were... well let\u0027s hope that there\u0027s no evidence left\nfloating around on the Internet. But eventually I did improve,\nbecause I studied and practiced, and was completely and thoroughly\nawful for a while. I was supported by my friends, family, and other\nartists on the net to continue to pursue my passion. I had always\n\u003cstrong\u003ewanted\u003c/strong\u003e to make comics but lacked the drawing ability, so I\nhad, long before I started drawing, practiced writing as well.\nEventually I worked up the courage in my art and writing to put two\nand two together and take the plunge. Thus began Amara.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Amara?\u003c/strong\u003e\nI have always loved the supernatural, and magic, in general. I have a\ndeep love of sci-fi and aliens and space as well, but always I come\nback to fantasy. Unfortunately, fantasy suffers from a problem that\nplagues sci-fi, although not to the same degree. Overwhelmingly, in\ncases where characters have human skin or properties, they seem to\ncorrelate to heterosexual, white, predominantly male people. There is\nnothing wrong with having such people in fantastical worlds, but why\nin a setting where anyone could be ANYTHING are there so rarely any\npeople of color, or queer characters? Amara was created as a world\nwith these thoughts in mind: I wanted to create a living, breathing,\norganic world that had detail enough to feel rich and provide\nsettings for stories for years to come, with the full range of characters and personalities possible in such a world. I also wanted to explore\nthemes and elements of fantasy without falling victim to the trappings of fantasy that are usually\naccepted and repeated throughout the genre. What if humans weren\u0027t\nthe dominant race? What if elves had a imperialistic drive instead of\nwanting to withdraw from the world? What if technology wasn\u0027t seen as\nan opposition to magic, but merely another application of it?\u00a0These are the\nquestions at the heart of Amara, a world set in a far away system\nwhere the energies of magic have altered the development of life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmara Is the tale of two elven sisters: one, born without magic, and the other without a mother\u0027s love. The story follows them as they go down very different paths and the consequences for everyone around them as they are pulled into a life-or-death case of sibling rivalry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\nSupport from patreon will help me offset living expenses and focus\nmore time on creating art and working on Amara as well as lower my\noverall anxiety and stress levels. It will also, should anyone\nactually support me, boost my confidence in said work until I\u0027m sure\nI could serve as a power source for my apartment and stop having to\npay for electricity! It will also give me insight into an audience\nwith which I can interact directly to share info and concepts about\nAmara, and gain feedback to help overcome my own shortcomings as an\nartist and writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should point out that Amara will *always* be free, and that you will never have to worry about pages being put behind any kind of paywall, even as a timed exclusivity deal. I am not holding Amara hostage, merely asking for support while I work on it!\u003cbr\u003e"
