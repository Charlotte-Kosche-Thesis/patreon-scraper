I\u0027m the creator of the Japanese-styled comic,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/snowbound\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSnowbound\u003c/a\u003e! Writing is my greatest passion; I\u0027ve never gotten as much joy out of anything as I have from being able to create stories for people. It\u0027s always been a thrill to create a story, to share it with my friends and family and just see how people like it. However, I want to go further with this and no longer make it a hobby. I want to bring my works to the world, and make it something I spend my entire life doing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.starofdestiny.com/patreon_files/patreon_snowbound_manga.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo pages from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/snowbound\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSnowbound\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s first chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time nearly all of my story projects, all of which are creator-owned, are designed for one of three areas: comics, animation and games. As such, I want to produce these stories as they were intended to be. The problem is I didn\u0027t get into the idea when I was young, had no responsibilities and had money to spare. I decided to make this change when I\u0027m a \"grown up\" with things like bills and other important responsibilities, things I can\u0027t afford to do just yet if I stick to full time writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.starofdestiny.com/patreon_files/patreon_starofdestiny_protag_bagprint.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bag print of the protagonists of my upcoming comic, Star of Destiny.

I want to be able to put all my effort into writing, into making stories and then bring them to life via games, comics, animations and any other medium that works. However, I need to be able to both support my own living and support funding my projects since most of these projects have me hiring other people to do the things I can\u0027t do (like draw).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/90QOHIXa3yY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn animated trailer for Snowbound.
