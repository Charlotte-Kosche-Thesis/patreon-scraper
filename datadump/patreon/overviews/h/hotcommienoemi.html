Noemi has been making video lectures and vlogs since 2014 and dedicates a minimum of 5 hours of reading in preparation for each live feed they do. They are currently writing a street medic zine and hope to publish it in December 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNoemi has invisible disabilities-- MDD (major depressive disorder) and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder)--as well as a traumatic brain injury (brain damage) from a car accident.\u003c/strong\u003e This limits their ability to work enough to support themselves. However, their passion for organizing persists and they seek to develop and cultivate leftists by making academic ideas and general revolutionary theory accessible. After all, theory and action are the two halves to praxis.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThrough live video feeds, social media, and vlogs, Noemi makes the theory aspect of praxis easy to grasp.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/cyxKPn/16114593_1644434812517610_5776993111295038291_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn example of the work Noemi does: In December 2017 and January 2018, they organized a trip with their medic partner to Borik\u00e9n (Puerto Rico) as a part of the relief effort.\u003c/strong\u003e Together they acted as medics, farmers, construction workers, and laborers, traveling to Arecibo, Humacao, Caguas, Orocovis, Utuado, and Cabo Rojo as a part of a brigade.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0In Caguas, Noemi led an Anti-Capitalist Self-Care Teach-in about trauma and ways to cope without any resources. One attendee later told Noemi and their medic partner that they saved his life. Noemi is passionate about keeping the left alive and resisting through the resurgence of fascism. \u003c/strong\u003eHealing and trauma relief has always been inaccessible to marginalized people. Often our most radical comrades are oppressed on multiple levels and it is so easy to lose revolutionaries to high-risk coping (such as alcoholism) and untreated mental illness.
