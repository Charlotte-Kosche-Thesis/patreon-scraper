Yes, I live from my music work, and go through A LOT to maintain a project like this in Brazil, specially in Rio de Janeiro. This is what i\u0027m good at, and what I LOVE to do. But being an independent artist, I end up spending more time with the process than with making music itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOU WANT MY MONEY? GO DREAMING, SMARTY.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCalm down. As we all know, being an independent artist is not easy. But is also not impossible. The important thing to keep in mind is that there is a whole life between being the next Prince and being a screwed up guy that always plays for free. To this day, ALL that I\u0027ve done was using my own resources. I make music with a lot of passion and dedication, and consider it my job. So, I believe it\u0027s fair to have some support to keep doing it. I have a little son who needs me. And who also needs money to the new Playstation that all of his friends are playing. But daddy can\u0027t give it to him. Daddy is a musician. Does it seem fair to you? Of course not. And don\u0027t think I\u0027m a lazy ass, cause I spent many nights studying. Musical Theory, Instrument Techniques, Musical Production Techniques, and even a bunch of tutorials for video editing. I wanna keep studying, evolving and making more music. That\u0027s why I need your support, so you can hear more from songs from me :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHxAxQzWEMo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, AND THIS PATREON THING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for you to support my art and my music by contributing with from just $1(your coffee change) to more than $2000 (I love you!), and, in exchange, get a few rewards like downloading my songs, watching making of from the videos I make, keep track of my musical process, project templates and a few more. With your contribution, I\u0027ll be able to focus in just composing and producing, thanks to a little more financial stability. I also believe this will help me risk more than when I was just some dude making music for nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHAT DO I DO NOW?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you choose an amount of money that you feel comfortable with, and, every time I release something new, this amount will be charged. You choose the value of this contribution, and you can change it, increasing or decreasing, or cancel it any time you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7b21NLxICk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIS IT WORTH?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou tell me.
