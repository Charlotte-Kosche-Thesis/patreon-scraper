Talking about not just what is and isn\u0027t realistic, but instead how you translate what you see in visual media onto the page. Fight scene choreography runs the gamut from terrible to utterly breathtaking and, despite what some authors say, you really can have it all. I\u0027d love to be able to talk about it and share my techniques when researching for my own writing.\u003cbr\u003e"
