    "summary": "Over the last five years, I had been doing my own little podcast show. \u00a0In the summer of 2010, I \u00a0started out small with occasional little microcasts, and by the autumn of that year I had started doing a more substantial weekly show Hypnobobs devoted to all manner of weird fiction. Five years later and we\u0027re still going strong, with the main show that features in-depth discussions and reviews now going out under the title Hypnogoria, more free-wheelin\u0027 chat and off-beat topics appearing as Microgoria, book reviews as Tomegoria, and serving up readings of classic weird tales as From The Great Library of Dreams. All of which you can find here -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hypnobobs.geekplanetonline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://hypnogoria.libsyn.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, we\u0027ve explored the careers of horror legends such as Peter Cushing, Vincent Price and Sir Christopher Lee, uncovered the history and evolution of Batman, charted a family tree of zombie movies, talked of Authors such as Ray Bradbury, Terry Pratchett, Kim Newman and Robert Aickman, watched some very odd films, and gathered round the fireside to hear tales from old masters such as MR James, HP Lovecraft, and William Hope Hodgson.\u00a0It\u0027s been a wonderful five years talking weird movies, terrifying tomes, odd TV shows, colourful comics, haunting music and gripping games. And while it s does take a lot of time to research, write, record and produce each show, it has been immensely rewarding to share my interests and passions with an ever growing audience of witty and wise folks. And I have been delighted, humbled and amazed at the praise and plaudits my shows has won over the years. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving worked hard to establish a quality, regular show, I\u0027m now looking for patreons firstly to invest in some new recording equipment, partly to replace old gear but also to expand the show into other formats such as film and books. Furthermore . \u00a0As producing the Hypnogoria podcasts has been one of the most successful and satisfying things I have ever done, \u00a0it would be wonderful if I could raise enough so that I can actually work full time on the shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding \u00a0will not only keep the show safely on the road, but will allow the show to continue to grow and expand. When I began in 2010, I had no real idea what I doing or where I was going with it, however now, over 200 shows later, I do have very clear ideas of what the show will be in the future - bigger, better and bringing you all the best of the weird and wonderful! Funding will mean better quality shows, not just through better equipment, but simply through being free to devote more time to research and production. Currently the show is thriving on audio, but I would like to go cross platform into making short shows on film and expand into print too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
