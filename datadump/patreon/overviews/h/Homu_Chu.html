I\u0027ve been hesitating on making a Patreon for a long time for several reasons, but I finally got the courage to start one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo begin with, I wanted to start a Patreon because of the obvious financial circumstances. As an artist, I want to dedicate as much time as I can to producing projects/art, and it would become impossible if I had to get a job so that I may continue paying for my education. \u003cbr\u003eSupporting me would help me so much. I will be eternally grateful and I would cry (good tears!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason I\u0027ve decided to open Patreon was because of art theft. As much as I love sharing my art to everyone, some people are very unconsiderate and take art for granted. Not that I will stop sharing my art, but I will be limiting what I show on my social medias. My patrons will be the the first to see new works and works in progress! And my social medias will have a few select works to display. I usually share everything (except stuff that will spoil my projects), but now a lot of it will be found here. The great thing about Patreon is that you can help creators by donating $1 every month! Four quarters!! And you get prizes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to conclude, by supporting me you are helping me have time to work on\n my projects (such as Nodoka Magica!) and help me pay for school. Any \nlittle bit of help that I get is already a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all the support!! I hope that my art will always bring you joy. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
