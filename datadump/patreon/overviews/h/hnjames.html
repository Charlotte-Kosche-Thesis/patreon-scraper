    "summary": "Hi friends! I\u0027m H.N. James, but you can just call me H. I\u0027m a full time photographic artist working on projects both whimsical and documentary - although whimsy and the surreal seems to creep into my so-called documentary work all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0I make photographs. I am a visual storyteller. Sometimes I am showing you a fragment of a story that your imagination can run with, sometimes it\u0027s all there for the seeing. There may be times when written words or music will accompany a photograph. I\u0027m big into music. \u00a0Music fires my imagination like almost nothing else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my ongoing projects is called \"People Who Do Things\" - in this project I photograph non-famous creative people of all stripes. You can see my gallery of People Who Do Things on my website at this link:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.punkrockphotography.net/people-who-do-things\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePeople Who Do Things\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://m2.22slides.com/punkrockphotography/wes-1-bwop-1509390.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started another project in 2015 called \"Urban Goddesses\" -\u00a0If Goddesses from mythologies all around the world were incarnated as modern women, what would they be like? What would they care about? How would they be different, and how would they be the same? Those are questions I explore as I photograph the Urban Goddesses. \u00a0You can see the gallery of Goddesses here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.punkrockphotography.net/urban-goddesses\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUrban Goddesses\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://m2.22slides.com/punkrockphotography/athena-recycleop-1507786.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also always find my still-life and abstract photography at my website shop,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.punkrockphotography.net/store\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLost in the Supermarket\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0That\u0027s where you\u0027ll find a whole lotta whimsy \u0026amp; sometimes social commentary going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy your support matters:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI get paid through sales of my prints and photo greeting cards and commissioned photo shoots. I\u0027m incredibly grateful to my fans, supporters, and collectors who are able to support me in this way. A lot of people aren\u0027t \"stuff\" people, I know, or maybe have already filled their wall space with the work of many fine artists. I totally get this. I want to offer another way for people to support me and my art. As a Patron, you will have access to info about what I\u0027m working on, what\u0027s inspiring me, and maybe you\u0027ll find yourself a little inspired, too. You\u0027ll see images before they are released to other social media platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to keep making the work I find so compelling and to expand my work in new directions. I\u0027ve recently started doing some studio portrait work. \u00a0I made some glitter portraits for a magazine submission but the glitter shoots have taken on a life of their own, and I wish to continue them. I also want to expand some of the projects like People Who Do Things to be national projects. This will require funding for travel. I promise to take you with me on this journey via my Patreon feed. Regardless of whether you can afford to buy physical items from me, I want to take you along on this fantastic creative path and show you what I see. You can help me do this for the price of a cup of tea or coffee.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patron is completely optional. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you don\u0027t have the money to pitch in, that\u0027s OK. You can still help by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus or anywhere else you see fit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your time and support. I sincerely appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\n~H.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
