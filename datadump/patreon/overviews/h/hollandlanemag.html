Sure, it looks that way. It has stories and a couple ads and pages to turn (or the ability to swipe if you\u0027re a digital reader type of person) but there\u0027s more to H\u0026amp;L than just that. When you think magazine, you think glossy pages at the end of a grocery store checkout aisle with some celebrity face on it, selling the latest beauty product, and telling you how to make your body look different so your sex life can be better. H\u0026amp;L isn\u0027t that. Beyond the thick, matte pages and simplistic cover design (that is clearly worthy of any coffee table) are evergreen stories about real life, strength, and perseverance. There are stories that say, \"I\u0027ve been where you are right now, and there are reasons you\u0027re going through this, and here\u0027s a way to pull yourself out of the pit you might be in.\" This isn\u0027t a magazine. This is a lifeline. This is someone, somewhere, saying you are not alone. This is a revolution to show women, you are perfect as you are and there are other women just like you who have been standing right where you feel you are right now. It\u0027s just that now, because of H\u0026amp;L, you know you are not standing there alone.\" - Chelsea Oliver\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
