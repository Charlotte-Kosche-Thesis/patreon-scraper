We are now a part of the Dark Myths Collective at darkmyths.org! With more listeners and further contributions from fans, I might be able to devote\u00a0less time to the teaching day job that supports my family and\u00a0more time to my artistic endeavors. It\u0027s all about you, how much you like my work and how frequently you\u0027d like to consume it. Spread the word! And thanks again!"
