The show has existed in several incarnations with a number of show runners and formats that have helped share this amazing hobby. Now the Hiddengrid is back with a new crew, a new game master, and the same burning desire to give the sixth world the hoop kicking it deserves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHiddengrid is a weekly podcast using the Actual Play format, in which a group of players and a gamemaster record their sessions for weekly fun. Episodes post weekly on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.hiddengrid.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHiddengrid \u003c/a\u003ewebsite and our \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/HiddengridTheSixthWorldChroniclesPodcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRSS Feed\u003c/a\u003e.

Our format is 30 to 60 minutes with an intro and outro. Our music is provided from Magnatune and features different artists and songs each adventure module. We\u0027re focused primarily on running a 2050\u0027s style campaign using older modules but updated to 5th edition rule sets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cast of Season 3 includes:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eJoel, a new comer to podcasting and long time Shadowrun fan, playing Guard-a-Manger\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJoules, a long time Shadowrun fan and contributor to the \u003ca href=\"http://neo-anarchist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNeo-Anarchist Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, playing Flatline\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMark, another new comer to podcasting and long running Shadowrun fan, playing Crutch\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNulloperations, the current Hiddengrid show runner, playing Lindsey Stoxell\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOpti, the host of the \u003ca href=\"http://neo-anarchist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNeo-Anarchist podcast \u003c/a\u003eand now current Hiddengrid Gamemaster\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eZendead, the original host of the Hiddengrid and show runner of the \u003ca href=\"http://seizethegm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeize the GM Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, playing Birger\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe encourage fan interaction and hold a monthly Edge Reward pool that\u0027s split between votes for Players or the Gamemaster.

Website and episode hosting, URL registration, licensing for music, Mixlr subscription for the live feed, and other recurring expenses. As we can we\u0027d also like to improve the hardware used by our players, and will focus on getting new mics, pop-filters, mixers, and maybe even pc upgrades. On the high-end we\u0027d also use the donations to make con appearances at major gaming conventions and organize meet-ups with listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love feedback!
