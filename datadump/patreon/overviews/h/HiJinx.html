This is Warcabbit from City of Titans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve got a lot of talented writers, and a lot of talented artists. \nSome of the most talented, though, need a little money in their lives - \nthey\u2019re willing to work for us, but they need the dough. \nSo, we\u2019ve done a fifty-fifty deal with them. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get a great comic about a fantastic character I\u2019m really \npumped about. And the people who wanted to support us after the \nkickstarter closed get somewhere to put a little cash. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven better, the constraints of telling the comic\u2019s story will \nhelp us design the city better - what parts look right, what parts \ndon\u2019t. Basically, everything you see is concept art for us. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we have two prototype titles - a heroic one about a kid who just wants to be fun that goes by the name of \u0027Hijinx\u0027, and something inspired pretty heavily by Secret Six that\u0027s on the flip side. We\u0027re thinking of calling that one \u0027Breakout\u0027, but it might change. We\u0027ve got a lot of hope for these comics - Hijinx especially, it\u0027s the story of a teenager who gets pretty great powers and doesn\u0027t really give a flip about responsibility. Not a bad kid, just... well, hey, if you had crazy luck powers, wouldn\u0027t you go have a little fun? That\u0027s what she thinks, anyhow. Let\u0027s see what happens next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you like them, and we hope we can keep producing the comics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Hijinx is being produced by Tom \u0027Kid Dynamo\u0027 Stillwell, writer behind the Fangirl comic (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/522162244/fangirl\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/522162244/fangirl)\u003c/a\u003e as well as his own Spinner Rack Comics, and Dale \u0027Black Gold\u0027 Yaddow, doing art, lettering, and coloring .)"
