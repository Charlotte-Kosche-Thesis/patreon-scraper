    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you all know, I started this channel as a way of putting my enthusiasm for Warframe content out into the world, and to help people make an informed decision as to how best to spend their ingame resources and their forma. And as time has gone on, my enthusiasm has done nothing but increase, and interacting more with you all has been absolutely immense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI actually went full time with youtube in Januray last year, and 15 months later, I am still going strong. However, with youtube recently\u003cbr\u003ehaving some really high profile issues with monetisation, and the higher paying ads being pulled from youtube by the big companies, all of us creators have taken a really big hit. This means that patreon plays a higher role in staying self sustaining and independent and you know, eating is kind of important sometimes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow in terms of rewards for becoming a patron you will get access to exclusive discord chat channel and voice channels, the ability to participate in polls regarding upcoming videos, Preferential slots in Livestream Squads and also the ability to request a video on a certain subject, on any game that I am currently covering. I am not big on seperating people based on their monetary situation, so you get pretty much the same with the lowest pledge as you with the largest, apart from the largest getting the additional benefit of their name on my endscreen as well as my video description.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate any and all of you that wish to support my channel directly through patreon, you will always have my eternal thanks. I love making content for you all to enjoy, whatever game that may be in, and I look forward to being able to continue that going forward!\u003cbr\u003e"
