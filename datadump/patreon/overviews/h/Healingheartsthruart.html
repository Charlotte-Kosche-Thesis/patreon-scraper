England, Artist and Founder of Healing Hearts Thru Art Nonprofit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe offer bereaved parents healing portraits of their deceased child (any age, any cause of death) 100% free of charge. \u00a0It is a love gift, to help parents have a memorial artwork of their child, and to know that we are loving on them, remembering them, and want to know that we are supporting them and sending spiritual strength, even when they feel most hurting and alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe parents don\u0027t have to do anything but provide a photo or two -- we do the rest, including covering shipping and handling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach portrait is done in top quality oil paints on linen canvas, and is crafted in love!!!\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how much or how little information we have, the portraits can take anywhere from several days to several weeks to complete. \u00a0As the artist, I can tell you, every portrait is extremely important and the utmost care goes into each and everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis, many times, is a quiet, unsupported work. \u00a0Grieving parents still have issues going on around them, and although a number of them write to say how thankful they are, some have no means of \"paying it forward\" -- Many still have numerous problems to contend with in direct relation to the loss of their child, even if it was years ago, complicated grief, marital problems/divorce as a result of the stress, financial issues, and other serious situations. \u00a0Some parents have lost more than one child as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\u00a0is why we are relying on friends and other people who feel touched in their hearts to help our outreach. \u00a0Other people who can empathize with this cause of helping bereaved parents, and feel that the work is important to continue. \u00a0We receive no steady funding, government or public funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWithout support from patrons, donors, and friends, there is no more outreach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will consider a patronage with us. \u00a0Every little bit goes a long way helping to pay for supplies, shipping, and of course, the always immovable administration fees that are everywhere!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor less than the price of a latte and croissant per month, you can help our mission continue.  We offer patron giving levels from $1 to $1,000 per month, for all budgets and blessings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOU are the change -- friends helping friends, and love wins \u2764\ufe0f \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease commit to be a Patron today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by and considering our outreach!"
