I make concise and focused videos with no fluff because I know you\u0027re all busy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do want to stress as I\u0027m sure many of you probably could guess, this is going to be a completely optional form of supporting the show. Why do I need funding? Well, life is expensive. Outside of my show, I am a freelance editor and while that pays the bills, it\u0027s also incredibly stressful and doesn\u0027t always guarantee the kind of money I need to survive. My channel is also not the most algorithm friendly on YouTube, I want to hold the freedom of making what I want without having to change anything to suit search-ability in the engine, just deliver my thoughts to you as I see fit and that works with my style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I get from supporting you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided I wanted to keep this like a tip jar with only one tier of $1.\u00a0Every Patron that kindly donates $1 or more will get\u00a0my eternal and undying love for supporting me but I figured you\u0027d want some more tangible stuff. You\u0027ll also\u00a0get access to my Patreon blog, where I will post all the research I did on each video, a monthly list of interesting game design videos I watched that month and anything else I find that\u0027s relevant, as well as be kept in the loop on my current projects I\u0027m working on. The Patreon only videos where I\u0027m gonna give quick thoughts on games I\u0027ve been playing (Nothing hugely in-depth, all that stuff will still be saved for the main series of videos) as well as a debrief of thoughts on the videos I released that month to go over some stuff I may have missed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
