    "summary": "PLEASE NOTE: At this time, I am no longer accepting Patreon pledges. The HSP Podcast has been on hiatus for a few months. I may continue with the show in the future, but for now there are no new episodes. Thank you SO MUCH for your generous support!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor two years and 70 episodes, I (Kelly) have been releasing a twice-monthly podcast sharing information, stories, advice, and humor about being a Highly Sensitive Person and introvert.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/h2\u003eAside from the existential crisis I just gave myself with this question, the simple answer is that I am dedicated to helping people learn about being highly sensitive. \u003cstrong\u003eHSP self-realization can be life-changing; I know first-hand. \u003c/strong\u003eAccepting your sensitivity\u00a0means accepting yourself, and it can take so much weight off your shoulders. Weight you\u0027ve been carrying your whole life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy podcast, \u003ca href=\"http://highlysensitiveperson.net/hsppodcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Highly Sensitive Person\u0027s Life\u003c/a\u003e, is a show designed to fit into your busy life. Most episodes are short (5-15 minutes) but I\u0027ve featured interviews in recent episodes that are longer. So far, I\u0027ve covered topics like empathy, workplace happiness, anticipatory grief, scary movies, handling criticism, travel, extroverted HSPs, beauty sensitivity, loneliness, loud sounds, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing highly sensitive doesn\u0027t mean you are weak! It doesn\u0027t mean you are weird or wrong! (But if you\u0027ve listened to my show, you\u0027ve heard me say this a dozen times already!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWHY DO I NEED YOUR SUPPORT?\u003c/h2\u003e\nYou might be wondering--how much time can it take to make a 5-15 minute podcast. Each episode\u00a0requires several hours of work, including research, production, editing, graphic design, and promotion. Editing a 45-minute interview takes many, many hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn a perfect world, I could do this fulfilling work and not have to worry about money, but sadly this is not the case.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy my podcast and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.highlysensitiveperson.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, if you find them helpful, uplifting, or entertaining, then I am thrilled. Would you consider giving just $1 per episode (or more!)? It would allow me to keep going with this work that is truly helping people just like you and me! Patreon makes this possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHOW DOES PATREON WORK?\u003c/h2\u003e\nYou can pledge to give a specific amount every time I release an episode (usually 2 shows per month.) You can also set a maximum per month to ensure you don\u0027t go over a certain amount. And you can cancel anytime! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u00a0All podcast and blog content is free, as always\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027m just asking for support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCertain levels receive rewards as a special Thank You!\u00a0All rewards are fulfilled the week AFTER you pledge. After I upload each episode, Patreon gives me a list telling me who-gets-what. I use that list to fulfill my obligation to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQUESTIONS?\u003c/h2\u003e\nEmail me at \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */ or tweet me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/hisensitivelife\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@hisensitivelife\u003c/a\u003e.
