    "summary": "Hi I\u2019m Adrian Baker, the creator of Hacking the Self, and I\u2019m going to briefly explain the premise behind this show and why I\u2019m asking for your support on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a K12 History teacher by training who lives in Thailand. I first became interested in Buddhism and meditation and yoga when I first moved to Asia eight years ago. Over time these interests have only intensified and expanded to include other Eastern religions and philosophies, as well as comparative mythology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this show is to promote thoughtful, sometimes edgy conversations around what in Buddhism people often refer to as \u201cwaking up:\u201d a process of becoming aware of our true nature--our limitations as well as our own potential--and carving out pathways to self actualization for the benefit of ourselves and for others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that there are multiple, viable visions about what it means to live a moral and fulfilling life and I\u2019m interested in undertaking this intellectual and spiritual journey through multiple lenses: ancient and modern, Eastern and Western, scientific and religious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m captivated by big ideas--largely fuelled by a passion for learning, but also driven by pragmatic concerns about how we can make the most of our finite amount of time on this earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why create a Patreon page for this show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few simple reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne I hate ads\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo I\u2019m going to explore some edgy, controversial topics on this show and I don\u2019t want any corporate money to subtly attempt to influence the content of this show\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThree I do have costs and there are considerable\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDirect costs of this show about $300 a month for the production of episodes \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpend considerable amount of time--common to spend 15-20 hours a week on the show, and there are many weeks where it\u2019s been more than that\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFour I really hate ads\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you\u2019ll consider giving. If people gave $2 a mont--50 cents an episode--I could not only make this project a sustainable one, but I could expand production to create more content that engages and grows a community of like minded people. I want people to feel engaged so that we can collectively inquire big questions that produce practical tips, and true wisdom, for living a meaningful life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a supporter as well of my favorite podcasts on Patreon. I firmly believe that this could be the future of financing creative content. I think it\u2019s truly a revolution in information technology and in the media. I\u2019m excited to be a part of it. I hope that you\u2019ll consider joining as well. \u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening and I hope that you\u2019ll consider being a part of a community of like minded people.\u003cbr\u003e"
