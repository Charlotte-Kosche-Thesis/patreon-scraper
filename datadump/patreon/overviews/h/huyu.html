My name is Hu Yu.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally from China, I\u0027ve lived in the United States for almost the past 10 years. Painting\n was always a large, very important part of my life growing up and \nsomething I am proud to pass along to my daughter Aiden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a kid, I loved to play in nature, the house I grew up in was surrounded by mountains, rivers, and lakes. I\n am very lucky, my grandmother taught me to use the natural beauty that \nsurrounds us  to make beautiful art - leaf and stone paintings are my favorites!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eexactly\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eMostly I make leaf paintings.\u00a0 I spend a lot of time outdoors and am always looking for the best leaves for painting.\u00a0 I like to use the natural features, textures, colors of the leaf when painting.\u00a0 It\u0027s more beautiful that way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you describe the process a little?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI start with selecting a leaf that is the right type and quality to undergo a flattening and preservation process.\u00a0 Also, I select the leafs that inspire me to paint.\u00a0 Natural features, hues, tints, etc all lend themselves to creating uniquely different works of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps the most difficult/tedious task is finding new leaves that will work well with my process \u0026amp; make great art!\u00a0 I am always on the look out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a leaf is chosen, the flattening \u0026amp; preservation process takes on average about a month to complete before the leaf is ready for painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long do leaf paintings last?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA very long time.\u00a0 They do not deteriorate or fall apart.
