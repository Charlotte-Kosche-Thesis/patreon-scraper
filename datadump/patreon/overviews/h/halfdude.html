    "summary": "Hello! My name is Ian but you can call me by my screen name Half-Dude. I\u0027ve been drawing my whole life, for about as long as I can remember, doodling crazy stick-people lands on used dot-matrix printer paper on my grandmas kitchen table. As the years have gone by my skills have increased, I\u0027m about as natural an artist as you can get, having never went to art college instead just learning everything I know through sheer willpower and determination. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was only after I made an online presence for myself on places like Deviantart and Furaffinity that I really got any idea of how many people actually enjoyed the finished product of my silly little hobby, I very rarely ever have many people to show my art to in real life you see. For the longest time I drew mostly fan-art for games and cartoons before finally starting to create my own unique characters and styles a couple years ago with the rise of my interest in vehicles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired by movies like The Brave Little Toaster and ad spots like the old 90s Chevron talking car commercials. I took a real liking to the traditional cartoon car style, you know, eyes in the headlights, mouth in the bumper, cute little nubby movements on their short little tire legs. Over the last year or so I\u0027ve really taken that idea and made it my own, creating a style of fully anthropomorphic vehicles capable of complex poses and body language. To my delight this style has been incredibly popular with my online fans which got me thinking I might really have something going here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince becoming involved with the OS (Objectum-Sexuality) movement, a whole new market for my kind of art has really been taking off in the form of shall we say.. auto erotic art, if you know what I mean. While I enjoy doing such art, I\u0027m by no means limited to it, and I love to do purely innocent, adorable, or funny drawings when the opportunity comes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Become A Supporter?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m so glad you asked, I\u0027ve never felt fully comfortable asking for money, but Patreon allows me to basically have a tip jar of sorts. I\u0027m not demanding anything of you, but if you enjoy the art that I create, this site allows you to support it. As of right now, my drawing is just a little hobby of mine. In fact with how my life is right now trying to get a career going for myself. I don\u0027t draw as much as I probably could, always feeling like I should be doing something more important. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would feel generous enough to become my patron, not only would I delight me to have such support from my fans, but the extra income would allow me to justify spending more hours of my day drawing, I would be able to treat it like a second job. Heck who knows, with enough backing I may be able to even make this a full time job who knows! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically if you leave this wall of text with anything, know this. Supporting me will support the art that I create, will allow it to improve and come out more frequently. If that sounds good to you, why not take a look at the different plans I have below, your patronage will not go unrewarded!\u003cbr\u003e"
