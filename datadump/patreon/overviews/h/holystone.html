Gods rule the world\u0027s nations and people, shaping their cultures around worship and prayer. It has been running for 3 years now, with 5 chapters, 4 mini-chapters, and a handful of short stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main story opens with pirate captain Anabele Tessier and her wife, Pheia Tessier. Pheia, in order to protect the theophobic Anabele, volunteers herself to become the \n\"khen\" of the newly-reborn God of Faith- meaning that she will act as the god\u0027s \u003cem\u003eliving vessel \u003c/em\u003efor the rest of her life. \nThis, however, angers the powerful Murtell crime family, who sought the political and financial gains associated with gods for themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis leads to series of consequences, political battles, and personal struggles as everyone tries to figure out what exactly to \n\u003cem\u003edo \u003c/em\u003ewith this rowdy \"baby\" god. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t read it yet, you can \u003ca href=\"http://www.holystone-comic.com/page/prologue-page-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eclick here to start from the beginning\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD I BECOME YOUR PATRON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nShort of any kind of major disaster, I will continue to make Holystone until it reaches its natural ending. It has been jangling around in my head for roughly 10 years, so it is wonderful to finally give voice and shape to so many of my long-beloved characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support would help make it easier to keep things going, by covering hosting costs and my basic needs.
