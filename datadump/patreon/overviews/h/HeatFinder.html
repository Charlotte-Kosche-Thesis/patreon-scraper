IRF2 was born from the original Internet Race Finder, a central tool for online racing used throughout the Heat Community for many years until it\u0027s sudden demise. Talk of replacing the original IRF had been floating around for years but did not materialize until early 2008. Sucahyo, a well known and respected developer in the Heat Community, began early work on a new project. DusterLag joined in on the project shortly after and the project quickly expanded beyond a simple online server listing. HeatFinder has expanded and contracted many times since then, but remain focused on supporting the entire Heat Community with our services and sharing our staff\u0027s skill with other groups within the Heat Community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday HeatFinder is fully funded through pledges and donations by our community members via Patreon and PayPal while subsided when needed by our administration staff.
