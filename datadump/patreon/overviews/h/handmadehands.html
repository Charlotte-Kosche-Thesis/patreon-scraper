    "summary": "Welcome!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are handmadehands, a band from Leeds, UK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make music. We have made music in the past. We intend to continue making music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy?? Because we enjoy doing it. We could get into a deep philosophical debate about why music is important (music is incredibly important!!!) but what better reason is there to do something than that you enjoy it? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want you to hear our music and we totally understand that, with even the smallest amount of internet savvy, you can do that for free if you like. We think that\u0027s a great thing, if you want it, we want you to have it! In fact, we have two albums on Bandcamp (\u003ca href=\"https://handmadehands.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://handmadehands.bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e) which you can get for \u0027Pay What You Want\u0027 (free is fine x). We also have a couple of videos up on YouTube (\u003ca href=\"http://youtu.be/RRAUSOi6RZ8)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://youtu.be/RRAUSOi6RZ8\u003c/a\u003e) which we\u0027ve made through collaboration with some of our incredibly talented friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why this??!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell.....like it or not, music and videos take time and money to make. We have been lucky enough to work with some amazing people over the years and we have a long list of talented people we\u0027d love to collaborate with in the future. We believe that it is important that people get paid properly for their work and we certainly don\u0027t buy into the notion that\u0027s all too prevalent nowadays, that if you enjoy doing something, you should do it for free. That\u0027s a pretty good way to stifle creativity and land us all in jobs we hate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is where you come in..........\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like you to pledge a fixed amount of money ($1 min on this site I\u0027m afraid) per song/video that we create to help us continue to do this. You can do this by simply signing up to this website and giving them all your personal banking details ;) After that, whenever we post a new song or video you\u0027ll be charged whatever you pledged. We won\u0027t do it more than once a month and the money will come out of your account on the same day each month, regardless of when we release the song/video.  Unlike a monthly subscription charge, if we don\u0027t release anything that month, you don\u0027t get charged anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConceptually, we don\u0027t see this as you buying downloads. You will of course get copies of everything we create as soon as we release it, but you aren\u0027t paying for the product, you\u0027re paying for it to be made. Your money helps pay for someone to come and record a session for us, edit a video, arrange band parts or something more boring like buying us a new XLR cable. You will be a patron of the arts, funding a project that we hope you think is worthwhile, just because you think it\u0027s worthwhile. We\u0027re hoping that doing it this way will give us the freedom to plan more creative projects and do some of the things we\u0027ve been dreaming about for some time now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe fully understand if you don\u0027t want to get involved in this, we certainly don\u0027t think you owe us anything. We still really want you to listen to and enjoy (hopefully) everything we put out for free with a clear conscience. We\u0027re just dead chuffed that you\u0027ve shown an interest, thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFletch and Dan x  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few promises......\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe will only ever put out things we are proud of.\u00a0 (We don\u0027t promise you\u0027ll love\u00a0it all, only middle of the road art is made that way)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe will pay everyone who helps us a fair share of any money made.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are not doing this for profit, though we may take money for time we have spent creating,\u00a0 If we raise loads of money (I\u0027m sure we will) we will use it in creative ways to\u00a0improve our output (Quincey Jones and Bruce Swedien on production/engineering duties, Van Halen guitar solos etc).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe love process, that\u0027s often the most interesting part of a lot of art for us.\u00a0 We want you to see the processes we go through in creating our music and videos so we will endeavour to keep updating you with blogs and other content showing what we\u0027re up to (for free)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe will constantly review how this is working and strive to make it something which is enjoyable and interesting to be part of.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
