With homebrew roleplaying game content dating back to the 80s, I have a vast collection of material and a depth of experience that I want to share with all of you. Our patrons get access to patron-only posts, monthly updates, meta-game and behind the scenes content. They can listen to the unedited podcasts, featuring meta-game discussions, fart noises, and more. Patrons also can watch gaming tips and tricks videos, receive monthly unique fully detailed characters, access to a special actual play podcast that highlights various roleplaying game systems, and a monthly play kit featuring additional factions, groups, characters, magic items, and setting information. Finally, \u003cstrong\u003eLegend\u003c/strong\u003e level patrons can even get a complete digital adventure module instead of having to purchase it through DriveThruRPG.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAlong with all this great content, patrons also have an opportunity to make a real difference in my life. I was diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s Disease in 2014. Since that time, my ability to work a traditional job has been hindered by a failing body. This has meant an almost monthly struggle to make ends meet.

A huge fan of \u003cem\u003eCyberpunk 2020\u003c/em\u003e, his enthusaism for the setting is infectious. Together with Greyson Simon, they explore the dangers, horrors, and wonders of the Milky Way galaxy. It is also a great example of how to run a game with only a small group of players.

While I\u0027m a big fan of the adventure books being produced by Wizards of the Coast, I miss the simple and straight-forward modules from days gone by that required little prep and a lot less time commitment from everyone. All hail the One Shot! So, this is my chance to fill that gap with easy to play and prep adventures designed for a variety of player character levels.

When most kids my age were chasing after crushes, I spent endless hours leaning over a table covered in strange dice, cryptic sheets of paper, pewter figures, and dustings of snack food crumbs. Not only did discovering roleplaying games help me overcome my dyslexia, the games proved to be the spark that ignited a lifelong love of storytelling and adventure.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tNothing in my life has been left untouched by this love for roleplaying games, including doing graduate work on the urtext of all fantasy, the \u003cem\u003eLord of the Rings\u003c/em\u003e. Over the years, I have played everything from FASA\u2019s \u003cem\u003eStar Trek RPG\u003c/em\u003e to Pondsmith\u2019s \u003cem\u003eCyberpunk 2020\u003c/em\u003e published by R.
