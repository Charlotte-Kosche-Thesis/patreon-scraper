And pretty much hated all of them ( I love animals, I just don\u0027t like their poop). Through it all, I always loved to write and now I want to see if I can live the dream by writing and creating cool stuff full time. So join me if you will, and help me escape my former poop filled life and be reborn as a writer. The stuff I like to create is mostly fantasy and sci-fi themed, but I also love horror and I love to joke. So expect some dark humour and graphic scenes. Not to worry though, I won\u0027t make it too nasty. (unless you really want me to...). If this sounds cool to you, then please feel free to join me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to pledge then thank you for being a Patron at any tier level.
