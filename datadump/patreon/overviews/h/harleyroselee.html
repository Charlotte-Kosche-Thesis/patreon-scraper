Your friendly neighborhood internet hoochie coochie girl!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a half-vampire half-mermaid creature who creates entertainment on the internet. This entertainment (intertainment?) takes many forms: I sing and play various instruments, I create video content from the hilarious to the sensual (and everything in between),\u00a0 I shoot cosplay and pin up style photo sets, I do live shows dressed in ridiculous outfits, I smash things on my head or cram things in my mouth for nickels...and that\u0027s just Monday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2014 I\u0027ve been live streaming and creating content. I\u0027ve been very grateful for the support I\u0027ve gotten thus far, but it is a lot of work! I don\u0027t regret the time I put into my shows and interacting with my fan base but it does make it hard to create new content or even come up with new ideas when you\u0027re constantly live. This Patreon is a way for me to be able to healthily balance being live and having a cushion to safely take some time away from the camera to concentrate on creating content, interacting with my fan base offline, and making sure me and my cat Leia are able to make ends meet and save for our goals consistently. (This page was her idea, btw).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support, whether it\u0027s here or elsewhere means the world to me and helps me continue doing what I love. So let me entertain you and we\u0027ll have a real good time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, sir!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxox\u003cbr\u003eHarley"
