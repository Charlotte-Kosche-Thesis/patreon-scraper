I picked up a marker and this guy just kinda plopped out of my subconscious onto the paper:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wjKQ8tV.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a hideous, creepy monster, right? But if you\u0027re like me, you kinda feel for the thing.\u00a0You empathize with it. You probably know what it\u0027s like to realize that sometimes love isn\u0027t enough. I found this weird drawing I\u0027d made surprisingly moving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started making more. Every time I went to a meeting, I ended up drawing two or three or four monsters, and then I\u0027d leave them on the conference room table for other people to discover. Pretty soon I noticed people were putting them up on the walls, talking to each other about them, and in some cases even taking ones they particularly liked home to stick to their fridge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6CDDWvp.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAn early batch of hideous monsters.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are quite a few of these monsters sticking to various walls around the studio where I work now. I like to think each one is a unique glimpse into a moment in the life of a hideous creature who is maybe not so different from you and me? Or anyway, the people I work with seem to like them, SO PROBABLY YOU WILL LIKE THEM AS WELL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge to this project, you\u0027ll get access to new monster drawings every week that non-patrons WILL NEVER SEE. You can also pledge to access the archive of the first ~300 I\u0027ve already made. You\u0027ll also get my (very valuable) gratitude and as many internet high fives as you can carry."
