The air is filled with pleasant conversation, and coming into it makes you feel like you\u0027ve come home.

While the audio is ok on the stream, it could be sooo much better.  Right now, my music comes from my stereo and into the Logitech webcam mic, as does my voice, and all the kitchen sounds.  I have my computer muted, and so any alerts or interactive board audio features would be audible to you but not me. Imagine if my voice was unmuffled, the music was clear, and my blender didn\u0027t break your ears every time I used it!\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cem\u003eAn iPad stand!\u003c/em\u003e I want to be able to show you more, to move my nifty iPad webcam to the stove, or the dishpit, or wherever I\u0027m working.\u003cbr\u003e3. \u003cem\u003eA website with a recipe blog\u003c/em\u003e, with special content unlockable only by subscribers.  This one is all about time.  A couple of top level subscribers could move my focus from hours at my paid job to time spent taking pictures, writing my stories, recipes and methods for growing, preparing and preserving food...until the site pays for itself!\u003cbr\u003e4. The ultimate goal...streaming and creating content that reflects my passion for food, food justice, and food security as \u003cem\u003emy full time job\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0It\u0027s a pretty big goal, but not impossible. \u00a0The first step is strategizing. \u003cstrong\u003eIf just 16 people subscribed at the 20$ level, I would be able to work just enough fewer hours at my current job to stay above water and focus on this growth. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The next steps would mean adding more to that team of supporters, and that is a few months down the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you like what you see? Do you enjoy what I do? Would you like to see more? Those of you who do, have encouraged me to go for it, to take this project to the next level, so this is the big chance to be a part of making it happen in real life. Thanks for believing in me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
