    "summary": "Well hi there, glad you could make it :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Greg Zaal and, as I\u0027m sure you know, I create\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hdrihaven.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHDRIs\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut not just any HDRIs. I create \u003cstrong\u003efree, unclipped HDRIs\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Unclipped\" means they\u0027re true HDRIs: they contain the \u003cstrong\u003efull dynamic range \u003c/strong\u003eof the scene they were captured in.\u00a0Most HDRIs you come across online, even the paid ones, are \"clipped\", which means the highest part of the dynamic range is missing, leaving your 3D scene looking fake or just bland. This is not always an easy problem to solve, but I\u0027ve made it my mission to do it so that you can have the best and \u003cstrong\u003emost realistic lighting possible\u003c/strong\u003e right off the bat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and they\u0027re not just free either, \u003cstrong\u003ethey\u0027re CC0\u003c/strong\u003e - basically public domain. \"Public domain\" means they belong to the public, the public owns them; you own them. It doesn\u0027t get any more free than that, you can literally use them for anything, anywhere, however you like. You can modify them, abuse them and even share them around, all without requiring credit or even mention of where you got them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is what freedom is, but it needs your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating HDRIs is an expensive task - camera equipment and travel costs are notoriously high, often thousands of dollars each, but there are also the day-to-day costs of running a website that makes these massive HDR files available for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. With your support, not only can we keep HDRI Haven alive and running, but we can \u003cstrong\u003eimprove it\u003c/strong\u003e. Higher resolution HDRIs, more of them, more often, and in more interesting places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow it works\u003c/h3\u003eThis Patreon page is not a paywall - by supporting me here, you\u0027re helping me create HDRIs that are available to everyone for free. The various reward levels on the right are a way for me to say thank you, allow you to get more involved in the process and be recognized for your contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons have access to a private Trello board where they can make suggestions and vote on various things like new HDRI ideas, travel locations, and how the donations are spent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayments are made automatically at the beginning of the month. For the lower reward levels, you\u0027ll get your reward immediately after signing up (even in the middle of a month). For higher reward levels ($20+) you may have to wait until after the payment has been processed before getting your reward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hdrihaven.com/p/about-contact.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejust shout\u003c/a\u003e :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d prefer to make a \u003cstrong\u003eonce-off donation\u003c/strong\u003e, you can do so with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hdrihaven.com/p/once-off-donation.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePayPal or Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to make \u003cstrong\u003eanonymous\u003c/strong\u003e recurring donations, I\u0027m on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://liberapay.com/gregzaal\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiberapay\u003c/a\u003e too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere your money goes\u003c/h3\u003eIn the beginning, most of the money will go towards maintaining and improving the website (making higher resolutions available, upgrading server capacity, etc) and funding travel for new HDRIs. But as things grow, we\u0027ll get to create more and more exciting things like an HDRI-shooting drone, crazy high resolution night time HDRIs with stars and entire new websites for textures and other assets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a number of goals on the left of this page, these are what we\u0027re working towards together. Each of them explains what the money is needed for, but I also release a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hdrihaven.com/p/finance-reports.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublic finance report\u003c/a\u003e every month so that you know exactly what was donated and where it was spent/saved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals can\u0027t be guaranteed to be fulfilled immediately as soon as they are met. Some of them will take time to implement, and some may have to be pushed back if the funding target is found to be unrealistic. Obviously I do my best to be accurate (and overestimate if unsure), and I\u0027ll update you if anything changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donations will be used first and foremost for HDRI Haven itself. After the expenses are covered and most of the remainder kept for travel and equipment savings, a small portion will be used for my own personal expenses (food, rent, medical, etc.). The more time I spend on HDRIs, the less time I spend on freelance work (yay!), which means I need to draw more from donations for my personal expenses. Again, all the details are publically available in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hdrihaven.com/p/finance-reports.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efinance reports\u003c/a\u003e :)\u003cbr\u003e"
