My siblings \u0026amp; I spent the summers with Maw Maw \u0026amp; Paw Paw- the days were filled with picking blackberries, completing crossword puzzles, and baking. The smell of summer was always a mix of chocolate chip cookies, apple \u0026amp; pecan pies, and coconut cake. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2008, our MawMaw left us for glory. Like most, we feel the weight of this loss especially around holidays. And though she was no longer with us, not having her pies at Thanksgiving or Christmas was not a reality we were willing to face! To keep the memory of her alive within our family, I took the role of pie baker at every family gathering. I began documenting my baking \u0026amp; home life on Instagram and found that more than a few friends wanted recipes to recreate the pies themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is an answer to those inquiries. I hope it serves you well as a resource in making your homes a little more like that small farm in Arkansas. \u003cbr\u003e",
