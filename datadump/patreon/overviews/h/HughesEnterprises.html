    "summary": "Greetings! and welcome to my Patreon page. With the YouTube Ad-Pocalypse upon all gun channels, small channels like mine take months to years to re-coup the cost of even the shortest shooting video. Ammunition is pretty expensive and guns even more so. Your donation through Patreon will allow me to make videos more frequently and be able to afford better camera and audio equipment to make more polished looking videos. With enough support I will be able to purchase new guns and ammunition as well as reloading components so I can share my knowledge and current projects with all of you. Thank you so much for your support whether that is through Patreon or leaving comments and sharing with your friends and I look forward to your continued viewership!\u003cbr\u003e"
