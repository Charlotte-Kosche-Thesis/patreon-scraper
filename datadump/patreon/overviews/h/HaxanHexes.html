Writing has been my passion and my life\u0027s goal since I was teenager. The written word is how I express myself and it\u0027s my primary creative outlet. In recent years, due to the encouragement of many talented friends, I have taken to writing and publishing fanfiction, first for \u003cem\u003eLife is Strange\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and now primarily for \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFanfiction has been an outlet for me to express and explore feelings around trauma, healing, identity, sexuality, romance and more. I want to write affecting stories about characters and worlds that I am passionate about. I want to share them with fellow fans and, in doing so, help expand their notions of what life, love and fandom can be. Or, at least,\u00a0write some fun, engaging stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/PineNeedles\"\u003eAO3\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://galpalico.tumblr.com\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/326162844896722945/412372695783833632/What.png\"\u003eAs mentioned above, my primary fandom is \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0though I\u0027m open to writing for any of my many fandoms. I specialize in femslash, but want to expand to gen fics and even certain m/f and m/m ships. Though my output is modest, I pride myself on quality, characterization and narrative depth. I\u0027m an avid multishipper and \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0rare pairs and poly ships.

My writing will always be freely available to everyone, and the majority of the Patreon-exclusive perks are unlocked at the $1 level. Writing for me is passion, not business, so the goal is neither crude monetization nor a clear money-for-service exchange. Rather, becoming a patron is a donation to my creative development. It\u0027s your way of supporting me as I pursue that which I love, as well as getting enough economic pressure off my shoulders through your donations to give my muse some room to breath. In return, you get some cool bonuses!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you want access to Patreon-exclusive benefits, all it takes is a dollar a month! If you can afford more, a larger donation is very welcome, and comes with other fun perks. And, if you can\u0027t afford the dollar, or just don\u0027t want to give it, my regular writing will still be available for non-patrons a week later on my AO3 and tumblr. Give what you want, if you can, and know that as my patron, you\u0027ll not only have early access to my fics, but also the font of my eternal gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/326162844896722945/412372693455732760/Schedule.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon has no set publishing schedule, but my aim is a story and an update a month.
