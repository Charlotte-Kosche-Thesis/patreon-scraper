    "summary": "As the founder and director of Horrible Imaginings Film Festival, I have dedicated the last seven years to building and fostering a community of horror lovers in San Diego that not only appreciates the genre, but thinks about it in new and exciting ways. We have offered networking opportunities that have inspired and led to excellent new film and writing projects and collaborations. Just this year, we have provided the platform that is leading to new projects in virtual reality.\u00a0With The Film Geeks, we are expanding into more classic repertory film programming, and adding a greater scope to our cinematic offerings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we are expanding our plans even further. Over the summer, we initiated a class on writing suspense and horror as an experiment in launching future classes. We also have plans to use age-appropriate monster and fantasy elements to bring the joy of writing, filmmaking, and other creative communication to our under-served communities here in San Diego. These ambitious plans are not without their costs. What we are asking for is not just the funding of one project, but for you to take part in supporting an organization that is the starting point for an endless number of creative projects--both from the networking of professionals to the education and encouragement of our youth and students. For this to be possible, we need to be able to dedicate more time to the mission, as well as get a team of teachers and horror enthusiasts to join the cause. Help us become a force of creativity, not only for here in San Diego, but as a hub that can foster creative forces worldwide!"

I currently work clost to 50 hours weekly for the school district, in addition to the 7 years I have been organizing Horrible Imaginings, Film Geeks, and other events. It is a quick road to burnout. At this Goal, all of my energies would go toward our educational outreach and literacy initiatives, unique and event-oriented film programming, workshops, filmmaker networking, meet and greets, and--most importantly--the building, fostering, and empowering of a genre-driven creative community right here in San Diego! YOU can be a key part of it!\u00a0",
