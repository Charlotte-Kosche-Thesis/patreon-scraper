It currently runs to nearly a million words and can be read in its entirety\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://deathworlders.com/books/deathworlders\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is HFY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHFY \u00a0is a sub-genre of speculative fiction. The acronym stands for \"Humanity, Fuck Yeah!\" and its specific focus is on subverting the usual role that the human race plays in speculative fiction. Whether we\u0027re the cowering masses in comic books who have to run for cover while supervillains are punched through our office blocks, or the galactic everyman against whom the aliens are more logical, stronger, more empathic or whatever, in most scifi and fantasy settings humanity generally comes off at best as the plucky underdog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHFY inverts that relationship. It envisions a world in which the human race is gifted in some way, and aims to leave the reader feeling positive or empowered about humanity as a whole...or to serve as a cautionary tale about power and responsibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Story So Far\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe concept of a \"deathworld\" has existed in scifi at least since the series of novels by Harry Harrison published in 1960. The term describes a planet so utterly dangerous that any intrepid explorer setting foot on its surface is in grave and immediate peril. Virulent diseases, clawed predators, toxic plants or simply the harsh weather all pose an imminent risk of death.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eThe Deathworlders\u003c/em\u003e, Earth is one such planet. Humans just don\u0027t know any different because we\u0027ve never lived anywhere else.\u00a0Those species that have achieved interstellar travel on the other hand consider it impossible for sapient life to evolve on deathworlds, so when humanity shows up they are\u00a0justifiably terrified of us. To them, we are monsters: Impervious to their weapons, strong enough to tear them limb from limb and capable of near-impossible feats of endurance. And that\u0027s to say nothing of the devastating bacterial and fungal plagues we carry naturally on our skin, nor our fierce intellect and contagious memes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe oldest and most powerful interstellar civilizations count us as the gravest threat they have ever faced, and so mankind barely have time to set foot on the galactic stage before we find ourselves embroiled in a deadly fight for survival...A fight in which all our natural advantages may not be enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Hambone?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy real name is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HamboneHFY/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhilip R. Johnson\u003c/a\u003e. I was born and raised in Carmarthenshire in Wales, UK and I graduated with a BEng in Computer Games Design from Staffordshire University in 2009 after which I spent several years working as a medical clerk and typist. I began writing as a hobby when I was a child, and I was one of those kids with a bedroom that was mostly bookshelf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far so boring. But in 2011 I wrote a one-shot HFY short story about a man named Kevin Jenkins and his alien friend Kirk, which I published anonymously on 4chan.org/tg/\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story enjoyed some positive reception before (so I thought) sinking without trace in the manner of pretty much anything posted anonymously on 4chan. It wasn\u0027t until two years later that, on a slow day browsing Reddit at work, I dropped into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003er/HFY\u003c/a\u003e and discovered to my surprise that my forgotten short story was actually pretty popular.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promptly wrote a sequel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen the sequel got a continuation...and several successor chapters. Then before I knew it I was 22 chapters in and writing a 112,500 word monster called \"Warhorse\" and it became apparent that I\u0027d managed to jump on a wild horse\u0027s back and was now stuck there for better or worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy readers encouraged me to monetize the series and...here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your patronage help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith your support, The Deathworlders has become my career!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a long and tough journey, but I am now able to work full-time from home as an author thanks to your support and kindness, and I am devoting the time this affords me to producing not also the best story I can, but others as well. This has been the realization of a life goal for me, and I will not be squandering this humbling opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope going forward to recompile the early chapters of the story into a hard-copy book format. I am also working on a children\u0027s novel which explores similar themes, which I intend to publish via more traditional channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther projects in the works include a pen-and-paper RPG set in the Deathworlders universe, which I aim to publish, and who-knows-what-else.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously these books will require artwork and design details to really bring the setting to life, and so further contributions will help me realize these projects in greater quality, and sooner. I also intend to begin commissioning artwork for merchandising purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, patrons of \"Squishy Xeno\" tier and higher are welcome to join me on Discord, where I\u0027ll be hanging out most days ready to answer questions or just chat. You\u0027ll need to link your Discord profile to your Patreon account by going to your account settings page: The bot will do the rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt Credit and special thanks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEndless thanks to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.artstation.com/artist/spipes\"\u003eSam Pipes\u003c/a\u003e whose excellent artwork graces the top of this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally and most importantly, I must give special mention to my deplorable friend ctwelve. His insight, guidance, encouragement, contributions and support have been beyond invaluable in helping me literally realize a dream, and this small paragraph is in no way sufficient to repay him.\u003cbr\u003e"
