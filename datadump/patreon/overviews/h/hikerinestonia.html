My name is Maiu and I make hiking-related videos on YouTube at my channel called \"Hiker In Estonia\".\u00a0 But you probably already know that ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been making hiking videos on YouTube since 2016 and I absolutely love it! I put a lot of effort into making these videos but unfortunately ad revenue from Google AdSense alone will not cover the costs of making a video, not to talk about investing in new gear or paying the bills in general. Patreon is a great platform for creators to get direct funding from their audience. You can start pledging as low as 2$\u00a0(about 1,6 \u20ac) per month! Think of it as buying me a cup of coffee (or five...) once a month as a token of your appreciation. And don\u0027t think these 2$ will not make a difference because it will! Every cent will count and this funding will make it possible for me to continue putting my time and energy into making all sorts of hiking-related videos in Estonia and abroad.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNOTE TO EUROPEAN UNION RESIDENTS: Please be aware that due to EU-s regulations the VAT tax is added to the sum you select to pledge (read more about it here:\u00a0https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205259549-How-Does-VAT-Work-on-Patreon-). The % added to the pledge depends on the country you live in, but is generally around 20%.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn return\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen pledging at least 2$ you will get access to the Patreon-only feed where I\u0027ll be posting polls, photos and other behind the scenes footage of my hiking life. When you pledge 5$ or more you will be able to join in on \u003cstrong\u003emy monthly live streams\u003c/strong\u003e where I\u0027ll be doing all kinds of random stuff. I am very excited about these live streams so I hope you can join me!\u00a0 If you have the possibility to pledge more than that then I will send you some stickers or patches or personalized postcards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUT THERE\u0027S ONE MORE THING...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to challenge myself and offer you more exciting videos and that\u0027s why I have decided to chase down a new, huge goal -\u00a0I want to go to \u003cstrong\u003eNew Zealand \u003c/strong\u003eand hike the\u003cstrong\u003e 3000km long Te Araroa trail\u003c/strong\u003e that runs thru both of the New Zealand\u0027s islands. The plan is ambitious but I guess that\u0027s why I like it so much! Together with my Patreon family I will be able to support myself on the trail and also I will afford an editor who will be editing my vlog material and upload it straight to YouTube. This way you can follow along the hike when I\u0027m on the trail in (almost) real life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.vucko.php5.cz/grafika/ta-mapa3.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, my hiking friends, let\u0027s go for an epic hike together!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
