    "summary": "First, thank you for checking this Patreon out. My name is Lukas, and I\u0027m currently designing my first full-length game, Hue Adventure. At its core, it\u0027s a 2D platformer. You, as Hue, explore grey worlds, recoloring the environment, enemies and anything else you find as you complete objectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis game means everything to me, and I aim to make it the best game I possibly can. I\u0027m working entirely alone at the moment, which gives me a great deal of freedom but can also be very challenging. Currently, the game is in the very early stages of development. There\u0027s tons to be done, and much of the game hasn\u0027t left the conceptual stage yet. Currently I have an early version of the first world, Primary Plains, completed and available to play here: https://lukas-peace.itch.io/hue-adventure?secret=EztkDUR6uOulCGvSRw16A1Y4g\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really appreciate you taking in interest in Hue Adventure. My goal is to some day see a console release, but at the moment I\u0027m keeping it simple and just designing for PC. By becoming a patron, you\u0027re not only signing up for the rewards, but also giving me added drive and purpose to complete this game. Knowing there are people out there who believe in me and want to see what I can do means so much to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you happen to play the game, please feel free to let me know what you think works and what doesn\u0027t. Every day, both the game and I are growing and improving, and this game is still very much a work in progress. Again, thank you so much for your interest and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Lukas\u003cbr\u003e"
