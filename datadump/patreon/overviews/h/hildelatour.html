To ensure everyone has access to their basic needs. During this transformative social innovation that has already started, a small fee can be asked and this added value can be given to the people, as a basic income. After all, a basic income is not about the money (which has no intrinsic value anyway), it is a means to get access to goods and services. No means testing, no conditions, on an individual basis, periodically paid and high enough to meet one\u0027s basic needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf the concept of machines generating a basic income is new to you, you can use the above links to get a quick view of what we are talking about.

They can build machines that generate a basic income in a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf we build the machines and we program the algorithms for the world of tomorrow, than we can decide what the world of tomorrow will look like.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn short: If you use a decentralised organisation where machines own themselves, the returned value can be distributed as a basic income to people all over the world. MACHINES HAVE NO INTRINSIC MOTIVATION TO EARN MONEY AND ACCUMULATE WEALTH, they can be programmed to distribute the returned value to the people.

I am doing this on a totally voluntary basis now and pay most of my expenses myself. Of course this is not sustainable. Help us to gain momentum.
