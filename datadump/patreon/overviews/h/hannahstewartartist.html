    "summary": "I am a disabled artist struggling to continue creating with bills to pay and few other viable options for work. Due to a complicated cocktail of rare disorders, I lost my last full-time job in December of 2017, and have been working hard to support myself off freelance work ever since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last 2 years, I have been a dedicated and passionate member of the Arizona theatre scene, working with a number of companies and helping to build Aside Theatre Company, but the need to pay my bills and take care of myself has made it incredibly difficult to continue creating. The nature of my disabilities means that I can be completely fine one day, and confined to a wheelchair or my bed the next, with little or no warning. Theatre and writing have given me an outlet for creation that has truly helped me find my place in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work consists primarily of stage directing, devised movement work, dramaturgy, and creative writing. I have a novel in the works, two others that I am currently querying, two series of short stories in progress, a new play that is currently in its first full production process, and a multitude of other projects constantly coming and going. As a director, I stay very busy, and rarely have less than 2 plays on my plate, along with workshops and various monthly productions at Aside Theatre Company, where I am currently the Associate Artistic Director.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheatre and writing have been my safe place since college. I would be lost without them. They are not only an outlet for creativity and expression, but they have given me a family and support system beyond my wildest dreams, and through them I have found my place in the world. The only time I feel like I belong is when I\u0027m actively working on or participating in the arts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had so many people supporting me in my career, and I am so incredibly grateful for every open door I\u0027ve been granted. There are so many people cheering for me to succeed, but for me to continue putting out the level and quality of work I have up to this point, I need help. My goal is to raise enough on Patreon to support myself on a part time job, which would give me the opportunity to focus on my theatrical and writing career without putting my health in danger. To do that right now, I need to bring in about $500 a month outside of my part time job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can accomplish this through Patreon, I will have the ability to create regular content for my patrons, which would really be a dream come true. My hope would be to send first drafts of new written pieces (including my novels in progress), sneak peeks behind the scenes of new plays in the form of photos, videos, commentaries, and the like, interviews with myself and those I\u0027m lucky enough to work with, a monthly series of short stories exclusively for my patrons, early access to blog posts, tickets to upcoming shows, discounted rates on my workshops, and exclusive live streams of various events. If I reach my goal, I will be opening this content to every level of patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for your support. It really, truly means everything to me, and I hope to continue producing the content you have come to expect from me. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about myself or the work I do -- I\u0027m an open book, and I love discussing my work!\u003cbr\u003e"
