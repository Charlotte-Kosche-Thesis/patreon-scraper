    "summary": "Hi folks, this is IM Kostya Kavutskiy and I\u0027m a chess professional--my work involves playing in tournaments, private coaching, writing, and now of course streaming :). I\u0027ve had a lot of help so far in my career, whether it\u0027s from my friends and family or fellow chess players, and for those of you that decide to support this page, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My current goal is to become a Grandmaster, which will take a lot of hard work and effort, but\u003cbr\u003eapart from playing,\u00a0I have a great interest in teaching and training chess players too. This means I work on and develop a lot of instructional chess content, whether its annotated games, exercises, training methods, videos, and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page I\u0027ll be uploading PGNs, videos, and articles that are meant for tournament players looking to improve their chess, as well as chess teachers who need new material for their students. I feel that the instructional value of my content will be well worth it, so please check it out:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnotated Games\u003c/strong\u003e - Recent events, historic classics, as well as many of my own games, all annotated on by yours truly. I strongly believe just going through these games alone can improve one\u0027s understanding of chess, or if you\u0027re a teacher, these games can be used as instructive material for your students.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOpening Analysis\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- My personal analysis of opening lines that catch my interest, as I try to build and deepen my own repertoire. Every week I\u0027ll share what I\u0027m working on, covering recent trends in opening theory (chesspublishing style), and\u00a0I\u0027ll even share some stories of opening preparation gone right (and wrong!).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTournament Videos\u003c/strong\u003e - As I play in serious events, I\u0027ll happily share recorded post-mortems where I go over my games, and I plan on recording \u003cem\u003ereal-time opening preparation\u003c/em\u003e videos, where you\u0027ll see me, working with Chessbase, researching and preparing for my next opponent, going over my lines and doing some pre-game analysis.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patrons will get access to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKostya\u0027s Blueprint\u003c/strong\u003e - This is a comprehensive guide for structured chess improvement that I\u0027ll be uploading in weekly installments. I plan to give my full view on what it takes to become achieve Master level (2200-2300), breaking down each part of the game and how to work at it! I will also include book recommendations, as well as a variety of resources for training.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKostya\u0027s Best Games\u003c/strong\u003e - A database of the most interesting and important games I\u0027ve ever played, which will (hopefully) be added to frequently :)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really believe my content will more than deliver for its value, and when we get enough Patrons to start a Discord channel I think things will really take off. For chess teachers--you guys are welcome to use any of my lessons for your own private students--but of course please don\u0027t upload my analysis publicly for all to see--that would ruin things for everybody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, as a Patron, you have the power to let me know what interests you--I mean, I figure the opening analysis will be (by far) the most popular attraction, but if there\u0027s something else you\u0027re interested in that I can provide, let me know. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this page grows, I hope to invite some of my friends and fellow chess professionals to share some of their work as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading! -Kostya"
