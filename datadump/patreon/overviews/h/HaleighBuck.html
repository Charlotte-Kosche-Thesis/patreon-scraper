    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e I have only been self-publishing my own comics for a few years. Recently, I have been working on a series of collected diary comics called \u0027I Feel Weird\u0027, which focuses on my anxiety and depression. Each issue highlights a month out of an entire year (Nov 2015 - Nov 2016 ) showing my \"healing process\" after an attempt to end my life. Now that the year time span is coming to a close, I will be done writing for this particular comic. I still have A TON of drawing to do for the series. I have just recently started working on the issue #3.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I realized I was at a loss for what was going to come next. I really enjoy the one page journal comics I have been doing. I also really like having a daily or weekly goal to work with. It\u0027s been helping me escalate my progress and art skills tremendously. I have been working my butt off recently, with both comics and illustration work. It has been an absolute blast! However, I want to really REALLY get down to business and take it to the next level. Donating what you can would help me get me closer to being able to work on artwork and writing full time. Every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdated every Monday/ Wednesday/ Friday Starting Wed October 19th.\u003cbr\u003eExclusive just for Patreon comics will be updated on Sundays!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking some time to check this out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease enjoy this little preview of some past work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/015f1630d2e3a92aa30ad18ad9b81484/tumblr_o111h9byt91se4vcgo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA page from I Feel Weird #2!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/comicsbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/I-Feel-Weird-2-1.jpg?resize=306%2C453\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
