Video courtesy of Jack Dunham \u0026amp; BVU, Bristol, Virginia.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAbout\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/humansofcentralappalachia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHumans of Central Appalachia\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Malcolm J. Wilson. I\nam passionate about my origins and these mountains I call home. I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/humansofcentralappalachia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHumans of Central Appalachia\u003c/a\u003e (HOCA) on Facebook in June 2015, inspired by the Humans Of New York (HONY) project. In New\nYork City, the pace is fast and the quotes on HONY are short\u2026 It\u2019s the culture.\nIn Appalachia (Apple-At-Cha) we live a slower paced life. We are natural\nstorytellers, so the stories are mostly longer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFiercely Appalachian-Proud, I\nhave always viewed it as an honor and a responsibility to document the people\nand the stories I have had the privilege of collecting throughout the course of\nthe four decades I have spent as a photojournalist and documentarian in the\nregion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHumans of Central Appalachia\nfocuses on the people and stories of Eastern Kentucky, Northeast Tennessee,\nSouthwest Virginia, Western North Carolina and West Virginia. In addition to\nthis Facebook page, we have launched a story searchable website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.humansofcentralappalachia.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.humansofcentralappalachia.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn the website, visitors have\naccess to all of the HOCA stories, a number of galleries, as well as being\nprivy to tidbits not available on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/humansofcentralappalachia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e, such as a gallery of color\nphotos and forthcoming audio clips from the actual interviews. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe story telling process\ninvolves traveling the region, attending festivals, car shows, family reunions,\nevents, gatherings and conducting impromptu on the street interviews with a\ncontinual parade of interesting Appalachians who are excited to be asked to\nshare their story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are passionate about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/humansofcentralappalachia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHumans of Central Appalachia\u003c/a\u003e and the stories yet to be told, because, as Appalachians, we share a collective voice and\nmessage that needs to be heard. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t do that with just wishful thinking and positive comments. In order to grow this project, we can\u2019t continue to personally financially subsidize the travel, time and equipment necessary. We have invested significant amounts of funding in cameras, lenses, computers, recording equipment, travel, food, lodging and admission fees in the course of sharing our stories\u2026sometimes actually sleeping in the back of our vehicle if the travel distances are far. There were particular months in 2015 we directly spent $2,000 or more to bring these stories to the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/humansofcentralappalachia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and internet communities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTogether, we can build this\ncommunity into something even more important, insightful and significant to the preservation\nof the Appalachian culture. We sincerely appreciate your support, and your\nwillingness to share our Appalachian stories. There is much to celebrate and be\nproud of in our Appalachian culture\u2026creativity, steely determination and\npassion. We invite you to help us share these things with a global audience via your financial support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShow your support by giving a\nlittle each month so that we may not only continue, but make HOCA flourish!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow find a sampling of photographs chosen from the nearly three hundred folks already featured in this project:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a73541115e0984d1d501e/569a73c905f8e2b24d9ee9b4/1452962768568/_8017852W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 326px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a73541115e0984d1d501e/569a73da1115e0984d1d52ef/1452962783881/_9133657W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 326px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a7707cbced647da311c0a/569a77ef9cadb6436a7e32c2/1452963826597/_DSF2111W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 324px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a73541115e0984d1d501e/569a73cf76d99c4f3912844b/1452962773385/_8030043+W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 326px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a7707cbced647da311c0a/569a77c41a520349a506dca4/1452963787471/_8042550W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 326px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a7707cbced647da311c0a/569a77d31a520349a506dcf5/1452963799473/_8221474W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 327px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a7b831a520349a506ef35/569a7bc35dc6de52422b92e2/1452964809534/_8017683W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 326px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56980fdcdf40f306caded45b/569a73541115e0984d1d501e/569a73e11115e0984d1d532c/1452962790712/_B201067W.jpg?format=1500w\" style=\"width: 323px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Wilson:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally from Cumberland, Kentucky in Harlan County, I am a photographer, writer, journalist, documentarian, graphic designer, painter, artist and jack-of-other-trades, living in the mountains of Bristol, Tennessee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated from Cumberland High School in Cumberland, Kentucky. In the early 1980s I left the mountains to attend Northern Kentucky University majoring in Fine Arts (Photography) and minoring in journalism. I worked for several years as a photojournalist for the Cincinnati/Kentucky Post. My last years in Cincinnati were spent in commercial photography and design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent eighteen years in Cincinnati documenting the plight of those urban Appalachians who had to leave the mountains to find work. I\u2019ve spent a large part of my career as a journalist, working for small papers in eastern Kentucky and metropolitan papers in the Cincinnati area. I have also worked as a stringer for United Press International (UPI) and the Associated Press (AP) during my career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI continue as an advertising/marketing consultant, graphic designer and photographer in Bristol, TN. I teach photography classes and hold digital photography workshops throughout the Appalachian southeast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Appalachian Archives at Southeast Community and Technical College houses nearly a quarter of a million of my negatives from my nearly forty years of documenting our Appalachian story. I have documented the depths of sorrow, the height of jubilation and the routine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June, 2015 I launched the Facebook page, Humans of Central Appalachia (HOCA) inspired by the critically acclaimed \u201cHumans of New York (HONY). HOCA is, based on percentages, the fastest growing \u201cHumans of\u2026\u201d page on Facebook. We also just launched a new website for the project.

We have a team of twenty volunteers, many of whom I haven\u0027t personally met that believe so much in the project that they have generously offered their free time to transcribe the hours upon hours of audio interviews. Our volunteers, which we graciously refer to as \"Team HOCA\" reside everywhere from New York City to Georgia. Our largest group of volunteers reside in the heart of Central Appalachia.

There is a tremendous amount of behind the scenes work required to bring the stories to you beyond the initial interview and photography. Photos have to downloaded, edited, processed and sized. The audio files must be downloaded then uploaded to the volunteers for transcription. The finished transcriptions are then edited for flow and content. Once this is complete stories have to be uploaded to all the social media accounts including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Tumbler as well as our new searchable website. On top of all that, there is the constant communication and scheduling with folks throughout the Central Appalachian region as well as the constant social media maintenance required to keep things running smoothly.
