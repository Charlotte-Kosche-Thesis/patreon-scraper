Brandon here. You may know me as half of Highly Unreasonable, \"your go-to podcast where we talk about whatever you send our way\"! Highly Unreasonable is a project that Adi and I started in order to hang out more. It then became a healthy obsession and now is a pet project of ours that we enjoy doing more and more and more as each day passes. The formula is simple: You send us stuff, we talk about it, you laugh, repeat.But what is Highly Unreasonable really? Sure it\u0027s the best effing comedy podcast on the internet, but it\u0027s also a service we provide to all Americans. What service is that, you ask? Here\u0027s a list, in no particular order:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Feeling bad about yourself? Listen to us floundering with day to day issues and you\u0027ll feel better.\u003cbr\u003e2. Feel like you\u0027re losing your mind? Listen to us, and the amount of mental stress that Adi puts on me will make you feel like you\u0027re on a mental vacation.\u003cbr\u003e3. Do you think you consider things from a unique or weird perspective? Listen to us and you\u0027ll realize...you\u0027re not alone.\u003cbr\u003e4. Ever wonder why we don\u0027t have chocolate faucets? Or do you do a lot of driving? You\u0027re one of us, brothers and sisters!\u003cbr\u003e5. Do you take the elevator to go up one floor? STOP LISTENING TO OUR PODCAST AND DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS YOU HUMAN TRASH MONSTER!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Adi asked me about starting a Patreon, I assumed he meant we were investing in a farm for magical horses. Turns out it is a \"crowd-funding\" site that allows us to be more actively engaged with our incredible listeners. Here\u0027s how it works. You like our show? Have a little spare change burning a hole in your Old Navy jeans? Contribute to the Highly Unreasonable Patreon. You\u0027ll help us cover the operating costs of doing the show, and you\u0027ll get extra content and opportunities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, contributing to the Patreon will help us grow the podcast, market the show, grow the listener base, and taker over the world! Don\u0027t you want to be a part of that? Well come on in. The water is warm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re still going to do the same ole show, coming to you every Monday. Because we love it, and we love you. If you\u0027re so inclined to contribute to the Patreon...who knows...maybe I\u0027ll get up in my attic and get the damn t-shirts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalk to you Monday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrandon McCoy (The Lebron James of Ping Pong)\u003cbr\u003e"
