    "summary": "I created the Hike Oregon website because I was unable to find reliable information about hikes in Oregon. I would find sources with different mileage, directions to the trailheads were unclear, or sometimes the trailhead wasn\u0027t even there anymore, no photos, and limited or no trail descriptions. I know from personal experience, that when people don\u0027t have much information about the trail, they are less likely to go on the adventure because the unknown can be scary. \u003cbr\u003eSo in August 2014 Hike Oregon was born. I document every hike with detailed directions to the trailhead, lots of photos so hikers know what to expect, very detailed trail descriptions with accurate mileage and elevation gain, as well information about permits needed and dog/other animal accessibility.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePutting all of this information together and onto the website takes many hours of hard work. Hike Oregon also has a YouTube channel where I video document each hike I go on for a more personal look at the trails, and I also make educational videos about gear, reviews and other hiking tips and tricks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn order to support myself I work full-time at an office job, however this leaves me little time to create content for Hike Oregon. Most weeks I barely have enough time to edit the two videos for YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e---\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; It is my goal to be able to provide you with more hikes on the website (preferably 2 new hikes a month), more gear reviews both on the website and on YouTube, and I would like to be able to travel the state of Oregon more so that I can provide readers with hikes across the entire state instead of just in the Cascades and Coast region.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution will help me to facilitate the continuation of Hike Oregon!\u003cbr\u003e"
