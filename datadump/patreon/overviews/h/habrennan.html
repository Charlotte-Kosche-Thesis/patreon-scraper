Brennan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst of all, I would just like to thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read this, to get to know this author, to get to know their story, and eventually, supporting their ambitions and dreams. The world needs a few more dreamers, and it\u0027s people like you who really make sure those dreamers can find the light and take flight. Producing content through Patreon is a group effort, and without patrons like yourself, there would be no support. So thank you, thank you, for becoming part of my support group!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has always been my dream to be an author. I\u0027ve always craved the late nights with coffee, where my eyes burn from staring at a screen for so long, but my fingers are still typing away the magical tapestry that is story telling. I have always found myself having a natural affinity to writing and I am very much looking forward to the adventure of harnessing my craft. I have put it on hold for so long that I do believe that this last year a part of me has really been missing, a part of me that has been silenced for quite some time. However, being an adult and having responsibilities\u00a0 means putting your hobbies aside so that you can take care of the things that are important. For too long I have allowed the \"important things,\" to be the driving factor in my decisions, but no longer will be I be taking the short path through life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in, my darling patrons. I need your help\u00a0 funding this new project because I can assure it you it is worth the investment.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am working on a new novel that is guaranteed to enthrall of all your senses, leaving you licking your lips, craving more, more, more! as you finger through the pages. It\u0027s a story so spellbound you will reach the end wondering if you actually read a work of fiction, or if you didn\u0027t actually just live that characters life in book form. It\u0027ll leave you wondering if you ever really knew anything at all, as if you had just been told your entire life was lie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to enchant you with words and mystify your mind with the endless boundaries that I break through with my characters. I want to make you fall in love with every single character that I put down on paper, only to make you hate them, and rethink every perception you ever had of this fictional person, leaving yourself to question whether you really knew them at all, or if they had just been a beast in disguise this whole time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to give you a peek into someone else\u0027s tragic life behind closed doors, to drag out a strangers skeletons, and to scare you with other peoples monsters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn order to really get this project going I will need support from people like you, who believe that there is still magic in the world that can be found in all art forms. People who know that story telling and works of fiction are just a few ways that people escape the mundane of their lives and that, without our artists, our world would be a bleak, and sad place.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your help I will be able to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFurther pursue my learning adventures in creative writing to continue to keep polishing my craft, so that I am always growing as an artist and producing quality content worth reading, and sharing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStop looking for meaningless part time work in retail that will not leave me feeling fulfilled and satisfied with what I\u0027m doing with my life. After spending four years to obtain a Bachelors degree, working my tail off to graduate with a 4.0, and cringing through every single sacrifice I made in the name of my college education, it\u0027s time to take my life back and use this artistically inclined brain for the power of good. (Or evil... depending on how you feel about whatever character I\u0027m currently torturing...)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpend more time with my kids, not being stressed out about time that I\u0027m spending away from them, all while working the job that I love. Granted, its everyone\u0027s dream to be famous, but that isn\u0027t my end goal. I am honestly looking to produce quality work that people love to read, even if that means that only three people want to read it. I would cherish those three people the same as I would cherish three thousand. An artist is worth much less when they don\u0027t have fans who truly love their work. I am humbled by every single one of you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase new equipment and computer storage space that way I will always have a working computer to post public stories and little bits from my books. Now that I\u0027m doing what I love for my full time job I can\u0027t wait to keep coming up with story ideas and giving you the quality, spine tingling tales of horror you\u0027ve been waiting for!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBrand myself by producing my own written words, audio books, and photography for book covers and character sheets. With your support I will be able to be the sole artist who works on my content that way you can verify each time that the work I do is authentic to myself, my brand, and my style.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd, as always, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for your time,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eyour contributions,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eand your efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eWithout kind, compassionate people like you, there are no people like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/2ynp7v7.png\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
