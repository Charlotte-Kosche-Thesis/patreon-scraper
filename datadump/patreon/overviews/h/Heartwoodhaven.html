    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHeartwood Haven Vegan Animal Sanctuary 501(c)(3)\u00a0began when its co-founders saw a post on their local vegan page seeking homes for roosters rescued from cockfighting. Although we didn\u2019t have any experience with chickens we volunteered to take one into our home to prevent him from being euthanized. We named him Porter.   Once Porter arrived, we were a little apprehensive but he immediately won us over with his warm personality and affection for humans. We began to research information about roosters and found that many are dumped, abandoned, and euthanized every year. We knew we had to do something to provide these amazing animals with a home while searching for their forever home. Adoptions allow us to save more animals and it\u0027s something that we didn\u0027t think we\u0027d do when we first started. However, once we learned just how many animals are in need it seemed irresponsible to just provide for a few while letting the rest suffer.\u003cbr\u003eAlthough Heartwood Haven began with one rooster we have since grown to care for all species of animals including goats, cats, dogs, and pigs. Pigs are especially close to our hearts as we\u0027ve learned more about their unfortunate treatment in this world. Our dream is to eventually move the sanctuary to a place that has copious acres of land that will allow us to\u00a0care for all of our animal friends in need. We\u0027d like to thank you for joining the Heartwood Haven team and supporting our mission here. Without you and without help from the community we would not be able to do this. You are as much apart of Heartwood Haven as we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
