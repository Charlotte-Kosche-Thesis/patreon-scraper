They lived in troubled times \u2013 sometimes it seemed \nlike the magic had all run out of the world and all that was left was \ndistraction and strife. So they decided to make something amazing, a \ndevice for spreading beauty and  kindling imaginations, a spectacular \ncreation to reignite old enchantments and bring wonder back into the greying world. And so, they created \n\u003cstrong\u003e\nHEDGESPOKEN\u003c/strong\u003e...

We were stunned by the generosity of our supporters - it seemed that many of you got the idea deeply and completely and wanted more of this kind of magic in the world just as much as we did, and were prepared to give us money to make it happen. Thank you - you know how much it meant to us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://hedgespoken.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/unspecified.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis summer, among other places, we\u0027ve taken the truck and our stories to the \n\u003cstrong\u003eGreen Gathering\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eOff Grid\u003c/strong\u003e festival, \u003cstrong\u003eGreen Earth Awakening\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eBase Camp\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eBeautiful Days\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003eHedge-u-cation\u003c/strong\u003e camp.

We\u0027ve been developing our first major puppet theatre extravaganza this year and applied for Arts Council funding for it, but the climate for liminal arts isn\u0027t a good one and our first bid has been turned down - we need to raise funds independently to ensure that these new shows get developed and that everyone involved is fairly sustained.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://hedgespoken.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/14556710_10154657167645774_4352860953998886748_o.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are many, many costs behind the scenes, too - a 1966 truck needs a lot of upkeep, and the petrol (yes, petrol) bills are painful and spare tyres come in at about \u00a3250 each, but we also need to invest in more kit to develop what we\u0027re doing and allow for greater possibilities of wonder and mischief - things such as:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ean \u003cstrong\u003eaudience shelter\u003c/strong\u003e to attach to the side of the truck, over the stage (think of a marquee, but with our truck and stage as one wall!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eheating \u003c/strong\u003efor this shelter, so that we can continue to perform during the bleaker months\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea \u003cstrong\u003ecaravan\u003c/strong\u003e to serve as an office, library and store\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea \u003cstrong\u003esupport vehicle\u003c/strong\u003e to carry our shelter and other kit and cast members for big shows, as well as to pull the caravan\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eall the appropriate \u003cstrong\u003echecks\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ecertificates\u003c/strong\u003e as we move into the arena of taking the truck into schools and the like...\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea \u003cstrong\u003emighty samovar\u003c/strong\u003e Russian tea urn from which to refresh our audience\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are but a few of them and there will be more costs along the way that we can\u0027t even imagine yet.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://hedgespoken.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/hedgespoken-gallery-26.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWe also want to expand what we do.

We\u0027d like to include more people in this project, so that we can offer not just what we already do, but a whole array of dizzying and dazzling circus and fair-like wonders.
