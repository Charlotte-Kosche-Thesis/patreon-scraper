We have fun plans to make the show better as well because we can do so much more by bringing on guests, doing specials, etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel good about what this show brings to you please consider pitching in. If everybody who watches the show gave a nickel a show, (a buck a month) we would be thrilled. If some can give 25 cents a show, or $5 a month we could really do amazing things. If its worth more to you...awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut please understand, if at this time you can\u0027t afford to support the show...all good. \u00a0No worries. \u00a0We aren\u0027t stopping the show tomorrow or next week or next month even. \u00a0And don\u0027t worry, our daily show will stay free to view in my blog and on youtube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford money at this time you can still help us by continuing to do what you all do best: Keep telling other people about the show, retweeting the show, emailing us ideas, or just simply clicking and subscribing to our youtube channel. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps more than you know.\u00a0Thanks for listening and remember, without the buzz it\u0027s just hockey!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
