Happy Healthy Vegan is the first vidcast the duo have hosted together, and to tell the truth, it\u0027s kinda taken over their lives! The duo love spreading the whole food plant based diet message to folks looking to increase their health and happiness, lose weight, and look and feel younger, and they\u0027ve been overwhelmed by the response to their show over the past 2 years.",
