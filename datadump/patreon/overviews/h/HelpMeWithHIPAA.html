    "summary": "Our podcast was an idea spawned by David Sims of HIPAA for MSPs in 2013. \u00a0David tried to convinced Donna Grindle of Kardon Compliance to start recording some conversations and putting them out for others to hear in a podcast. \u00a0Eventually, Donna gave in and Help Me With HIPAA launched in May 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been through a lot of trial and error figuring out what equipment works best, how to publish and promote podcasts, and most of all how to continue to make content that is relevant and useful. \u00a0Our original goal to keep humor in the mix has probably been the easiest for us. \u00a0We make ourselves laugh, anyway! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA badge of honor for us as podcasters is to say we have never skipped a single Friday morning without publishing something for over 2 years now. \u00a0There were a couple of blooper shows and one replay during the holidays. \u00a0Otherwise, there has been new content published every single week since we launched. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the weekly process that is required to produce\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://helpmewithhipaa.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Help Me With HIPAA\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0(Please ignore the programmer\u0027s humor - Donna just had to have it in here.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edo {\u003c/strong\u003eEach week Donna is scrolling through information and making outlines for shows to record. \u00a0David is tasked with keeping the website up and running plus managing our sound editor, Bojan. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Friday morning we have an appointment to record an episode. \u00a0Sometimes, we have to add in days or double up to keep the episodes in the hopper. \u00a0It usually takes at least a couple of hours per episode just to record. \u00a0When we finish recording an episode, we drop off a bunch of copies of our recorded conversations for editing by Bojan.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBojan takes all of our copies and creates the episodes you hear that sound so smooth and professionally done (because he is a professional!). \u00a0He also has the job of selecting those opening segments for each episode. \u00a0We can always tell how much energy we had while recording based on the number of options he gives us to use for the open. \u00a0If it is 2 then we were flat. \u00a0If we get 6 it was a pretty good episode for us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonna goes through the options and selects an episode to publish each week. \u00a0It sometimes requires input from others but only because there are so many options. \u00a0Once an episode is selected, it is uploaded to Libsyn, our hosting service. \u00a0The mp3 file is prepared for release and set up for listing in iTunes and other podcast feeds. \u00a0There is also a Libsyn mini-webpage published at Libsyn. \u00a0Libsyn also handles publishing to our Help Me With HIPAA apps in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/help-me-with-hipaa/id1272917865\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Apple Store\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0and \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.wizzard.android.hippa\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Google Play Store\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe post on our Wordpress site is created with the summary, show notes, links, and whatever else we plan to include.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything is scheduled for release early Friday morning. \u00a0Sometimes it is getting done at 11 amFriday morning but it gets done! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe still have to set up our social media posting services to send out our social media blasts for our followers. \u00a0MailChimp sends out our weekly email to subscribers on Friday\u0027s too. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, we prepare to record another episode! \u003cstrong\u003e} while ($production == \"ON\")\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat seems like a lot of work when it is all written down. \u00a0Especially, when you consider this is a side project that has never made any money on it\u0027s own. \u00a0The fact that we can do all of that every week and be in three different locations (Bojan is in Split, Croatia, by the way) is a testament to the value of today\u0027s technology and the capabilities it provides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides our time each week there are \"hard costs\" associated with the production. \u00a0We pay for our web and podcast hosting and app services, Bojan also likes us to pay him, and we pay for other things like podcast publishing tools and social media management services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat all starts to add up which is why we appreciate your support for our podcast here on Patreon. \u00a0Our little side project has grown up now and needs to pay it\u0027s own rent!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting us and thanks for listening to Help Me With HIPAA!"
