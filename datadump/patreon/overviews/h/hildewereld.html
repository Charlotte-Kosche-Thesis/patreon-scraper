    "summary": "Dear Patrons or should I call you friends? I should call you friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for all the support over the years. You\u0027ve been a huge help in keeping my content alive and I\u0027m forever grateful.\u003cbr\u003eYou might know by now that, even though your help is so, so appreciated, Patreon has been a big stressfactor in my life. I feel bad for not being able to make the incentives, give good rewards and just make this worth it for all of you guys. I know most of you don\u0027t care about the rewards and that means the world to me, so here\u0027s the dealio.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to get rid of all the rewards on my Patreon. It\u0027ll continue to exist but will be inactive (as it already was). Whomever of you crazy people still wants to keep supporting me is welcome to. I\u0027ve had quite a few people contact me like HEY THERE WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOU AND WE DONT CARE ABOUT THESE DUMB REWARDS and just so you know, I wept a little. You guys are absolutely amazing.\u003cbr\u003eSo. If you want to stay a Patron, you can. If you don\u0027t, you can cancel. There\u0027s no way I\u0027d hold it against anyone ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support me in other ways, here\u0027s ways you can do so:\u003cbr\u003e- Watch my videos! Leave comments and like them! Youtube is a mess and not a source of income for me, so helping my channel grow will be an insane help. Throw out those tweets, tell your friends, I don\u0027t know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Buy me a coffee! Wait what? I don\u0027t even like coffee. Here\u0027s a tiny website that makes it possible to send me \u0027tips\u0027. The biggest issue with patreon for me was the paying monthly, here you can just do it whenever you feel like it! \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/hildewereld\"\u003ehttps://ko-fi.com/hildewereld\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Amazon wishlist! On this list I\u0027ll try to only add items that\u0027ll help my channel, like Pok\u00e9mon cards (ahem) and equipment.  \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.eu/4NdUI2c\"\u003ehttp://amzn.eu/4NdUI2c\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- While I\u0027m at it, I also have a wishlist for crap I want but isn\u0027t useful in any way.  \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.eu/bwOyzUZ\"\u003ehttp://amzn.eu/bwOyzUZ\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight, I think that sums it up? I don\u0027t know. Please know I\u0027m so grateful for all of you guys. You are the best and I love you. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
