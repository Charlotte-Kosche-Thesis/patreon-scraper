I started drawing ever since I was a kid, it just felt right, I loved it from the start, I had my struggles but every artist does. I started drawing furries about 4 years ago, and ever I since I did well I couldnt stop, there was a certain charm to doing it, it was magnetizing and well here I am now. I love meeting new people, I love talking and chatting with my friends and I also love when there\u0027s opportunities to spread my art across the globe. I like writing, I like anime and cartoons, I like music and love playing my ocarina, I really really enjoy videogames and series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Can I Offer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI can offer as much as I can do, in here you\u0027ll most likely find a vast majority of digital artwork with a preference for anthropomorphic animals, mostly I draw in the japanese kemono artstyle (anime or manga style if you want to call it that way) which consists in bara art. I also can offer fan art of popular series and whatever the fandom seeks nowadays I can mostly offer a lot of that. Im pretty sure everybody wants to see free art but in supporting me, you are not only supporting me economically, but also help motivate me to keep improving and never stop. I am mostly focused on drawing oc\u0027s but that will quickly shift into fan art as quickly as I get requests for it. Probably in the future I can make a comic as well so stay tuned!\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWith your support you can help me achieve these several goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSexy pinups of characters chosen by you!
