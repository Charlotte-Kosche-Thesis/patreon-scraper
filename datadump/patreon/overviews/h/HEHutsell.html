It\u0027s difficult to commit as much time as is required to pull this off, while dispersing much of my time elsewhere to make ends meet, and still travel to promote my work. I have self-published 14 books already, but I\u0027m still not widely known, so at the advice of many, I am going to just keep writing and writing and writing, attending events and traveling to bookstores for signings. At least, that is the plan. I\u0027ve known that I wanted to do this since I was 11 years old (30 years ago), and it is my greatest passion--I love every moment of it, even the parts that are tedious. I lovingly refer to my books as my \u0027babies\u0027. They are all different, they all require different amounts of attention, but the same amount of love. I have also recently come to realize a greater happiness through my passion for writing, and I want to fuel that in others. I want people to see that I have realized my dream and am making it work--and so can they."

I recall in many of my younger\nyears, wanting to run away by hopping a circus train, if only to cure myself of\nacrophobia, by becoming a star tightrope walker.

Since then, it comes and goes,\nthough I am pleased to say it is more in the coming\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am pretty much\nthe prisoner of my many muses. When I\u2019m asked what genre I write about, I have\nto give credit where it\u2019s due and say that my muses make that call. \u003cem\u003eRomantic\nhorror, absurdist fiction, surrealist fiction, Steampunk mystery, futuristic\ncautionary tales, fairytales gone awry, Vampyres, Lycans, supper club/mafia\nshenanigans-\u003c/em\u003e-I do them all. It is my hope that I never fall into any one\ncategory; that when my books someday hit the stores, there will be meetings and\ndebates on where my books are to be listed, until someone finally pipes up and\nsays \u201c\u003cem\u003eThey belong Everywhere\u003c/em\u003e.\u201d I don\u2019t want to write to thrill one\nparticular audience.
