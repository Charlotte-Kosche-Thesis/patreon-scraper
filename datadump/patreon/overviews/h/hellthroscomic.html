It is an ongoing, science fiction and fantasy comic with anthropomorphic characters, alien creatures and yes, there are some humans in it. It focuses on the villains of their universe with the good guys popping in and out to do justice. Why focus on the bad guys? Because they are more fun! Not only that, I just feel there are too many stories where the good guys win. Why not let the bad guys have their fun and see what their daily lives are like? As bad guys are there will be adult content which is why my page is marked as adult.\u003cbr\u003eIt started out as a fun thing to do when we were bored writing back and forth in this universe that we had invented as kids. As we have grown older, more educated and taking the brave steps of showing this to the public; we have edited the universe and put down laws for it. The script itself, even with a thousand pages of content is getting reworked and edited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is in it for the contributor?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a few things planned for you as a contributor! Want your own character to be spotted in the background in a certain part of the universe? I will let you have that if you provide me a reference sheet of your character and contribute $25/month. With this, I\u0027ll also procure a reference sheet of your character in costume to fit in where their hang out in the universe is. Though, beware. If you stop contributing, your character stops getting drawn. Also for people contributing $10/month you\u0027ll be receiving a monthly print of characters in the comic!"

     "about": "Hello! My name is Sally Shoemaker, pen name is Solidos. I am a \"I\u0027ll do what I have to do to pay the bills\" kind of person and that has unfortunately put my artistic skills on the back burner. With that said, I\u0027ll be doing my best to get back to where I was and continue to grow as an artist. I have gone to art school and had dropped out during my last year due to various reasons, I won\u0027t list them here but I will say art school is one of my biggest financial regrets and I wish I had gone to community college instead to get the same classes. I do not regret the connections and friends that I have made while I had attended art school. By internet standards, I am old and decrepit for an artist, though my wild imagination keeps me up at night. I am the mythical \"native\" of Arizona, born, raised and still living in. Unfortunately due to red tape I cannot talk about my current occupation and will never be able to talk about it once I leave. I don\u0027t \u003cem\u003emind\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0working at my current place of work, people are great, the pay is okay and the hours help keep the lights on and I\u0027m making progress on paying off my debts without needing to ask anyone for help. I just feel unfulfilled there and I have uncontrollable authority issues, I don\u0027t exactly fit well with the mesh. So here I am creating a patreon for a hair brained idea that I hope works out. If not, it will be some extra pocket change to help pay off debts faster.\u003cbr\u003eMy partner in crime is Heidi Schmitz, co writer and life long best friend. We\u0027ve been friends for 20 years now and have our bumps in the road, separated at times, swallowed our pride and got back together. Though now we can\u0027t see each other as much because of life and our relationships with our significant others; we do stay in touch though.\u003cbr\u003e",
