    "summary": "Hey everyone! I made a patreon page for all of you wonderful fans of my particular spectrum of pony fan art... And thank you all so much for your feedback and appreciation. With this Patreon account you can help make it easier for me to continue my existence, and create more dank, fetish-intense clop art for all your perverted needs. You may also get something great out of it personally made to your liking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why ascend to this level? Well, for starters, the horse cartoon fandom is 5 years old... 5.... YEARS... and contains MILLIONS of pieces of fan art by various popular talented artists, however, for the simple sake of finding the broadest, widest popularity and success, the most popular artists always seem to stay safely in a spectrum of anthropomorphized pony pinup girls, with the same variant series of clothed, nude and futa edits, which there\u0027s nothing wrong with, but it becomes all you see over and over on every \"leader board\" at every pony art site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIsn\u0027t it time we got some high-quality, semi-professional looking art of something a little more hardcore? I mean, come on, people, It\u0027s 2016, or 105 in North Korea! It\u0027s time to get wierd! It\u0027s time to get kinky! It\u0027s time to freak out the normies! It\u0027s time to shave the squirrels and get out the mayonnaise! It\u0027s time--okay I\u0027m done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting and please join if you\u0027d like to see more and help me survive and continue making depraved pony art!"
