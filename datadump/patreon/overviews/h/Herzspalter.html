    "summary": "Originally only made to prove a point, these little comics are more or less accurate summaries of the 1984 original Transformers cartoon by Hasbro. They\u0027re both a celebration of the series as well as a little guide for those who haven\u0027t watched the show, those who watched and didn\u0027t believe it, and those who watched and embraced the weirdness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile this only started off as a joke and then turned into the quite ridiculous quest to recap every single G1 episode ever made, I sadly can\u0027t work on the comics very often at the moment. I have by now thankfully found a part-time job to pay my rent and \"only\" \u00a0have to earn additional money for food etc. So while I will continue this little series either way, I could work on it more often if I can earn a little bit with it. Each comic, despite having very simple art, takes multiple days of work (writing, layout, outlining, coloring etc) and I am currently not in a position where I can just do that every other week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my G1 comics and would like to support me a bit financially, I would be very grateful! If it so happens that this does get a couple of patrons, I will try to make at least one Recap per month instead of every 5 or 6 months. Thank you very much for your attention! I wish you the Best!"
