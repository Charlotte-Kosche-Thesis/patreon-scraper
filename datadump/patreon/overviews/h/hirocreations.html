    "summary": "\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCosplay Armor and Prop 3d Models and tutorials that are accessible to all! \u003c/h1\u003e\n3d printing has been one of the most exciting and best things to happen to cosplay since Worbla. As it has allowed more cosplayers to make the props exactly the way want it to with crisp lines and details without the high costs of mold making and resin casting. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course the bottleneck is the STL files themselves, most cosplay printers either have to rely on the 3d model repositories which might not have the models they need or pay very high prices to commission or buy the files. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs an early adopter of cosplay 3d printing I faced many of these pain points and I\u0027m launching this patreon as a way to hopefully make getting high demand cosplay prop and armor 3d models easier and more accessible to people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWho Am I? \u003c/h1\u003e\nMy name is Yasu Tano, I\u0027m an award winning cosplayer and prop builder who specializes in using 3d printing to be on the cutting edge of costume prop and armor fabrication. You might know me from some of my more recent builds that have been making the rounds on Reddit and Instagram lately such as:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFull scale 3d printed T-60 Armor\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0XvHCeU.jpg\" style=\"width: 293px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n3d Printed Genji Armor\n3d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mo349Wc.jpg\" style=\"width: 267px;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPrinted Lannister Armor from Game of Thrones\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ggK7UyT.jpg\" style=\"width: 273px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of these builds have gone on to be featured in large media publications like Huffington Post, LA Weekly, Inverse, Chicago Tribune, and many more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhy me? (What your money funds)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be honest and straightforward I\u0027m doing well enough from various projects and things I\u0027m involved in that I don\u0027t need this money to live, pay bills, or even fund new cosplay builds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be asking \"then why are you launching a Patreon then Yasu?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I\u0027m really getting on board with the idea of documenting as much of my builds as possible in order to create as much transparency and ultimately level the playing field for both new and experienced cosplayers alike. As I see lots of information get jealously hoarded or sold at high numbers. That hurts us as a community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m aiming to disrupt that by amping up the amount of content and videos I put out. I currently have 2x 1 TB disks pretty much loaded with raw video, livestream captures, and timelapse footage from my last few builds waiting to be edited into cohesive videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately I don\u0027t have the time to keep up with my crazy build paces AND edit produce video. So I\u0027m launching this Patreon to help allow me to fund hiring a part time (and eventually full time) video person to handle editing and publishing of my videos and get them out there on youtube free for anyone to see.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNone of my videos/tutorial content will ever be 100% locked behind paywalls of Patreon, and people viewing my videos are not under any obligation to contribute as I\u0027m going to operate this patreon like a tip jar. Contributing will help me accelerate and increase the number of videos, blog posts and other clever pieces of content faster (as I can afford more help/equipment to facilitate that).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said I\u0027m offering up the STL files and armor/sewing templates, and the ability to vote on what I design/create next as semi-exclusive incentive for helping contribute to my vision to disrupt cosplay content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Tiers \u003c/h1\u003e\nFor a long while I held off on launching a patreon as I did not want to end up creating something that looked like the rest of the patreons or be super expensive to to support.\nWhat I have ended up doing is creating 3 simple, super accessible tiers that I hope provides a ton of value.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTier I: A seat at the table\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes you read that right, right off the bat for contributing $1 (or more) you get the STL of the month for your personal use (I email the files after your payment clears).\nYou also get access to Patreon exclusive videos/blog posts/BOMs (build of materials for complicated builds).\nAnd you get access to any of the milestone bonus perks that I offer when they\u0027re reached.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTier II: The Voter\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou get all the benefits of Tier I, but you also get to vote on what the file of the month should be, I\u0027ll hold a series of polls to determine fandom, character, specific prop.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTier III: All Access:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYou get all the benefits of the first two tiers plus:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIs the current file of the month not tickling your fancy?

From the start, I wanted this Patreon to be focused on getting as many folks on board. So given I wanted to incentivize more participation I added the best perks to the milestone goals so everyone could benefit from them, regardless of what tier they are in. This could range from unlocking monthly raw print giveaways to all tiers getting bonus files each month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reward tiers are as follows:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$100 - Unlock Dedicated Fallout Bonus File of the Month (for a total of 2 file sets per month)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$200 - Unlock Dedicated Overwatch Bonus File of the Month (for a total of 3 file sets per month)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$500 - Unlock Bonus File (total of 4 files per month)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$750 - Unlock Bonus File (total of 5 files per month)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$1000 - Unlock Bonus File (total of 6 files per month)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$1250 - Unlock second dedicated Fallout Bonus File of the Month (for a total of 7 Files)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$1500 - Unlock second dedicated Overwatch Bonus File of the Month (for a total of 8 Files)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$1750 - Unlock Bonus File (total of 9 files per month)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n$2000 - Unlock Bonus File (total of 10 files per month)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThe Fine Print\u003c/h1\u003eAll my models are being offered for non-commercial, personal use.
