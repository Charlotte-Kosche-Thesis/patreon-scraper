I don\u0027t need you to buy me a vehicle so I can not travel around in it, I don\u0027t need to fix a computer or a phone.... Now that I have probably offended a few people including friends, fans, and even customers... \u00a0Lets get serious... I guess what I\u0027m getting at is this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a website \u003ca href=\"http://juggalonews.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://juggalonews.net\u003c/a\u003e that has a monthly cost, I do photography which also has a monthly cost \u003ca href=\"http://hazin.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://hazin.me\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0I also would like to think I\u0027m mildly entertaining with comments and reviews on social media. \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fb.com/alethal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://fb.com/alethal\u003c/a\u003e If any of that has ever made you smile on more then one occasion and you think, man it would be awesome if he got up more content or better content... You can help out with that. \u00a0 On top of that monthly cost, new equipment costs is crazy, gas money, hotel money, child care costs and so much other stuff people don\u0027t seem to realize.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cant promise you the first 3,000 that comes in is gonna buy a new camera or lens, or that the Jnews site is going to get some fresh new feature each month. \u00a0But I can tell you it will be hugely appreciated, and will be put to good use whether I feel like I need to feed the kids, or get some camera equipment. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what would I be getting if this brings in some solid money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEquipment Wise:\u003cbr\u003eCanon 5D MIII\u003cbr\u003eSony A7RII\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMultiple Lenses\u003cbr\u003eA Flash (Not sure what one is yet, but think I probably should get one)\u003cbr\u003eStorage (Both Digital and Bags)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSite Wise:\u003cbr\u003eForums and Chat\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStaff:\u003cbr\u003eSending more staff to shows (Tickets, Gas)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this pops off and it makes sense, Patron\u0027s will receive Photo Prints, T-Shirts, and Beyond.... \u00a0 Maybe even Photo Print T-Shirts, the stuff music labels have been reluctant to do even?"
