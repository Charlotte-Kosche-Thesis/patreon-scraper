We make comics and cartoons and books and shirts and prose and any damn thing that a writer and an illustrator can get up to together.

Indeed, thus far, we are paying for the privilege of entertaining you, between fees for web design and hosting, and what we pay Jacob Bascle, our incredible logo/lettering demigod, this sets us back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny other money that we make allows us to devote less time to our restaurant jobs and more to producing \u003cem\u003eHunter Black\u003c/em\u003e as well as our other projects. Heck, in a perfect world, we can update \u003cem\u003eHunter Black\u003c/em\u003e FIVE DAYS A WEEK, and still work on \u003cem\u003ePlanet Pantheon\u003c/em\u003e (a webcomic that\u0027s currently on hiatus), \u003cem\u003eRocket Queen and The Wrench\u003c/em\u003e, and the upcoming \u003cem\u003eCassie Cometstail and The Haunted Star\u003c/em\u003e...but that\u0027s a pipe dream at the moment. Ultimately, our only goal is to make a decent living doing what we love...which is making something for you to love (hopefully).\u003c/div\u003e"
