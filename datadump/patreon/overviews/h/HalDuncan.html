Sodomite Hal Duncan!! (sic)\u003c/a\u003e so named by a lovely piece of homophobic hatemail from one whose... linguiphilia, shall we say, shone through in their exuberant overuse of excess capitalisation and spurious punctuation. Scotsman, smoker and certified citizen of New Sodom, I\u0027m likely known best to you, if you\u0027re noseying around here, as a scribbler of strange fictions and verse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you new to my work though, who am I? Well, I\u0027m the author of the World Fantasy Award nominated\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2006/05/writings-on-vellum.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVELLUM\u003c/a\u003e, described by Lucius Shepard as \"the Guernica of genre fiction,\" and the sequel INK, along with a whole bunch of novellas (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/ebook-escape.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eESCAPE FROM HELL!\u003c/a\u003e), short stories (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/scruffians-deluxe-edition.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSCRUFFIANS!\u003c/a\u003e), poems (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.papaveria.com/2010/songs-for-the-devil-and-death-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSONGS FOR THE DEVIL AND DEATH\u003c/a\u003e), essays (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/rhapsody.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRHAPSODY\u003c/a\u003e), sadly as yet unfilmed screenplays (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/whatever-fuck-you-want.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT\u003c/a\u003e), and even the odd musical or two (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/nowhere-town.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNOWHERE TOWN\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/sodom-musical.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSODOM! THE MUSICAL\u003c/a\u003e). I\u0027ve won awards, even judged a few. I\u0027ve been a full-time writer now for ten years, but let\u0027s just say that when your most successful work is best described as \"literary cubism\" it\u0027s not exactly the fast-track to the life of Riley. When your latest projects are an anarcho-socialist d\u00e9tournement of the Gospels and a gay porn sci-fi retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson\u0027s KIDNAPPED, you need to find support outside the industry of commercial fiction, to keep the wolves from the door while you trust your crazy muse to take you where it will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in, me scamps and scrags, scallywags and scofflaws.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read my fiction or my poems, you\u0027ll know how important the \u003cem\u003esound\u003c/em\u003e of it is, the voice of the narrative, the rhythms of the verse. I\u0027ve done a lot of spoken word over the years now, and I give good readings, if I do say so myself, but I\u0027m in Glasgow and you\u0027re... very probably not. So, what I thought I\u0027d do with this Patreon is offer you a chance, wherever you are, to hear the stories and the poetry performed. If you can\u0027t come to a live gig to watch me slip into the role of Gobfabbler and recount a heartwarming tale of gruesome goodwill like \"A Scruffian Christmas,\" or open up and bleed for you, in best Iggy Pop fashion, with an intensely personal poem like \"Wake,\" why, I\u0027ll bring the show to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is, then, for me to record a video and MP3 of a reading, one short story or poem every month. My poems tend to the long form, by the way, so we\u0027re not talking some one-minute snack, but a juicy, meaty sonnet sequence like \"Sonnets for Kouroi Old and New,\" a good ten-fifteen minute paean to the buttsex boys of ancient Greek mythology. Sign up as a patron, and you\u0027ll get exclusive access to the videos as they\u0027re added, to watch at your leisure, a spoken word gig in the comfort of your own home. A few more bucks in the tip hat, and you\u0027ll get a downloadable MP3, to listen to just as you would an audiobook. And at higher levels of patronage, I\u0027ll be looking to see if I can\u0027t reward your support with, say, a quarterly chapbook collecting the texts of the works released in that period, something similar to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/fabbles-1-scruffian-chapbook.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFABBLES: 1\u003c/a\u003e. And if the funding outstrips my basic goal, I\u0027ll be aiming to do this with brand new fiction too, so in any given chapbook there\u0027s something you can\u0027t get anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you fancy a wee monthly bedtime tale to soothe you to sleep with slaughter and mischief, or a rousing rebel yell of a poem to send you out of a morn with the Sodomite\u0027s vim and vigour in yer heart, all told with the growly gruffness of a \u003cem\u003eguid Scots tongue\u003c/em\u003e, as they say, (but don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll speak slowly and clearly for the international ear,) I\u0027d be chuffed to bits by your support. Truth be told, no exaggeration, you\u0027ll be helping keep a roof over my head, food on the table and--most important of all--power in my laptop to keep doing what I do best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e You\u0027ll have my gratitude, you\u0027ll have my love, and most of all, you\u0027ll have my \u003cem\u003ework\u003c/em\u003e."
