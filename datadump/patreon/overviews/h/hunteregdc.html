    "summary": "The Esports and Game Design Collective is a club where gamers, artists,\nprogrammers, musicians, writers, and storytellers of all kinds gather to create\nand play games at Hunter College. We are an academic club in nature, connecting students from\ndifferent departments and majors that have like-minded career interests in the\nfield of game design and development, and connecting the makers with the\nplayers. Our regular meetings, held in various student lounges around campus,\nfunction as co-working space for us to collaborate on our projects and academic\nendeavors. However, we also hold events and workshops open to the wider Hunter\ncommunity, functioning as a space for students who are gamers to learn how\ntheir favorite games are made, let them better understand the mechanics behind\nsaid games, and for them to have the opportunity to interact with student\ndesigners. We also offer peer academic advising to interested students on\nstudying game design. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn\nthe esports side of our club, we are home to the League of Legends,\nHearthstone, Overwatch, and Melee teams. Competing is not purely recreational.\nThe competitive gaming scene is psychologically and intellectually intense,\nforms camaraderie, and offers a chance for students to win scholarship money\nfor their education.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs of right\nnow, we are not an officially chartered club on campus due to roadblocks by\nadministration. We do not have the ability to publicly advertise or post flyers\naround campus, or the ability to receive school funding. However even with the strict\nlimits to our visibility on campus, we have over 150 active student members. The\nnumber continues to grow exponentially. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter a petition\ncampaign (and a whole lot of emails), the student government denied our request\nfor an appeal to their decision, and told us to try to charter again next year.\nWe have existed for a year already, and now face another whole year without\nfunding for our academic endeavors. Last year this was not as much of an issue,\nbecause we were a group of 35 crafty students. However, it is much harder to\nsustain a group this large with a budget of $0. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease\nconsider donating to our club so we can continue to create a space for students\nto be creative, gain experience, and get a chance at scholarships to fund their\neducation. Support the next generation of game developers and leaders. Help us\ncreate something amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards Tiers have different perks. If you are an active club member at Hunter, you will receive benefits labeled \"for club members\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur organization as a whole is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Hunter College, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates. The official Hunter website can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/.\"\u003ehttp://www.hunter.cuny.edu/.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe use on our website and/or in related promotional print or video material of trademarked names and images is strictly for editorial and descriptive purposes, and no commercial claim to their use, or suggestion of sponsorship or endorsement, is made by the Hunter Esports and Game Design Collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, we\u0027d love it if we could be officially affiliated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
