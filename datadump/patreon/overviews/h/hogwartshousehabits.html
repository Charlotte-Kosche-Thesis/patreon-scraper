What\u2019s that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way to support creators you love with recurring monthly donations. You can donate as little as $1 a month all the way up to our special $49.99 a month. Each tier give you special privileges, which you can read about in the column to the left.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous asked:\u003c/strong\u003e Is this going to mean you post less on Tumblr and we have to pay to access content now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely not! The content found on our blog is not going to change at all. You\u2019ll still get house reactions, analysis, and our goofy selves on a daily basis. Patreon is just a way for you to get all of that AND MORE. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous asked:\u003c/strong\u003e What will you do with the donations?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of the donations are going to be divided between the four admins for help with bills, school, and other life things. The other part is going to be tucked away for a general blog fund. Those funds are going to go straight back to YOU. We will use them to host giveaways with real life stuff, for travel costs for admins to meet up and produce content with more than one of us, and maybe to one day go to a convention and host a panel (big dreams people!). The more donations we receive, the bigger our dreams can get!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous asked:\u003c/strong\u003e That sounds amazing! How do I do it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClick the button that reads \u201cBecome a Patreon\u201d and follow the steps! You can donate for as long as you want to - from a one time donation to donating every month. We are eternally grateful for anyone who takes the time and dedication to pledge any monetary amount to us. We love what we do on the blog, we love interacting with our followers, and we love that we are going to be able to do more for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne more time, just to make it clear: Thank you.
