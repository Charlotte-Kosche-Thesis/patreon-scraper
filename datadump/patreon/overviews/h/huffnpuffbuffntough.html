    "summary": "First and foremost I want to just say thank you!!! Just the fact that you made it to this page is enough to make me smile. Being here shows that you appreciate how much effort I pour into my content, and in some way shape or form it has helped you in your life. Thank you for sticking with me throughout these last few years and for future years to come. Well, let\u0027s get to it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eW\u003cstrong\u003ehy do I need your support? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been honest with my readers and take pride in knowing that there are so many people who trust me and have been with me throughout my journey. I\u0027ve always committed to making all of my content free..  hands down, regardless of the amount of support that I receive. However everything I use and need including all of the supplies and equipment come straight from my families budget. My husband has been my biggest supporter and provider for everything, and I sincerely appreciate all that we have accomplished together. But now, I\u0027m looking to increase my current content as well as expand into new territory including a book, YouTube videos which will cover a host of new material including, cooking and meal prep, work out routines, equipment reviews, and also personal vlogs where I do what I love most... talking with my supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile all of this new and exciting content expansion sounds great the fact is that I absolutely cannot proceed without your support. As a patron, your support would help me allocate more money to supplies and new equipment, including much needed audio/video equipment. Your patronage will allow me to make new content for you to enjoy and learn from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore Thanks!!\u003cbr\u003eI believe it goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate any support you can offer, but hey, i\u0027ll say it anyway.....\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!!!!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0It truly means the world me. Now, Patreon recommends that we place rewards here to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re both honest... you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027ve been doing and what I\u0027m expanding into, and you appreciate the thousands of hours, anxiety ridden days, and ultimate joy I pour into what I create.\u00a0You are here because you truly appreciate what I do and I am here because of supporters and friends like you. The default setting is only $1.00 but you can change it to whatever want, and even adjust it as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I keep saying this but honestly I feel like I can\u0027t say it enough. Thank you!! From the bottom of my heart I truley appreciate all that you do and I\u0027m humbled by the fact fact that you support me. \u003cbr\u003eThank You ~ Katie ~ Huff\u0027nPuff to Buff\u0027nTough\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
