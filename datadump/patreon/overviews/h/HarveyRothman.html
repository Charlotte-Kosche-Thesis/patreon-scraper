    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWho\u0027s this now?\u003c/h3\u003eHello there! I\u0027m Harvey Rothman, creator of cartoons I haven\u0027t made yet. But that can change!\u003cbr\u003eI primarily make animations that are all about making the most of animation: surrealism and doing things that live-action can\u0027t do.\u00a0I also make comics, illustrations, jazz-inspired synth music, and just about anything in between (or at least have the ambition to expand on what I create).\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll find some joy in these absurdities and I\u0027ve got many more ideas for the future that with your support can help get them out there faster and better than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon for?\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon primarily to fund my projects. Right now my cartoons and music are almost completely independently made, relying only on friends and family for the odd voiceover or other help. That\u0027s fine and all, but I\u0027m lucky to finish an animation yearly with a lot of stress and time wasted on tedious donkey-work. With enough of a budget however, I can afford better equipment and such. A big ambition of mine would be the ability to cooperate and collaborate with other talented people to create much more grand works; background artists, musicians, animators. I\u0027m looking for distinct traits and styles, anything that I\u0027m not. It\u0027s things like this that your loving gratuity will go towards. Along with these ambitious works, you\u0027ll also get these extra little somethings: rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRewards\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/beRZ2ie.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the right you can spot a bunch of rewards. They aren\u0027t so much insentives to donate more, but I just feel like I owe my lovely donators something in return for their gracious support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t like the idea of donating monthly, but still would like to contribute a little, you can donate with this:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/U7ytJ9s3ix\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://paypal.me/hrothman\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThanks for popping in!\u003c/h3\u003e"
