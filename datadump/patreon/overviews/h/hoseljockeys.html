    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re Bryan Allain and Tyler Stanton. In April 2016 we started the Hosel Jockeys Golf Podcast because we\u0027re sort of obsessed with golf. It\u0027s essentially an hour each week of two buddies talking about playing and watching golf the way you and your friends do. Listen on Apple Podcasts\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hoseljockeys.com/itunes\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight now, YOU GUYS, our listeners, are helping us bring the podcast to life each week through your support. And if you like the pod, we\u0027d love for you to support us!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re trying to make this show different from every other golf podcast by being ourselves, trusting our instincts, and embracing our obsession with playing (and watching) golf. We want this to be a safe place for your obsession as well.\u00a0Our goal remains the same: to be a bright spot in your day a few times a month. We hope you\u0027ll find enough value in that to support our efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal was to get to 18 Founding Supporters, and we did just that! They are forever memorialized by having a hole named after them at Augusta National!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://bryanallain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Supporters18.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to get in on the fun, you\u0027re not too late. If you pledge support to the show, you\u0027ll get a hole named after you at Sawgrass, and you\u0027ll be memorialized on the graphic below. Hole #5 could be you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll supporters get an invite to our private Facebook group where we talk about anything and everything golf, where you can help us shape our episodes, and where you can nerd out with Bryan at the intricacies of proper right wrist flexion and extension in the golf swing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://bryanallain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sawgrass4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you enjoy the show, would you consider sponsoring a hole and becoming one of our supporters?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s still growing and changing and (hopefully) getting better. Right now it\u0027s just us and our awesome listeners, figuring it out together. We\u0027d like to keep it that way for as long as we can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to the show, give it a listen. If you like it, tell your friends about it. And if you can, please consider supporting the show to help us continue to make it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\n\u003cbr\u003eBryan and Tyler\u003cbr\u003e"
