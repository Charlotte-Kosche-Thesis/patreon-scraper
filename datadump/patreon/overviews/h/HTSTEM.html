We\u0027ve made several bots you might be using on the HTwins Central server everyday. These include the music bot, flair bot, and more. We\u0027ve done this all for you guys, and we hope you all love it. Unfortunately, as much as we would love to do this for free, hosting Discord bots costs money. We need to pay for the servers or our own electricity bill to keep the bots running, especially the musicbot.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/h3\u003eFor donating any amount of money, you will get the \u003cstrong\u003eBotSupporter role on the HTwins Central Discord server\u003c/strong\u003e. (It features a lighter shade of the snazzy developer role.) Also, for avid music bot users, for each $1 you pledge, you will be able to \u003cstrong\u003equeue an extra 10 songs\u003c/strong\u003e at a time. $3+ patrons will also get access to our bot testing server where they can help with the development of new features, or even suggest new things we should add to the bots! All patrons will have their name show up in the \u0027patreon\u0027 command of the musicbot, while $5 patrons will have their name show up with the developers of the bot in various commands (like !help) of the bots. In the future, we hope to implement features to prioritize songs from \npatrons and other features you guys suggest. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, if you decide you want to support us after reading all of this, \u003cstrong\u003eThank You! \u003c/strong\u003eYour support means a lot to us. You are part of the reason we can continue improving the experience of users like you on HTwins Central. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
