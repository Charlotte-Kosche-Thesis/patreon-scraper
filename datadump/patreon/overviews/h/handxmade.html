I assume you landed on this page from my Instagram or YouTube channel, where I craft miniatures with polymer clay (for the most part).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBehind Handxmade is a 22 year old Singaporean who simply wants to make miniatures of anything and everything every day, and share the process with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eTHE SITUATION\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in a conservative Asian family, crafting was never viewed as a \u201creal job\u201d - after all, what\u2019s a job if you enjoy it, right? \ud83d\ude36\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI guess I wanted to prove them wrong. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, I moved out in 2015, started Handxmade and crafted custom orders for the past few years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the journey, I eventually realised that I didn\u0027t want to make custom orders my main source of income, which it had become because I had to survive and pay the bills (hashtag adultlyfe hashtag responsibilities \ud83d\ude05) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to craft anything and everything, but custom orders were taking too much of my time (thanks to my perfectionist side). By the time I completed one month\u2019s worth of orders, I would have burned through the income I earned from those orders, and would have to reopen more custom orders for the next month. There was just no room for creativity. \ud83d\ude1e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHence, I decided to take a leap of faith and look towards producing video content where I could push the creative boundaries of my crafting while sharing the process with the those who are interested around the world. I discovered Patreon through some great artists and creators I follow, and decided that this was the best way to get involved with my supporters while doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day my dad asked me if I earn at least 2k per month (in SGD so that\u0027s about USD 1515), and I had to say no. I don\u0027t want his words to discourage me, so I\u0027m still here trying to make it work. But when I reach that goal...that\u0027s the day I can finally face my family and tell them that I made it while I\u0027m doing what I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eWHY SHOULD I SUPPORT YOU?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell you don\u0027t have to!! \u003c/strong\u003eNo obligations whatsoever!

(That is...if you want to see more of my videos, which you do........right? \ud83d\ude05)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso, Patreon gets me paid without making you viewers put up with ads AND WHO WOULDN\u0027T WANT THAT AYE. I\u0027m actually thinking of not even monetising on YT to keep my videos ad free hoho.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also (hopefully attractive) exclusive perks available for my patrons, and with your support I will be able to make them more diverse and attractive as I go along!
