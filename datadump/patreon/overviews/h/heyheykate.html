With individualized rosters, being able to compare not just each RAW to one another and each SmackDown to one another, I\u0027d then be able to compare how WWE distributes their time amongst the 5+ hours of live wrestling airtime they\u0027re given every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, that jumps my workload from 5 hours with just the RAW Breakdowns (which I\u0027m currently doing free of charge) to 8 every week. More if I do an extra Breakdown comparing the two shows week to week. I need to ensure that I can justify the amount of work in doing SmackDown Breakdowns every week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe reach this goal every month, every single SmackDown that month gets broken down, in ADDITION to the SmackDown PPV Breakdowns being posted publicly.",
