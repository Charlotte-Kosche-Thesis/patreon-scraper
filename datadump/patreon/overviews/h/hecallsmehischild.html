I have rent the hearts of Invader Zim and Mystery Skulls Animated fans alike. Who knows what fandom may next provide me with that obsessive spark?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 240px;\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003eHi.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/1e54610cf718b45a3726534decce4acb/tumblr_p0bay4Qf1z1spp8hco1_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in love with writing, but writing is also the most cantankerous craft I\u0027ve ever dealt with. Some days it\u0027s like riding a gelding down a peaceful trail. Other days it\u0027s like clinging for dear life to the back of a bucking stallion. There is no single method I\u0027ve found, but I\u0027m happy to share my various struggles, tips, and solutions with you as they occur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking to put together a website where I will post up my original fiction projects, which will include my novel (and all related world-building), poetry, and several children\u0027s stories that I have in mind. These would be available for free on the website and open to reader comments so that I can produce original fiction in the same way I produce fanfiction. I control the updates and speed of completion while interacting with my readers every step of the way. It\u0027s a win-win!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on my Patreon, you will have access to my brain as I process different projects here, from writing fanfiction chapters for the first time to editing older works to info on tackling the challenges of self publication and even Q\u0026amp;A videos! You could even receive a piece of art or an editing session from me! Whatever tier you decide on, I am thrilled to have you on board for this adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/a3d94f6c051696d5c66dd8b256721fe5/tumblr_p2oluwiUvK1spp8hco1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
