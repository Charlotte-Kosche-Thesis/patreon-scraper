    "summary": "So here\u0027s the deal. I like playing games while people are watching. I like showing off what\u0027s cool about them, what isn\u0027t, and I like when crazy things happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I do it every Thursday night, 5:30 PM PST, at what is now, for your convenience, both www.hitbox.tv/banjooie and www.twitch.tv/banjooie . \u00a0The problem is, I can\u0027t do it more because of that money thing where I need to purchase food and other such sundries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe deal is simple, basically. If you guys like watching me play video games and making a fool out of myself, then I can play more video games in front of you guys. I can do things like show off obscure Korean MMOs with terrifying grinding in side LPs, I can show off Minecraft mods nobody cares about. The more I don\u0027t have to be at my job, making groceries beep, the more I can be streaming stuff and helping you decide whether to buy that game the next time it goes on sale on Steam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEffectively: I need your money to purchase time to entertain you. Above that, I\u0027d like to soundproof my work area a bit better so I can be louder. Maybe get a better mic. More money also means I can buy more games that you might be skittish about \u00a0and want some guy to flail at.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "So here\u0027s the deal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t really want to do rewards. This isn\u0027t because I don\u0027t think you are absolutely utterly fantastic for giving me money, it\u0027s because I don\u0027t want to be in a situation where I have made a neat thing and then cannot show people the neat thing, or have to keep special lists of who is and who is not allowed to see me cry at poop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo then you\u0027re saying, \u0027Well, what about game choice? You could let people who give you money decide what you\u0027re going to play!\u0027 And we could, absolutely! And if I were to hit the full-time stage where that would be viable, I\u0027d set up that kind of scenario. As it stands, with the current Thursday mechanic, I\u0027d be in a weird situation where very, very quickly I\u0027d have more people paying me to play specific games than time in which to play them, so someone\u0027s paying money and not getting a thing? And that\u0027s obnoxious for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027But everyone has secret skype channel chats and teamspeak servers and\u0027 Good lord I am not nearly full enough of myself to believe you want to PAY for the right to talk to me on frigging voice chat. That\u0027s insane. If I start a teamspeak server for that sort of thing, it\u0027s going to be open. You are just going to come in, and you\u0027re going to say words, and I\u0027m going to hear them, and if you\u0027re a douchenozzle then I will ban you. And it will be okay, because \u003cstrong\u003eyou didn\u0027t pay for the privilege of having me ban you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo really, the reward for paying to help me make a thing you like is that you get more of the thing you like. Maybe at some point if someone suggests something really cool to me, I\u0027ll consider adding it, but for now I feel like I can\u0027t add a reward that doesn\u0027t penalize somebody giving me money, and you are all fantastic people so I can\u0027t do that.",
