On my website you can find a heaping carcass-pile of art that I\u0027ve stacked there for all you to gnaw on at your leisure (for free). If you enjoy the rank flavour of my offerings I hope you will consider tossing me back a few shards of splintered bone so that I may put points on my poison arrows. I\u0027ll take care of rearing the poisonous frogs, stalking the mythic beasts roaming the hinterlands, scouring the dunes, assembling the remains and completing the cycle...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontmesswithdinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/TheTombcropd.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for reals though, I need steady funding to keep doing this. For years I\u0027ve been managing the difficult financial balancing act of keeping myself fed by doing freelance animation and illustration work while committing every spare dollar and hour I can to funding and creating my own projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontmesswithdinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/GodsMonsters.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd everything I do takes a lot of time (which = money, in the form of food, utilities and rent), because I\u0027m committed to producing the best quality work with the richest detail \u0026amp; originality I possibily can. Your funds help pay for that time and the materials necessary to do what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontmesswithdinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/BT2_Output3_Adjusted2-WM_WEBSIZED.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the focus of my personal efforts in recent years has been music videos and dinosaur illustrations, my long-term goal is to make feature films, and I think it would be awesome to make big, ambitious productions happen completely outside the mainstream film inudstry, funded primarily or entirely by the people who are tired of remakes, sequels and rehashes and who want to see some crazy new shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dontmesswithdinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/FTCryponychusWeb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToss me a few bucks a month and not only will you be supporting the \nevolution of new monsters, and helping paleontologists communicate our understanding of the past, but you\u0027ll\n also get access to original art, music \u0026amp; behind the scenes content \nthat you wont be able to see or hear anywhere else.\u003cimg src=\"http://dontmesswithdinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/CaveLungerDMWD.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

At this monthly rate I will also be able to travel further afield to film in more remote/epic/gnarly locations. I will also be able to commit to big projects (like full albums or music video series) for extended chunks of time without having to take breaks from them to regroup and raise money to keep them funded.\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "At $6000 a month \u0026amp; beyond I will begin to develop projects larger than music videos \u0026amp; short films. I have a pile of feature film ideas I want to make, \u0026amp; at this level of funding those ideas will start to materialize and content related to them will start to appear in my Patreon feed. Do you want to watch full length films with bizarre monsters, dinosaurs, aliens, space ships, explosions, kung fu, ghosts and strong complex human characters?? I want to make them. Help me. This is a totally reachable goal. It\u0027s half my current youtube subscribers giving $3 a month, or it\u0027s 10% of a future audience of 20,000 (not that many viewers by internet standards) giving a couple bucks. Be part of it. NEW MONSTERS. NEW MOVIE IDEAS. NO DUMB REMAKES / SEQUELS / ADAPTATIONS / PARODIES / OTHER REHASHED BULLSHIT. I want to drag you accross the universe and toss you into worlds you\u0027ve never imagined.\u003cbr\u003e",
