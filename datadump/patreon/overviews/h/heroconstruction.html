    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a group of regular people who believe anyone can learn to be a hero. Four years ago we launched the first-ever Hero Round Table, the world\u0027s largest conference on heroism. The message was based on the classroom experience of educator Matt Langdon and a network of innovators, scholars and heroism experts. We are amazed by people\u0027s response\u2014what started as a small local gathering is now a global event. It has spread to three continents and brings people together from around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we have much bigger plans. We believe that a culture of heroism starts with young people. We have created a non-profit organization, the Hero Construction Company, to teach kids and teenagers how to be heroes. The HCC runs the American version of the Hero Round Table, and creates heroism lessons for any school that needs them. These lessons are always \u003cstrong\u003eFREE\u003c/strong\u003e. We don\u0027t charge for them because we want to have the biggest impact possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals of the Hero Construction Company are simple:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeach.\u003c/strong\u003e Create free, in-depth heroism curriculum for teachers of all grade levels.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShare.\u003c/strong\u003e Bring together people from all walks of life at the Hero Round Table in Brighton, MI.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInspire.\u003c/strong\u003e Help people of all ages learn what it means to be a hero \u0026amp; how to be tomorrow\u0027s hero.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThis work is already happening. In 2016 we released our first ever heroism lesson plan, which is now being used in Michigan schools. And we have reached thousands of people through 4 years of events. But that\u0027s only a fraction of how many people we \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0reach\u2014if we have your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is you can donate any amount you want and the donation will be recurring every month. That means that any amount you choose, from $1/month on up, is a huge help to the cause.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will the Money Be Used For?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur educational work is what needs your support the most. Our initial goal is to reach $500/month in contributions, which will allow us to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelop a series of heroism lesson plans aimed at different ages, grade levels and topics.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProduce high quality video lessons that can be used in-class.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for marketing and outreach so that the curriculum reaches as many schools as possible.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire professionals to help where needed and cover the day-to-day costs of running a nonprofit.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThose are the basics. If we can reach this milestone we will have the ability to make the best heroism training possible. From there, the only limit to what we can do is the imagination of the people we reach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery single person who has shown their support is helping make real change. Thank you for anything you decide to do, and thank you for believing in heroes!\u003cbr\u003e"
