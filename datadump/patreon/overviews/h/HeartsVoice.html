There is so much in my heart that I feel needs to get out in some form of media. \u003cbr\u003eNot Only will your monthly pledge help free some space in the schedule, but it will help with publishing expenses and purchasing necessary equipment for creating guided meditation videos/sessions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that eventually I will be able to have enough income to be at home with my daughter and to raise her myself, instead of relying on childcare. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for this site is to publish the things that are reveiled to me in the Spirit and to create practical application guides/mediations/activations and be able to articulate to you (and the world) the things that the Lord is showing me."

I have been believer for over 20 years, but more recently the Lord has opened me up to the reality of the Spiritual Realms, and I am excited at what I see Him doing and hear Him saying. \u00a0I love to write, and I try to write fresh from the heart. I would really love to start doing guided mediation and activations \u00a0for Spiritual Cleansing and Growth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am finding that there is so much in the Bible, The WORD that is not taught or unrealized. It is such a great Spiritual handbook, as well as everything else, including the TRUTH. There are is a battle going on in the Spirit, and I am just a willing vessel doing my best to articulate the things of the Spirit so that we can perceive them.",
