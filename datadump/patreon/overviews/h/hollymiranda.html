    "summary": "My name is Holly Miranda. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve been making music professionally for nearly 20 years and I\u0027ve watched this industry change drastically over that time. While things like online user based streaming have allowed musicians to reach a wider audience it has also hindered the ability to survive off of one\u0027s art. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSocial media has made accessibility a necessity for success. A bit of mystery has been replaced with an imagined intimacy filled with blasts and filters. So be it then, let\u0027s get on with it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e2017 finds me working on lot\u0027s of things. A musical, a series of short stories, an animated project and a photography exhibition, to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been struggling lately to find a path to my listeners that feels like I\u0027m honoring both myself and them. Maybe, this could be the answer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI hope to use this platform to connect in a more meaningful way, while sharing unique content and creating a forum for conversation and collaboration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards will start July 2017. Please join me in this\u00a0experiment (you can stop at any time)!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your support you will gain access to private concerts, exclusive recordings, meet and greets, one-of-a-kind personalized artwork and all of the other little things that might creep out of my brain. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI will in return be eternally grateful for your support and use the time your support frees up to see through the many projects I have in the works. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery contribution makes a difference! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a rough out there for dreamers. Now more than ever we need to support each other and resist with love those who would want us to believe that magic is dead. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMagic is very much afoot. ;) \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003exxx\u003cbr\u003e\nHM\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

She began playing piano at the age of 6, taught her self guitar at 14 and moved to New York at 16 to start her professional career. For nearly 20 years Holly has been performing, writing and producing with some of the best in the business. She has performed with the likes of Karen O, Lou Reed, The XX and Lesley Gore. She released two records with her band \u201cThe Jealous Girlfriends\u201d and has co-written and produced a mass of other projects. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017 Holly will release her third solo album on Dangerbird Records titled \u201cMutual Horse\u201d, with assistance from Josh Werner (Dr. John, Lee Scratch Perry), Jared Samuel (Yoko Ono), Jim Kirby Fairchild (Grandaddy, Modest Mouse), Kyp Malone (Tv On The Radio), Maria Eisen (Underground System), Matthew Morgan (Built to spill, Modest Mouse) and many others. The eclectic mix of players make for some compelling grooves. This record finds Holly bridging the gap between 2010\u2019s experimental synth laden release \u201cThe Magicians Private Library\u201d and 2015\u2019s stripped back soulful self-titled record. Miranda takes an honest and intimate approach, while maintaining her sense of humor and sonic explorations. Make sure to catch Holly live in US and Europe in 2018!\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
