    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWelcome thank you for joining in this discussion. My name is Darrell Campbell I\u0027m a Certified Life Coach and the founder of Real-Life Coaching LLC. I have a BS in Sociology, a minor in Social Psychology and in pursuit of MS in Developmental Psychology from Clayton State University. I was awarded outstanding  accomplishments in Sociology in 2015, and served as President of Clayton State University Model United Nations delegation from  2013 to 2015. I was honored  Outstanding Delegate in Ecuador, and Head Delegate in Czech Republic and New York City conferences. I earned a Diploma in Sex and Drug Abuse Counseling from Stratford Institute, 2006. My internship was at Atlanta Mission. I am a former restaurant owner and operator,  Restaurant Operations Consultant, Author, and Grant Writer for Nonprofit Business Development. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for comments from Patrons who shared and for those Patrons who respectfully listened in the background, hopefully you feel you received a return on time invested, as other Patrons were unpacking this unique perspective on A School of Hard Knocks. Thank you,  I am appreciative of your attention, time, feedback and pledges of support. Please join us each Saturday 10:30 a.m.  as we continue our discussion of a School of Hard Knocks. Our next discussion focus will be on The Stupid Stuff We Do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Real-Life Coach Darrell Campbell. Remember, he who knows and knows that he knows is wise, and he who knows but knows not that he knows is yet still  ignorant. However, he who knows not, yet thinks he knows and judges a matter before he hears it, is but a fool. Don\u0027t forget, I might be talking to myself."
