I\u0027m also an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/how-architect\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eauthor\u003c/a\u003e, inventor, patent holder,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thearchitectsbirdfeeder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eproduct developer\u003c/a\u003e, entrepreneur,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thearchitectsacademy.usefedora.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eteacher\u003c/a\u003e and I have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/howtoarchitect\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e that\u0027s all about architecture. I love to learn, I have lots of stuff stuck in my brain and I love to teach!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I don\u0027t like to admit that the word \u003cem\u003earchitecture\u003c/em\u003e could be used for any other reason than to describe great buildings, it really is a versatile term. Everything out there has an architecture. That is, all things have a framework, a structure, or a fabric of some kind - from ideas to events and objects. And this fabric, of sorts, comes together to form facts. Information that can be substantiated. I like facts and I know there are others out there just like me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you\u0027ll learn here isn\u0027t subjective. It\u0027s real. It\u0027s knowledge, it\u0027s true and you can impress anyone in the world with it! This Patreon page is all about the Who, What, Where, When, Why and How of all things worth knowing about. And I believe that\u00a0it\u0027s the kind of content that has the potential to make your life richer and more fulfilling. We will soar the skies and delve deep into the ocean blue. We\u0027ll cover exciting topics like procreation, the human body, civil conflict, inventions, communication, theories, machines, ideas, and philosophies of mankind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s get real. I make videos. There are literally hundreds of original examples over at my YouTube channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/howtoarchitect\"\u003eHow to Architect\u003c/a\u003e. And videos take time. Plus, many of the videos I create include original artwork. Which takes more time. And last but not least, I don\u0027t pretend to be a bonafide genius and I may not nail it every time, but I try. And that means I research the content I create. And that takes even more time. Bottom line...I have a passion for learning, eduction and teaching others about what I know and learn. And that\u0027s why I\u0027m here at Patreon asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron at \u003cem\u003eThe Architecture of Everything \u003c/em\u003eyou get LOTS of\u00a0 exclusive Patreon videos. And depending on your level you can gain access to the Suggestion Forum to not only suggest video topics but be personally thanked in a video. You can access my Google Drive to see what I\u0027m working on, or you might decide to become part of our Genius group that meets monthly to discuss the topics of your choice \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e what\u0027s next on EVERYTHING!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to meeting you soon and thanks so much for your support. It means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKind Regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoug\u003cbr\u003e"
