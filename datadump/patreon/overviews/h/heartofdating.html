Just having you here is enough to give me ALL THE FEELS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Kait and I am a  lifestyle, wellness, style, and faith filled blogger and public speaker with the purpose of showing how to thrive with purpose! Over the course of the last few years, I have developed a particular passion on the topic of dating in the Christian world. It isn\u2019t easy, but I have been committed to finding out more about this difficult subject\u2026 cuz let\u2019s be honest \u003cstrong\u003e#THESTRUGGLEISREAL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo help us along in this journey I have started a \u003cstrong\u003ePODCAST\u003c/strong\u003e that I hope will encourage a healthy conversation around this difficult and somewhat murky subject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe purpose of The HeART of Dating Podcast is to unmask the ever so ambiguous world of dating in the Christian world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nTBH\u003c/em\u003e, some people have looked at me all wide eyed and bushy tailed when I told them I was starting a podcast on DATING\u2026like, \u201c\u003cem\u003egirlfriend are you crazy\u003c/em\u003e?!?\u201d. Well, I am here to tell you that NO, I am not crazy, but YES this is no easy feat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat is why I am here today!\u003cbr\u003e\nTo:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n1. Ask you for your prayers cuz Lawd knows I need it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nand\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n2. Invite you to join my exclusive community!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo...WHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nRunning a podcast may seem easy, but it is actually quite the endeavor! Anddddd it happens to cost a lot of mulaaa $$$.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get this off the ground I have invested a TON of personal time and resources of my own. From equipment, to audio editing, sound mixing, logo creation, website development, interview research, actually interviewing some #FIERCE people, and running the social media components\u2026 there just a few moving parts (are you out of breathe yet? I am!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe behind the scenes costs associated with just launching and creating the first episode have been upwards of $2,500 (which doesn\u2019t include the cost of significant personal time I have invested in this project... worth every second though!). On top of the initial setup costs, there will continue to be costs associated monthly in order to run the podcast seamlessly. My goal is to launch 1 Episode/week (or more) over time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat is where I want to invite YOU- my friends, family, incredible community, and dating advocates-to become a part of this crazy amazing vision I have!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBy paying for the podcast you will be a part of supporting me on this daunting task, and help bring love, encouragement and support to others as they navigate the murky waters of dating.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e$1,500/mo: I\u0027ll be able to continue to execute and implement the upcoming episodes of the Heart of Dating Podcast! This includes paying for audio mixing, website and media hosting, and a part time assistant for emails and scheduling.I will also be able to start paying off my initial investment!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e$3,500/mo: PRAISE! I would be to invest in some equipment upgrades, more time into interviews, as well as be able to start paying myself a bit for the time invested in this project! I would also be able to fully pay off my initial investment in this project in no time at all!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e$5,000/mo: Hallelujah TO JESUS! This would be crazy. I would be able to come out with more HOD Podcast Episodes, add more members to the team (which is currently Me, Myself, and I), and actually invest even MORE time into creating a Heart of Dating Ministry! This would included courses, potential retreats, themed events, a BOOK, and MORE!!! This would be the craziest biggest blessing on the planet. #BLESS\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eHold the phone!\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t want you to leave without \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eat least \u003c/em\u003egetting an inside look of who is to come on the Heart of Dating Podcast:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJohn Mark Comer\u003c/strong\u003e-Portland Based Based Pastor of Bridgetown church, and Author\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJordan Lee Dooley- \u003c/strong\u003ePublic Speaker, and founder of Soul Scripts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGary Thomas- \u003c/strong\u003e Bestselling Author and International Speaker \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAll of the people above inspire me in different, but very impactful ways. There are many more people on the docket to be interviewed, but I will leave those as a surprise\u2026.just trust me that you will love them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbove all, THANK YOU for your desire to be a part of this journey on Patreon as we jump into the boat together and navigate the murky waters of dating. Though daunting, it\u2019s also exciting right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the heart of the matter ;)\u003cbr\u003e\nKait Warman\u003cbr\u003e"
