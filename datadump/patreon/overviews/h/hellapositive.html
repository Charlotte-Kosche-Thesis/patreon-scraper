    "summary": "First things first, here\u0027s how this works: this is a subscription pledge model. Let\u0027s say you pledge $5. Every week, on Monday, I will post a new set of photos. At the end of the month, for each new set I posted that month, your card/Paypal will be charged $5. So on most months with 4 Monday\u0027s, that would be $20. You can also set a cap on how much you\u0027ll be charged each month. Also, yes, by pledging you get access to all of the past sets as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s all kinds of reasons why I do this. It\u0027s part rebellion against media that shows us only one way to be sexy. It\u0027s wanting everyone to have something they can look at on those bad days and think, \"Damn though, I am fiiiine.\" It\u0027s wanting to make feminist art that is sex positive, body positive, gender expression positive, queer/kinky/poly positive, and just straight up actually positive. It\u0027s about all of those things, but more than anything else it\u0027s about me being absolutely fascinated by the incredibly diverse ways in which people feel sexy. This isn\u0027t about making you look sexy to other people, this is about you feeling comfortable and looking sexy to yourself. Funny thing is, that usually translates to you looking like a fox to other people as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really truly mean it when I say I\u0027m radically inclusive. If you look through my shoots and think, oh, that looks nothing like me, then please please please send me a message so we can book a shoot. I want my portfolio to truly reflect my views, and I want people to look at it and know that they are welcome, that this is not a thing they are excluded from. I promise that this is for you, if you want it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWanna see some examples? Here\u0027s my portfolio, with some of my favorite photos that I\u0027m allowed to put on the internet. I hope it goes without saying, but this gallery is NSFW.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bradennesin.com/pin-up/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.bradennesin.com/pin-up/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWanna star in your very own shoot? Great! Go here and fill out this survey: \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/EZGDZC47MZ.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://goo.gl/forms/EZGDZC47MZ.\u003c/a\u003e If and when I pass through your neck of the woods I\u0027ll send you an email to see about booking a shoot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny other questions?

Also, at this point I\u0027ll be able to start investing more into my shoots, and production value will steadily go way up. I\u0027ve been doing these shoots on a shoestring budget with basically no gear beyond a camera and a couple of prime lenses. With the extra money I\u0027ll be able to shell out for lighting gear and other assorted equipment one piece at a time, and you\u0027ll see the extra quality that adds reflected in the photos. Also, I\u0027ll start flying domestically for free once a month, to whichever cities have the most interest or that I haven\u0027t visited in a while.",

This will mean even more opportunities for people on a budget to get to feel sexy in front a camera. Basically the only cost for clients at this point will be my travel expenses. Pay for my flight, or split that between a few people, and I will come to you so we can make some sexy art together.",
