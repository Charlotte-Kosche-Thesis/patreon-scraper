    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eWho am I and why did I decide to join Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I made my first hoodie back in 2013 and shared it online I didn\u0027t expect people to like it that much. It was simply a birthday gift for my best friend. We sort of had this tradition of giving each other handmade gifts and we were both crazy about Young Justice cartoon back then, so I thought it was a cool idea to make her a Robin inspired sweater. Since then, I\u0027ve created tens of comics, games and cartoons inspired sweatshirts and tunics. And they\u0027re all fully handmade!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m not only doing this because I love designing and sewing, I\u0027m also doing this for living. I\u0027ve had my ups and downs because when you\u0027re a single person running a business every smallest life or health issue might be enough to stop you, but all the wonderful people I\u0027ve met thanks to what I\u0027m doing are my reason to never give up and always come back stronger. There\u0027s nothing that motivates me to work harder more than a returning customer, saying they\u0027re still wearing something they bought from you years ago, not to mention seeing a picture of a happy person wearing something I\u0027ve made with my own hands. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of my latest projects are commissions, but I have so many ideas in my head I\u0027d love to turn into an actual piece of clothing! Something I can\u0027t always afford myself considering I\u0027m living alone, taking care of two rescued cats and struggling with health problems, but I have so many people asking if they can donate I thought opening a Patreon would be a good idea. This way whoever feels like supporting me will be able to do so, while I\u0027ll have a chance to repay you for your help. Just the fact you\u0027re here reading this means a lot so thank you and enjoy my stuff! \u2665\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI get a lot of questions from people interested not only in my hoodies but also in the way I work and the process of creating my sweaters. I will be doing my best so my Patreon is full of various content from tips and small tutorials, through designs, progress pics, photoshoot backstages to high quality photos of the hoodies (including details closeups) as well as exclusive photoshoot pics. All of this will be available to everyone from TIER 2 and up!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo matter how much you decide to pledge (starting TIER 1) you will also be able to vote for the hoodie desing of my patrons\u0027 choice I will be creating every month, starting March! \n\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons choice sweatshirts won\u0027t be available to get anywhere outside of my Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e. Also when the new one is picked, the previous one is gone forever! One lucky person (TIER 3) will be able to grab the prototype and only five more pieces of the same design will be made for my TIER 4 patrons. There\u0027s also a special TIER 5 if you like my works enough to have something made especially for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat exactly am I creating?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI am doing my best to create sweaters you can wear everyday. I always make sure to use quality fabrics so my hoodies are machine washable and last for a very long time, just like your casual clothes. I get inspired mostly by comics and games.

Most of these pics are taken by the one and only Kairi (Kairi in Cosplayland @ FB) with Zel (Zel CosHorse @ FB),\u00a0Andrasta and Namidanobaka doing the model job!
