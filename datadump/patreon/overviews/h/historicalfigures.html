And if you aren\u2019t, well, maybe you\u2019re about to be. Historical Figures would not be here if it weren\u2019t for our wonderful listeners. You\u2019ve been a huge part of our launch and growth. You are the most important part of what we do, and we can\u2019t express how amazing you all have been to us. So from the bottom of our hearts, thank you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAbout Historical Figures\u003c/h3\u003eBig Lives. Little-known Facts. Great, unknown stories hide inside history\u2014every Wednesday, we dig up what you don\u0027t know about the icons you do know. We bring history to life, telling unexpected anecdotes, describing the real personalities behind big names, and examining each individual\u2019s lasting impact on the world. A reboot of Remarkable Lives. Tragic Deaths. (iTunes \u201cBest Debuts of 2016\u201d).Historical Figures is part of the Parcast Network and is a Cutler Media Production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy We\u2019re Asking You for Money\u003c/h3\u003eOur goal is to put our listeners first, and improve with every episode. However, each episode costs thousands of dollars to produce. Why? Every episode is written, acted, and sound designed by trained professionals. A few other costs include the recording studio, equipment, and online hosting. Producing podcasts is an uphill battle\u2014like the Wild West, the podcast space changes daily, and we strive to stay independent so we can create shows that are fresh and original. In order to continue releasing episodes weekly, we need stability. You\u2019ve probably heard our ads, and we love our advertisers, but unfortunately, in the podcast space, ads aren\u2019t consistent. Our listeners, however, are. Hundreds of thousands of you tune in every week, and we\u2019d love to continue to produce high quality podcasts for you for a long time to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you can\u2019t afford to give but still want to help, you can write a nice review, give our show a 5 star rating on iTunes or your favorite podcast directory, or share the podcast with your friends, all of which help out tremendously! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for all of your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eParcast in a Nutshell\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.parcast.com/\"\u003eParcast\u003c/a\u003e is a production house and network that brings you podcasts like \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/unsolvedmurders\"\u003eUnsolved Murders: True Crime Stories\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/parcastserialkillers\"\u003eSerial Killers\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/cults\"\u003eCults\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.parcast.com/haunted/\"\u003eHaunted Places\u003c/a\u003e. Unlike other podcasts produced by one or two creatives, Parcast is a team of over 40 people, including screenwriters, actors and sound designers currently producing multiple new episodes per week. The team works together to produce podcasts with everything done in-house, similar to the way the classic movie studio system produced great films. In the last year, we have had over 37 million downloads. And last year, Remarkable Lives. Tragic Deaths. (now rebranded as \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/historicalfigures\"\u003eHistorical Figures\u003c/a\u003e) was named one of iTunes best debuts of 2016. Serial Killers was ranked on the list of Most Downloaded New Shows by Apple Podcasts for 2017. None of this would be possible without YOU, our listeners. So thank you!\u00a0\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
