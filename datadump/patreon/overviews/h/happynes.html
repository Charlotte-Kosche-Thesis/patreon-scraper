    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI have so much energy I feel like I\u2019m going to explode.\u003c/strong\u003e Producing meaningful work is the most important thing to me, it simply gives me my sense of purpose in this life. Without it, I am lost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI moved to Istanbul in October 2015 from Los Angeles where I was working at the cutting edge of a blossoming virtual reality (vr) industry. Our small company of 4 quickly grew into one of the leading vr camera and stitching innovators in Hollywood. At the forefront of its\u2019 success was a crazy genius called Andy, his VJ slash programming wiz partner Ram, and me. Together in Andy\u2019s living room we hacked countless prototypes, perfected a not-yet existing vr pipeline, and stitched the hell out gigabytes upon gigabytes of test shots. Our 360 stereoscopic camera rig captured a black lives matter protest in New York, traveled to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan, and survived an active volcanic rock in Iceland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoining VRSE so fresh out of graduating from USC\u2019s MFA program pushed me neck deep in the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. It was exhilarating. It was a year of steep learning curves, relentless innovation, and reckoning with some of Hollywood\u2019s less favorable characteristics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eLater, moving to Istanbul gave me the opportunity to explore my own art. I developed a television series. I taught myself how to code in Python so I could build a live audio-visual interface to make video art during concerts. I designed several websites. I started selling my illustrations online. I made murals. I worked tirelessly on proposals, none of which panned out. I animated a music video. I started to screen print in my living room.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo it seems I\u2019m at my life\u2019s fork right now. It\u2019s time to step up and be the leader I know I can be. I want to build something big. It\u2019s here, it\u2019s now, it\u2019s in Istanbul, and I got a feeling it\u2019s important. And if it\u2019s not important, well then we can just say it\u2019s important to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Challenge:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nAt the moment, there is a storm covering Turkey that stems from ignorance and warped political views. Art, much like journalism, is undervalued and compromised in Turkey. I believe a good way to win this war of ideas is through art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMission Statement:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nMy mission is to project a tapestry of ideas that reflect deep seeded roots of freedom of expression, theories of evolution, sex education, healthy living, peace, gender equality, gay rights, good business practices, ethics, moral accountability, secularism, nutrition, dance, music, exercise, science, fun, festivals, concerts, theatre, yoga, mindfulness, meditation, technology, women in technology, learning, exploration.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrategic Goal 1:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nCreate HappyNES Studio in Istanbul, Turkey in a manner consistent with support received from patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrategic Goal 2:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nDevelop and perfect a projection mapping pipeline that encourages new associations to technology and collaborators. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrategic Goal 3:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nEnhance the audience experience by creating beautiful and thought provoking aesthetics during live concerts, festivals, and other social events in Turkey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrategic Goal 4:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nIn the case that Turkey\u2019s State of Emergency gets prolonged again, funnel resources towards organizing events rather than focusing solely on enhancing experience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVision Statement:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappyNES has carved out an oasis of positive artistic pursuits in Turkey\u2019s volatile political and economic landscape. The sanctity of our sustainable business is due to an unwavering commitment to aesthetic beauty, technical acumen, and a tall order of ideological and moral questioning. Thus, giving rise to a socially-conscious business that values people by encouraging their development and rewarding their performance. Setting a high bar of reliability, consistency, and quality has changed the art and business scene in Turkey for the better. Beneficiaries of our efforts - Turkish people and the world at large - enjoy meaningful art, engage critically with content put forth, while having fun and being better community builders for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you expect now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLike it was in the start up company I used to work for, we just DID and then came back to the boilerplate, reassessed, reiterated, redefined, and forged onwards. As I see it, the HappyNES experiment is no different. I\u2019m going to do art with a heavy emphasis on video art, visual music, and projection mapping. Get feedback from you along the way, improve, tweak, and move on to the next project. Once a following starts to grow, I hope to scale the projects up and collaborate with other driven, talented people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of a company will it be?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA projection mapping company for live events. A stage design company. A festival organization. Maybe a mixture of all of these, maybe focusing specifically on one, I can\u2019t say just yet. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAt this moment, the only thing I know for sure is this Islamist movement is gaining momentum and it\u2019s time for an institution to be born that is driven by ethical business practices, secularism, accountability, and adequate funding to ensure artists, collaborators, etc. are paid properly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy aspirations are high and my motivation is endless. It is your donation that will help suppressed and profusely creative voices find hope, find happiness. The impact of which could quite literally change the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am tremendously thankful to have a community of people who value what I do. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, your commitment, and your trust.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eRespectfully,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/jpkfsy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
