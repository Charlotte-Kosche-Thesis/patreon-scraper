    "summary": "Hi everyone! My name\nis Hollie and I make short films, predominantly for non-profit organisations,\nNGOs and charities to help tell their stories and showcase the amazing work\nthey\u0027re doing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eA bit about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eEver\nsince I was young I\u0027ve had a fierce creative streak and a very strong\nempathetic instinct. I loved telling stories through art, acting out plays and\nlearning more about new places and new people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter working in\nvarious different jobs when younger, and a degree in drama (another passion of\nmine), I spent some time volunteering in Cambodia and Indonesia. My eyes were\nopened, not only to the harsh reality of life outside of my home country, but\nalso the wonderful people and organisations that are fighting to make the world\na better place. And what\u0027s more, I\u0027d finally found an industry where caring too\nmuch is a good thing! In a nutshell: it made my heart swell.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDetermined to help out\nin some way, I studied again, found my way into filmmaking and photography, and\nhave never looked back. For the last four years I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to\ntravel to all over the world making short videos or shooting photography\nprojects to tell the stories of some incredible non-profits that are changing\npeople\u2019s lives.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe problem:\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnderstandably, non-profit organisations are often operating on extremely tight\nbudget. Paradoxically, donors frown upon non-profits that spend money on\nmarketing, despite it being that same marketing that brings in more donations\nand enables the organisation to help more people. As a result, I am often asked\nto work for free or at discounted rates. This is very hard to say no to, but\nsaying yes is becoming increasingly difficult because sadly, like everyone, I\nhave to pay my bills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ask:\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what I\u0027m thinking\nis this -\u003cstrong\u003e if I can get enough of a production budget per video or\nphotography project from kind patrons, I will eventually be able to offer my\nservices free of charge to amazing non-profits that can\u0027t afford to pay (or at\na discount for those that can only pay a little)\u003c/strong\u003e. Your money will make this\npossible, in turn helping good organisations to raise much larger amounts of\nfunding, \u003cstrong\u003emultiplying the impact of your money several times over\u003c/strong\u003e. A\ngood video or photo can make a huge difference in terms of fundraising, and is\nalso a reward to the hardworking staff and beneficiaries of the organisation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eMy ethical principles:\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI wanted to include\nthis because I think it\u0027s important for patrons to know. Neither the non-profit\nnor filmmaking industries are perfect, so for me it\u0027s important to have this\nset of principles that I adhere to:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI never edit my\nfilms in a way that misrepresents people or the reality of a situation,\nalthough where I can find positivity, I will always do my best to bring it out.\nIn my experience, there is always something positive happening in any\nsituation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI treat everyone I\nmeet with respect. Sometimes I interview people who have been through very\ntough experiences. I have seen filmmakers who will plough on with a set of interview\nquestions to get the best soundbites, regardless of the feelings of the\ninterview subject. I would never do this - I treat them as I would wish to be\ntreated myself.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI put my full heart\ninto every project I do, big or small. My loyalty and motivation lie with the\npeople that the non-profit is seeking to help. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for reading\nand a huge thank you from the bottom of my heart to anyone that is able to be\nmy Patron! If not, I completely understand and hope you will continue to watch,\nshare, and enjoy my work anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHollie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Note: I will aim to do one or two projects a month, but will keep you updated on this! Remember that if you want to cap your pledge so you are not donating more than desired, this is possible. Cheers!\u003cbr\u003e"
