    "summary": "We are a small time, and we mean super small time, YouTube Channel and group of podcast creators who started this whole thing back in 2015 as a hobby and what meager success it has had is still mind blowing to people who never expected anyone to listen to what we have to say. After two years of experimenting and figuring things out and constantly improving we\u0027ve decided to start a patreon with similar expectations as to when we started a podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore anything else we would like to say thank you to anyone, absolutely anyone, who listens to our shows and subscribes to our channel. We are extremely grateful to you for giving us the time of day and whether you listen for free or donate to help us out you are just the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit more about us, at the time of writing this we currently have two shows featured on our channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFriends By Default-\u003cbr\u003eOur flagship show, FBD is a comedy podcast created by Brooks Vernon, Zach Teal, Liam Wallace, and Josh Yaskovich. It includes comedic riffing, guest interviews, special media focused episodes, DnD episodes, and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrooks and Zach Hundred Years-\u003cbr\u003eOur first show, created by Brooks Vernon and Zach Teal, and cohosted by them and Josh Yaskovich and Liam Wallace. It\u0027s mostly just us talking about whatever interests us and what we find hilarious. You can check out the back catalogue on our YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll Like \u0027Em-\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a show from Conor Harris and Josh Yaskovich about all things music with a main focus on bands and artists you might not have heard of but are guaranteed to love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNoice Choice Bois-\u003cbr\u003eOur newest show. A comedy podcast from Liam Wallace and Zach Teal, it\u0027s shorter length and tighter production allows for more focused improvisational bits, and is some of the funniest thirty minutes you can find anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with these shows we have all these plans for new content and series, some in the planning stages and some already filmed/recorded. With all of us having jobs/lives outside of Hundred Years we see this as an opportunity to put some more money/time/love back into the channel, and improve in every way we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if any of this interests you, please consider donating.\u003cbr\u003e"
