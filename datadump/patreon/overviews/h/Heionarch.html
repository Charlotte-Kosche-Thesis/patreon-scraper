    "summary": "I\u0027m a veteran concept artist having worked for video game, movie and toy companies including Sony, Dreamworks, Hasbro, Insomniac Games, Disney and Telltale Games among others, most recently on their Batman and Guardians of the Galaxy series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be creating a sci-fi fantasy space opera graphic novel called \"HEIONARCH\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project will feature the kind of stuff I enjoy designing as a concept artist: Sprawling, far-flung imaginary worlds and cities, weird outlandish characters, robots, creatures, war machines, and of course... huge spaceships! The story will deal with some of my favourite themes - science fiction (of course), forbidden technologies, mysterious and possibly mystical occurrences, political intrigue and ideological conflict.... Initially I plan to do a digital online version, then when I have completed the first few episodes or an entire book I\u0027ll be looking to get a printed version published. I will also be posting behind the scenes work as I go, such as concept art, storyboards, and art demos. More details to come in future posts and videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.rolfmohr.com/Heionarch/Heionarch_DP3_th.jpg\" style=\"width: 521px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e--------------------------------------------\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHEIONARCH \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\"hee-on-ark\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorically the term was \"Helionarch\", when the first ruler of the solar system decided to anoint\u00a0 themselves as such. \u003cbr\u003eOver time the pronunciation of our first exo system rulers dropped the L and it became He\u0027onarch. Then after a few forced language rationalizations, the last of which was rhe New Conformity act of the 32st century which was also a sweeping enforced \"renormalization\" of acceptable social mores,  it got  its final spelling.\u003cbr\u003e(one would think after the digital age all spelling would become locked, but apparently due to humans\u0027 stubborn habit of changing language, they were not interested).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rolfmohr.com/Heionarch/Images/Heionarch_Thumbnail_03.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo after the so-called Singularity, A.I.s became profoundly, and predictably, advanced and surpassed human intelligence. The debate has continued ever since as to whether they are truly conscious no matter how well they appear to reproduce autonomous sentience. Regardless, after various humanity-traumatizing \"disruptions\" of mass unemployment, social unraveling and so on and so forth, society got back to the business of what it was good at. Creating hierarchy, ideological schism, massive wealth gradients, class divides, enslavement and subordination of the \"lesser\" types including synthetic life forms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/419/279/large/rolf-mohr-heinonarch-loredinum-artstation.jpg?1483602818\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e--------------------------------------------\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit more about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConcept artist, art director, writer and teacher.
