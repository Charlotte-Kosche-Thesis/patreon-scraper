The show has been featured on all of the major horror news sites, and even featured in the amazingly awesome horror publication Rue Morgue Magazine.\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter many years of sitting on the idea, I launched TheHomicidalHomemaker.com in February of 2012. Immediately, I had a growing fan base, which has now reached over 22,000 fans on Facebook alone. I did absolutely 100% of everything myself, and out of my own pocket \u2013 developing the recipes, photographing them, building and maintaining the website, and all of the branding and marketing. I always wanted to bring the video element to the website, but honestly just didn\u0027t have the means to do it, both equipment and time wise.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUP9G6peVdI?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2015, I partnered with Neptune Cinema to bring my idea to life \u2013 my own horror-themed cooking show that was not just educational, but also fun and entertaining, and suitable for all levels of kitchen skills. In February of 2016, the show premiered.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_E3ff1E8ck?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Homicidal Homemaker shows delves into many areas that standard cooking shows typically don\u0027t \u2013 usage of miniature models, cinematic vignettes before and after the episode, and music that is unique to every episode. Basically, I get to do what I love \u2013 add my own spooky twist on easy-to-prepare recipes, but also get to make a mini-horror movie in every episode. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1CPZ8jMmr8?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery element of The Homicidal Homemaker cooking show is 100% created FOR the show. Absolutely zero stock footage or music is used. Our crew is small, and wears many hats to make the show a possibility. It\u0027s definitely a labor of love, and we DO love bringing you the episodes. We all do this out of pocket, and we all do this outside of our very busy full-time careers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first goal for Patreon is \n\u003cstrong\u003e$250/month\u003c/strong\u003e, which would allow me to raise funds for my own personal filming equipment for filming bonus content for the channel, as well as in-home crafting and decor tutorials that don\u0027t utilize an entire crew. Having my own personal setup would eliminate the need to travel over 50 miles away to my producer\u0027s studio to shoot an episode, which would allow me to put out content more frequently, as well as introduce a wider variety of entertainment that goes beyond the cooking episodes and product reviews. Some equipment has already been purchased. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE, 07/2017: my in-home studio is 99% complete and SOME additional/new types of content have already been filmed!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmkBV-Wf3iQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo matter what, the regular horror-themed cooking show and #QuickTipsFromTheCrypt (mini-episodes) will always continue\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, but your support via Patreon will allow me to put out additional content, and more frequently, as well as allowing me the opportunity to better connect with my audience, and get a feel for what they would like to see more of.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8zflDL5E7I?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

All recipes have a horror-influence or a general spooky/gross theme, or, is inspired by films or music with a darker aesthetic. With vivid colors and just the right amount of creepy and kitschy, the show combines a cooking show with cinematic segments before and after each recipe, which puts a \"mini horror film\" into each episode. The show utilizes a high-production value, all-original music, and all-original recipes developed by yours ghoulishly. Within the first year, the show was not only available on YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo, but also on the paid-streaming platform Screambox, as well as on AT\u0026amp;T Uverse/Comcast in the Central CA area. Your support on Patreon ensures that I can continue to provide these videos to you.\u003cbr\u003e",
