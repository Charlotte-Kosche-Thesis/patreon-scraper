    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon Page!  My name\u2019s Hal Weeks, and I teach and play autoharp professionally.  The really great thing about the Autoharp is that it allows many individuals to succeed in playing an instrument in a very short time:  many can play a few songs within a few hours!  From there, the sky\u2019s the limit...advanced players often play blues, jazz, classic rock, Irish and classical music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMY \u201cSTALKING THE WILD AUTOHARP\u201d VIDEO TUTORIAL SERIES ON YOUTUBE\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently produce regular Autoharp tutorial videos and lessons, posting about 2-3 videos a month, and keep the access FREE FOR ALL. After producing 50 of these videos, and with no end in sight, I\u2019m addressing  a list of subscribers that grows every day! My videos make learning possible for many people who are far away from an available Autoharp instructor. Modern technology has made it possible for anyone with a computer to find my tutorials and advice.  Perhaps YOU are one of the hundreds who have already benefited, in some way, large or small, from my teaching videos?  Here\u2019s your chance to give back to the process, in a small or large way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I\u0027m doing something important when I see people pick up an instrument and finally succeed at it. Often they venture out into musical community and make new friends and share their sounds. \u00a0This brings healing to the individual, and to the community, and finally to me, because I know my lessons and videos helped! \u00a0My website is sprinkled with quotes from people who have bloomed from playing the Autoharp; many of these folks are people I\u0027ve helped along the way....now YOU can help, too! \u00a0Become a Patron, and help me keep the camera rolling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eBECOME A PATRON--A TIME HONORED WAY OF SUPPORTING ART!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Patronage will  help me with a long list of things including obtaining better video hardware and software, which will help me to upgrade and polish my videos and integrate better teaching aids. If you believe in what I am doing, Patreon offers you a way to show your support! You can partner with me; together we can continue to make my videos and lessons available!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging a little each month, even a dollar, you will help me immeasurably by providing the necessary support for my ongoing efforts to provide valuable teaching resources to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn contributing, you\u2019ll also gain access to a number of nifty reward offerings, available only to my Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
