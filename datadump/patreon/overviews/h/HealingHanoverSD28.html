    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI understand that this crowdfunding site is geared more towards \"Youtube channel creators\" artists, musicians ....etc! \u00a0To me this site offers our community and school district the chance to pitch in and watch it grow! When this page was created it was before the Mill Levy election. At first it was geared towards the Hanover SD and the communities needs, however, since the \"NO\" vote, the School\u0027s needs seem to be just as important.... because these children will be valued community members one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I have lived in the Midway area since 2007. My son started Pre-School at Prairie Heights Elementary during the 2015/16 school year. Wanting to be a part of my sons education and whole school experience, from K-12, was very important to me in any capacity that I was needed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhile being involved with the school directly is not easy for many parents, helping raise funds is!\u003cbr\u003eWhen you see/hear of the issues the school needs funds for you will wonder why the Mill Levy was denied yet again. For those that voted YES, this is your \"YES\". Whether you contribute $1 or $100 a month, This site shows you how much is being raised, where the funds are needed the most....etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSince living here I have seen the need for all kinds of services. Some folks do need a cup of sugar, someones dog is missing, someones roof blew off, someones car was destroyed while driving on unkept roads or a beloved member of our community passed away and the family needs help.\u003cbr\u003eI would love to help this community, However, I cannot do it alone nor always when it is needed the most. But as a community we can have a \"nest egg\" for when something is needed! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis page is accessible to anyone, easily viewed and explained. I have given the password to the super intendant and another parent. I am NOT in charge of this page nor the funds raised. In order for the page to get up and running it needed to have a payment option and I used my debit card. I do not want to be the only one with access to the funds raised, my card is just temporary until myself or someone opens an account for everyone.\u003cbr\u003eMark Beazley has been donating $20 per month just to get it started and to show that we are in this for the long haul.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
