Don\u0027t you want to live in a world where maybe, when you least expect it, twenty people will get on the bus you\u0027re sitting on, play \"No Diggity,\" and then leave? Where a Mardi Gras parade appears out of nowhere, even though it\u0027s twelve degrees outside and snowing? We\u0027re trying to make that world, at least in Hartford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery now and then, we get paid to play. Mostly, we don\u0027t, and that is fine - no one\u0027s quitting their day job for this. But we do have expenses, and the closer we come to covering them, the more often we can be out in the world, playing and raising a ruckus. We\u0027ll do with your pledge what we do with any money we get from gigs: keep it in common and use it for gas, food, instrument repair, and making shiny, gold and blue satin capes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePractically every week, we\u0027re out there bringing smiles and funk to the neighborhoods, non-profits, and fun-loving people of Connecticut. By pledging, you help us bring joy and spontaneity to the streets and beyond, and you help all the other creators and worthy non-profits to whom we so often lend our services."

We\u0027re pretty much like that, provided that the problem you have is a lack of brass and ruckus. Also, we don\u0027t punch dudes, we\u0027re not on the run from the law (yet), and we\u0027re pretty easy to find. But we do have a sweet bus!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re a funky brass band, loosely in the New Orleans second line style. We play traditional tunes (like \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\" and \"Big Chief\"), blues tunes (like \"Hoochie Coochie Man\"), modern covers (like \"No Diggity\" and \"Faith\"), and original songs. We usually have about 16 members, including sousaphone, trash can bass drum, snare, saxes, trumpets, trombones, cowbell, washboard, euphonium, and piccolo. We don\u0027t need to set up or plug in anywhere. We just show up and make the people dance and smile.\u003cbr\u003e",
