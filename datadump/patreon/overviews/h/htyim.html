Yim. There isn\u0027t much I\u0027m certain of in\nlife \u2013 except that I want to write.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI dream about making an impact on the world through stories, by drawing\nattention to issues in a way people can empathize with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nVague\nand lofty proclamations aside, here are some examples from my bibliography thus\nfar: \u003cbr\u003e\nMy first book was a marijuana memoir which sought to increase awareness about\nrecreational use, and some of its positive and negative aspects. My first short\nstory addressed a type of rape which our society tends to overlook (itching to\ntell you more but then I\u0027d ruin it). And the piece that made me feel most\nfulfilled to complete was a history essay written by a student in the future,\ndescribing the circumstances that enabled the birth of the Earth Republic (it\ndid mention a Bernie Sanders administration\u2026 so clearly, I\u2019d starve as a\npsychic!). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy heart lies in science fiction and fantasy, though, and I\u2019ve also written\nsome fanfiction. I wrote a vision of how (obliged to say GAME OF THRONES\nSPOILER ALERT, even though HBO already revealed the secret) Lady Lyanna and\nPrince Rhaegar fell in love. I finished \u201cNewtopia Rising\u201d, a space rock opera\non behalf of my spirit animal Todd Chavez from the show Bojack Horseman,\ntouching on various topics including climate change, LGBTQ, and the prison\nsystem. And right now, I\u2019m working on a screenplay for Doctor Who (Twelve and\nClara forever!) which not-so-subtly talks about the humane treatment of\nanimals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://htyim.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/why.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve\nbeen dying to write my next two books (not to bash the memoir genre\u2026 but real\nnovels omg).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cMimesis\u201d is a coming-of-age story with a predominantly romantic focus,\ncommentating on the empowering yet toxic nature of our celebrity culture. In\nterms of form, I\u0027d like to have fun with the writing and change the style\ndepending on which acting role the characters are playing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cThe Tides of Change\u201d will be an underwater epic fantasy. The underlying theme\nwill be the impact of human-induced climate change (not so fun I know, but\nit\u2019ll also have MERPEOPLE AHHH).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd along the way, I\u2019d love to get distracted by short stories \u2013 at times full\nof hope for the future, at others slightly depressing, considering the current\npolitical landscape...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut with trying to earn a living, volunteering, and struggling to manage a\nsocial life (curse you, family and friends, if only I didn\u0027t love you!),\nprogress has been agonizingly slow. It took an entire year to finish \u201cNewtopia\nRising\u201d at under 17,000 words \u2013 though in my defense, the whole damned thing\nrhymed. \u201cMimesis\u201d was first conceived over two years ago and is only 1/8th of\nthe way in, with no excuse about the constraints of poetic composition and with\nno end in sight.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve yet to make any money through writing. And to make my financial matters\nworse, I\u2019m determined that 50% of profits from the marijuana memoir go to the\nNational Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in the U.S. (here in\nCanada, it\u2019ll be legalized July 1st, 2018! Hurray for evidence-based\npolicymaking!). For \u201cMimesis\u201d, 100% of profits will go to Kollaboration, a\nnon-profit seeking to increase non-stereotypical representation of Asian\nartists in the media. And for \u201cThe Tides of Change\u201d, 50% of profits will go towards\nfunding The Ocean Cleanup, a tech foundation devoted to combating plastic\npollution in our waters.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting is my forever calling, and will take place whether or not I\u2019m starving\n(so long as I\u2019m not starving to death, I guess?). But your patronage will speed\nthe process and help buy food. Also, I really like whiskey xD~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://htyim.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/what.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL YOU GET?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nbelieve creative content should be freely available on the Internet, and make all my\nwork available for free download on my website. So honestly speaking, you can\naccess my writing without Patreon\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut what I can give patrons is a) early access to content before it\u2019s\npublished, b) exclusive insight into the process (which, I warn you, tends to\nbe messy), c) exclusive glimpses into my personal life (which tends to be even\nmessier, but I\u2019m thinking mostly cosplay and/or mildly funny photos ^__^), and\nd) exclusive access to poetry (which tends to be soul-baring and super\nembarrassing, but apparently my pride has a price tag).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of all, your patronage would enable me to focus on my dream as a writer,\nand to hopefully change hearts and minds through the written word.\u003cbr\u003e"
