    "summary": "I first discovered Irish music back in \u201898 with the rise of Riverdance, and something about the tinwhistle spoke to my soul in a way no other instrument up to that point had. My first whistle was an $8 Fead\u00f3g and since then, my music \u201ccareer\u201d has been unique and varied. Along the way, I gained experience in research, teaching private lessons, tutoring, and early music history. Irish music (and its early counterpart \u2014 Renaissance dance music) has remained my passion for almost 20 years now, and making it \u2014 and the tinwhistle \u2014 accessible to other, budding enthusiasts is something that brings me much joy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Because I remember just starting out and the struggle of trying to learn what I could for free as a kid without a job (and therefore no funds to put toward music lessons), I want to offer all my materials as freely as possible...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...But unfortunately, those materials take time, money, and tangible resources to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where YOU come in! \ud83d\ude43\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic lessons can be expensive. On average for my region (the Pacific Northwest), you are looking at $18 to $25 per 30-minute lesson. Every week. That can rack up a pretty significant bill rather quickly, and can be unfeasible for many to budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron at whatever level and amount you are comfortable with, you can help me do what I do best \u2014 teach and inspire the next generation of musicians \u2014 and keep it free. \u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRESUME\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e+Over 25 years of musical study, including 18 years of performance.\u003cbr\u003e+Studied music under Dr. Bill Perconti (Lewis-Clark State College, 2003-2006)\u003cbr\u003e+Bachelor of Arts: Literature (including Medieval \u0026amp; Renaissance literature, and European folklore), Lewis-Clark State College, 2006\u003cbr\u003e+Music produced on Bandcamp: http://heatherthebard.bandcamp.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2014-2015: Regional Head of Historical Early Music Performance, An Tir, Society for Creative Anachronism (Medieval \u0026amp; Renaissance historical society)\u003cbr\u003e2014-2015: Instructor at The Zoen: Online Music Lessons\u003cbr\u003e2013 \u0026amp; 2014: Tumbleweed Music Festival performer, Three Rivers Folklife society, Richland WA\u003cbr\u003e2011: Self-employed private lesson Music teacher\u003cbr\u003e2010: Under a Celtic Moon II, Liberty Theater, Dayton WA\u003cbr\u003e2005-2006: Irish Celebration of Dance, Lewiston Civic Theater \u0026amp; Festival Dance, Clarkston WA\u003cbr\u003e2003: Lewis \u0026amp; Clark Discovery Faire, Lewiston Chamber of Commerce, Lewiston ID\u003cbr\u003e"
