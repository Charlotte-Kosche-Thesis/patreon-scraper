Sometimes I tell stories, sometimes I play with cards and curiosities, sometimes I talk about other people\u0027s neat things and sometimes I just laze around on a couch or in the sun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m called Vale, or more formally V. Medina.  I write things, though not for a living.  You can, however, find my work in a forthcoming anthology and I was one of the contributing authors who penned an essay for the Disabled People Destroy Science Fiction Kickstarter.\u00a0 I also make bite sized bits on Twitter and longer stuff over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.howsweethtewords.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from when I\u0027m being a ridiculous cat, I\u0027m also a queer, non-binary, blind, mentally ill and biracial person striving to make a living out of their words.  I like all things caffeinated, horror movies, poetry, all kinds of music, creating delicious food, and occasionally trying my hand at making various kinds of art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why do the Patreon thing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live off of disability right now.  While I try and occasionally get freelancing work or sell a story, this does not add up to a steady paycheck.\u00a0 Out of home work is not easy for me, as part of my issues include agoraphobia, and while I would love to find work-from-home positions, it\u0027s not always easy.\u00a0 This Patreon is meant to be just one of a number of streams of income I have to help support me and make sure I can still get food, meds, doctors and everything else I need each month so I can keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I have on offer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI offer micro-fiction, short stories, blog posts, short fiction recommendations, and prompts for you to stir up your own writing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you be charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I\u0027m shooting for posting once a week, I will only charge once each month.\u00a0 Just about everything can be found over at www.howsweetthewords.com or on my Twitter (@howsweettheword) which is mostly where quick updates and the microfiction live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish you kindness and good things, no matter who you are, no mater what brought you here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
