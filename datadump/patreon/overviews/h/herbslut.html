    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Luna, a white, queer, feminist, sex-positive, non-monogamous herbalist living with chronic illness and HSV 1+2. I currently work a part-time day job, attend herb school, host local non-monogamy, kink, and sex-related events, and produce content for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.herbslut.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e and social media pages. Through my work, I try to provide sex education, herbal information, musings on health and healthcare, and most of all, a place where people (hopefully) see their own feelings and experiences reflected, and know they aren\u0027t alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m new to Patreon, but hoping I can use it to fund more of the work I am most passionate about!\u00a0I want to keep providing as much as I can for free and on a sliding scale-- not just while I\u0027m getting started, but forever. I understand the struggle to get adequate healthcare, nutrition, connection, pleasure, and information. I believe we all have a right to these and more! I hope to eventually practice as a clinical herbalist, mostly focusing on one-on-one sessions, but also teaching in group settings. I always want this work to be accessible, which means people will pay (or not) based on what they can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is one way to start doing that now! If you appreciate the work I\u0027m doing, and can afford to donate, please consider becoming a patron. I\u0027ll be eternally grateful, and you\u0027ll be helping to keep my site available to everyone.
