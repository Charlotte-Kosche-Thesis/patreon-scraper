    "summary": "There is surely no greater purpose in this life than raising the next generation in the love of Jesus and the knowledge of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday\u0027s children need Jesus and His Word so desperately, and in order to reach them we need predictable financial support.\u00a0 Become a patron today and help us reach our goal, to reach more children around the world with the Gospel than ever before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChildren are watching hours of video every day and we intend to be there for them, so we are doing an exciting new thing; meeting children where they are and in a medium they will connect with and enjoy. To fulfil this vital mission, we need resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Joseph Cheetham-Wilkinson, I am the writer and creator of Jovis Bon-Hovis, a Bible-centred children\u0027s show seen on television networks around the world. \u00a0I am also the producer of \u0027Faith in Action\u0027, and our newest children\u0027s show currently in post production, \u0027Scripture Seekers\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut sporadic episodes and occasional series\u0027 just aren\u0027t reaching children where they are.\u00a0 Your money will enable us to set up a studio for the production of free, daily, wholesome Christian videos for all children, worldwide. Jesus said, \u201cLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\u201d Why us? We have years of experience producing Christian content for children, but it\u0027s mainly been for TV, and it\u0027s time to expand the vision and the reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a completely unique mission. \u00a0There is nobody currently making high quality daily Christian videos for all children everywhere. Children are watching a vast quantity of videos online every single day, even in the poorest countries the technology is becoming available at an alarming rate. So let us grasp that opportunity and share Jesus with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy videos? Children around the world are spending hours every day watching video content online on phones, tablets and computers. The good news of Jesus must be there for them, not just in one-off television series\u0027 and productions, but as a sincere, committed, long-term strategy of ongoing DAILY teaching. Children want Jesus! So let\u0027s show Him to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur fun, engaging Christ-centred videos will always be free, always fresh, always daily, and always made easily accessible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a large-scale vision for a significant impact on a new generation, and we are looking for people who want to know that their money is being used powerfully and effectively, in a way that makes a real and long-term difference to lives.\u00a0 Believers who think there is value in sound education, and recognise the enormous opportunity we have to nurture and develop budding faith in children. The Bible says in Proverbs 22.6: \u201cStart children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.\u201d That is the command, so let us do it together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world\u0027s children need Jesus, more than ever children need hope and a future.  We are expert in creating captivating and fun videos with puppets and lovable human characters which children will come back to again and again.  We will also prioritise promotion to ensure your money is well spent, making the videos clearly visible and not buried on a back page of the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur success is directly linked to the time and resources we have to invest in our ministry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are devoted to making a relationship with God through Jesus relevant, appealing and exciting to children and adults.  We seek to truthfully and responsibly minister God\u0027s Word, and while we are active members of our church, we are not working on behalf on one particular denomination.  Click the button at the top of this page to join us in the great commission, by committing to nurture children\u0027s faith as they grow in this new, exciting and very necessary way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What exactly will these videos look like?\u003cbr\u003eA: These videos will be vibrant, fun and engaging, full of character and colour.  We will be using puppets and human characters to present Bible readings and explanations in a clear, child-friendly way with humour and personality.  We will be using a varied cast of characters and friends of Jovis Bon-Hovis who will all make regular appearances in order to add variety while maintaining familiarity. The set will be bold, eye-catching and colourful, in a friendly style, professionally designed and constructed. Each daily video will be around 3-4 minutes long.\u003cbr\u003eQ: What kind of topics will you cover?\u003cbr\u003eA: We believe that the Bible is relevant to young lives, and that there are as many topics to cover as there are stories, parables and concepts in Scripture. Every episode will be carefully produced with the child in mind, not watering down theology but rather creating nutritious milk appropriate for young palates. \u003cbr\u003eQ: How long do I have to commit for?\u003cbr\u003eA: You can cancel your commitment whenever you like.  We would like patrons to join us for the long term, but if you can only give for a few months we would be very grateful.\u003cbr\u003eQ: Is this a charity?\u003cbr\u003eA: No. We have looked into becoming a charity and decided that it will be more cost and time efficient, at least at first, to operate through traditional patronage. By becoming a patron, you are commissioning us to undertake a good work. Patronage offers some of the advantages of having charitable status, such as not being motivated solely by profit margins, freeing us to simply do what we are good at.\u003cbr\u003eQ: What happens to the money raised before the threshold?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u00a310,000 pcm is the first major milestone, this is where the budget-proper kicks in and our foundational production of daily children\u0027s videos can begin in earnest. Until that time money will be used to prepare and make ourselves ready for the launch so we can hit the ground running.  We will be prioritising public awareness in order to reach our goal as soon as possible, the purchase of equipment in advance, legal documents and fees, website and social media development, normal living expenses, production of sets and props, rent and preparation of studio space.\u003cbr\u003eQ: Are we giving this money to you personally?\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes. \u00a0Patronage represents an established and time-honoured system of commissioning and releasing people into a good work. Historically all kinds of people have been funded by patrons from artists to missionaries to students. \u00a0Patronage exists to release gifted and talented people to undertake work in their field of expertise which they would otherwise have been unable to carry out, by seeking like minded people who are willing to support them. In the past, this has often been acheived with several large donors, but modern platforms like Patreon now allow larger numbers of people to support good causes with smaller amounts. \u00a0 With this mission we are going further than soley the traditional salary support, and also committing to invest in an entire studio structure including lighting, cameras, computers, office furniture, rent, internet, fuel, accountancy and legal, and everything else associated with running an efficient and effective ministry.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My name is Joseph Cheetham-Wilkinson, and I am a producer of Christian video content. \u00a0For the last 7 years I have worked on a number of projects including Jovis Bon-Hovis, which is seen on TV networks all over the world. \u00a0My passion is for sharing the good news of the Gospel with Christians and non-Christians alike, and in recent years the internet has provided us with a superb platform for sharing God\u0027s word. \u00a0When producing for television, there are networks willing to pay for quality content like Jovis, but broadcasting only on Christian networks massively reduces the potential reach of anything we produce, and also forces us to think in terms of money and saleability. We are keen to reach a level of quality in our productions which matches anything seen on Christian networks, but to make them completely freely available online and without subscription, as God\u0027s word should be. For this, we need financial backers.",
