I\u2019ve been the\nsole driving force behind the site since it began in 2011, watching on with\namazement at the growth and ever-increasing engagement I\u2019ve been able to\ncultivate amongst our own supporters and football fans in general during that\nperiod.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUntil very recently, my only source of income from HLTCO has\ncome from direct advertising through banners placed on the website itself or\nbespoke references made to companies via my social media accounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI won\u2019t lie to you, I hate that side of things with a\npassion but until now, there has been no way around it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are plenty of huge advertising platforms that will readily\nplace banners on any site and pay you for the traffic you generate each month\nwithout any care or thought for the specific preferences of your readership. I\ncare deeply about the perception of both HLTCO and myself to those who\nregularly read the site or engage with me over Twitter and have taken a number\nof measures to ensure that I\u2019m not looked upon as a \u201csell-out\u201d after a period\nof something approaching success. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat being said, the way online media companies operate is\nchanging at a rapid pace, with the biggest movers and shakers placing more and\nmore pressure on the shoulders of the individuals (me included) who create\ndaily content for a small but extremely dedicated readership. Having started\nHLTCO as nothing more than a hobby, I am now extremely conscious of allowing my\ntone and style to change forever because of decisions made by some faceless\nexecutive in an office on the other side of the Atlantic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is with this in mind that I have taken the plunge and\ncreated the page you now find yourself browsing. If you have read this far, it\nmeans you are at least mildly interested in HLTCO and for that I thank you and\nencourage you to have a look at my plans going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eHow are things going to change?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nIn essence, everything will remain exactly the same to start\nwith. I have established what I like to feel is a personal style of writing\nthat offers Palace fans (and interested onlookers) an easily accessible and\nrelatively authoritative opinion on everything going in SE25 from day-to-day,\nwhether that be through articles placed on \u003ca href=\"http://www.hltco.org/\"\u003ewww.hltco.org\u003c/a\u003e\nor on the Twitter page @HLTCO. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m weary of trying too desperately to\nfix something that isn\u2019t already broken, although I am aware that there are\nplenty of people who would love to see the club covered in far more detail than\nI can already manage, which is something I have always looked towards as the\nultimate and (until now) unreachable goal of the site, until now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would love nothing more than to devote all of my time to\nwriting about the club in its numerous different strands, without having to\nworry about holding down a 9-5 job alongside it. The site really has gone from\nstrength to strength in the seven years it\u2019s been up and running but I now\nregularly find myself banging my head against a figurative glass ceiling when\nattempting to step up the level of coverage I am able to offer because of a\nlack of hours in the day and the need to sleep each night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could continue to muddle through, maintaining the status quo for the foreseeable future but the last few months have seen\nme grow a tad restless, keen to push things onto the next level and produce\ncontent with far more regularity than I already do; sadly, to do that,\nfinancial considerations are dragged kicking and screaming to the forefront of\nmy mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eHow much are you asking for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI\u2019m not exactly comfortable with the idea of asking people\nfor money in exchange for what tumbles out from inside my brain onto a page,\nwhich is why I will be asking for the minimum monthly donation of $1 from each\nof you, rather than implementing any sort of tiered reward system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn line with that, it\u2019s important to say that the website\nitself will remain completely open and free to anyone who wants to access it; I\ndon\u2019t want to wall-off content or demand that you open your wallet to\ncontribute, I would much rather know that the people who have decided to send\nany pennies my way are doing so because they appreciate the effort and care that\ngoes into running HLTCO.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst I will of course have to make occasional\nreferences to Patreon in a bid to raise awareness, I don\u2019t intend to ram it\ndown your collective throats; you\u2019re here to read about a football club, not be\nbombarded by a glorified begging campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt this point, I feel compelled to say that $1 is the base\nlevel of funding that Patreon allows, meaning that if you are able and willing\nto send a little bit extra my way, you can. It goes without saying but if you\ndo want to give anything more than a dollar, I would be eternally grateful to\nyou forever more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it\u2019s a well-worn supermarket catchphrase in the minds of many these\ndays but every little really does help. You\u2019d be surprised how quickly an extra\npound here and there adds up when it\u2019s done on a large scale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat\u2019s the long-term plan?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI\u2019m lucky enough to currently work for a company that will\nallow me to gradually lessen my workload over time in accordance with the\npotential growth of my earnings from HLTCO, meaning that the eventual aim of\nthis venture is to become a full-time writer, dedicating a complete working\nweek to covering Crystal Palace FC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith that in mind, I have broken down my current monthly\nsalary into five bite-sized chunks of $600 (between \u00a3480-500), meaning that\neach time I hit the next target, I will be able to remove a day from my regular\nworking week and dedicate it to HLTCO instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nObviously, should the level of funding ever reach the fifth\n\u201cgoal\u201d I will be able to quit my current job entirely and begin to run the\nwebsite on a completely full-time basis but for now, I\u2019m cautious of getting\ntoo far ahead of myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI should say that I am keen not to come across as greedy\nwhen laying out my long-term aims for the site but as I\u2019m sure many of you will\nfully understand, the need to pay bills, keep up with my mortgage payments and\noccasionally put food on the table means that I have to allow a little leeway\nin my financial planning. If, by some minor miracle we ever make it above the\nfinal target, I will revaluate and look at further expansion but for now, let\u2019s\nkeep our feet firmly on the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eHow will HLTCO change with direct funding?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nAs previously touched upon, the need to drive readers\ntowards advertising is something of a dark cloud hanging over every independent\nblogger aiming to make a bit of spare cash in the modern world but with your\nhelp, I hope to be able to adapt the website so that it is completely advert\nand pop-up free, focussing purely on news and opinion relating to Crystal\nPalace FC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI hate clickbait articles as much as anyone, believe me. In\nmany ways, it\u2019s the bad taste they leave in the mouth which has led me here,\ndesperate to clamber off the slippery slope towards the black hole of\nadvertising dependency before it\u2019s too late to escape. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere has been a\nworrying shift towards a style of \u201cjournalism\u201d that focuses solely on pulling\nyou onto the page without anything substantial for you to sink your teeth into\nonce you\u2019re there, I would love this venture to provide me with a platform to\navoid that side of things altogether but without meaning to sound too soppy, I\nsimply can\u2019t do it without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eAre you finished?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that covers everything for the time being\nalthough, if anyone does have any further questions or queries I\u2019ll make sure\nto get back to them in a prompt, professional and friendly manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is completely new territory for me and to tell you the\ntruth, it\u2019s an extremely nerve-wracking thing to ask of people. It\u2019s obviously\nan extremely exciting prospect but it remains hugely daunting too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor seven years, HLTCO has attracted a lively and\never-growing army of Palace (and general football) fans to interact with,\nenabling me to improve as both a writer and a person and for that, I can do\nnothing other than thank every one of you for the support shown to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, I am hoping that the same feelings of goodwill and a\ncore appreciation for the site can lead me towards producing content designed\ndirectly and solely for you as a reader, without any hint of reliance on\nmulti-national advertising companies run by apathetic executives with no feel\nfor what the everyday supporter wants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for reading this sprawling ramble, the\nfact that I even feeling capable of asking something like this of you says a\ngreat deal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUp the Palace!\u003cbr\u003e"
