You can give as much or as little as you can.\u00a0I am eternally grateful for anything you wish to contribute, but more importantly, I\u0027m just grateful for you and your on-going support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn example of what I do is here...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/udbDqmEhJgQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your support go...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work, and want to see more of it more often, then you\u0027ll benefit from becoming a Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far my donations have allowed me to;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Release a crochet video tutorial every Friday.
