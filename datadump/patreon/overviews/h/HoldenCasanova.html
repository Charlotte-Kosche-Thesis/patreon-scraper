    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Holden. You probably know me from either my personal channel \"HoldenReviews\" or the podcast that I co-hosted called \"PodTaku\", or maybe the podcast that I am currently a part of called \"Anime no Yume\" that I not only host but do all of the editing for as well! I am here on Patreon because I want to push my video making hobby to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my content and want more of it in a timely manner, pledging here on Patreon is by far the best way to do so. No amount is too little or large.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work as a freelance motion graphics artist \u0026amp; animator. While I do love animating and making motion graphics it doesn\u0027t take up that much of my time as business has been pretty straight forward, resulting in quick turnaround times and finishing most orders in a day or so. This gives me time to focus on creating content for my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those as skeptical as I am about Patreon, let me give you the rundown on the set up I have for my page. When you pledge an amount I will receive a portion of that (about 95% with the other 5% going to Patreon) upon the upload of a video that was meant to be funded. Because of this you won\u2019t get charged for random, no effort update videos, only the quality content. You will get charged around the end of the month and if I post multiple videos you will be charged for each. \u003cstrong\u003eRather importantly! You can set a monthly limit so you do not end up paying for more than you bargained for.\u003c/strong\u003e I HIGHLY suggest you do this so that you don\u2019t end up getting charged more than you were willing to generously donate. If there is ever a problem with this you can talk to me personally and we can resolve it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently only aim to make one video a month as a starting point, but in the future I aim for them to become bi-weekly by using the finances raised here to help hire some extra help to speed up production cycle tremendously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Whether you choose to pledge or not, if you EVER want to talk to me personally please \u003cstrong\u003edo not hesitate\u003c/strong\u003e to contact me via any of these methods:Twitter: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/HoldenReviews\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/HoldenReviews\u003c/a\u003e (direct messages are open)My public Discord server: \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/0uYgLZpzAFiH0kDc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/0uYgLZpzAFiH0kDc\u003c/a\u003e (No account required)Youtube Comments: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HoldenReviews\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/HoldenReviews\u003c/a\u003e (I respond to every comment)If you find that you cannot make any financial contributions to the channel that is completely fine and the fact that you took the time to even read this far means a lot to me. Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Holden\u003cbr\u003e"
