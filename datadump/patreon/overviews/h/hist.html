    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Hist and what does \u0027Hist\u0027 actually mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer is two-fold: there\u0027s the origin of the name, and then there\u0027s what it means to me today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name Hist came from a poem I heard when I was just an ankle biter (around the time dinosaurs roamed the Earth). It\u0027s by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/denniscj/bookforkids/hist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eC.J. Dennis\u003c/a\u003e, who was an Australian poet from the early 20th century. The first stanza goes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHist! . . . . . . Hark!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe night is very dark,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd we\u0027ve to go a mile or so\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eAcross the Possum Park.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was a children\u0027s book version (that I\u0027d like to get my hands on one day), which had these wonderfully eerie illustrations and I remember sitting cross-legged with my classmates, in rapt attention as our teacher spun this tale of darkness and foreboding. I didn\u0027t see the poem again until I became a teacher myself and found it lurking in a dusty corner of the school\u0027s library. Reading it as an adult was an entirely different experience, but the nostalgia was real. Even after \u003cem\u003e[an undisclosed number of]\u003c/em\u003e years, flipping through those pages still brought back some of that eeriness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe underlying theme of the channel\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eis giving people\u003cbr\u003ethe confidence to\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eventure out and experience\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003esomething\u003cbr\u003enew and exciting.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCut to about a year ago, when I decided to make a real go of this YouTube thing, and it made sense to call myself \u0027Hist\u0027. Not only was I embarking on this strange and unknown journey to who knows where, but the name represented a seemingly insignificant experience that stuck with me for years to come. And \u003cem\u003eTHIS\u003c/em\u003e is what my channel is about. I\u0027m starting off with instructional videos for \u0027World of Warcraft,\u0027 but the underlying theme here is giving people the confidence to venture \u0027\u003cem\u003eacross the Possum Park\u003c/em\u003e\u0027, and experience something new and exciting, and hopefully make some new friends along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInclusiveness\u003c/em\u003e is definitely something\u00a0I\u0027d love to see become\u003cbr\u003ea hallmark of\u00a0the community.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows what lies on the other side (chicken joke, anyone?), but I\u0027ve been loving the journey thus far. Not only have I been learning and growing as an individual, but to see the subscriber base steadily grow with people who are genuinely interested in the channel\u0027s content is just so heart-warming. What\u0027s more, people come together in my Twitch livestream channel, offering to help each other out, and just generally enjoying the company of others. The inclusiveness is definitely something I\u0027d love to see become a hallmark of this community. That and perhaps a little less of my goldfish memory, and spoonerisms (which have been lovingly referred to as \u003cem\u003eHistlish\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s my story. I want to foster a community where people feel comfortable trying new things, and subsequently help each other have positive experiences in an environment that can be really quite toxic in its exclusion of those deemed \u0027unworthy\u0027 or \u0027noob\u0027. The way I see it, we\u0027re all good at something, so by helping each other out we can become better at everything. I see no reason to ever be elitist or put others down simply because they don\u0027t have an identical skill-set to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn that note, thanks for taking the time to read through to the end of this perhaps verbose \u0027creation story\u0027. Enjoy the rest of your morning, day, afternoon, evening -- whatever the case may be -- and I\u0027ll hopefully see you in the YouTube comments or Twitch chat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
