I have created Hikari Woodwind Quintet in hopes of playing not only classical music but lots and lots of amazing video game music! I majored in Performance of Music - Oboe at University of British Columbia. I was a kid dreaming to be a member of a famous symphonic orchestra but as I grew older, I realized how hard that task was. I felt a little bit discouraged after auditioning to many music schools such as Julliard and New England Conservatory for Masters. The world that I thought I knew was a lot bigger and had so many talented players fighting over for only one or two open seats. As much as I love music, I did not like the truth of the world as a musician. So I decided to start a brand new journey and started a YouTube channel where I play my favorite video games. After two years since I graduated, I felt I was missing something... I felt like I will never truly be happy if I do not continue to play Oboe. So I started to take lessons again from my teacher. After few months, I still felt just taking a lesson or two per month was not enough. I realized that I really loved the setup of a small ensemble where everyone works together to create one harmonized music. This is when I decided to create Hikari Woodwind Quintet. I am very excited to share my brand new journey with you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Paul Hung - Flute]\u003cbr\u003eBorn in Taiwan, Paul Hung entered the Langley Fine Arts School at the age of 13 and made his first concerto debut at the age of 16 at the Whistler Music Festival. He was then featured several times as the winner of the Vancouver Kiwanis competition, and awarded the Tom Lee Music scholarship for Excellence in Music Performance. He was a recipient of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s \u201cGalaxie Rising Stars Award\u201d and placed Second in National Music Competitions 2008. Paul performed with the Vancouver Youth Orchestra as a result of attaining first place in the concerto competition in 2009. Soon after, he performed as a soloist with the Abbotsford Symphony and New Westminster Symphony. In May of 2011, Paul won a spot in the YouTube Symphony and performed with 100 other musicians around the world at the Sydney Opera House. \n\nAs a passionate solo and chamber flute player, Paul performed in music festivals such as the Banff music festival, Domaine Forget, MusicFest Canada, Performing Arts BC, Vancouver Kiwanis Music Festival, Redshift Music Society and Health Arts Society. Paul also plays frequently as a substitute with Vancouver Symphony and Kamloops Symphony. He was the substitute principal flute at Vancouver Island Symphony and Okanagan Symphony in 2014. In 2015 to 2017 season, he serves as the acting principal flute at Prince George Symphony. \n\nPaul was a student of Lorna McGhee, the principal flutist of Pittsburgh Symphony. He has also studied under Brenda Fedoruk; and then Christie Reside during his Master\u0027s degree at UBC School of Music. He is currently a faculty of Vancouver Academy of Music and the St. James Academy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Aidan Wong - Clarinet]\u003cbr\u003eCanadian-born composer and clarinetist\nAidan Mulldoon Wong always intended to be a veterinarian. He began piano\nlessons at age 6 and only lasted a couple of years before quitting in lieu of\nvideo games. However - and much to his chagrin - his parents signed him up for\nlessons again some years later. This round, however, was much more successful,\nas Aidan cultivated a growing interest in both movie and video game soundtracks\nand sought to play them on the piano. Upon a fateful viewing of \u201cHow to Train\nYour Dragon,\u201d he fell in love with John Powell\u2019s score for the movie and was so\ninspired that it gave him the final push to decide to pursue his master quest \u2013\na career in performance and composition. In the meantime, Aidan attended the Langley\nFine Arts School where he developed a passion for the clarinet. Despite\nstarting relatively late, he started his undergraduate degree at the University\nof British Columbia School of Music, where he is currently in his fifth year,\npursuing a double major in composition and clarinet performance. Aidan has\nstudied with Jeanette Jonquil, Cris Inguanti, and Michelle Goddard for\nclarinet, and Dorothy Chang, Stephen Chatman, and Jocelyn Morlock for\ncomposition. Aidan has played with many ensembles\nincluding the UBC Symphony Orchestra, UBC Symphonic Wind Ensemble, the\nVancouver Metropolitan Orchestra, and an assortment of chamber ensembles. He\nlooks forward to joining the multiplayer Hikari Quintet in what he considers to\ncombine a triforce of his favourite things \u2013 video game music, clarinet, and\nperformance!\u003cbr\u003eCheck out his official webpage where you can purchase his music:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aidanmulldoonwong.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.aidanmulldoonwong.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Carrie To - Bassoon]\u003cbr\u003eHi there,\nmy name is Carrie To and I play bassoon with the Hikari Woodwind Quintet. I am\nvery excited to be a part of this vibrant group and we look forward to bringing\nyou music of different genres. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nA typical\nAsian child, I began piano lessons (poking at the keyboard in my kindergarten)\nat age 2 and that was enough to kindle my love for music. Since then, I have\ndedicated a large part of my life to learning as many instruments as I can,\nincluding: piano, clarinet, Chinese zither, bassoon, contrabassoon, harp and am\nteaching myself the ukulele. Determination to pursue a musical career has\nbrought me to the University of British Columbia and the Royal College of Music\nwhere I completed my Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees in Orchestral Performance,\nrespectively. Sharing the raw emotion of music with audiences is a passion and\ndream of mine and I am lucky enough to have been able to do that in British\nColumbia with the Vancouver Philharmonic Orchestra, New Westminster Symphony\nOrchestra, Opera Appassionata, Academy Symphony Orchestra, Vancouver\nMetropolitan Orchestra, Vancouver Oratorio Society, Sea to Sky Symphony, and\nPostmodern Camerata; in London, UK as part of various ensembles at the Queen\nElizabeth Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and the Bishopsgate Institute; in Hong\nKong with the Hong Kong Band Directors\u2019 Wind Orchestra and the City Chamber\nOrchestra of Hong Kong. I hope to continue performing and connecting with\npeople through music and cannot wait to share the wonders of music with you at\nfuture Hikari Woodwind Quintet performances and on videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Nick Anderson - French horn]\u003cbr\u003eSince moving to Vancouver in 2003 from his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, hornist Nick Anderson has been active as both a performer and educator. Nick received a Masters of Music in Horn Performance from The University of British Columbia. He plays 2nd Horn with the Vancouver Opera and regularly performs with many other ensembles including the Vancouver Symphony, Touch of Brass Quintet, Turning Point Ensemble, Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra, Kamloops Symphony and the Vancouver Island Symphony.  Nick is active as a session musician and has recorded with numerous bands in various genres. As an educator, Nick is dedicated to sharing his love of music through masterclasses, clinics, and his own teaching studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Marco Del Rio - Arranger]\u003cbr\u003eMarco Del Rio loves music. He can\u2019t make up his mind about what it is he loves most about it, so he\u2019s become a multi-instrumentalist, music educator, conductor, and composer. Born and raised in Vancouver, Marco\u2019s love of music was forged at an early age by obsessive listening to the soundtracks of classic video games \u2013 most notably the soundtracks to Chrono Trigger, Mega Man X, Legend of Mana, and the somewhat more obscure Wanderers from Ys. He went on to study at Capilano University and the University of British Columbia, where he graduated with both a Bachelor of Music and a Bachelor of Education. Although he intends to teach for a living, he is now taking time to explore and create all sorts of crazy and energetic music before settling into the demands of a high school teaching career. He co-directs local choir VanDeca, now into its fifth season, and sings with the Laudate Singers as a section leader. He also plays tin whistle in Celtic folk band Elsay, and fronts a rock band (name change pending!) on rhythm guitar and lead vocals.  Marco is excited for his latest adventure with the Hikari Woodwind Quintet as an arranger. He\u2019ll take on any arranging challenge, and believes that a good arrangement is a \u201cre-composition\u201d rather than a copy. In his spare time, Marco loves experimental cooking, immersing himself in metal music, learning as many instruments as possible, and, of course, punishing himself with Dark Souls and DotA 2.\u003cbr\u003e"
