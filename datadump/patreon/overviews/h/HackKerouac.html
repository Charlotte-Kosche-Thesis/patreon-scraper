Welcome to our Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love traveling, meeting people, sharing stories, and volunteering for charitable organizations (i.e. No-Kill animal shelters, veteran\u0027s organizations, homeless shelters, Habitat for Humanity, etc.). I also love writing about those experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is your chance to get involved in my writing. You sponsor my travels, and I can afford to keep writing and traveling. I will post 1-2 articles a week to this blog, and hopefully throw in a video every once in a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no guilt here. I write articles, you read them. I produce a video every once in a while, you watch it. You can keep on enjoying them and I\u2019ll keep writing and producing them regardless of whether or not you patronize my work. Patronage exists as a way for you to say thanks with financial assistance, which in turn makes it easier for me to continue to write and produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRadar, my 40lb recently rescued All-American-mutt, Sophie, my 45lb rescued Pillow Hound, and I will be continuing our tour of the country and writing about the people we meet and interview as well as creating occasional videos to complete a book. Our Hack-A-Palooza cross-country tour will take us to all of the lower 48 states so be sure to keep track of us via Facebook and/or Patreon and let us know when we\u0027re nearby so we can stop by and thank you for your patronage in person! We look forward to meeting as many of you as possible. Thanks for checking us out and we hope to see you soon!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHack, Radar, \u0026amp; Sophie\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
