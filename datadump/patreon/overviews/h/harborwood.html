We hope you have seen our videos on YouTube, and have come to offer your support to assist us in our cause! That is: the making of great musical performances of some of the best musical compositions from some of the greatest video games, films, and other great stuff too. If you have \u003cem\u003eNOT\u003c/em\u003e seen our YouTube stuff... then I am curious how you got here...\u003ch4\u003eBut regardless!\u003c/h4\u003eWe would offer our highly biased opinion that it is, how to say... pretty freakin\u0027 good stuff, and invite you to go check it out. Or you could just blindly offer to support us! :D That would be fine as well. Anyway, take a look around (at the rewards section), see if anything catches your eye, and we look forward to a long and prosperous relationship between our great houses."
