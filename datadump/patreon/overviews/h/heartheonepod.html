    "summary": "Hello! We are \"Did you hear the one...?\" Podcast. ( A podcast on Patreon? Really? Yes. Shh.) We are a storytelling podcast, in the vein of the Sheanchai, or that old guy who sat in the pub and would entertain you for a beer or three. We get together every couple of weeks and bring some anectdotes from our past, and a guest with a hell of a story to tell. Mostly funny, sometimes serious, always entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJustin and Joe, the two main hosts, have been acting and telling ridiculous stories for years. We were just foolish enough to put a microphone in front of them. Join them and their irreverant sense of humor to see how many states they have alienated so far, and learn what a Zamburak is.\u00a0Help them out if you can, yeah? THANKS!"
