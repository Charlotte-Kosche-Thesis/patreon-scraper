By joining me, here, on  Patreon, you will have the opportunity to see weekly updates of my projects, get tips on my carving techniques, tutorials and any other things I can think of to throw in for you about my life, adventures and projects. I will enjoy seeing your comments and answering your questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow it works\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge your support, here on Patreon,  you\u0027re giving me a much appreciated, monthly gift and becoming a part of what I do. As soon as you pledge here you will be given access to all my content in your pledge range and there will be an initial charge in the amount that you pledged.  No matter what day of the month you pledged, Patreon will charge you again on the first day of every month thereafter for as long as you wish  and you can cancel at any time. So If you decide to pledge, here, you might want to do so, closer to the beginning of the month, rather than toward the end of the month to avoid feeling like you\u0027ve been charged again, too soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much to all my Patrons!  You\u0027re the best!  I love to hear from you!  I want to know what you are interested in and what you\u0027d like to see, here on Patreon.  I hope you enjoy the updates on my latest projects and the videos of my journeys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
