Hometown Anomaly is more than a music, it\u0027s a way of life!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am boisterous, crazy, goofy and extremely passionate about music....and I need your help!

Often the world stereotypes us, generalizes and marginalizes our successes to going to college, having a traditional desk job and working out life away in a systemic fashion......and I\u0027m not with that way of thinking! \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do YOU Get For Becoming A Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAside from the pride of being an official Anomaly, there are also different perks and rewards of becoming a Patron that range from my undying appreciation, free mp3 downloads and one-on-one advice on how to grow your Youtube channel! You not only get access to these exclusive perks (that NOBODY else on the internet will have access to) but you also are first in-line in the discussion on future songs, suggestions, behind the scene as well as me sharing photos, videos, experiences and thoughts with you exclusively as a way of saying thank you for being a patron of mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go And How Much of It Comes to Hometown Anomaly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour support goes directly to the creation of more and higher quality Hometown Anomaly videos, new instruments and quality recording equipment.  I truly cannot continue this work without you!  Your support will allow me to keep creating powerful videos as well as begin to expand into other areas of Youtube like vlogging and philosophy.  With your support, I can continue to share my passion and the ideas of truly being yourself with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0"
