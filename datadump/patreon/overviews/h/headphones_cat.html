    "summary": "Essential Films\u00a0is a channel that aims to take a closer look at beloved and culturally important films, classic and modern, to examine what makes the films that are generally considered to be \"great movies\" so great, while also championing debated contemporary films and unearthing unsung masterpieces from some of film\u0027s earlier decades. These are the films that I believe are the greatest: the best of the best, the films that anyone who loves (or even simply likes) films should see. My greatest hope for this channel is that it will introduce younger generations to older movies and older generations to newer movies, but more importantly, that it will give people a chance to reexamine films that they\u0027ve already seen with a new perspective. All in all, regardless of whether you like or dislike any of these films, I do believe that these are all worth a closer look."
