Hubba Hubba Revue faces those odds even more than most. Our production level is so large, one rainy night can cripple the show for months, or even shut us down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHubba Hubba Revue wants to be able to continue to provide San Francisco \u0026amp; The Bay Area with shows that are top quality, large scale, professionally-produced events, and with the help of you, \u00a0our beloved friends \u0026amp; fans we can do just that! --now and for many more years to come!"
