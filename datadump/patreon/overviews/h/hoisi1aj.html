My name is Audrey Jean, and I\u0027ve created this page to try and supplement my full-time job as a dispatcher with writing. Ever since I can remember wanting anything, I\u0027ve wanted to be a writer, and hopefully with your assistance I\u0027ll be able to work less at the restaurant, and be able to focus more on writing and getting published! As it stands, my job requires me to be on my feet for upwards of fifty hours a week, and for anyone who\u0027s ever worked in the restaurant industry, or food as a whole, you know how unpredictable it can be.\u00a0Help me, lovely Patrons, you\u0027re my only hope!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe unfortunate thing that no one ever tells you when you\u0027re growing up, and you say you want to be a writer, is how expensive it is. Bills don\u0027t care how many chapters you\u0027ve written, or what your next plot twist is, and the landlord certainly doesn\u0027t accept payment in the form of short stories or character dissertations. My goal, with the help of you amazing Patrons, is to reach $200 a month with this Patreon, which will afford me more opportunities to seek out agents, publishers, and actively work towards getting my books out there and available!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to, once a month, provide a piece of writing: whether it\u0027s a short story, an analysis on a character type, advice, setting, a rant, what have you. All Patrons will be able to vote monthly on the type and topic of the writing. I appreciate each and every single one of you, whether you\u0027re able to pledge one dollar, or twenty. Thank you so, so much for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $1 a month, you\u0027ll have access to the monthly vote for the All-Patron Post content, as well as the corresponding piece. This can range from a writing piece, writing help, a video, live chat, etc. as determined by your votes (and what my time will allow!) In addition, you will have access to \"get to know my cats!\" cat pics. I lovingly watch over two 12-year old sisters that I\u0027ve had for over half of my life, and their personalities are vast and constant sources of inspiration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $2 a month, along with the previous content, you\u0027ll have access to bi-monthly, 3-5 minute videos on writing, done in a Q\u0026amp;A style. You ask the questions, twice a month I answer one to two!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $3 a month, along with the previous content,\u00a0you\u0027ll also have access to a new reward: \"What I Learned from Reading X.\" Every month I will review one book and explain what I best learned from that book, be it style, content, or all of the above. It\u0027ll come with a review on the book itself, as well as what information I found to be most helpful towards further writing OR! what stylistically I took away from it. How I was able to use the book as a stepping stone towards furthering my own writing technique and career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $5 a month, along with the previous content,\u00a0you\u0027ll have early access to drafting and my process writing. This includes, but is not limited to, first drafts of stories, what\u0027s coming up, along with my notations as to what I change, why I do it, and how I hope to strengthen my writing through these edits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $10 a month, along with the previous content, you\u0027ll have access to monthly small group Google Hangout sessions, once a month, for an hour in length. The topic of these can be decided ahead of time, or can unfold organically, or take on a Q\u0026amp;A style, the choice is yours! Times and dates will be made available near the beginning of the month to try and accommodate as many schedules as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $15 a month, along with the previous content, you will receive monthly, motivational emails! One of my favorite things about writing is the sense of community it fosters, and the ability we have as writers to help. We can chat briefly about what it is you need help on, whether it\u0027s character building, story and character arcing, world building, or if you need a bit of a pep talk for life itself! I\u0027m here to help you :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt present, this pledge is limited to 5. As more people pledge, and I\u0027m able to afford taking more time off work, I hope to be able to increase this number.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $30 a month, along with the previous content, I will look over and edit a piece of your work, max page length being 15 pages. I\u0027ve freelance edited for going on five years, have taken courses on it, and I\u0027d love to look over a piece of yours and offer up my advice and suggestions!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt present, this pledge is limited to 5.

We\u0027ll get together for a one-on-one Google Hangout session at a time decided beforehand, and for one hour we\u0027ll discuss writing, what\u0027s coming next in my work, and you\u0027ll even get a character named after you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt present, this pledge is limited to 3.

It\u0027s never seen the light of day, I was a high schooler when I wrote it (so trope ABOUND) and it was inspired by the Twilight saga in its heyday. SO. Needless to say it\u0027ll be a hilariously good time.
