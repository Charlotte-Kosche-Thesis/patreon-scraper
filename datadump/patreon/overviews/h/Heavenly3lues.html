It is a gift that I have been given and feel called to share in my lifetime. My earliest experiences of sharing music were through busking... performing on the street for tips. Busking is something I continue to do from time to time. I enjoy certain aspects of street performance, mainly the fact that anyone can listen, regardless of financial situations. My performances have shifted to a more venue and event-oriented focus over the years, but I still wish to make my music available for all to listen to rather through the occasional street performance or through streaming music and video online. Of course, I\u0027d also love to have you at one of my concerts or our Sound Journey events near you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jeremyarndt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/36645_776806875855_89942_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom my first journey outside the US... guitar with the children along the banks of the Niger River in Mali (2010).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jeremyarndt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14570770_1093607734059723_4759608981650969748_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eJamming along with a sadhu (hindu ascetic monk) in the foothills of the Himalayas outside of Rishikesh, India (2016).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
