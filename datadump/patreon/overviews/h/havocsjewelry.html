    "summary": "Mail armour is ancient. \u00a0There are records of it dating to the fourth century BC from the Celts in Romania. \u00a0There is some evidence that it could go back even further then that and from the research I have done, it is the oldest form of metal armour ever. \u00a0I originally learned just one very basic pattern and since learning it, I have expanded my knowledge of the subject vastly. \u00a0However old the armour is, there is one interesting fact: \u00a0The jewellery side of chainmail is pretty new. \u00a0Over the past twenty years, ideas and and designs have exploded.\u00a0 \u00a0There is much more to this then one would ever imagine, including structures and sculptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe armour I make is usually costume grade. \u00a0I aim for lightweight and flexibility in most my armour without cutting corners in supplies and body coverage. \u00a0I have made combat grade for LARPing (Live Action Role Play), typically out of stainless steel and Galvanized steel. \u00a0I have made one scalemail vest and I really enjoyed it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to continue making the armour and jewellery and I would love to continue to create as much as I can with the possibility of opening my own workshop and store front in the future and teaching others how to do what I do. I would like to produce educational content on how to make chainmail along the way patreons will receive updates, pictures on a day by day basis and chances to get some one of a kind pieces along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA common question that I always get asked is about the jewellery being costume or is it real. \u00a0I always ask people what is real jewellery and they often reply with silver and gold. \u00a0I try not to brush it off as a big investment to get gold or silver, but it is. \u00a0Gold is really pricey and I really do not like the cost. \u00a0However, in the past, I have worked with it and loved the feel of it as I found it easy to work with. \u00a0I do have one ounce of Sterling Silver always on hand when I do public shows so people can compare the weight of a piece made in aluminium. \u00a0I have been asked to make items in Sterling Silver and I have, without hesitation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, stepping back from the armour and the jewellery, I also make some novelties. \u00a0My personal favourite novelty to make has always been ties. \u00a0It\u0027s like a small piece of armour just for one person, custom fit and custom colours. \u00a0Around Christmas time, I break out all sorts of ornaments, from snowflakes to bulb covers that look like icicles. \u00a0I have made some paperweights in the past and people seem to like them. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have actually always wanted to make a chess set out of chainmail. \u00a0It\u0027s one of those projects that is so long and so hard that it\u0027s almost never likely to begin, but I really will begin it one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting at the beginning, it will be just daily updates and photos of progress of jewellery and armour as it is built. \u00a0As time passes, I hope to start a daily vlog (I am really camera shy, so bear with me at the start until I become more comfortable in front of the camera) and the old school blog that everyone is kind of forgetting about nowadays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently, I have started working on inlays (pictures kind of like cross stitch). \u00a0I have seen many different pieces of inlays from sports teams (I once made a Toronto Blue Jays logo) to favourite gaming companies and games. \u00a0Now, I don\u0027t mean to repeat myself, but this particular series of inlays I really want to work on is the first generation of Pokemon (You know, Red, Blue and Yellow). \u00a0Each inlay is between 6 and 25 hours - yes, they take a long time to make because they are so big, and each one costs between $12 and $30 of rings I cannot produce. \u00a0I plan on spending a good chunk of what you Patrons send my way towards this project that I am guessing will take me about three years to complete (If I only used the funds from Patreon, it would take much, much longer). \u00a0Since starting this, I have made 11 out of the 151, and that was just in January.\u003cbr\u003e"
