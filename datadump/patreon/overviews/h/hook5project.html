The game has great character customization functionality and very simple pose creation interface, but it has very poor graphic, because it was development under directx8.\u003cbr\u003eTheKlub17 is the same 3DSV game, but hardly moded by internet community, it has wider customization functionality, a lot of additional mods like new cloth, rooms, toys and so on, but still the same graphic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have some experience with graphic programming and I decided try to change 3d graphic of this game. It was a long way, I developed hook, hook2, hook3, hook4 and every new one was better and complicated then previous one. Now I want to try implement hook5 with using directx11 and some great stuff that provided by directx11. What is hook5 - is a graphical enhancement mod, which allow me change shading style of various objects in game, insert some new object into game scene, apply some 3d graphic effect to whole image, now hook5 already support physx ragdoll hair.

So no more visible polygon edges on body, nose, chin and so on. Also displacement will allow to change curvature of body shape. Possible problem - conflict with clothing, when huge displacement are used.\u003cbr\u003eNext three techniques I tried implement on directx 9 extended hook version for my patrons, but only \u003cstrong\u003eScreen Space Subsurface Scattering\u003c/strong\u003e was finished, other was removed due to low quality and performance, with directx11 I can implement it properly. \u003cstrong\u003eHBAO\u003c/strong\u003e - enhanced version of Ambient Occlusion, in comparison with SSAO it has better quality and has no artifacts such as false occlusion. \u003cstrong\u003eScreenSpaceLocalReflections\u003c/strong\u003e - this technique create a dynamic reflections in the scene, of course with some limitations.\u003cbr\u003e",
