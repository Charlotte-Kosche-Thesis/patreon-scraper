    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Niklas Haas - also known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/haasn\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@haasn on GitHub\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend most of my free time working on free software, in particular\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv\" target=\"_blank\"\u003empv\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0for which I work on the primary video renderer (vo_gpu - previously known as vo_opengl). Recently, I have started work on a new project known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/haasn/libplacebo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elibplacebo\u003c/a\u003e, which aims to be a reusable, modern collection of high-quality GPU-accelerated rendering primitives, much like mpv\u0027s internal renderer, but rewritten from the core to cure some of vo_gpu\u0027s current limitations. My hope is to bring higher quality video/image rendering to a wider number of projects, with the long-term goal/dream of seeing libplacebo code being used in cross-platform free software projects such as VLC or Firefox to provide colorspace conversions, image scaling, tone mapping, debanding/dithering and so on. I would also like to integrate the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/shader-slang/slang\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRetroArch/slang\u003c/a\u003e shader system if possible, and/or make our own user shaders more powerful. Also on my roadmap is GPU-accelerated motion interpolation (like SVP or MVtools but fast and free).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Oh, I also technically have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://haasn.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea blog\u003c/a\u003e, but it\u0027s not too active for the time being. I might change that if I get more time to work on this sort of stuff, to document some of the things I\u0027ve learned along the way. However, for the time being, all of my free time is spent programming. Maybe once libplacebo and mpv get to a point where I\u0027m satisfied I\u0027ll start writing more technical posts about color spaces, mutimedia, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a hobbyist, I\u0027ve been working on mpv for several years now. However, I see the day coming on which I need to reduce the amount of work I do on mpv and FOSS in general in order to make a living. My dream is to continue working on free software for the rest of my life, and perhaps branch out into other areas of multimedia software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help me continue living out my passion for mpv, or appreciate my work on mpv and would like to support me for it, I would be very thankful to receive any contributions either way."
