Bringing together a diverse range of voices, we create a wide variety of free content and online services for those who follow the old ways of the\u00a0\u00c6sir and the Vanir. Our authors produce regular news, editorials, and book reviews relevant to the members of our religious community; providing a well rounded perspective on both modern and ancient traditions. In addition, we maintain an online reference library for those who might otherwise not have access to our texts, we provide easy to follow guides to our Lore and histories, and put out daily updates via our free mailing lists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, keeping these services free for our users means that the costs of providing them come out of our pockets. Web hosting, and mailing services cost money, not to mention the time and effort that every member of our team puts in. Our hub was meant to be a safe place for all kinds of Heathens to gather, interact, and learn without any costs or obligations. We built this to help those within our community who might otherwise have little to no access to information about their own traditions. Any money we get here will go first and foremost into ensuring that these free services remain available to anyone who needs them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
