You may see things changing during this time (mid-July through mid-August.) This may include goals, rewards, everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be posting works here without triggering patron charges as a way of thanking people who have stuck with me during the time my account was inactive.

I have ideas that I think are great and that a lot of my viewers enjoy. Supporting me on Patreon is supporting\u00a0\u003cem\u003ethose\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0drawings, the ones that I\u0027m super inspired to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re on my page I assume you\u0027re at least passingly familiar with my artwork, and you\u0027ll be getting more of it by supporting me here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSite Exclusivity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post some art on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/rei98/\"\u003eFuraffinity\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Rei98\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, but art that is created for Patreon will be posted in its highest quality on Patreon only. I may post lower quality, cropped, or shortened versions of Patreon works elsewhere as a way of drawing interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt Bundles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, it\u0027s important to note that in the past I have taken all Patreon works posted over a given time frame and placed them in an art bundle for purchase while removing them from Patreon. If you supported me on Patreon during the time they were posted, contact me to receive a coupon code to download them for free. This is something I will likely do again in the future, so be warned but don\u0027t be alarmed. Again, you shouldn\u0027t lose access to any works you supported, even if they\u0027re moved into art bundles."
