The money will go towards hiring people to help me with video production and editing, so that I can focus on the technical writing and output more than 1 video a week. My goal is to get to 2 high quality educational videos a week, and for that I\u0027m going to need a solid amount of help from a team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
