    "summary": "Our mission is to entertain you with our table hijinks, while showing the possibilities of tabletop RPGs. Our goal is to do our part to expand the hobby. To that end, we decided to use our system neutrality (we have our favorites, but we\u0027ll try anything) and our love of story telling - and everything that goes into that - to bring a new kind of RPG podcast to the internet. \u003cbr\u003eMost of the ones you are going to find play a single campaign using a single system. Not us. We are planning to span the industry, and the multiverse with our games. Each season of the podcast will have one of the five stars act as GM, and will be set in a different universe using different rules. \u003cbr\u003eFor our show it will never be a 100-plus hour commitment to try and \"catch-up\" with the current story line. Our current format aims to have the story wrapped in less than 20 hours. So, you can catch-up easily or simply wait for the next season to start."
