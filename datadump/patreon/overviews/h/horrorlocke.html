These will be a mixture of high and dark fantasy; I have several novels that are in the process of being written already, of which I\u0027m planning to self-publish upon completion and editing. The tales encompass heroes without quests, magic related shenanigans, what happens when a man wakes up after being shot in the head and mortals striving for immortality while the immortal seek to destroy it for good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://image.prntscr.com/image/922765790e014ffabc09539ccf271db6.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLUSUS NATURAE;\u003c/strong\u003e a project that has been in the works for several years now and I am planning to release it as several comics. It is a post-apocalyptic/scifi tale that involves war and mutants running around in the sand with guns that have too much ammo and mouths that have way too many teeth -- all due to a world-wide endemic of creatures called \u0027Angels\u0027 that [mostly] wiped out humanity a long long time ago. While the main story will be in comic form, I have a plan for several \u0027spin-off\u0027 novels encroaching other plots within the world that the comic doesn\u0027t include -- but the \u003cstrong\u003ecomic itself will be free to veiw\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0online as it updates! I do want to release print copies eventually, but that\u0027s for when I have the funds to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, I\u0027m developing an RPG that will be based within the same world, and with further funding I\u0027d be able to actually make and release it.
