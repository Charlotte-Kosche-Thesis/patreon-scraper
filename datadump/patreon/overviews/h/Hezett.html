I love bright colors. And I LOVE giving my quilts away, Because I\u0027ve had so much help getting into this position already and I feel the least I can do is give back. \u003cbr\u003eNow. I love quilting. I love sewing so much. It\u0027s my favorite thing to do. \u003cbr\u003eHowever. I am not a fast quilter, due to my disability.... \u003cbr\u003eAnd I don\u0027t think too many people will be able to afford what I would charge per quilt based on my time involved. \u003cbr\u003eSO THIS is the best idea EVER!  1 dollar a month(but please feel free to pay a little more, that would REALLY make my day). \u003cimg src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zeb/2/16/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 16px; margin: 0px 1px; width: 16px;\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I am going to draw a name and mail A PIXEL QUILT OF THE WINNERS CHOOSING to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are not standard bed size quilts, as much as they are art, or maybe a lap quilt. They\u0027re generally square and not...bed size large. Sizes depend on how many pixels are in the design. \u003cbr\u003eAnd YES, I absolutely CAN design something specifically for you if I don\u0027t have anything that entices you readily available. \u003cimg src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zeb/2/16/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 16px; margin: 0px 1px; width: 16px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e AWESOME FOR RETRO ROOMS. Sooooo good to curl up under on a rainy afternoon,  to play your old favorite video games. You won\u0027t ever find anything like this at walmart. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Drawing for a quilt every single month on the 5th. \u003cbr\u003eThe odds right now? incredible. \u003cimg src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zeb/2/16/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 16px; margin: 0px 1px; width: 16px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI LOVE this opportunity; I\u0027m so passionate about doing this.
