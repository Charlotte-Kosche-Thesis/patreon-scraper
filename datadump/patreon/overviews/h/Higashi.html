I\u0027ve been told multiple times that I should create videos and put them on Youtube as well as start streaming. I\u0027ve started streaming and it\u0027s been great, but it\u0027s not enough to make it a living at the moment.\u00a0My current living arrangement and job don\u0027t allow me the luxury of time to record and edit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my friends live on the other side of the lake so they are 5+ hours ahead of me. It\u0027s hard because of my work schedule, I leave work when most of my friends are sleeping or heading to bed. I truly do wish to make YouTube and Streaming my job, because at the moment my current job only allows me to pay for my rent, my car insurance, and my phone. I\u0027m usually left with very little which I use to spoil my little sister whenever I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhenever I have the time and money, I go to conventions where all my friends are. I always see how they interact with their fans, how happy the fans are just to meet and talk to them. It\u0027s a great thing to see people meet the person they admire. I want to bring that to people, I want to be someone people can admire. I just want to make people laugh and make their day better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money that I\u0027ll be getting from Patreon will be helping me pay for my current living arrangement as well as upgrading my computer. Hopefully, if it gets big enough I can move out to a place of my own and just focus all of my time on content creation.\u00a0"
