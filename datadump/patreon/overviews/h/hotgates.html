Pinky promise. :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Lila \u201cLidoria\u201d Gkaravela and Vangelis \u201cSutorcen\u201d Angelakis. We are partners in life for nearly twenty years and besides the love for each other we share a common love for video games. That\u2019s why since late 2015 we began development of \u003ca href=\"http://hotgates.eu/project-origins-working-title/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eProject Origins\u003c/a\u003e. A year later we started creating tutorials for the Unreal Engine community as well. That love gave birth to Hotgates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://hotgates.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hotgates-logo-black-large.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Hotgates?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Battle of Thermopylae took place in September of 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of Thermopylae (\"The Hot Gates\"). A Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block a massive Persian army. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history\u0027s most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing that a small path led behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, fighting to the death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe chose this name as our logo because it represents determination, perseverance and is synonymous with never giving up. That\u0027s our motto; Never give up, never surrender. We also chose Spartoulis because he represents our playfulness and love for video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://hotgates.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hotgates-post-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Project Origins?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject Origins (working title) is the game we are currently developing. It\u0027s the first game in the \u201cOrigins\u201d universe, a first person, interactive sci-fi tale that takes place on Mars in the year 2373 long after the Earth was abandoned. In this first game explore every detail of the ARES\u2013B3, a large Martian base built to facilitate the study of recently discovered nearby alien ruins. Observe and examine every area to find clues. Hack into computers, solve puzzles and explore the internal struggles of xenoarchaeologist Sophia Williams and the events that occurred on ARES\u2013B3. You can read more about Project Origins on our \u003ca href=\"http://hotgates.eu/project-origins-working-title/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/downloads_wordmark_white_on_coral.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor us, Patreon is a way to get support to do the things we love. In our case a video game, tutorials and Unreal Engine 4 related content. Patreon cuts out the middleman and connects video game developers with the fans directly. That\u0027s why, Patreon for us is the future for indie developers. We know we will achieve all our goals, because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor you, Patreon is a way to support small projects (like our game) and join a like-minded community. You can choose to donate any amount you\u0027d like per month and in return, receive some pretty awesome rewards! Regardless how much content we release, you decide how much you donate each month and every penny helps. This means we get a regular financial aid and you become a bona fide, real-life patron of video games. As an added bonus you get to influence the development of a video game. How cool is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been making Project Origins since October 2015 with whatever money is left from our salaries. Self-financing a game can only take us that far. We truly pour our heart and soul into the game and every tutorial we create. Making video games is our calling and it\u2019s a task without any financial return until we release the game. There are still many obstacles to overcome that become harder because of time restraints and lack of funding. With your help we can overcome these obstacles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will my support help Hotgates?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough your support on Patreon, you will help us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Check our goals on the left for more details)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eKeep our website and content Ad free.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuy some assets to make the game look even better.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuy some better equipment to speed up development.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire a team to help us - 3D artist, programmer, sound engineer, voice actors.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate more tutorials, enough to release as a book.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart creating video tutorials.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate more free assets for the Unreal Engine community.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWith enough support we will make Project Origins and our Tutorials Book available for everyone for free.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire a team to film this whole journey and release it as a documentary, in hopes of inspiring others to follow their dreams.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUse your support as a solid foundation, upon which the second game in the series can be built.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of the amount you decide to give, we can promise you this.
