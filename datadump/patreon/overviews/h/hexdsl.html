    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho IS HexDSL?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a dude who makes videos about Linux Gaming, often (like many times a week.) I have been doing this for ages now. Every video I either look at a new game, first launch something live on camera or just have an opinion. Sometimes I try to show you something that I think is cool (and related to Linux.) I\u0027m not a Linux expert or a developer but I have played a lot of games, like a silly amount! I have a pretty good eye for a fun game and would like to think that I have a interesting things to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre your videos any good?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t know... I think they are. I try really hard to be natural on camera, I am honest about my thoughts and don\u0027t edit my thoughts into an idealised version of myself like some of those larger YouTubers do. I\u0027m like a real person and I say stuff that I think, or at least I try to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery video I have was made on Linux entirely. I do not use Mac\u0027s or Windows to edit. I record, edit, upload everything from Linux.\u00a0That includes any channel artwork too. It\u0027s all done on Linux. I am a real Linux user.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Reward Tiers suck!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know, I\u0027m sorry. I actually worked really hard on what to write on those places, but I\u0027m not a great believer in \u0027Pay Gates\u0027 and \u0027Exclusives\u0027 annoy me as a gamer. Actually, commercialism annoys me too. I make my content for as many people as possible so putting it behind a pay wall seems like the opposite of what Linux is about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhy should I give you money?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are probably (definitely) more deserving people on the internet. If you feel so inclined then you SHOULD give them your money instead. However, if there is a little left, and you \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to give it to me then I will use it to make my channel and content better. I would like to think that I can show people some awesome games and share some of my inner monologue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
