    "summary": "Everyone\u0027s got bills to pay, unless you\u0027re a ninja warrior that calls no man master, but I\u0027m pretty sure even they have to pay union dues or something. Supporting Happle Tea through Patreon helps me pay my bills and means I get to keep creating comics about monsters, mythology, and necromancers that run for local government office rather than taking jobs consulting about the precise shade of blue someone should use for their website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHapple Tea does something that most other comics don\u0027t do: it educates while it entertains. The insight it provides into history and world mythology can help you look very clever at social events and help you to avoid making the same mistakes mythological figures made. Over the last 5 years or so, we\u0027ve learned that maybe we SHOULDN\u0027T be so proud that we mock the gods, or that maybe being a princess isn\u0027t a great idea when dragons want to use you for cushioning. That is knowledge you can\u0027t get many other places on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting Happle Tea means continued and regular updates to a site that hopefully provides you with some small entertainment and knowledge every week. After five years of updating, I\u0027ve been surprised at how much the site has grown and how much support I\u0027ve received from comments, emails, and on twitter and facebook. Now I hope you\u0027ll find that you enjoy the site enough to help support it financially as well. Making comics may seem easy, but the work for Happle Tea is never ending. I spend a ton of time (between 20 and 30 hours) reading, researching, writing jokes, drawing, coloring, and writing pages of text for the blog post every week to provide entertainment and bring the world of mythology and monsters to you in a humorous way. I would love to continue doing that, even for free. Unfortunately, I have bills to pay and if I can\u0027t make money from drawing these comics, I have to take other, less pleasant jobs that will pay the bills and that means Happle Tea may have to take a back seat. While I would never put the comic behind a paywall, I do hope that some of you will have the means to help support the continued growth of this humble comic strip. And hey, if there\u0027s enough support, I could even start working on new projects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you enjoy what I do, please consider becoming a Patron today!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u003cbr\u003e-Scott Maynard\u003cbr\u003e"
