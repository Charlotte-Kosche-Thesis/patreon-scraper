    "summary": "In 2013 I embraced the teaching mission of the Epicurean Gardens. What this means is that I\u0027ve made a commitment to educate people about Epicurean\u00a0philosophy and its science of happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of this effort, I have been producing content since 2013 on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.societyofepicurus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSociety of Friends of Epicurus\u003c/a\u003e webpage, which I created and maintain, and also was commissioned to write the book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22238752-tending-the-epicurean-garden\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTending the Epicurean Garden\u003c/a\u003e by Humanist Press. The book is now available\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tending-Epicurean-Garden-Hiram-Crespo/dp/0931779537/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efrom amazon\u003c/a\u003e, and if you\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.humanistpress.com/tending-the-epicurean-garden.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebuy the e-book directly\u003c/a\u003e from HP you\u0027ll be allowed to post online comments which, when approved, become forever part of the work! The book is an interdisciplinary, modern introduction to Epicurean philosophy which draws from neuroscience, diet, and research by social scientists on the science of happiness, and shows how contemporary research vindicates Epicurean teachings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine this is all quite time-consuming, as it not only requires lots of writing,\u00a0but also reading and interpreting\u00a0didactic material, and sometimes the ability to access rare and hard-to-find books. Philosophers affiliated with the teaching mission at\u00a0Society of Friends of Epicurus should be able to make a partial living from the teaching mission.\u00a0I appreciate any and all support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn recent years, I helped to create a Spanish-language free course in EP for \u003ca href=\"https://lasindias.school/itinerarios/9/ver\"\u003eLa Escuela de las Indias\u003c/a\u003e and I now\u00a0write a column\u00a0for the most visited webpage and daily paper in Puerto Rico, \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.elnuevodia.com/arte-de-vivir/\"\u003eEl Nuevo D\u00eda\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve also written and made easily available commentaries on the scrolls that survived the Herculaneum eruption in the year 79 of Common Era, some of the translations of which were either unaffordable or very difficult to find by most English and Spanish speakers before I began my teaching mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also create philosophy-friendly blogs for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theautarkist.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Autarkist\u003c/a\u003e, my personal blog, and\u00a0edit or write the content for the Spanish \u003ca href=\"https://sociedadepicuro.wordpress.com/\"\u003eSociedad de Epicuro\u003c/a\u003e site. For more didactic content about our tradition, you may visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.societyofepicurus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSociety of Epicurus\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.newepicurean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNew Epicurean\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.elementalepicureanism.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eElemental Epicureanism\u003c/a\u003e.
