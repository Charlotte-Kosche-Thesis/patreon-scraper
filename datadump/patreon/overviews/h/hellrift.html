    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Dream\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Anthony Tote. I am a lifelong gamer (20+ years) and have always dreamed of developing my own IP. I hold a B.S. in Game and Simulation Programming. In 2016, I decided I was finally in the right position to start working on my first full title. I have always been a fan of loot based games such as Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, and Hellgate: London. With that in mind, I started designing a game based on the elements I love most about those titles. I had a little bit of money saved up, and contracted some artists to help me get the ball rolling. I began learning blueprinting inside Unreal 4 (visual scripting), and started building the gameplay foundation. We\u0027ve been pushing forward ever since. As Fledgling Studios, our goal is to grow as a team, become a \"real\" development studio, and to produce games that we would love to play. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHellrift\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHellrift is a 3rd person action RPG that takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth that has been overrun by a demonic invasion. Quests, skill trees, crafting, and (lots of) loot will all be present. We aim to provide a robust action RPG experience containing many gameplay mechanics with which you may be familiar, but with our own twists and modifications added to them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApproach to Development\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur goal is to be as transparent as possible. We are a small team as of now. We still need a lot of help and are very early on in Hellrift\u0027s development. Having said that, you\u0027ll see many of our milestones. We\u0027ll share a lot of our screenshots, even if they\u0027re rough around the edges. Things will change. We will adjust, replace, or outright remove assets and gameplay elements. We will make the tough decisions to focus on one feature and to leave another for the eventual sequel (hopefully). Why? Because that is all part of game development, and its time we started embracing that instead of hiding from it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, the team and I spend our nights and weekends working on Hellrift to get the essential mechanics implemented and to establish the core gameplay loop. To put it bluntly, the more money we raise, the more people I can bring on board and the faster we can proceed with Hellrift\u0027s creation. Once we have a solid vertical slice built, we will most likely move to a crowd-funding platform that provides a lump sum, such as Kickstarter. We will use the funds raised there to proceed until we hit what will hopefully be an early beta stage of development. After that, we may do a soft launch on Steam Early Access in order to get player feedback and receive a last-minute boost in funding. However, all of this is tentative and is subject to change based on how we proceed through each phase of development. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon And Updates\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I said before, we will not be shy with our updates. Having said that, game development does take time. We may go a couple weeks without showing anything. But I will always keep everyone in the loop, even if we\u0027re having trouble. I\u0027ve come to Patreon as I believe that it is a good way to slowly ramp up our funding along with our development. We hope to provide the gaming community with an excellent new ARPG to discuss around the water-cooler, and any help we receive in getting to that point is deeply appreciated by myself and the rest of the team.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
