    "summary": "When I started writing, I had no idea I was going to be foolish enough to try and make a career out of it, but here we are. I\u0027ve been covering the Lakers for over five years now, three of which I\u0027ve been lucky enough to be credentialed for games and practices on the beat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve left my old home at Silver Screen and Roll and found a new one at Lakers Nation, but my goal is to continue producing the volumes of content you\u0027ve come to expect, as well as co-hosting a daily podcast (Locked on Lakers), in addition to writing more features and longform content as I\u0027m able.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying to make this a career, and money helps with that. Between parking, gas and the\u00a0coffee necessary to\u00a0keep me going, I lose money on every Lakers game I cover in person. This is truly a labor of love as I attempt to build my resume, but I want it to be something more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be able to make it financially viable for myself to continue to create thoughtful journalism surrounding games, as well as adding value, context and humor to whatever topics I choose to write about. I want to approach this with creativity and fun when I can, as well as doing more serious stuff when it\u0027s merited. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love going to cover the Lakers or blogging, aggregating, co-hosting a daily podcast, managing a student paper and still going to school, but it means I often work 18 hour days and run on about five hours of sleep, as well as leaving me with various expenses. Every little bit is huge in helping me keep up with the work that I hope you enjoy, and I appreciate your consideration if you read this far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my work, you can obviously continue to do so for free, but even just a dollar a month helps. If every podcast listener or reader pledged just a buck, I\u2019d be able to pay my rent and all my other bills and not have to worry about keeping 100 jobs at once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to continue trying to add benefits for those of you that support me. I\u0027ve enjoyed building up the small following I have, and hope to be able to continue to grow as a writer, journalist and creator with all of your support. I\u0027m still a student, which means I\u0027m never short on bills to pay, and every little bit towards making this more financially viable for me is a huge help and means a ton. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration, and for reading, listening to the podcast, or doing anything else to support my journey so far. With your help, I hope it can be a much longer one.\u003cbr\u003e"
