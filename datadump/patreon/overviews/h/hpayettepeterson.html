    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! \u003c/strong\u003eI am a young biologist and artist originally from Boston, USA. I create surreal, science-inspired oil paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art is inspired by my interest in surrealism and my background in science, in particular the fields of biology and astronomy. I\u0027m especially influenced by the beauty and mystery of the ocean and outer space, and both themes appear often in my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a website that allows people to directly support their favorite artists by pledging a certain (often very small) amount of money per project (or per month). In return, they get access to exclusive content and rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Patreon, I want to give some of my most dedicated supporters and followers access to exclusive content (more in-depth than what I post on Instagram and Facebook) and discounts and more input into my creative process, while also helping fund the art supplies\u00a0I need in order to keep creating my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.hpayettepeterson.com/uploads/6/5/7/3/65736277/22197577-10210381422391654-1609895441-o_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.hpayettepeterson.com/uploads/6/5/7/3/65736277/img-20170926-203259_orig.jpg\" style=\"width: 478px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to use my Patreon page as a sort of blog to discuss science, art, surrealism, ideas and inspiration, as well as my creative process.\u00a0I also want it to be an open forum for my patrons and I to talk about these topics--rather than only publishing content for you all to look at, I want my patrons to feel free to respond to what I post and interact with each other as well! This page will be a place for me to share raw, less polished progress photos, discuss not-yet-fully-formed ideas and hear your opinions. I speak English and Spanish, so if Spanish is more comfortable for you don\u2019t hesitate to speak to me in Spanish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve decided to charge my patrons one payment per three paintings I complete (though I won\u0027t charge you more than once a month). This is just to make\nsure that every time you are charged, you\u2019re receiving more than your\nmoney\u2019s worth in awesome content and new artwork from me. My goal is to create\nat least 3 paintings a month, but just\nin case I don\u2019t make as much artwork one month I\u2019ll make sure you guys aren\u2019t\ncharged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to visit my page and for supporting my artwork!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore artwork (as well as paintings, prints \u0026amp; products for sale) on my website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.hpayettepeterson.com/\"\u003ewww.hpayettepeterson.com\u003c/a\u003e"
