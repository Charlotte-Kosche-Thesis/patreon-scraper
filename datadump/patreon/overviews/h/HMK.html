I primarily focus on video game theories, hyped news on gaming, and hectic rants on the gaming industry. I also create Top 10 countdowns, and various comedic pieces. What HMK is on YouTube and Twitch is a representation of passion of gaming in all of it\u0027s spectrums! An appreciation of who gamers are, in all terms and accepting that no matter who you are! The core of HMK is also taking all you know on gaming, the facts, the theories, and make you think! Gaming is more than gaming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhy I\u0027m On Patreon\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite what some think on the web, HMK is a mostly a one-man army. I do get help from time to time, but I mostly work by myself and it could pretty Hectic (forgive my pun...) I love creating YouTube videos, it is very fulfilling for me however it does take it\u0027s toll from time to time. The revenue that I receive from YouTube gets spread around into my personal bills and life and into YouTube, with the recent changes in the revenue system on YouTube it alone is not enough to rely on sometimes due to the erratic nature of ads and their own internal systems. And due to being mostly a 1-man crew some projects to slip behind and get left in the dust. Support from Patreon and those who would pledge will allow me to invest more time and money into the channel while also allowing me to take care of my expenses so that I can focus more on YouTube and at the same time I could bring on others onto the team of HMK and get content out to you in droves and will have way less a chance of slipping away! With this I will be able to continue it with more stability, which will in turn help grow and create more quality content quicker and bigger.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Become A Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron of HMK you directly help support the channel and you will be considered one of the deepest supporters!
