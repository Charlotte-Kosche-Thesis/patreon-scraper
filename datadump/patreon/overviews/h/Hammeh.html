I originally made videos and streams\u00a0having fun in Hearthstone (and teaching some for beginners), StarCraft and many other games together. No play is too bad, as long as we learn from it..and laugh together at it a little too ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve enjoyed making videos (and streaming possible) for 4 years, as a hobby and making a loss, before the channel exploded with my Overwatch content. If necessary, I\u0027m happy to continue doing so the way I am - by working part or full-time, and making time for video creation around paid, freelance work, as I am not a full-time YouTuber currently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis, naturally, limits what and how many videos I can produce - there are only so many hours in the day! I love making long-form, heavily scripted, edited content, like my Hero Lore, Voicelines and Interaction series (which I\u0027m probably best known for), but also mix in shorter content like news and reporting, when I have less time, or there\u0027s news you appreciate hearing my take about :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u0027d love to try expand and grow what I do currently, collaborate with amazing artists, animators and creators to make even higher quality content, and perhaps - if you support it - go full time to make more of the longer, detailed, edited, quality content \u003cstrong\u003eyou \u003c/strong\u003elove and want, become less dependent on YouTube ads, and remove any pressure to create daily content for views to please the YouTube algorithm and drive those ads. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll never charge for any of the regular content you see every week, or any new projects driven by this Patreon in future - disposable income is not a thing for a lot of people, and if you watch, enjoy or find anything I make useful, that\u0027s amazing support, and reward enough for me. Please don\u0027t stop :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever enjoyed my vids, and would like to support even larger and more wonderful creations, then I\u0027d love to work with your support to do that. I have so many huge ideas , and that\u0027s where Patreon, and hopefully *\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e*, come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gone into a lot of detail below about this, and a video will be here too shortly to explain - do comment on the YouTube, tweet me with any questions too.

I have put this in as a milestone goal, so, should we ever hit that together, then I\u0027ll start a discussion and poll with all Patrons to determine whether you\u0027d like me to go full time, and what that would involve.
