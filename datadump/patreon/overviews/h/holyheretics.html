    "summary": "Hi everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a guy who once pastored full-time in the Evangelical Church, but then left.\u00a0 I left because I believe that the Jesus message is bigger than just one religious expression, Christianity included. I like to refer to the Jesus message as the Christ consciousness. I believe this Christ consciousness is a way of seeing and being in the world that\u0027s not really concerned at all with doctrines and dogmas. I am an inclusive, peace-loving, ordained minister for the reconciliation of all people and all things. I believe in drawing circles of inclusion and not lines of division. I care nothing about converting anyone to a particular religion. I just want to help people see, be, and live wholly in the world. I am also a bit irreverent and church clothes just don\u0027t fit me too well. And yet, I still identify as mostly Christian, but I believe that word and ideology has been hijacked by American Evangelicalism and I would really like to help reclaim it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound a bit heretical? Yeah, I thought so. Thus the name. And here\u0027s one more thing - I know I\u0027m not alone. I know that there are many people out there who feel this way but just stay silent and in the shadows. I understand. I did too for a long time. I do this weekly podcast as a way for all of us spiritual misfits to connect. Know this - you are not alone. I drop episodes every Tuesday where I talk alternative theology for spiritual misfits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal - I do have day job. Like 9-5, 40 hours per week job. I LOVE podcasting, but it does come with costs, such as: web hosting, equipment, and travel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you would like to pitch in and help me out, I would be greatly appreciative. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch Love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJon Scott\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConnect with me....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: @HolyHeretics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram: @theholyheretics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmail: theholyheretics@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e"
