My name is Heikitsune (Or Hei for short.) and I write well, nearly anything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeep stories of love and lose, High octane adventures, gut busting tales of laughter, sweet stories of romance, and even the dirtiest of smut and erotica. I can almost do it all. I\u0027ve been writing for a about five years with about over eighty stories out in the wilds of the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is a mix of NSFW (Not Safe For Work; smut, erotic etc.) and SFW (Safe For Work; none smut).  Most of what I do for SFW writing is humor, romance, action and adventure. While for my NSFW writing I do a rather fair-sized amount of sexual stories. Form Vanilla stories, to rough sex between a naughty elf and a really horny orc. Or pig. horse. A random bunch of villagers. Basically, anything that tickles my fancy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf your curious about what I do for NSFW stories, here\u0027s a link to that profile: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/AkiraOkami94/profile\"\u003ehttp://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/AkiraOkami94/profile\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for the ones who want to see the none naughty stuff: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/~heikitsune\"\u003ehttps://www.fanfiction.net/~heikitsune\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is more of a source of extra income. Something to making living a little easier. By supporting me you give me more time to work on my stories, and for me to do some fun stuff like commission artist for images of my work, allowing you to influence what type of work I do. As in voting for witch story that get\u0027s done, and/or what chapter get\u0027s worked on, and maybe even starting my own original comic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my work here will be open to the public a month after they are released on here. However, commission releases are of their own volition. Meaning they are released whenever for the commissioner and they will be released here too. Just to keep the content going so there aren\u2019t any months where nothing comes out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth on Patreon, my Tumblr and twitter will I announce what things are coming out during the month, what stories are nearly done, when a story is released, and how close a story is to being done. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVoting for stories and ideas will be for the month after. Example: If your voting for a story chapter to be worked on this month, the chapter will come out next month. I will put the months that apply for each time there is voting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is petty bear bones right now with only two tiers and both not really doing much sadly. I am currently trying to incorporate my commissions in it somehow and/or have something for a third tier. But I will add that at a later day or not at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to give money to support me, then fallow me on any of my sites that I am on and leave a comment, write a review, retweet my work, or whatever to get my name out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://heikitsune25.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttps://heikitsune25.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Heikitsune25\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Heikitsune25\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, thanks for supporting me!\u003cbr\u003e"
