It is set up a bit like \nKickstarter, if you are familiar with how that works. Basically, there are \ndifferent pledge levels which grant different benefits for each level. My main goal with Patreon is getting to more conventions and spreading the adventures of Dungheap. Every pledge helps. They also help with supplies, such as paints and flyers and ink for printing out copies of the minicomic. But you get something in return!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s288.photobucket.com/user/HopskotchSunday/media/The%20Story_zpsfbxkratk.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll193/HopskotchSunday/The%20Story_zpsfbxkratk.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDungheap\u0027s adventure takes place on the branches of the mighty Tree which is\n home to various races that have lived mostly in peace for the past \ncentury, ever since the powerful creatures that enslaved all the races \nwere driven from the Tree not to be seen again. But now they have \nreturned and no one knows why.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a map of the Tree and the \nvarious communities spread throughout its branches. Xylem, the capital city, is on the trunk of the Tree while Dungheap and the Volans live on the outer edges of the southern branch in Cambium. The Tree is surrounded by a thick canopy of leaves that create the Coriaceous Sea which people travel across in light leaf skimmers that float on the leaves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mynameisdungheap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Main-with-Text-for-Web.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many different races that share the Tree. Dungheap is half \nVolan and half Ert. The Volans are a forest dwelling race that use the Tree magic to heal others, manipulate the leaves and branches of the tree and to create wooden weapons they use to defend themselves. The Erts are a mysterious, warrior race that have not been seen in over a decade. They are known for their rage and hostility. Whoa. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing of \nboth races, Dungheap finds it difficult to fit in and is just now \nbeginning to see that he has a much bigger role to play in the events \nunfolding around the Tree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill they be able to save themselves \nfrom what is coming? Will Dungheap discover why these creatures are so \nintent on capturing him? The story is just beginning!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCall me crazy, but I am making this comic in three ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s288.photobucket.com/user/HopskotchSunday/media/Minicomic_zpswb8kzj0d.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll193/HopskotchSunday/Minicomic_zpswb8kzj0d.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week or so I will be making a new eight page minicomic that I will be sending out to my $10 patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s288.photobucket.com/user/HopskotchSunday/media/minicomics_zpspgvvuuol.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll193/HopskotchSunday/minicomics_zpspgvvuuol.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the benefits of physical copies is you get to witness the page reveals and you can unfold it and on the back there will be maps, character descriptions, bonus art and more that will add to the story.\u00a0 AND getting things in the mail is way cool!!
