    "summary": "Hi! \u00a0Thanks for checking out my Patreon! \u00a0I\u0027ve been an Integrative Health Specialist for the past 20 years and I\u0027ve started the podcast and blog \u003cem\u003eHighway to Health\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0While it is a labor of love, I would love your support and involvement. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is \u003cem\u003eHighway to Health\u003c/em\u003e? \u00a0This project was born out of the years to collaborating with other health providers from all fields of care. \u00a0In 2014 I started working with an MD friend in health tech to help promote a better means of care delivery and coordination of care. \u00a0What we realized was that both providers and people seeking care were looking for a more integrative experience across fields of care. \u00a0Further, in working to improve health outcomes, we were also forgetting to have one important dialogue with each other; what does \u0027health\u0027 mean to you? And what is your belief system for improving \u0027health\u0027?-- if that\u0027s what we are truly working together to achieve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough conversations, original written content and video--by myself and the most brilliant and inquisitive minds I know around the world of health, I am building not only a resource site, but \u00a0engaging a dialogue about how to improve the health of individuals, communities and our environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love your support with either a small monthly amount ($10 a month goes a long way), A one time donation, or whatever you can give--every dollar helps to build momentum for this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cstrong\u003ebigger vision\u003c/strong\u003e for the podcast and blog is to create a reserve set aside from revenue generated here to provide care to groups in the U.S. who are marginalized in our system and give them access to the kind of care needed to improved their health and communities using the care network of people you\u0027ll get to know from the show and content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we can build a healthier, more connected world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e--Jeremy Quinby\u003cbr\u003e"
