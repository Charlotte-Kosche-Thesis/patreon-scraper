In our efforts we try to make the lives of DM\u0027s easier and their games more fun and vibrant. From engaging and memorable NPC\u0027s to hair-raising random encounters and epic locations, we enjoy creating it all.

Personally, we love creating content for Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, Pathfinder and other tabletop games and have been doing so for ourselves and friends since we began playing tabletop RPG\u0027s over a decade ago. Then we realized that our design and writing skills could be better put to use polishing our own work so others could enjoy it too. Also, as avid travelers, our rich history allows us to write about far off lands and dangerous encounters on dark moonlit streets as if we had actually been there, because we have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur dream:\u003c/strong\u003e To one day write and create content for the tabletop RPG community professionally. We will continue to build adventures and encounters for free, but our time is very limited due to \"real life\" requiring our attention and money. So here we are, on Patreon, asking for your help.
