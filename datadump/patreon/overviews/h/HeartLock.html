And my hope is that my work can inspire thought, imagination, and excitement in the minds of others who experience my art themselves. There isn\u0027t a day that goes by where I don\u0027t draw, and I never want there to be. I want to live and die with a pen in my hand, creating all that I can and with all that I have. My ultimate dream is to be a comic writer and illustrator one day professionally. I know I have the passion and drive necessary, as I feel this is what I\u0027m meant to do. Any pledged support of me and my work would be so very appreciated. So if you like what you see, then please support. :)"
