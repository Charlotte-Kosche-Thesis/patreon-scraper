    "summary": "I enjoy entertaining others. I enjoy making people laugh, making people think, or just giving bored people something to do. I enjoy making videos. However, it can be a lot of work. I know I\u0027ve spent many nights working till 4 or 5 in the morning editing, adding sound effects, drawing custom graphics for my videos, writing and recording custom songs for my videos, adding special effects such as motion tracking, chroma keying, and animated graphics and titles. It is almost a full-time job. I don\u0027t have a team of helpers. I am doing it all myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I dream much bigger than my budget and my time allows. I cannot afford to put as much time into this form of entertainment as I would like, because I have to make a living. I have to go work a different job to make money (a couple of different jobs, actually), while youtube remains the thing I do that gets mocked, marginalized, or belittled by people who say \"why are you wasting your time doing that? It will never amount to anything.\" Perhaps they\u0027re right, but I enjoy doing it, and I\u0027d like to think that if I\u0027m consistent, it will eventually pay off. And all that I mean by \"pay off\" is that this would become something I can actually afford to do full time, and put all of my time and effort into. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so many ideas I\u0027d like to bring to life and see through to completion. Comedy scripts, cartoon and machinima ideas, plans for crazy gaming talk shows set in outer-space, sketch comedy, and many other ideas for this channel as well, and I actually have the skills to make them a reality. I can do so many things with this channel. So what is holding me back? Money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I have to make money to get by, and that is done by methods other than video content creation, and so my youtube work ends up taking a backseat to that which pays the bills and feeds me. I can\u0027t put as much effort and time into these videos as I\u0027d like to. It is extremely difficult to make a living through Youtube, and is also very unreliable. I dislike e-begging as much as the next guy, but the bottom line is that I need to be able to afford to take the time to bring you this content, and hopefully eventually more and better content. I feel that the best way to achieve this is by being directly supported by the you, the viewers who enjoy what I do. That is where Patreon comes in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can now help to support me via a small donation each month, if you are comfortable doing so. However, this is not something you should feel obligated to do for any reason whatsoever. Simply watching my videos is also supporting me, in another way, and I completely appreciate that, if that\u0027s all you feel comfortable with doing. Thanks for taking the time to take a look at my Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
