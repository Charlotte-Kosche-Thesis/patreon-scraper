Electronic trading whistleblower responsible for alerting the SEC to undocumented order types on Direct Edge, resulting in a record-setting $14mm settlement and the largest fine against a stock exchange in US history. Built whistleblower teams contributing to three additional SEC enforcement actions, as well as tangible policy changes in the financial markets, including a near-record $14mm penalty against NYSE in part for pegged order types that disadvantaged hidden liquidity."

He is generally credited with unleashing the so-called \"order type controversy,\" which focuses on abusive practices relating to complex nontransparent order types. Mr. Bodek\u0027s contributions have influenced the ongoing public policy debate and the rapidly changing landscape for regulatory, enforcement, and litigation issues, and he has actively assisted the SEC in several investigations that resulted in substantial monetary fines and significant changes in practices of certain trading venues, including admissions of inaccurate disclosure.",
