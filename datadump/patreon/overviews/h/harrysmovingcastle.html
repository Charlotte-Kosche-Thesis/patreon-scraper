    "summary": "This is the page dedicated to the most loyal (and royal) of fans, those that want to become more than just a subscriber to my channel. I\u0027ve been making videos for years now and Patreon has shined a path to how I can be funded independently, but most importantly by people who enjoy the content I make. Fear not, your viewership alone is worthy of my gratitude, the fact you take time out of your day to watch my content overwhelms me with joy. However, you can donate as little as a dollar per month (Less than 80p in the UK!) and you are granted reward! Think of it more like a voluntary magazine subscription; you don\u0027t have to pay, but the magazine will be a lot longer and worth reading with your donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou as a fan can become a producer of the show. Look to your left and you can see my goals for the channel economically, and to the right you can see the rewards you can receive for being such an honorable individual. The more money I receive, the more frequent content I make - I can\u0027t make that any clearer. Money is the reason why I currently don\u0027t make videos as often as I probably should, and taking the time to make them is what makes my channel so successful. It is just me who makes the content too so hopefully, with your generosity, this will soon change!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you all,\u003cbr\u003eHarry\u003cbr\u003e"
