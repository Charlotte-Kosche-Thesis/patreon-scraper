This far I have financed it out of my own resources. Now I\u0027m asking for your financial support to continue my priceless work for many, as an independent writer, researcher and human rights worker. Read more how you can already join with 1 dollar per month and what you give forward to countless others, when you support my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction to Lyme\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLyme disease is the fastest growing infectious disease of our time, with more reported new cases than breast cancer and HIV infections. However, because of the way Lyme disease has been coded, defined, underfunded, managed, treated and perceived during the last forty years, estimated millions of ill people around the world are now invisible. They are too often told that the cause of their severe ailments is \u2018all in their heads\u2019 or are simply misdiagnosed with incurable diseases such as MS, ALS, ME, Alzheimer, Parkinson, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Lupus and numerous other diseases, some of which you can find in the image above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost doctors only start to understand the severeness and complexity of this disease, once they or their children become ill themselves. Millions of ill people - including these doctors and children - are simply disappearing from social life, because somebody else tells the wrong story about them. A story that violates our most fundamental human right: the right to dignity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy ways to create awareness\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost people still hope that governments and the medical-scientific systems will provide solutions for them and for future generations. I have been working on other ways to shift the Lyme paradigm. As a social researcher my role has been to document and communicate the devastating social, emotional, financial and legal consequences of the current myths and misconceptions around Lyme and to build alliances with other professionals who defend the human rights of similarly vulnerable and neglected groups of ill people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written the book \u0027Shifting the Lyme Paradigm; the Caretakers\u0027 Guide on a Hero Journey\u0027, available in both English and Dutch, which have been read by both patients, their caretakers, scientists, thought leaders, open-minded doctors as well as world renowned human rights experts. You can find several of their reviews on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/huib/posts\"\u003epublic post section\u003c/a\u003e. Next to the book, I published over 100 well-researched articles and 270 interviews on the On Lyme Foundation\u0027s website, which have been read by over 350,000 readers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also contributed on two critically needed reports for the United Nations (UN), documenting both how the current ICD codes of the World Health Organisation (WHO) lead to human rights abuses of patients as well as the corruption of colluding state actors, insurers and certain medical entities to maintain the status quo. Together with professionals who understand both what is going on and what to do about the current unacceptable situation through appropriate channels like the WHO and the UN, we are already creating movement towards real solutions for countless ill people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it is high time that patients become \u0027impatient\u0027 and learn how to effectively defend their own human rights to dignity and access to care. And I would invite you to join this campaign and\u00a0actively support me to keep stirring this impatient revolution up.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent request \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal is the amount of $2,200 a month.\u00a0With your support, I first of all intend to simply continue my work like this and be able to take my work to a greater level of impact.\u00a0There are still many stories that need to be told, topics that need to be researched and addressed, more reports to the UN that need to be written, processes that need to be disturbed, new alliances need to be build and both disruptive and constructive strategies that need to be created. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution will also allow for everyone to keep having open access to the information; including those who do have not enough money left to buy a book.\u00a0When for example a thousand people are willing to chip in two dollars a month, I will be able to continue creating Lyme awareness for thousands (or rather millions) of others - without needing to put a \u2018pay wall\u2019 or price tag on my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon uses a reward system, which works well for musicians, artists and other creators. Given the nature of my work however, I decided to just let chose. People supporting my work tell me they don\u0027t want anything in return, but simply want me to keep going to provide unbiased information, to unlock knowledge and to work with the Ad Hoc Committee to address human rights violations and medical corruption at the UN in order to break the status quo and work towards real solutions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to join?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI fully understand that many patients themselves have very few resources to spare. Yet any donation will help to create awareness about the Lyme pandemic and ultimately to bring more sanity in the current \u0027health care\u0027 system. You can do so by giving a monthly amount of your own choosing, which you can stop anytime you want. And if you do endorse this campaign but don\u2019t have any money to spare, sharing it with your own network and on Social Media is also helpful. I am deeply grateful to all who enable me to continue shifting the Lyme paradigm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHuib\u003cbr\u003e"

I was born in 1971 in the Netherlands. Probably before I was born, yet surely before I was three years old, I got infected with Lyme. Since then I have spent over 250,000 hours on \"studying\" Lyme, which is said to make me an expert on the subject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was young I was well underway to become a professional soccer player, until I suddenly ended up in a wheelchair for a couple of years. So I learned to use my wits instead of my legs. In 2007 I accidentally discovered I actually had Lyme and managed to cure myself. In hindsight I started seeing what I now call the Labyrinth of Lyme and decided to make it my business to do something about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfessional bio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter getting my Master\u0027s in Social Psychology, I spent some twenty years in international business education, working both with business leaders, professionals and scientists. I have authored several articles on social perception, the paradoxical effect of international policies, on Maverick thinking and scientific progress. My well paying career allowed me to also work with children, showing them how to learn more effortlessly. Besides that I learned about the dynamics of the \"health \u0026amp; wellness market\" as a practitioner in a complementary healing method.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 I left my career to create ripples around the broad, messy and controversial subject of Lyme disease, since I believe that is highly needed and that I am well equipped to \"tune\" the strategy differently. I count myself lucky with the abundance of professional and good-hearted people, who I\u0027ve met during my professional life. Many of these friends are now working together with me again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA very different game board than a soccer field and a much more interesting game to play together!",
