Not always being great with words wanted to\nat least share with you a bit of who I am. The best way to know me, is to know\nmy art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGrowing up my passion for art will only continue to grow\nstronger with every minute passing. The more I learn, the more I love. I am a\nlover of Art. I even named watercolors, the moment I spend penetrating the\npaper with layers of colors is intimate. Nothing can come close to how personal\nI am with my work. So, I name watercolors \u201cConstantine\u201d. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy I started this so I can do what I love. I want to change\nthe art world, make my style something people can enjoy. I want to paint souls\nand personality\u2019s. The stories, the secrets, the passion. \u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, I am\ndiving into other forms of art like photography and fashion. Fashion is named \u201cHelena\u201d. Which is going to be more detailed with in\nthe year, I will be blogging what I learn, new things I been doing with fabrics\nand things of that nature. \u003cbr\u003eCreative as I am, I will be changing everything about my work including my name. I am going to use Hobo Smutt, because I love being free spirited like a bum, and my work has a smutty twist to it. Throwing away nicknames that was given to me like Tex, or Perle. Majora Rose didn\u0027t suit well because it seemed forced. And in creating a new line of work I will change it to fit me. More motivated than ever, nothing will bring me down to chase my dreams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe ones who support me, THANK YOU! I can\u2019t even start to\ndescribe how thankful I am for those who support. Especially means a lot to me\nsince it\u2019s my work.  \u003cbr\u003e"
