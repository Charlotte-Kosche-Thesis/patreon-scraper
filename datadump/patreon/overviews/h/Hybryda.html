I\u0027m old hag, I mean I\u0027m 27 old hag that like to create. It was like that from times long forgotten I call childhood.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreate You ask? But what do you create?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you ask!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eILLUSTRATIONS!\u003c/h3\u003eThis was my first passion. And it still can make me sick when I don\u0027t draw something in long time. I feel bad and wasting away if I don\u0027t sketch some silly idea. Artblock are extra painful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCOSPLAY!\u003c/h3\u003ein 1998 or something like that I was on my first convention. There I learned what cosplay is and very next one I was already dressed. But dressing up is not the beloved part of the hobby. Once again is the creation side. I love to figure out and make my costumes. Bring a bit of this fantasy to real world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eANIMATION!\u003c/h3\u003eI started with static pictures and then... learned that making them move... just a bit makes my heart skip a beat. few frames and suddenly this character of mine blinks or jumps. I love all types of animations, be it 2D, 3D stopmotion...\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3D!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eBack in the day I tried this small program for 3D, you might hear about it... Blender? but it was long ago and I could not force myself to learn much. But around 2 years ago I got my hands on 3D printer and I got this final push to learn the program. It helped that it got much more user friendly. It all stared with modeling for 3D printing only, but soon I saw the potential. Still have a lot to learn but I do love to make item art and soon first illustrations and complex animations\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMORE?\u003c/h3\u003eThere is probably more. I work on MOONLIGHT PROJECT - design compendium for all Sailor Moon, I do want to learn in near future game design and animatronic. I design dresses based on pop-culture. And I want to share my travel with You.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATREON FOR ME?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI do a lot. I want to make more. But at the moment I\u0027m limited by time and funds I can spend. I don\u0027t expect for patreon to be my main source of income, but that would add a bit of stability. I might take a bit less commission work and devote myself to things above. Create for the sake of creating.\u003cbr\u003eI have only one pledge tier. Wonder why I call it Narwhals? It is simple - a group is called a blessing and that what you are for me (don\u0027t cry bryda, you are not done yet)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATREON FOR YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eEveryone counts. No matter haw much you want to send my way, you matter and I love You.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLook to the right. That is a lot I give to You. Some things are early access, some are patreon exclusive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNext year would for sure be better year. (This one was personally bad year with a lot of bad behind me)\u003cbr\u003eI have a ton of costume planned and You will see all the progress photos at least few a week when I work on personal costume, as I love to overshare my work. Working on some new prop. Be ready to get this blueprints so You could tackle them also. Wondering how work goes on this or that piece of art? Wonder no more, if there is a progress, even a bit, You will see that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso at times I get photos from photoshoots all in one batch. And it is up to me to distribute them. You will get all the photos the day I have them. No more waiting for weeks for me to burn through. And there are at least a photoshoots I have already planned. What\u0027s more? Printable art. Lineart and color art in 100% resolution. Just... don\u0027t resell it ok?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and I would forgot. At least one secret cosplay project. Only you will know that I work on this or that. Only you will see the WIPs and if possible You will be one of the first to see it finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
