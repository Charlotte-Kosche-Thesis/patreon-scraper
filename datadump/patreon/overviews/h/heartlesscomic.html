I write stories, comics, and tabletop RPGs, and I draw pretty much everything I write and then some. Most of what I create falls under the category of \u201cgenre fiction\u201d, from fantasy to romance to sci-fi. This Patreon was originally created to support Heartless, my webcomic, but has since been extended to cover support for my other artistic projects as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon support allows me to continue working on stories, games, and artwork that are important to me, and to my patrons, but which might not bring traditional financial success. It also allows me to keep producing free or pay-what-you-want content, making more of my stuff available to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi63.tinypic.com/2ed776e.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThese projects provide free content that anyone can see and enjoy. Even \nwith additional support like pay-what-you-want, ad revenue, or one-off \ndonations, finding the time to work on these can be tough when compared \nto paid work. The money I earn through Patreon helps me continue to provide this sort of content.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHeartless:\n\u003c/strong\u003eMy ongoing original webcomic, featuring vampires, pretty dresses, and an asexual \nprotagonist.  I\u0027ve been working on Heartless since early 2015, and you \ncan read the entire comic for free online at \u003ca href=\"http://heartless-comic.com\"\u003ehttp://heartless-comic.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eIndie RPGs:\n\u003c/strong\u003eMuch of my independent RPG work goes towards small games that I release \nfor free. I\u0027d like to find time to write more of these, and provide more\n content for the games I\u0027ve finished, especially Rest. You can find a \nfew of my free games at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sweetingenuity.com/free-stuff.html\"\u003ehttp://www.sweetingenuity.com/free-stuff.html\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube:\n\u003c/strong\u003eMy Youtube channel is still pretty small, but I\u0027m trying to create a new\n video every week. Many of these are simple speedpaints, but I\u0027m also \nusing the channel to share tips and tutorials from what I\u0027ve learned \nover the years. You can find my channel at \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5etzwMaJ1KqLv-bs9fVGpw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5etzwMaJ1KqLv-b...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal Art/Writing:\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen I\u0027m not writing or drawing professionally, I\u0027m usually writing or \ndrawing for myself. I produce occasional fanart and fanfiction, as well \nas various personal illustrations and writing to explore new story \nideas, the best of which get posted online on one of my various social \nmedia pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi67.tinypic.com/245aj9h.jpg\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eThese projects aren\u0027t available for free, but many of them are still \npassion projects, especially when it comes to taking risks on new ideas.\n Patreon support acts as a \"tip jar\" from art patrons who love what I do\n and want to help me make more of it. Wherever possible, I\u0027m going to \ntry and offer extra behind-the-scenes peeks, early access, and discounts\n to patrons to thank them for their extra support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eOnline Stores:\u003c/strong\u003e\nThrough Etsy and a few other sites, I offer greeting cards, prints, \nmerch, and even fabric printed with my original illustrations, \nfrequently updated with new art and designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eTabletop RPG Writing:\u003c/strong\u003e\nI work as a freelance writer on a variety of tabletop RPG projects, as well as working on larger games of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eCommissions:\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhile I focus primarily on my own artwork and commercial-use \nwork-for-hire, I do occasionally take personal commissions too. I almost\n always have chibi commissions available through my Etsy store, but when\n I open commissions in my more complex styles my patrons will have first\n dibs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
