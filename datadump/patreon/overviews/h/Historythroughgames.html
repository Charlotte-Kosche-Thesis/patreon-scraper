I am a recent Graduate of Ancient History and I adore the study of the past in general. Thus as a huge gaming buff it hit me once while at work. Why not teach history through playing games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have done something similar to this over at the LowesyPC Twitch channel with my Historical Playthrough of Hearts of Iron IV as the German Reich. However, with a band of volunteers, I will hopefully explore other parts of history to create an eye-opening exploaration of the past, so please join us in the adventures through the past!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo enjoy the videos and explore Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLowesyPC\u003cbr\u003eDan \u003cbr\u003e"

This is my attempt. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistory Through Games is a way of engaging two groups of people. One gamers, who may have an interest in the backgrounds and history of their games. Two History Buffs, who may want to see grand strategies and epic battles of the past fought out in front of their eyes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be creating videos that hopefully will be full of knowledge, pleasing visuals, and brimming with history. I will be offering the chance for my Patrons to see videos early and also the chance to appear in them too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I am doing it this way is so that any support from you I do get I can put back into the channel with new games to play and explore, new equipment better visuals and more time to commit to the projects if there is enough support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy and I will see you soon!\u003cbr\u003e",
