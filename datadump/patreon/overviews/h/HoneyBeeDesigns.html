    "summary": "Hi, my name is Bee Geiger and I am a 26 year old queer trans girl living in Oakland, CA. Beginning in Dec 2015, I have been doing sliding scale tailoring/alterations for Bay Area queer/trans people and recently, I have also begun working out of the new NOTAFLOF (No One Turned Away For Lack of Funds) collective in North Oakland..\u00a0As a transitioning trans girl on hormones, my body has changed so dramatically and it can be hard to have a wardrobe that fits properly, so sewing has been my savior. I have already met a number of queer and trans people who have similiar issues. The majority of my clients so far have been masculine people AFAB (assigned female at birth) who buy pants marketed to men...but also have large hips (though I am of course very open to anyone!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also am an aspiring fashion designer/seamstress, and right now largely make dresses and other more femme clothing. Check out my pics and video for the couple of items for myself that I have finished! Additionally, check out my instagram (\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/honeybeedesigns5653/),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/honeybeedesigns5653/),\u003c/a\u003e which has sketches of other designs I would love to make if I had time...either for myself or someone else! I would like to devote more time to this and to making affordable dresses custom designed for awesome queers...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that right now, I am absolutely swamped with clients/work, largely people who don\u0027t have much money and who otherwise would have no fitting clothes that in any way conform to their identity. There are SO many queer/trans people in the Bay who could use affordable queer tailoring from someone used to and comfortable with different bodies than clothing designers normally intend designing for. There are just too many of us for one tailor to handle. If they found a way to be affordable, ten queer tailors could easily serve the Bay Area queer/trans community and never have to compete for work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor that reason, I also want to begin putting effort in establishing labor shares (work for me for a few hours doing basic sewing and I\u0027ll do your clothes for free), apprenticeships (I have had a number of offers already) and classes for queer/trans people so they can tailor their own and other people\u0027s clothing. I also am donating a sewing machine and some basic supplies to the NOTAFLOF collective so people can go and sew for themselves whenever they want. Tailor a queer\u0027s clothes and make them look stylish for a day, teach a queer to tailor and make them look hella stylish for life ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, very few of my clients are able to pay very high on my sliding scale and right now (which is fine...those are the people I WANT to help), and it isn\u0027t enough to make a living. I don\u0027t have time to put towards realizing my teaching dreams and I definitely don\u0027t have time to actually design and make clothes, which is my real passion. Patrons who could donate absolutely any amount would help me tremendously to be able to truly be affordable for the people who need it, pass on the ability to sew and tailor, and actually pursue my passion for clothing design to help spread unique, cute queer designs throughout the Bay Area. Thank you so much for reading \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
