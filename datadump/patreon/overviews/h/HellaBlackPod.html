With each episode we hope to educate and inform our listeners on all things related to Blackness. Our podcast is important because it uplifts the voices of Black radical organizers who are doing the work in the field. Often times our narratives are not told.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should consider becoming a Patron because each podcast we guarantee you will learn something new, and to be honest - we are funny as hell. It will also allow us to get your email, which will allow us to stay in contact with you better and send you podcasts right when they drop.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth Blake and Delency are community organizers in Oakland as well as educators.
