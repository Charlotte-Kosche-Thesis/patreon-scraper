So, you know that it\u0027s worth every dime, that we\u0027re going to make it whether we are making it with 100 bones we just busked, or with whatever budget is thrown our way, and Patreon is the place to invest your cash in your community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHomeGrown Theatre is a Boise-based production company.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTogether we work with talented teams of performers and production crew to write scripts, craft puppets, and produce locally crafted plays. Days are spent designing props and puppets, including elaborate shadow puppets in a garage/workspace, and nights rehearsing in the basement of the Gem Center for the Arts. Our mission is to serve an audience of peers, a group that seems to have fallen between the cracks when it comes to performing arts. HomeGrown rises to the challenge by bringing the show to bars and alternative venues, drawing a crowd who comes for the beer and laughs, but stays for the smart, real storytelling.

And isn\u0027t that something Boise deserves? That you deserve? Let\u0027s face it, artists make shitty waiters, and for the price of a monthly cup of coffee you can be helping artists make livable wage by doing art, and not messing up your drink orders. You can be a benefactor to your community by housing these artists with shelter to create, work, store stuff, and rehearse. And you don\u0027t need to steal grandma\u0027s purse to get in on this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHGT\u0027s mission is to never have to turn anyone away, which means we make productions that the brokest of hipsters can afford to turn up for. Inexpensive theatre means more cash in your pocket which means more drinks in your belly! If you haven\u0027t been to one of HGT\u0027s plays, I\u0027m going to let you in on the secret; it\u0027s totally worth it. It\u0027s the kinda thing that doesn\u0027t exist in Boise.
