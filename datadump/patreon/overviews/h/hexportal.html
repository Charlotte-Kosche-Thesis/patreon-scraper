    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi! Thank you so much for your interest in joining the HexPortal community as a patron! Make sure to check our awesome rewards, and if you\u0027re already a patron, thank you for joining us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Hugo Lindsay. Ever since I was a kid, I\u0027ve loved exploring online worlds and I\u0027ve always wanted to create my own. This is what made me develop an interest in coding and become a software developper by profession. But I\u0027ve come to realize that for those that don\u0027t enjoy coding, there is a very real barrier to creating any type of online world. And even for those that do, it can be a massive undertaking and require a large team to complete. Especially in the case of massively multiplayer games which are typically among the most complex projects. Many end up giving up on their dream, but what if it didn\u0027t have to be this way? That\u0027s why I started the HexPortal project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is HexPortal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHexPortal is all about empowering you to create your own immersive online worlds regardless of your technical skill level or experience. You will be able to create your own worlds by simply piecing together modules of your choice, tweaking settings, and selecting content from a massive community built library. Deployment, hosting and scaling will all be handled in the background by HexPortal to allow you to focus only on making your world exactly the way you want it. And if you do want to get your hands dirty, you will still be able to create your own modules and content and share it with the community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy HexPortal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHexPortal will make it possible for a single person with zero technical knowledge to create their own fully fledged massively multiplayer online world! HexPortal is also all about community and cooperation and sharing. By working as a team we can create something so much bigger than ourselves. Here are some tools and features HexPortal will make available to you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eProcedural World Generation\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t have to start from scratch! Start with a virtually infinite sized procedurally generated world. The algorithm will be fully tweak-able giving you the freedom to modify every aspect, such as which biomes exist and their occurence rate. You can then go in and make manual changes, or optionally give players the ability to do it themselves! Plus since the algorithm is deterministic, you can reset manual changes in any given area and regenerate it exactly as it was originally generated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMassively Multiplayer\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHexPortal will fully handle this in the background so that you won\u0027t have to give it a single thought. HexPortal is designed to scale up as much as you need it to. Plus, if you want to, you\u0027ll be able to enable split-screen multiplayer and cross platform multiplayer for your world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eModular Design and Community asset sharing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHexPortal\u0027s modular design allows for each world to be truly unique. You will even be able to create your own modules! And sharing modules and content you create means HexPortal gets better for everyone with more and more options to choose from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin our Exclusive Community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGet access to my patron only feed!\u00a0Plus, get promoted to a special role on our Discord server and\u00a0access patron only channels!
