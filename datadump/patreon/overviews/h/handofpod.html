With money from our patrons, we\u0027ll be able to buy our own domain for the HOP website, pay for our drinks each week, and Sam hopes to have enough left over to finally start paying the other panelists for their time, after over seven years of everyone doing the show our of the goodness of their own hearts. As well as all this, later in 2018 when we have to start paying for our SoundCloud Pro account (we haven\u0027t had to until now ... it\u0027s a long story), funding will enable us to ensure the entire back catalogue of the podcast remains online, rather than having to have a lot of older episodes disappear off the page. In time, we hope this will lead to a better show. Maybe we\u0027ll even feel motivated to plan a few segments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe HOP Patreon page is launching with only two reward levels. That\u0027s because we still haven\u0027t worked out the final details of the social media networking we\u0027ll use for the other level, which will include HOP Extra as well as the chance to chat with other listeners and the podcast (Sam at least; other HOPsters TBC) via a private group, probably on Facebook. We expect this second reward level to launch within a few days, but wanted to go live now so early adopters can get hold of HOP Extra for the weekend just gone.\u003cbr\u003e"
