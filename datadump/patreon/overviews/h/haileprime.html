    "summary": "Hello, welcome to my Patreon page! So we all know why we\u2019re here, I\u2019ve weaseled you into clicking on my link to hopefully get money out of you. Yes, shameful, but, it could benefit us both! So let me explain a little bit\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to come home from school every single day and write. School was easy, didn\u2019t take a lot out of me, didn\u2019t ask anything of me, and gave me ample free time. So I wrote, a lot. It may have taken me 5 years to finish\u00a0Melanie\u0027s story but I finished Kendra\u0027s in only 11 months!\u00a0But now that I am older I have Work instead, and it does take a lot out of me. I\u2019ve got all these adult responsibilities and such and they all suck. They leave no room for fun anymore it seems. As such, I lack either the motivation or the inspiration to write anymore. I\u2019m trying to change that, but I could use your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage to me, I will not only strive for excellence and success, but in putting out more and more content for you and everyone else to enjoy. I\u2019ve written for well over a decade with no intention of personal gain, and that isn\u2019t changing now. I still write, and this Patreon page has been up for almost three years with little success (but I now have a couple Patrons! woo!). But, I\u2019ve still put out the same amount of content as I would have had if I had not done this thing. So, I\u2019m merely asking for a little bit of help so I can spend even more time doing what I love and putting out ever more increasingly incredible content for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve changed and streamlined my rewards and offerings once again to help you make your choice and to help me fulfill them. It was getting a little hectic with so many reward tiers to keep track of. So now I\u0027ve got a few very simple ones. Contribute as much as you want but if you donate at least the value listed on the right you\u0027ll get those rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should also remind everyone that Patreon doesn\u0027t always give me notifications so you should definitely send me an email when you become a patron. A simple hello and what your patronage reward level is. I\u0027d love to chat, I think I\u0027m pretty friendly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut anyway, thank you again for the opportunity to provide the okayest quality entertainment and artistry I can give. I\u0027m trying my best! And with your support I promise to get even better!\u003cbr\u003e"

Now that I am older I don\u0027t have near as much time to work on my writing, which greatly saddens me. I want to be able to contribute even more to the community that I love so much and to do this I need a little bit of help. I\u0027ll continue to write with or without anyone\u0027s patronage, but it would do wonders to ease things on my end! After all, if everyone gave me $1, I could retire!\u003cbr\u003e",
