Our work is a sacred act of resistance against everything that prevents our sisters and siblings across the globe from getting free from the gender binary.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.heartsparkpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ResilienceLBX-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, 322 supporters from across the globe raised $11,229 for Heartspark to create \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1793438718/the-resilience-anthology\"\u003eThe Resilience Anthology\u003c/a\u003e,\" the largest literary collection of trans women and (C)AMAB NB writers. Because of their generosity, we published and started shipping \u003cem\u003eResilience\u003c/em\u003e, donated copies to people in need and libraries, and went on a Midwest tour with some of our writers. This February, Amy Heart and co-editor Abbey Pieri started editing the world\u2019s first literary collection of children\u2019s stories written by (C)AMAB trans writers for trans girls and gender non-conforming kids. \u003cem\u003eWe\u0027ve even discussed a North American tour in Summer 2018, if the stars align just right for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.heartsparkpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_0970.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile small presses like ours are built entirely with love, they still have to survive within the confines of late capitalism. Our volunteer staff works day and night to keep bringing you new trans literature, but we\u2019ve also got bills to pay and lives to lead. We need to find a way to sustainably pay our writers, print books, record more stories, go on tour, and take care of our hearts while doing The Work. \u003cstrong\u003eIn short, we can\u2019t do this alone\u003c/strong\u003e. The time has come\u00a0for the community-at-large to support trans women and (C)AMAB nonbinary writers in telling their own stories.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAnd that\u2019s where you come in.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage supports our vision of a new world where storytelling by trans women and (C)AMAB nonbinary artists are accessible to everyone. Monthly donation in any amount will help us eat, pay the bills, fund writers, post print books, post to our Bandcamp, and hopefully the big dream\u2014to keep going on tour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.heartsparkpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_0625.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut more than anything, by donating to our Patreon, you\u2019ll become an active participant in this major act of resistance. Every day, (C)AMAB trans lives are constantly threatened by a violent, cissexist society that doesn\u2019t believe we have the right to exist. \n\u003cem\u003eWhen you support Heartspark Press, you are standing up for the voices of all transgender girls, women, and (C)AMAB non-binary folks across the entire planet\u003c/em\u003e. You are screaming that our voices are important and that our lives are worth fighting for. This is a rare opportunity to help us make this world safer for everyone struggling to get free of the gender binary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJoin us in lifting the voices of (C)AMAB trans people everywhere.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://heartsparkpress.com\"\u003eSupport Heartspark Press today\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
