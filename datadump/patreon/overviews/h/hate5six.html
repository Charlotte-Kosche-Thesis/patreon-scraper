Rather than continuing to sell myself to companies in order to pursue my passion, I\u0027m cutting to the chase and attempting to take hate5six to the next level by going full time with it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you have never heard of hate5six.com, it is a project I started in 2008 (officially) as a way to archive live music and connect people to bands.

My content has been viewed over 15 million times and people worldwide have spent 140 million minutes watching these videos.

     "about": "This project stands for the redistribution of high-quality live music videos in as much of an anti-capitalist framework as realistically allowable. At its crux, music is the communication of ideas through rhythm and sound. The introduction of money into the equation invariably obscures that connection. In an era when the turnover rate in the community is staggeringly high, this site serves as a vehicle for preservation and posterity. Institutional memory is key in any setting, and hardcore is no exception. A band\u0027s live performance tells a story about a particular moment in time relative to a particular audience. The intention here is to share that story with people who could not be there to experience it, both physically and temporally, or with those who have no conception of what hardcore is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout an audience, a band is just sending acoustic vibrations into an empty room. Without a band, bodies are just standing catatonically in a room waiting for inspiration or some other activation of the senses. This interface between the two defines an impassable gap between seeing a live show in the flesh and watching a two dimensional projection of said show on a screen. They can never be equivalent, but there are ways to construct a bridge that attempts to close that gap. The retelling of these narratives in this manner is the sole mission of hate5six.com.",
