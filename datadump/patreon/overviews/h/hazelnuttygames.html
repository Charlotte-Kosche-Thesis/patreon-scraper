I also believe in the community that hangs out with me in my streams and comments on my videos! You guys are awesome and there\u0027d be no HazelNuttyGames without you guys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a place where you guys can choose to support me in my dream of making a living at content creation. I spend upwards of 60 hours a week on the work that goes into my videos! With your help, I can go from \u0027Delusional Video-Making Hermit\u0027 to \u0027Financially Sustainable Video-Making Hermit\u0027. Every 1$ raised here helps me as much as 1000 views on Youtube!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a strong value of mine that all of my content should be available to everyone, for free. I will never put any videos or livestreams behind a paywall. I don\u0027t ever want to make anyone feel like they\u0027re missing out because they can\u0027t afford to donate! Because of this, there will be no Patreon-specific videos. There are some cool rewards to thank you guys for your help though!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to check out my Patreon. I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful day."
