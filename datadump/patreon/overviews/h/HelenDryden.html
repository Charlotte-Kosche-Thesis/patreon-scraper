    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Helen Dryden, I\u0027m an artist and a painter based in Leeds, UK. Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited to be able to use Patreon to give rewards to my supporters who are helping me continue to make art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two different reward tiers available -\u00a0 $1 and $10. Please check out which one is right for you by reading the info to the right. My aim is to create a sustainable income where I can make my art with the knowledge that I have some money coming in. Like a lot of artists, I exhibit and sell my work but this is an unpredictable business and I can never tell when those sales will happen. With Patreon, my supporters can pay as little as $1 a month, and know that they are helping me on my way to sustaining my practice, as well as getting amazing Patron Only rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been making art professionally for 18 years, painting and drawing, organising exhibitions of my own work and other artists\u0027 too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to my art I have a spontaneous, \nexperimental approach to materials and subject matter. Using acrylic, \nwatercolour and mixed media, painting is my way of reflecting on a \nplace, event, emotion, idea or person. Using photos as a starting point,\n the resulting artwork may be representational or a journey into \nimagination or abstraction. My job as an artist is to figure out what \npainting and drawing can be, using my direct experience of the world and\n my interior narrative.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m inspired by graphic novels, \nexpressionist painting, psychedelia, pop culture, music and doing crafts\n with my son. I have a restlessness, influenced by diverse subject \nmatter such as goth/punk women, British 90\u0027s rave culture, local \nlandscapes, my domestic situation, stage magicians, and ideas of Utopia \nand the apocalypse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I set up \nUrban Sketching/artist networking group \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SketchThat\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSketch That\u003c/a\u003e which has monthly \nmeet-ups and an annual exhibition. In 2000 I graduated from Leeds Metropolitan University with a \ndegree in Graphic Arts \u0026amp; Design. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to get $100 a month in pledges which would be fantastic \nas I spend a lot of my money on art supplies. The support of brilliant \nPatrons in 2017 and some sales on \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/HelenDrydenArt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy etsy shop\u003c/a\u003e, plus a couple of \ncommissions, and sales on\u003ca href=\"https://www.saatchiart.com/HelenDryden\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e SaatchiArt \u003c/a\u003emeant that for the first time ever I could break even and \nnot make a loss. Woo! Now I want to work on making some money to live \noff while I make my own art and support others (through Sketch That) with \ntheir art careers too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank everyone who has signed up to show their support so far! You are amazing people, and are really helping me. It\u0027s so good to know that people like what I do and I hope that you enjoy the rewards. YOU GUYS ARE THE GREATEST!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
