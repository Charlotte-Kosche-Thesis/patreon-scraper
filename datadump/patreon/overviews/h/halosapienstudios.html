So recently I\u0027ve decided to take a huge leap...okay maybe like a medium leap, cut down a bunch of my hours from work and transition to make my part-time job (which is my art) into my full-time job. With your help on Patreon the goal is to earn a living working solely on my art through comics and illustrations \u003cem\u003eaaaaaand \u003c/em\u003ebe able to finally travel to comic conventions and see all you wonderful people and fellow geeks!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e a sob story, nor is it a plea for your money, I just wanted to be open and honest about where I\u0027m coming from. If you like what you see and want to pledge or donate, awesome! No money and you just want to leave a comment, cool! Basket of kittens, heck yeah! Large supreme pizza on pan crust, I love you!! Actually now that I think about, I don\u0027t think you can do those last things on Patreon. I\u0027m thankful for any and all shares, visits and pledges to this page. Every little bit helps.
