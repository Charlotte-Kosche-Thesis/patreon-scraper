    "summary": "Hey it\u0027s me, Nick.  \u003cbr\u003eI make podcasts and travel the world helping people set up effective and sustainable homesteads and farms.\u00a0I appreciate that you made it to this page. \u003cstrong\u003eI have a vision to create a FREE Permaculture Design Course, FREE courses on gardening, carpentry, welding, butchering, raising animals, cooking, preserving food, propagating plants, and many more topics.\u003c/strong\u003e Those courses are often quite expensive and restrict important knowledge to only people who can afford a $1200 course. I want to build an easily accessible repository of knowledge made free to everyone. Just the fact that you\u0027re here tells me that you are interested in helping me help more people. Thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e Joining Homegrown Liberty on Patreon will allow me to do cool stuff like make videos explaining how to set up resilient systems on your property like automated watering and feeding for your chickens, predator protection, placement of your animals and plant growing zones so they will benefit each other and reduce the amount of work you have to do every day! This would be a huge help to transition from traveling and consulting to more frequent videos and free up some of my time to do important things like trying be a good Dad! Making these videos will allow me to reach more people with great information that they need but can\u0027t afford to buy, or don\u0027t know how to find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow?\u003c/strong\u003e Several cool reward levels allow you to tailor your subscription.  I would like to convince you to choose one, even at $1, so you have access to the Homegrown Liberty feed here at Patreon.  Sometimes YouTube\u0027s subscription methods are unreliable, and if you sign up via Patreon you\u0027ll be notified directly when I upload a video, which is pretty awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If you\u0027d like to go above and beyond to help me do things like travel for an episode, invest in equipment, create animations, tackle larger and more interesting projects, and pay for my kids\u0027 current and future education.... picking any of the larger support levels will certainly help do these things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it goes without saying that we would greatly appreciate your financial support. I\u0027ll say it anyways though. Thank you. I greatly appreciate it. The Patreon model asks us to create rewards here to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re both honest... you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027m trying to do with Homegrown Liberty, and you think the lifestyle we encourage, and information I have to share is worth it. You\u0027re a fellow thinker and doer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo Good Things, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNick - Homegrown Liberty\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003etl;dr (too long; didn\u0027t read)\u003cbr\u003e- Pledges are per month and help me make awesome videos\u003cdiv\u003e- I will release 2 videos per month on average, to start with. More as we reach goals. Expect the first videos to come out when we get close to the first financial goal.\u003cdiv\u003e- Thank you so much for helping out, every little bit is appreciated!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
