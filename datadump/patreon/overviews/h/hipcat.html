    "summary": "Hi, I am HipCat,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream to create an artist access printery \u0026amp; gallery is now well and truly underway, I\u0027ve done this without external help; aside from the assistance and support of friends, my children and my patreon supporters! People like you that believe that a healthy arts and cultural sector makes for a healthier, and a more stimulating and invigorating society.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love teaching the myriad of techniques and disciplines within printmaking.I am fortunate that I am able to teach people, techniques which allow them to create the works that they have dreamed about and facilitate their saying the things which they need to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a practicing artist printer since I was 16. Back in the day I did artwork for the Dead Kennedys art director John Yates. I did work for Memoria Pulp in Germany and got my work into the National Gallery of Australia before I turned 21. I\u0027ve been at this for a while as I\u0027ve just turned 48.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI print on some lovely old presses, I set type, I cut lino, I engrave wood. I\u0027m producing artistsbooks \u0026amp; prints; editioning for \nartists and teaching people how to create and print by hand. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired by Artnoose (an amazing letterpress printer whose also on Patreon) I\u0027m producing my own letterpress printed bi monthly zine. I\u0027ll also be producing my prints, my broadsheets and working on a number of artist book projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong ago I worked at Redback Graphix under the late Michael Callahan. I learnt from him that Australia as a country doesn\u0027t really support the arts and that to make art in Australia you have to create your own space. Its a trend everywhere that the funding for the arts is reducing, but in Australia there never has been reasonable funding for the fine arts. Artists access spaces are virtually non existent. In the USA \u0026amp; UK there are spaces made for artists which are supported by artists but this is not how it is in Australia. This is me creating the space, for myself, for others...\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always done this on my own, I\u0027ve never received any funding except from \nsales of my work, with three kids to support (single dad), I\u0027m reaching \nout to get some consistency to my income and get others to join me on \nthis ride. I want to join that community of artists that exists just beyond the reach of my arms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for coming with me on this journey, reading this far I hope you will consider becoming my patron, and supporting the arts in Australia\u00a0 (through me and through this project), and for making a difference...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
