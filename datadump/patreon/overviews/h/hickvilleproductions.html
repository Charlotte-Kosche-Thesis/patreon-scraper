Also because this is something I\u0027d love to do full time. Being able to give it my full attention would not only mean I\u0027d be able to stick to a more frequent release schedule again, but I\u0027d also be able to create content of higher caliber. I\u0027ve studied and been an indie film creator. I\u0027ve also worked a broadcast related job. Not to mention, I\u0027ve had my hands in the animation cookie jar since I was only 8 years old. I love to create professional level videos that convey something deeper to them. Even if it\u0027s something simple like share a smile with someone cause you never know what that seemingly simple empathetic act may do for them that day. Granted, that there is probably the biggest reason I\u0027d imagine one would want to support my work.
