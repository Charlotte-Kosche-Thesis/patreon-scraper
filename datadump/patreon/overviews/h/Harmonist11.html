Let\u0027s sum it up. Under this alias I create adult illustrations in an anime/manga style, with erotic content that explores specific hardcore fetishes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.hitmann.net/harmy/patreon_divider_buttfocus.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a creative person with my hands on many kinds of projects, but my free time is limited, my income from a full-time job so-so, and living expenses and mortgage to pay for, so I tend to lean towards doing creative things that might help with such expenses. Unfortunately, this has usually meant that those things are not the things I truly would want to be working on, and I often lose artistic freedom in the process, because the work is often commissioned. One thing I would want to put more focus on is adult artwork. Particularly the content that comes out of my own dirty mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.hitmann.net/harmy/patreon_divider_cutie.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been extremely humbled by the amount of positive feedback and the way my artwork has been received by those who fancy the same fetishes I like to explore in my art, over the past years. I would really like to give those people, people like you perhaps, such art more frequently. Aside from limited free time, another thing I lack is incentive. While it is not possible for me to do this as a full-time job (for various reasons), if I could get just a little bit of money every now and then from doing my own adult artworks, it\u0027d be incentive enough to keep going, way beyond most alternatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.hitmann.net/harmy/patreon_divider_twins.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want, you can help nudge me towards creating content more frequently.

I won\u0027t send works that are horribly damaged to begin with though. (I\u0027m quite careful with my works though. The list will include mentions of any issues I find worth mentioning.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlso note that some works may not look as clean as the versions online, because faintly visible lines, like those erased with an eraser during drawing, may still show.
