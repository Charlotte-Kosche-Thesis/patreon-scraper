As a non-binary identified queer person, I\u0027ve witnessed first hand the power behind creating images of our relationships and ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://hereportraits.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e is a personal project I\u2019ve wanted to do for a very long time.I intend to create a space for people to share their truth and for anyone who visits the website to develop an understanding of the diversity of background; and experience, of transgender and non-binary identifying people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCombining words with these portraits is essential, allowing the subjects to collaborate on their own representation. This patreon will be a space to expand on these statements and conduct deeper and more in depth interviews with some of the people participating. Perhaps one of those people can be you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany similar projects have focused on trans people living in large cities, my focus will be to work with people within their own communities. Historically, trans people have existed in every culture, in every community. I\u2019m interested to show that this is true across America, and interview people who might otherwise never wind up in a documentary project. Thank you for your support."
