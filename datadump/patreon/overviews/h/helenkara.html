I can set up a YouTube channel on creative research methods\nfor students and early career researchers. I can develop an open access\nacademic journal on creative research methods.

I have the knowledge, skills,\nexperience, and contacts to make all this happen \u2013 I just need your help. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been an independent researcher since 1999, and enjoy working\nin my garden office in Uttoxeter, a quiet market town in central England. I am\nfascinated by research methods, particularly the new, cutting-edge, creative\nmethods being used around the world to help answer today\u0027s difficult questions.\nI love to write about, share, and teach these methods. Thanks so much for your support in helping to make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are other ways you can support me, too.
