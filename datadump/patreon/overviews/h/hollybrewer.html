I like to see the app on my phone reminding me to stay in touch with folks about what I\u0027m up to. I often post lil snippets on fb but it\u0027s not enough to get out the whole story as it were. I\u0027m not a blogger. I don\u0027t keep a journal and for someone who talks as much as I do, I don\u0027t seem to be good at regular communication but I\u0027m hoping that here I won\u0027t be as spread out and I can consolidate my transmissions. We\u0027ll see.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOU:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re at this page, you probably know me personally. I value\n your input. I want these ideas to become reality. I\u0027ll do it anyway (I\n can\u0027t stop) it will just take longer without you, in some cases, a lot \nlonger and I risk some ideas floating away if I can\u0027t catch them fast \nenough. The truth is \u003cstrong\u003eI NEED YOU\u003c/strong\u003e. You are my tribe but I\u0027ve never really given you the keys to come in. I\u0027ve not had them. I think \u003cstrong\u003eTHIS PLACE IS THE KEY\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026gt; Let\u0027s See how awesome \u003cstrong\u003eWE CAN MAKE IT\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story (Well a part of it anyway):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may know me by my musical projects,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.humanwine.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHUMANWINE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://www.thefolksbelow.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Folks Below\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\n I tell stories through song. I am a maker and above all open to \ncreating many forms of ART. I looked for a peer-to-peer system when I \ncan deal DIRECTLY with my supporters. I\u0027ve successfully run a campaign \non \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humanwine-the-folks-below#/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIndiegogo\u003c/a\u003e (2k11) and \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanwine/humanwine-fits-4-new-records-in-a-glass-bottle-and\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKickstarter\u003c/a\u003e (2k15). I sell my tunes \u0026amp; wares through \u003ca href=\"https://humanwine.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e, they offer a subscription service for folks but it just is just too limited in \u003cstrong\u003ethe amount of interaction I\u0027d like to have with you\u003c/strong\u003e. A bunch of my fellow artists have been telling me to join Patreon for 2 years now and finally I\u0027m ready to commit to this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTIMING\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003eRunning a Campaign like IndieGoGo or Kickstarter has proven to eat up a \nsolid 2 months of my life each time. No bueno. That\u0027s a proven time \nwaster AND campaigns end :( I want to create quality content and get it to you NOW, each time. Another \ntime waster has been the \"aloneness\". I will hire more musicians, artists, an\n assistant to help these creations come to life. More time and less \nstress is a winning combo in my book. I may even make another book. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve moved, let\u0027s see, around 17 times in the past 10 years. \nI\u0027VE FINALLY GOT A HOME. A place I live. I have a studio (that I just \nfinished building) where I can record anything I want and make anything I\n can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCREATIONS:\u003c/strong\u003e After February, I will most likely come up with a new finished creation every 40 days or so. You can adjust your pledge at anytime and you can cap it. You will never be docked for capping your pledge. Whether you grab a Boarding Pass for $1 or become a First Mate for $100 per creation, you have the SAME SAY as anyone here. I\u0027m the ship. How far and how fast we sail is up to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT BIG THING I AM CREATING NOW: Crow Calls Fox\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIII Part Music Series \u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart I: This War\u0027s Medic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be my first time ever recording a very RAW, unrefined, naked album. The songs came to me over the past 3 months. I think after co-creating HUMANWINE\u0027s \u003ca href=\"https://humanwine.bandcamp.com/merch/aether-codex-i-want-all-things\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u00e6ther \u0026amp; codex\u003c/a\u003e in all its lush imagery and nearly airbrushed sonics of minute perfection the only way to turn next was down the street 100 miles to a beat up old motel. I parked and went in. My feet sloshed through the dank carpet down hallways of torn wallpaper that wreaked of loss, pain, anguish and loneliness. I wasn\u0027t checked in. I didn\u0027t even work there. I had no idea why I was there. Then I did. I walked by a door and she told me to sit with her. She spoke eloquently about how she lost her father. Her best friend in the whole world. I held her for a time. How long? I don\u0027t remember. When I closed her door I didn\u0027t even get 3 steps before he begged me to come into his room. I did. He told me of a woman who was having their baby and about the moment when they had to blow out the candles because the nurses were wheeling in an oxygen tank. I held him too and I was the only one of us who seemed to be startled when another guest knocked on his door and begged me to come to their room to show me the pictures of everyone in their lives who had left because they couldn\u0027t understand. I wiped their tears, held their face close to mine and said, \"I love you\" and I did. On and on it went like this. Down each hall I must have visited 13 rooms and in each room was a totally unique voice telling a different tale. I promised to sing all their stories and I will. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eholly\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublic Profiles:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hollybrewer\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thiswarsmedic/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
