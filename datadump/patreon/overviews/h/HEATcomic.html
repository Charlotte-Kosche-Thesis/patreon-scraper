Hell, Inc. is drawn in my spare time, as I juggle a variety of freelance comic and illustration projects to pay the bills. My goal with Patreon is to use your support to spend my time working on the projects that I want to work on, starting with Hell, Inc., which lends itself quite well to Patreon\u0027s per-creation set-up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating a small amount of money per Hell, Inc. comic that is posted, you will not only be supporting Hell, Inc., but all of the other projects I want to be working on, including (but not limited to) Hockeypocalypse. You\u0027ll also be getting some nifty rewards, including digital and physical copies of books I\u0027ve done, as well as helping push toward additional Hell, Inc. comics per week! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with all Patreon campaigns, you have control over how much you want to spend. You can set a limit on how much you want to donate per month, as well as end your patronage at any time. \u003cbr\u003e"
