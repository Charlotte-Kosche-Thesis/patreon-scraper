    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, I\u2019m Harry and I am a photographer based in Wales. My love is for landscape and nature which are the main focus of much of my work. I began my photography company at the end of 2016 and had some exciting successes. I feel now is the time to take the experience I have gained and really push to take H Tilsley Photography to a new level!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided I would start a Patreon after coming back from travelling for a month in Japan. Having some time to take a step back from the business and see it all clearly I could see that a small regular amount of money coming in would make a huge difference, allowing me to properly invest and create projects that I cannot do otherwise. You may have seen my work around the flood defence in Cardiff. Luckily, that subject was just down the road for me, but I have lots of ideas that require more time, more travel and more resources. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy hope is that through Patreon, and with your support, I will be able to create projects and content that not only matter to me but also to you. Patreon also gives me a space to interact with everyone on a more personal basis as well as a place where I can post content directly to those who do care about it. By creating a Patreon community I will be able to exchange ideas and content with you which can help me develop more meaningful projects. Along with this, being a photographer means I require quite a bit of equipment. Patreon will hopefully let me build up the money to occasionally replace things like lenses and upgrade items which are getting old. This means I can keep creating quality images and content to share with you! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny support from you allows me to continue doing what I love. If you\u2019re interested in my work, and want to give me a boost, just choose how much you want to pledge per month (even $1 makes a difference!) and select some great rewards like, postcards, prints, Q\u0026amp;A\u2019s and monthly newsletters.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd don\u2019t worry! You can edit or cancel your pledge anytime you want.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
