YouTube channel! If you like HotTips! content, you\u0027ll love getting access to it before everyone else!\u003cbr\u003e----------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eQuick\u00a0Message\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nHey everyone! YouTube, for me, has been a place of amazing personal expression, both in a professional capacity, as well as a gaming community. I\u0027ve learned a ton on this network, and YouTube has offered me the chance, as a platform, to give back some of that knowledge, and some of that excitement and entertainment, in the form of video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRecently, my channel has begun growing rapidly, due to new gaming content. It\u0027s a thrill that so many people are into it! I\u0027ve spent the last few years supporting creators that made the content I wanted to see, and now I get to make content for others. It\u0027s a wonderful world.\u00a0There\u0027s no substitute for putting smiles on people\u0027s faces and entertaining and educating minds. YouTube allows me a venue where I can have fun doing all of that every day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhy Start A Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nRecently, an increasing number of people have been asking me \"how can I support the channel,\" and up until now, all I\u0027ve been able to say is \"maybe turn off your ad-blocker when you watch my videos.\" The thing is though... I hated that response then, and I hate it now. Nobody likes ads. It\u0027s a reality of this interface and this \u0027free video for you\u0027 platform that allows creators like myself to operate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo this campaign here is meant as a way to provide a support venue for those people who are interested in supporting me in making more content online, while at the same time, turning ON their adblockers if they want to, so they don\u0027t get annoyed by the ads my channel simply must have in order to operate (and allow me to keep producing). I hate ads as much as you, trust me. If I get enough supporters here... I\u0027ll turn them all off on YouTube, and everywhere else HotTips! as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eIMPORTANT:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMy videos will ALWAYS be free to view on YouTube when I create them for HotTips!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e You \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eNEVER\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e have to pledge to this Patreon to watch my videos, and I\u0027ll keep making them in the future if nobody pledges here at all. I love what I\u0027m doing, and I love it all being available to you, regardless of money. This is merely a way for those who want to show their support (above watching and liking content) to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eHow Will Patreon Help Me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nPatreon will help me in numerous ways, the most notable being, financial support for creating additional content for YouTube, as well as maintaining and improving my existing equipment and workflow. I\u0027m a full-time, self-employed business operator that works every day, and many times long into the night every night, handling projects for people all over the world. My real passion is video, and this network has allowed me to grab hold of something I find truly magical and fun. Ad revenue has been a subtle supplement for the time spent instead of working on other projects, and Patreon will allow me to supplement even more, releasing me from 16 hour days at my job, and allowing a few hours (or more maybe) to go into this awesome community here on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat that translates to... is more support = more videos, faster!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eHow Am I Rewarding Supporters?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nIn addition to the obvious thank you\u0027s and access to the Patron feed, I have a variety of rewards I\u0027ve come up with which I think illustrate the value your support has with me, as well as some unique rewards that few (or no) other YouTubers are doing. From traditional ones such as your name at the end of videos and shout-outs, to unique ones, such as access to exclusive live streams of the editing process of the videos, as well as two-way communication during that process, so you can even have conversations with me while I\u0027m working on the next episode, and see it all edited together in real time!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003ePopular Rewards For My Favorite People!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027m extremely active with Patrons, and any patron will confirm: I engage a LOT with my audience. I\u0027ve formed a Discord server that\u0027s heavily integrated into my content and community strategy, and I utilize Discord heavily for keeping in contact with great people like you. Every Patron, from Bronze to Ridiculous level, show off their support with colored flare on the server, as well as gain access to an exclusive VIP channel where insider information is constantly being shared, as well as EARLY VIDEO RELEASES! Patrons get to watch what I\u0027m about to publish, sometimes even as much as a whole day before it goes live. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out all the details on the side of this campaign page to learn what else I like to do for VIPs, and ask around on the Discord if you want to know what being a Patron might be like. The HotTips! Discord is a free place for all, but only VIPs get access to everything that experience has to offer:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/FcEVHKq\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/FcEVHKq\u003c/a\u003e"
