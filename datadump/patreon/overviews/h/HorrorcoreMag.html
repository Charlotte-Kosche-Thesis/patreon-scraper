    "summary": "Hello Future Patrons,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Kirk Chewning, Founder, Editor and Lead Designer for Horrorcore Magazine. Back in 2013 my\u00a0 good friend Dustin Coffman and I set out to create the best underground magazine the world has ever seen. In 2013 we kick started our success with the help of Lyrikal Snuff Productionz, better known in the Horrorcore/Underground scene as LSP! A very popular Musician by the Name of \"SCUM\" graciously accepted our offer to be the first front cover artist and with that we grained a great traction for our start. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the release we started a earthquake that rumbled the underground. Within as little as one month we seen our Facebook likes skyrocket overnight to 100, 500, 1000, 6000 and now up to 15,000+ and from there we only grow by the hundreds every day. Our second issue featured another group on the LSP Label known as \"Dark Half\". Again, we began to shake the ground and by our third issue we gained recognition by a Horrorcore Legend known as \"Mars of Mad Insanity\". Mars has paved the way for so many artist in the Genre and he came to us to Partner with his umbrella Company \"Red Planet Ent.\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We Graciously accepted the Offer and for the First Time in Horrorcore Magazine History we placed our first Nationally Known artist(s) on the cover known as Kung Fu Vampire \u0026amp; Mars! With assistance from Red Planet Ent. we successfully re-branded with a fresh new logo and a whole new outlook and vision. By the end of the 2013 year we were contacted by Psychopathic Records which in case you don\u0027t know is home of the Horrorcore Super Stars \"Insane Clown Posse\" and we featured our First Psychopathic Records artist on the cover \"Big Hoodoo\"!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After connecting with Mars, Insane Clown Posse, Scum and many more we earned our place in the ranks of Underground magazines as the #1 Underground Magazine for Horrorcore and Rap. If you follow our History we only get more impressive by adding our \"Best Of The Rest\" articles which features some of the most popular Metal and Rock bands around, and we are so glad we did. We are honored the be the last to interview the late \"Wayne Static\" from the band \"Static X\" which we created a Special Memorial Edition for. We have been contacted to work with Artists Like Twiztid, Rob Zombie, I Prevail, Disturbed, Crazy Town Mushroomhead and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Along our journey we have gained recognition throughout the Horror community as well having interviewed actors like Ari Leham which played Jason as a child from the popular Friday the 13th Franchise, as well as Alex Vincent who played \"Andy\" from the Popular Child\u0027s Play Franchise along with many more. As Horrorcore Magazine Grows, we want to expand our pages, lower production costs, Offer Free Issues and bring MORE HORROR(CORE)! As we have said from the beginning:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\"We are more than JUST a Magazine.....We are A Movement!\".\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With your help you can make Horrorcore Magazine Flourish and get HORRORCORE recognized by the world!
