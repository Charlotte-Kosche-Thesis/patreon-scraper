I have been running the blog for \u003cstrong\u003e7\u003c/strong\u003e years now. I would like to grow my site further, and provide you with even more content. Right now, the struggle is acquiring the ingredients necessary to do all of the experiments I have in mind. I\u0027d also like to feature other content that isn\u0027t strictly recipe logs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t know about Hive Mind Mead?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s okay, there\u0027s never a better time than now to get acquainted. Currently, Hive Mind Mead is ranked in the top 75 Homebrewing related sites / blogs on the internet (and there\u0027s a lot more than 100!). I\u0027ve written several articles for Homebrewtalk.com, including a very popular series on Lambic \u0026amp; Sour Mead Making. I have also been a guest on the Mead Makr Podcast to discuss bochet making and solera aging. I\u0027ve got the tenure, and it\u0027s time for Hive Mind Mead to explode. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStill Intrigued?

I\u0027d also like to increase the amount of content posted, which means more brewing among other things, and even hiring guest writers. (I have some new ideas for a variety of content).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Hive Mind Mead grows, I\u0027d also like to start having giveaways to my Patrons to thank them for their support. \u003cstrong\u003eIn fact it\u0027s my first goal!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the reasons above (and some other new surprises), I\u0027m asking for your help and support moving forward.
