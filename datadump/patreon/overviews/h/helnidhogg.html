    "summary": "Hi all, my name is Ina and I have been working on handmade jewellery projects since 2014. Last couple of years I had to take a very long break due to life being very busy, but I am back now and going to expand my (so far) humble collection. I love working with crystals, semi precious stones and wire wrapping so you would see lots of these here + some beading projects (the very first bracelet I created was beaded, I still have it around in case anyone is interested).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been interested in semi precious stones and find it fascinating how something so simple could be used to create elaborated jewellery projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always wanted to create some simple tutorials and \u0027behind the scenes\u0027 videos which would allow you to see how it\u0027s all happening, maybe helps you pick some beads and stones yourself. My long term plan would be also to talk about individual stones and designs. As you might know semi precious stones could have many special meanings and I would try to touch as much as possible on the subject, provide you with guidelines on how to use them and what stone would be appropriate for what occasion.\u003cbr\u003eI hope this Patreon would be education experience for all of us, we all could learn something new and explore new creative ideas."
