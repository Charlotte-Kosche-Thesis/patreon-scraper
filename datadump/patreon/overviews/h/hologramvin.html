    "summary": "I do everything under the sun. I write, I create, run an etsy shop, and most of all I just try to get by. I\u0027d love to pursue these things more full time, but it\u0027s difficult to motivate myself to do things that take energy like that when I know there isn\u0027t any way I can financially support myself doing it. Living as a young, trans, nonbinary individual isn\u0027t the easiest thing. I\u0027ve got a lot of projects I\u0027ve been drafting the past few months, but before I dedicate hours to them, I want to know it\u0027s not in vain. I\u0027m unemployed, and currently studying on my own time for my GED tests which I will be pursuing once I\u0027ve moved to Seattle with my lovely housemates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving that will probably make it a lot easier when it comes to job hunting and not having it isn\u0027t stopping me from trying right now (sure is hard though). That\u0027s where you come in. My lovely followers, friends, and supporters. I promise you I\u0027m happy and eager to reward you for supporting me like this and I certainly hope the rewards I offer you are sufficient. 1$ a month from 50 of you would be enough to help me meet my current monthly goal, which would really mean a lot. My intentions for this money are not for me to stop working how I do every month, but to increase my creative output, and have leftover funds each month I can start putting towards rent and my own extra needs. I know money isn\u0027t readily available for many, and that is completely alright, but even if you can\u0027t personally contribute, I hope that you consider sharing to those who might be able to, and that you enjoy whatever I\u0027m able to make from that support. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Vin"
