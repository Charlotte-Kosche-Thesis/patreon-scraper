    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Ben. I like to read and write and play and watch fantasy. I eat\nit up. I imagine that a lot of you are like that too, and that\u2019s why I was able\nto snag your attention. The intention here is to provide both serially\npublished and serially accessible fantasy short stories and flash fiction. I\nplan to typically write between 500 and 2000 words of lightly edited fantasy\nper sitting, my favorite of which I\u2019ll read out loud on Youtube at the end of\nthe week. The link will be posted in the Patron section. I\u0027ll start out promising 3 per week. Feel free to share one or two with your friends, if you think that\u0027ll get them here. Or ask me personally to send you a copy or two. Ask for \u00a0a story about something, suggest a prompt, whatever! Anything to get you to SIGN ON THE LINE WHICH IS DOTTED and subscribe. $1.50 is less than starving people spend on breakfast. You can afford it. Sign up!\u003cbr\u003e"
