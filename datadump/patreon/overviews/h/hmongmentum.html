    "summary": "Thanks to all of you who have joined the Hmongmentum. Our mission is simple: we exist to build momentum in the Hmong community by investing in young Hmong people. In the year of 2018, I seek to invest in young Hmong people in 3 concrete ways.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI will bring our annual Hmongmentum Convention (HCON) to Minnesota this year. HCON brings together passionate young speakers to share their story with others in order to spark action.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI will host monthly H-Talks (12 total) in and around Hmong populated cities. H-Talks are small, organic events that take place in your local library, university, or community center. They\u2019re free to the public and they cover a wide range of issues relevant to our young Hmong people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI will continue to produce episodes through my show Shareable Hmongments on a weekly basis to capture and share valuable Hmongments.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://hmongmentum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-can-you-help_.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuilding Hmongmentum consists of two very simple ingredients: people and action. We help young Hmong people take action on the projects, ideas, and causes that they\u2019re most passionate about. We help them turn their ideas into reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron means making a monthly contribution towards Hmongmentum. Raising funds this way allows us to impact our Hmong community in efficient, expedient ways. Above all, becoming a Patron allows us to produce content and host events that are completely FREE to the public!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of 2017, we launched our first ever Hmongmentum Convention, HCON. Through generous supporters like you, we raised close to $15,000 to make HCON a reality for young Hmong students and professionals around the country. But the Hmongmentum can\u2019t stop in 2017, we need to continue in 2018. So, are you ready to build Hmongmentum?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://hmongmentum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Copy-of-how-can-you-help_.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach our first goal of $3,000 a month, I will be able to quit my job and build Hmongmentum full-time. This is much lower than what my day job currently pays me, but I\u0027m more than willing to take the pay cut in order to invest in young Hmong people full-time. I\u0027m married to my wife Amy who is a full-time student. The $3,000 will allow us to cover our basic needs: rent, food, and transportation. This amount will allow me to quit my day job and to focus on creating more valuable content for the Hmong community, plan local H-Talks on a monthly basis, and to bring HCON 2018 to Minnesota.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach our second goal of $4,000 a month, I will be able to use that additional $1,000 to invest in new recording equipment and software. I will also be able to provide FREE food and refreshments at out monthly H-Talks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach our third goal of $6,000 a month, I will be able to use that additional $2,000 to invest directly into HCON 2018. My goal is to make HCON 2018 a FREE event to the public in Minnesota.\u003cbr\u003e"
