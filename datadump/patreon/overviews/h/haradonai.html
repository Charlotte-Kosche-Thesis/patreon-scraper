    "summary": "Beauty and truth. I need them both in my life. I crave them, long for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a follower of God\u2019s word, the truth part comes naturally. It\u2019s all around me. It\u2019s the beauty part that\u2019s hard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor years, I found beauty in the counter-culture that surrounds indie rock music and skateboarding. I\u2019ve spent decades writing, recording, and performing music. I put out albums, played in rock clubs and festivals, and went on tours. I even developed a small skateboard brand.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd if anyone ever asked me what my favorite song was, I could tell them right away: \u201cFreak Scene\u201d by Dinosaur Jr. It was a late-80s anthem, with a cynical tone and melodic force that meant the world to me \u2013 until it didn\u2019t.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, to me, it\u2019s beautiful. But it\u2019s not true. At a key point in the song, J. Mascis whines out the words:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Sometimes I don\u2019t thrill you, sometimes I think I\u2019ll kill you, just don\u2019t let me [expletive] up will you, \u2018cause when I need a friend it\u2019s still you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOver time, like the princess and the pea, that line just bothered me. Why did it bother me? Because I no longer wanted to live in a world where love was defined in that way. Where we hurt ourselves and each other, and then we expect everything to be cool. I\u2019ve spent enough days like that \u2013 I\u2019m done with it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Freak Scene\" is an example of beauty without truth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, John Mark McMillan released a full-length album titled \u201cMercury \u0026amp; Lightning\u201d. In the closing song, \u201cNothing Stand Between Us\u201d, he sings out the words:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cYou always find me, in between the thunder and the lightning.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(The \u201cYou\u201d in that sentence is God.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be found by God, even in the worst circumstances in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat line is an example of beauty with truth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve sought to communicate both beauty and truth in my music. The problem is, I need an environment that honors such a thing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo I moved my music from the rock clubs to the worship room. Every week, I play for one hour in a worship center in Jerusalem, Israel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy heart is for this time to become a fully-realized corporate worship experience. This means not just me and an acoustic guitar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy music project is called Har Adonai. It\u2019s a reference to both Mount Zion (which stands across the valley from my home) and the concept of holiness. And although I write and play the songs myself, they are intended for a 6-piece band.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon will help me reach a fully-realized corporate worship expression.\u003cbr\u003e"
