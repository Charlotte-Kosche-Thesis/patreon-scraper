They accomplish this in\nmany ways: by telling stories, by teaching new\nskills, and by helping us explore spirituality and magic. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to be more than a\ngroup of people selling books. We want to share many worlds and many\nvoices with our readers--voices which have been neglected by\ntraditional publishing for far too long. And we want to facilitate a\nvirtual community where readers, writers, and staff members can\ninteract, share inspiration, and support each other. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why our doors are\nopen to you, the reader and writer, from the very beginning, before\nwe ever release an ebook or launch our website.
