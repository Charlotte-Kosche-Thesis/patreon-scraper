This Patreon will essentially combine the two worlds. So for those of you that don\u0027t know, \u00a0I am Hannah Maria and I have been traveling this crazy country in my Winnabego, affectionately named, Winnie the Road Unicorn. Along with my rowdy pup, Aja the Vicious Thug Jesus Maria, \u00a0I create beautiful and unique illustrations, paintings and graphic design for people across the country. \u00a0With your help I will be able to keep doing this and bring fun and pretty things to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat is Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003ePatreon is the new modern way for you to become a patron of the arts. Think back to your art history classes, of those well to do masses demanding their portraits be painted by Da Vinci and Rapheal\u2026 Are you imagining yourself wearing a fantastic wig? Good I\u2019m proud.  Patreon has created a community where not only can the patrons (you) fund a creator\u0027s(me) endeavors, but they also reap the benefits. \u00a0Every patron has a choice in the amount they would like to fund on a monthly basis, and based on what tier you choose, you receive my pretty things, blog posts, random thoughts and general Hannah Maria\u0027ness magic from me. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat can you expect from my Patreon Page\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePure awesomeness... am I selling it too much?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular blog posts following my travels in Winnie the Road Unicorn\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Current projects, and exclusive images of the thoughts and ideas for future projects.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs we go along I\u2019d like to create more incentives based on what you guys, the patrons love and like, if that means me visiting specific places, creating a new art piece, sharing photos of the elusive Pig Cow Shark (if you become a patron you will know what this is) and her history as the cuddle monster.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will be called a unicorn (have you noticed a theme?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Patreon Page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have been contemplating and circling around this idea for so long, and decided to finally just do it. The past few years have taught me one thing, I am just not a planner. I could spend days, weeks, months trying to organize this perfectly and I would never finish. Everything that has been positive and worthwhile for me has been a head first dive into the unknown. Yes, completely reckless and not exactly smart, but you don\u2019t have to follow my ways, you just get the benefits of following me and my chaos.\u003cbr\u003e"
