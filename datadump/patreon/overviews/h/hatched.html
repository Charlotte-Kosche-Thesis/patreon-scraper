    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eHatched\u003c/em\u003e is a puzzle magazine focusing on new and emerging constructors. Nathan Curtis, the founding editor of \u003cem\u003eHatched\u003c/em\u003e, got his start in puzzle construction by writing a puzzle a day for a month and posting them for free to his website. As he continued to post new puzzles \u2013 at a more sustainable rate \u2013 some solvers offered their feedback, allowing Nathan to grow as a constructor. While this could be taken as a heartwarming tale of the power of the internet, it was also a slow process, and it took three or four years before Nathan could submit puzzles to professional publications, and ultimately start posting his own puzzles on Patreon. We at Hatched want to speed up the process for new constructors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does this mean? This means taking puzzle submissions from constructors of all stripes, but especially newer constructors. All constructors will receive the benefit of editorial feedback on their submissions, and many will get to see their work published for the first time. And everyone who helps along the way, from the contributing constructors to the editors, testsolvers, and graphic designers, will be fairly paid for their contributions. \u003cem\u003eHatched\u003c/em\u003e isn\u0027t the first publication to do this, but we believe we can take advantage of internet distribution and the crowd-funding model of Patreon to make this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things Patreon lets us do here at \u003cem\u003eHatched\u003c/em\u003e is start small. When we reach our first funding goal of $250 in pledges per issue, we will start by publishing one or two variety puzzles per issue, once every month or two. As we meet higher funding goals, we will publish more and more puzzles in each issue, with the end goal of publishing a puzzle hunt (five to eight puzzles plus a metapuzzle) and a dozen or more variety puzzles in each issue, every two to three months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHatched\u003c/em\u003e is accepting submissions from all constructors.
