(Note: by listening to this podcast while driving, you assume all liability for fatigue-related crashes).\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur completely dour and scholarly podcast comes out with at least one new episode of 30-45 grueling minutes each week. What we lack in entertainment value we make up for with our morose professionalism and sophisticated restraint.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn each episode, in our flattest single-note attorney voices (imagine Ben Stein in \u003cem\u003eFerris Bueller\u0027s Day Off\u003c/em\u003e, except monotone), we talk about a completely zany and off-the-wall employment case, but strip it of any vestige of whimsy, leaving only a dry recitation of lifeless facts. We tackle pressing issues or current events like we\u0027re reading the phone book, subject you to guests whose inane patter will make you want to stab yourself in the eardrums, and finish each episode with true but totally insipid workplace stories sent in by our unfunny listeners.\u00a0 You can always rest assured there will be no swearing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eHostile Work Environment\u003c/strong\u003e is the ideal podcast for depressives, masochists, self-mutilators, human resources professionals, or anyone fascinated by the modern workplace.\u00a0 If you like TV shows like \"The Office,\" \"Archer\" or the movie \"Office Space,\" you should probably listen to something more your style, like the\u00a0\u003cem\u003ePrairie\u00a0Home Companion\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 But\u00a0if our brand of sober \"edutainment\" sounds intriguing (and why wouldn\u0027t it?), give us a listen.\u00a0 Any support you give will help us cover our meager expenses and keep this podcast running.  Thank you for checking us out!  And thank you even more for your support!"
