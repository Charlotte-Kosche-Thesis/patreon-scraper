     "about": "I was born in Delaware in North Wilmington. I spent a lot of time outside, as well as a lot of time at the Delaware Nature Education Society.  My family moved to Pennsylvania to Chester County where I went to High School.  I moved to New Hampshire to go to Plymouth State where I earned a  BS in Marketing while working Full time at a Deli then on lifts.  I moved back in with my family in Pennsylvania, and worked for several Marketing Companies.  I took a position as a Retail Convenience store Stocking shelves, and moved up to Store Manage.  I moved to Delaware near Elsmere, and purchased a house.  I began Home Brewing, which I still do occasionally.  I became married to a wonderful woman who is also my best friend.  We had our first Child, Nych.  I changed positions to Merchandiser at a pet food retailer.  We had our second child, Anja.  We then moved to Pennsylvania to Chester County to be closer to family.  I landed a dream job of Brewer at a brew pub.  It was short lived position, so I transitioned to District Manager for a Stationary supply chain.  I started online at Argosy University where I earned an MBA.  I changed laterally to District Manager of Halloween stores.  Now I work for a Nationwide Marketing and Sales company that I started as a Part Time Representative to where I am a Customer Manager.  We currently live in central Virginia were we have been raising rabbits for about 3.5 years, and chickens for 4.5 years.  We have 7 cats, and 2 dogs.\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to contact me for any reason, reach out at Hareoftherabbit@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003eJeff Hittinger.",
