     "about": "Hannaka is an impetuous artist. One who is found in ever-changing and evolving forms, who never was quite able to separate philosophical thought or the practice of living from the practice of art-making. This all encompassing artist who just recently finished her Bachelor of Music in vocal Jazz has, also, in the last year assailed many musical and artistic feats. She is a singer/songwriter, composer, sound-artist, poet, graphic designer, installation and performance artist, curator and painter. Deftly employing a servitude to art that infects feeling into her audiences. She transmutes the means of that communication into whatever form is most poignant, with its most insistent voice, be it in music, visual arts or movement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year Hannaka released 2 EP\u2019s, one as a folk-singer entitled \u2018The Colour of War.\u2019 The other, a collaboration for her experimental vocal project, The Feather Collector, titled \u2018Ereshkigal.\u2019 She curated the music and writing programs for 2high Festival, toured her folk EP, curated a monthly event called Smorgasbord and turned bedrooms into lakes and forests that posed as a platform for her sound installation work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHannaka has a unique passion and courage to explore realms through her work that are the \u2018silenced\u2019 discourses of our existence, drawing on themes of wildness, madness, transcendence, awe, loss and unbridled sorrow and feeling. She has an inquiry that is unrelenting and a fragility that combines talent with unbridled vulnerability.",
