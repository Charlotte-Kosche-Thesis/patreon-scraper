    "summary": "Who Am I\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Aamuro.  I\u2019m 16 years old and I\u2019m a filmmaker.  In 2010 my friend Sophia and I were bored, so we decided to make a science fiction movie with my dad\u2019s camera using ice from our freezer.  We named the movie \u201cICE\u201d and edited it with software on an older Mac.  When the movie was finished, we showed it to our 4th grade class and it was a big hit.  A few weeks later we made another ICE film, and then another. \u003cbr\u003eThat ignited my passion.  Sophia and I have since taken different paths, and now I\u2019ve been making movies on a regular basis.  Early on, my friend Max and I made an action movie \u201cdriving\u201d cars in our garage and providing sound effects with our voices.  One day Max gave me a shirt with a smiley face character on the front, and that is how HappyMovies was born!  From that point I started following my dream of movie making.\u00a0Recently I have been incorporating better editing software and equipment for a more professional result. In March of 2015 my film was selected and shown at a local film fest. I took home the Most Likely to Go Viral prize which wouldn\u0027t have happened if it wasn\u0027t for my supporters. But, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY Goals\u003cbr\u003eHappyMovies has been making movies on little-to-no budget using my parents\u2019 money and old equipment. I now want to take our movies to the next level.  With your support I will be able to make higher quality movies using better props and editing software to create awesome visual effects. I will also be able to delve deeper into the world of film, no really, like literal film. I have been working on creating unique experimental movies using 35mm film with various cameras. Also, raising money with Patreon will teach me about the world of crowdfunding.  Your donations will help me learn both the craft of filmmaking and the tools for running my own business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat You Get\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I will release a new video near the end of each month.  Then, depending on how much you donate, you can receive exclusive HappyMovies merchandise (limited quantities) and even online Q\u0026amp;A sessions!"
