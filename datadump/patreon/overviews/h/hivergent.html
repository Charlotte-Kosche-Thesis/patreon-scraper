    "summary": "I am a writer, developer and solution architect working in\nthe Cryptocurrency industry. Over the last two years, I have written over 1,000 blogs, posts and answers related to\nthis field, which have been viewed over 5 million times. I am a\nstrong believer in the potential of blockchain technology, a staunch advocate against scams\nand bad actors, and the biggest supporter of new people entering the industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn September of 2017, I left my position as a data solution\narchitect to work in this industry full time. Unlike many of my peers, who are\nnow working as traders, hedge fund managers, or decentralized entrepreneurs, I chose another path. I have an intense need to understand how this new emerging industry\nworks and how people like you can make an impact. This naturally led me to creating written content, videos and other materials to help people connect with this industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI decided to start this page to get closer to many of the\npeople who are now following my content around the web. I want to understand your\nbackgrounds, goals, gifts, and beliefs to help you find a place in this new\nemerging field. One way I can do this is give my time here and make as much of\nan impact as I can. I am here to make you stronger and will do everything in my\npower to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy subscribing to this page, you\u2019ll receive exclusive steaming\nvideo content about specific blockchains, frameworks and insights into this\nfast-moving field. Patrons will also have the chance to get exclusive access to\nask questions about their own unique circumstances through monthly Q+As and a\nPatreon only email address. As I experiment with new mediums, including books,\npodcasts, speaking or events, this will be the first place I will announce\nthose initiatives. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you to everyone who has support my work through your\nwarm support on Quora, Medium, Twitter and my website at Hivergent.com\u003c/strong\u003e. My work\non these social sites will remain unchanged. I look forward to building this\nindustry with you.\u003cbr\u003e"
