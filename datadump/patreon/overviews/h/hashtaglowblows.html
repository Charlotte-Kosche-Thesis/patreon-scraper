    "summary": "In 2012, former Irish pro-wrestler Rick Nash ran a party in Captain America\u0027s in Grafton Street, to celebrate the comeback of his favourite childhood wrestler, The Rock, at WWE WrestleMania 28. It was supposed to be a one-off, but it ended up sparking a movement, as for the first time ever adult wrestling fans had a community where they could come together and enjoy wrestling as a group. Two years later, the Low Blows podcast was born, a show that went against the grain in criticising WWE and tried to have a laugh with and at the world of wrestling, celebrating fandom for this stupid hobby we had never grown out of!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLow Blows has become a way to enjoy your favourite hobbies. A distraction from when the real world gets shitty, with tongue firmly in cheek, we discuss, analyse and have a laugh at the world of wrestling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Low Blows Network will be an extension of that. We will kick off with both the returning Low Blows flagship podcast and another wrestling show, in addition to non-wrestling content that looks at other aspects of the world in the same \u0027Low Blows\u0027 way we look at wrestling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we also make sure not to forget the community aspect of all of that, as with a subscription you get access to a plethora of Low Blows nights, all for free. Live, late bar nights for the WrestleMania, Royal Rumble and SummerSlam, plus our new non-spoiler Mondays for every other big WWE pay-per view, and now even nights for major NJPW and indie wrestling shows! In addition to that, a subscription gets you exclusive access to quiz nights and live podcast recordings, in addition to exclusive first access to table bookings for bigger nights and drink deals for subscribers-only!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support of Low Blows to this point and we will forever thank you for your continued support. We always say that if you invest in us, we\u0027ll invest right back in you. So keep subscribing, coming to the nights and spreading the word and we\u0027ll keep working all day to improve your experience as a fan!"
