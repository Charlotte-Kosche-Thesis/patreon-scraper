    "summary": "Hi there! Thank you so much for making your way to our Patreon page. We are Jerome \u0026amp; Raissa, new parents to our little Talitha Ruth. We both love to write about our life experiences, share husband \u0026amp; wife stories, do a lot of DIY arts and crafts and make awesome wallpapers of our little girl and inspiring Bible verses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we try to share parenting experiences and at the same time, help inspire other parents, couples or individuals with our stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some really big plans for the future and we are asking you to be a part of our journey. With your help and support, we can invest more time in creating content, designing more wallpapers, create other rewards like specialty prints for our patrons and we might even be able to start working on our second Kids Yoga book as well (Raissa already has the story in her head).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us pursue our passion to help reach and inspire more individuals.\u00a0Your support means the world to us! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout us:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaissa is a practicing pediatrician and part-time teacher, I am a full-time fitness instructor and part-time web developer. Both of us are hands-on parents as well. In between, we try to work on our passion, which is writing about anything under the sun and trying to share our stories to anyone. As you all know, writing takes a long time. Sometimes a single blog post can take from a few hours to several days to complete, that does not include taking nice and appropriate photos as well as formatting the post so it will look nice. This is the time we don\u0027t currently have a lot of. In order for us to write more stories, we\u0027ll need to have a site that can be self-sustaining in the long run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow your support can help us:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to sustain our passion, we were initially thinking on running ads on our website. But like us, we like to read without any distractions. Ads can be distracting and hurt the reader\u0027s experience. We think that\u00a0donations are a better way to sustain our love for creating content without bombarding our readers with ads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a reader can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. Anything, from $1/month up, will greatly help us in getting more content into our site.\u00a0We are so fortunate to have readers like you--people who are willing to help motivate us and be a part of who we are and what we do. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you in advance!\u003cbr\u003e"
