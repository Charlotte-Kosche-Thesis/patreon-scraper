My name is Madison and I\u0027m the \n\u003cstrong\u003ecreative director and lead pattern maker for CUT/SEW. \u003c/strong\u003eCUT/SEW started as the craziest of ideas that came about while I was working at a costume shop as a pattern maker, where a co-worker with years of super amazing experience all across the globe off-handedly said to me \u003cstrong\u003e\"I\u0027ve never understood the sewing instructions for commercial patterns. I\u0027ve never met anyone in this field who has.\" \u003c/strong\u003eThat experience of feeling like the sewing patterns out there were too confusing, too poorly fitting, too complicated reminded me so much of when I was learning how to sew and all of the times I would buy a pattern and throw the instructions out almost immediately because I couldn\u0027t make heads or tails of them. \u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t let anyone tell you commercial patterns are a piece of cake - even some pros can\u0027t figure them out.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/r78a2w.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI thought that the world needed sewing patterns made for contemporary creators, not just grandmas and stay-at-home moms (although both of those are amazing makers, too!). I wanted to see people inspired to try cosplay, or excited to dress up in a style of dress that isn\u0027t local to their region, and I wanted to see sewing elevated beyond a crafty, kitschy thing that gets scoffed at and into an art-form of frantic beauty that literally anyone could try. I quit my job at that costume shop and started working full-time on CUT/SEW with the help of a few friends and the hope that other people would respond to this idea in the way that I did. We plowed ahead and managed to launch CUT/SEW after an IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign that raised only 1/4 of its needed goal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/n6lif.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis company is my passion, my dream. This crazy idea is what keeps me going even on the worst of days, and it\u0027s not cheap. CUT/SEW is a small business built by artists and it\u0027s funded by pinched pennies and missed meals, not investors with deep pockets. To keep it going we need your support, even if it\u0027s just a dollar or two a month, because without the continued support of the people who want CUT/SEW the most, we can\u0027t sustain it forever.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where our Patreon comes in. Your monthly support on Patreon means we can keep producing all the patterns that you want to see.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI know that everyone has different financial needs and not everyone can support us directly by buying patterns regularly, so we\u2019re offering some super cool perks for people who are excited about CUT/SEW but aren\u2019t able to make a bigger financial commitment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/11vnmna.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor as little as \n\u003cstrong\u003e$1 a month\u003c/strong\u003e, we\u0027re offering\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eup-to-the-minute news on where we\u0027re headed next, and mood boards that show our inspirations and influences for every pattern we make.

Our mission is to elevate sewing at home from the crafty-kitschy stuff of fabric store nightmares to a thing of frantic, creative beauty; we believe that anyone making stuff, whether it\u0027s clothes or cosplay, is making something amazing and our goal is to help you on your own unique creative journey in a way that supports your unique skills, body type, and needs.",
