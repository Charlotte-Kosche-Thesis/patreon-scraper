    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eOnce word got out that I\u2019d left Christianity and become the first humanist chaplain at USC, I started hearing from lots of folks looking for advice about making the most of life on the other side of supernaturalism. I quickly realized I couldn\u2019t carefully correspond with each and every one, which is why I launched this podcast in 2015, and why almost every episode since has had something to do with building loving relationships, making things better for others, and cultivating a genuine sense of wonder and gratitude for the privilege of human consciousness. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt took me a while to find the rhythm, but now we enjoy a steady stream of fascinating conversations with artists, scientists, philosophers, journalists, social entrepreneurs and community builders, all of whom have shed some light on this risky business of embracing and enjoying our own finitude. Much as I love it, however, producing Humanize Me and nurturing its audience requires a lot of time and energy, not to mention a fair bit of money. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, since this is our Patreon page, let\u0027s mention that fair bit of money, and agree that your willingness to pitch in is a very big deal, both to me personally and to the rest of the Humanize Me community.  By supporting the show you are helping us grow and enabling us to pump hope into a world that desperately needs it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m tremendously grateful to have friends like you, who value what I do.  Thank you, thank you, and thank you again. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
