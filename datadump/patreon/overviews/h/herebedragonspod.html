It\u0027s a story told in the style of classic radio plays (like War of the Worlds, or the original Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy), through modern means (like iTunes, SoundCloud and Youtube).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the show about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a story about women. Or we could call it a story of adventure, of friendship,\u00a0and mystery... And true, it\u0027s a little about heartbreak, and home, and loyalty, and danger, and finding something new, and waking up in the morning not knowing if the roof is going to fall in on you. And of course, there\u0027s the Bermuda Triangle and lots and lots and LOTS of sea monsters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the official synopsis from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://herebedragonsradio.com\"\u003eherebedragonsradio.com\u003c/a\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhen the body of a previously unknown aquatic creature washes up on shore, four women are called together for the expedition of a lifetime. Tasked by the U.S. Government to find and record evidence of this new breed of sea monster, Harper Bennett, Pippa Cambell, Lt. Commander Adrienne Scarlett and Dr. Natalya Atlas set off into the untamed wilds of The Bermuda Triangle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut when technologies fail, monsters abound, and new friendships are pushed to their limits, these ladies find that they just might be in over their heads.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does my contribution matter?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause we wouldn\u0027t be here without you. We created \u003cem\u003eHere Be Dragons\u003c/em\u003e because we love telling and sharing stories, and this was a story we loved and needed to tell. And every single step of the way has been a labor of love, and a huge group effort; Jordan writes it, Cristina shapes it, and Ellie puts it out into the world so that somebody somewhere can find it. And you did. So it\u0027s obviously been worth it. But it\u0027s a time consuming, whole-heart-giving, expensive effort. And we need your help to keep it afloat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo THANK YOU. We\u0027re here for you, and because of you. Every patron helps us take another step forward, and every step we take forward the more we can give back. Every penny goes straight to building more of this show, so every penny counts! And the more pennies you give us, the cooler the bonuses we give you! Thank you for your love. For your support. For absolutely everything. To every listener, supporter and patron out there: Thank you! And welcome to our crew!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eJordan, Cristina \u0026amp; Ellie"

     "description": "At this point, it\u0027s become clear you like us more than the average listener. And for that, we\u0027ve got to do something extra special. We\u0027re gonna make an episode just for you. Seriously. You can send us a prompt, or a character you\u0027d like to have featured, and we will write, record, and send you an exclusive Here Be Dragons episode. Just for you. (Again, some content restrictions apply, and we reserve the right to decline certain requests/materials.) You also get access to all previous awards, a HUGE shout out after every episode in the season, and we\u0027ll put you on our website as a Hall of Fame supporter.",
