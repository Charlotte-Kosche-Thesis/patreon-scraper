    "summary": "Hi everyone! For those of you who don\u0027t know me my name is Jake. Some people call me Huntychan. I\u0027m sorta indifferent to that ^_^ I\u0027m 22 and live in Brooklyn, basically in a bomb shelter basement. But I don\u0027t really think it\u0027ll save me from any bombs because its really flimsy. Anyway that isn\u0027t the point of this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been using the internet since Summer of 2003 when I first joined Neopets and I\u0027ve been talking to people online since I tricked my parents into signing the parental permission form (for Neopets) in late 2004. Being on the internet is a really big part of my identity. I\u0027ve jumped from website to website throughout my entire life (formerly Tumblr and now Twitter having the most impact), and I can\u0027t imagine how my life would be otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating content in any form... whether its on Twitter, Twitch, Instagram, Youtube, periscoping, anything. Its honestly what makes me happy! Its also why I wake up since I don\u0027t have a job right now. In turn that makes it difficult to support myself since I\u0027m not in school either and don\u0027t have any financial support from my family. I\u0027m really on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I get my PC (which is coming in May) I intend to stream games on Twitch or just talk and interact on Youtube/Periscope at least once every day. I\u0027ll also continue to tweet every day and will continue consistently updating everything that most of you follow me for. (including posts on Patreon)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you pledge $1 I am so so grateful. Thank you for helping me have the opportunity to do the work that makes me happy. This is the start of a journey for me and I plan to branch into more ventures outside of the internet later down the road as well. I really want to entertain and work hard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you and thank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJake"
