    "summary": "Hello, my name is Isaac Meyer, and I\u2019m a PhD student in\nHistory at the University of Washington in Seattle. I\u2019m also the showrunner for\nthe History of Japan podcast, weekly show that runs, on average, about 20-30\nminutes per episode. We cover a huge variety of topics, from the power politics\nof the ancient Imperial Court to the legacy and impact of Japan\u2019s video game\nindustry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Did I Start the Podcast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst, I think Japanese history specifically is extremely\nimportant and hugely under-served by what\u2019s out there in English. Japan is one\nof the most important states in the modern world; it\u2019s hugely wealthy, hugely\ninfluential, and its relationship with China and the United States is likely to\nbe one of the driving forces of the 21st century. That\u2019s not even\ntouching on its cultural influence in things like the manga industry or anime.\nFor all that, however, there\u2019s not a lot of great material available to the\ngeneral public on Japan or Japanese history; most of what\u2019s out there is either\nvery general or relies on the reader having some degree of prior knowledge. My\nhope is to make Japan\u2019s history accessible to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSecond, history as an academic discipline in general serves\nthe majority of interested amateurs out there \u003cem\u003every \u003c/em\u003epoorly. Most academic history \u2013 though certainly not all of it\n\u2013 is written in such a way as to make it either very boring or just too\njargon-laden to be comprehensible for anyone who doesn\u2019t have years of training\nsifting through this kind of stuff. I firmly believe that history is both\ninteresting and worthwhile for everyone to know, and the podcast is one of the\nways I want to prove that. I try to make every show interesting, and I try to\nalso make it clear for each topic why this is worth knowing, and what value it\nhas for us as citizens of the modern world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support the show?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, hopefully because you like it! I strive to make the\nshow both educational and entertaining for everyone who listens to it, and if\nyou enjoy it please do consider donating. While I try to keep costs related to\nthe show to a minimum they do exist \u2013 in terms of hosting fees, book purchases\nor rentals, and simple man-hours \u2013 and your help defraying those costs would\nmean a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBeyond that, you\u2019ll also be helping to support the idea that\nhistory is for everyone, not just those with the training to decipher it. I\nfirmly believe that history belongs to us all, and that historians have a\npublic duty to share their knowledge with the world in a format that is accessible\nto the general public. This is history presented without jargon and without the\nassumption that listeners need to have years of expensive education before they\ncan be introduced to tough subjects \u2013 all you need is interest and a\nwillingness to learn. If you agree, I hope you\u2019ll consider supporting the show.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support will also help me get through my graduate\neducation. As some of you already know, graduate education in general and the\nliberal arts in particular are hugely underfunded in the United States; in\npart, this is our own fault for making our subjects so opaque that no one\noutside the academy can see their value, but it\u2019s also part of a massive shift\nin the way we fund and think about education in the United States. It\u2019s my hope\nthat as a historian I can use my degree and my training to help people see the\nvalue in history and why it\u2019s so important to keep our discipline alive. I\ndon\u2019t receive any assistance for the show from my university, financial or\notherwise; this whole project is supported by my own time and funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are three reasons I chose Patreon over other potential donation options (for example, PayPal). First, Patreon\u0027s got a nice, clean, and easy to use interface, making it easier on users (at least in my opinion). Second, Patreon allows for recurring donations -- you can pledge a certain amount per show, making it better for long-form projects like a podcast. Third, Patreon does better by creators like me; I see more of the money than I would through PayPal. In addition, PayPal has some very restrictive policies that make it easy for them to freeze your account and deny you funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for reading, and for all your support. The reaction\nto the podcast over the last year and a half has been absolutely incredible and\nfar beyond anything I ever expected; the tremendous outpouring of interest and\nenthusiasm that has come my way has meant so much, and I can\u2019t really say\nenough how much I appreciate it. So, thanks very much to each and every one of\nyou for listening, and I\u2019m excited to learn with you where the show will go\nfrom here!\u003cbr\u003e"
