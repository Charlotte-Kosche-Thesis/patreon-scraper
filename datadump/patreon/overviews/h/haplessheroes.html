We are, as you may already know, an actual-play D\u0026amp;D 5th edition podcast set in the fictional world of Telduria. We have been playing as a group since the summer of 2016 and we were having so much fun in our game that we decided to turn it into a podcast and share it with you, the people of the internet. We do this all for fun and love that we can take our sessions and broadcast them for anyone to hear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, the costs of producing, hosting, and managing a podcast are nothing to sneeze at. Our hosting costs alone are the single biggest expense but we\u0027d also love to be able to greatly improve our audio quality by purchasing some additional microphones and recording gear as well as more powerful software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make sure we share our love and appreciation for our fans by coming up with some fun and unique rewards. Take a look and we greatly appreciate donations at absolutely any budget or level. Every penny we earn is going to go right back into making this show even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Hapless Heroes\u003cbr\u003e"
