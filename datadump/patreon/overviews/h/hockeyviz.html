    "summary": "I make visualizations that help people understand hockey at \u003ca href=\"http://hockeyviz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehockeyviz.com\u003c/a\u003e. My graphs, charts, and articles show what happened, suggest what will happen, and deepen our understanding of how we should think about hockey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eDescriptive Visualizations\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat happened?\u003c/h3\u003e\nHockey is a maelstrom of movement and almost every facet of it is a threefold-mixture of two extremely skilled teams and a great deal of happenstance and puck-luck. People have long sought to sift the signal of talent from the noise of randomness with statistics---describing just how unusual and how remarkable are the performances we watch every day. We understand the amazing by comparing it to the ordinary, and our visual intuition for making these comparisons is extremely strong---much stronger than our intuition for numbers in tables.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor instance, here\u0027s a graph showing where the Ottawa Senators took shots when Erik Karlsson, their\nstar defender, was on the ice:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hockeyviz.com/fixedImg/teamShotLocOffWi/1617/OTT/karlser90\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can quickly see the kind of impact he has: the big red patch of shots that he takes personally from his\nusual spot at the right point; the way the team gets great shots from right in front, the way the team avoids he high slot and instead attacks along the goal line.\nI make many kinds of descriptive graphics that help people understand what happened -- who did what, who was amazing, who hurt their team, who was a non-factor.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI make a raft of different descriptive visualizations, simple and complex, covering single games, seasons, teams, and whole years, published every day of the hockey season on my website, \u003ca\u003ehockeyviz.com\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003ePredictive Visualizations\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat happens next?\u003c/h3\u003e\nAt the same time, we want statistics to help us separate the lucky from the good, to understand whose fortunes are about to turn for the better. Prediction requires us to isolate which features of hockey arise from the skill of the players, which of these skills can be repeated in the future, and which of these matter for winning. I make predictive models which I use to simulate seasons and estimate the probabilities of making the playoffs, of meeting particular teams, or of getting a high draft pick. For instance, here is a graph showing Minnesota\u0027s likely first-round opponent from last year:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Uduu05R.png\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThey salvaged their season with a goalie trade and then maneuvered their way into a match-up with St Louis after seeming sure to meet Anaheim or Nashville. There are various outlets which produce predictions, but their methods are either shrouded in secrecy or known to be weak. I\u0027ve written extensively about my methods and I publish all the details of models for anybody to read or use for themselves. I make many predictive visualizations---for the Presidents\u0027 Trophy, for the lottery picks, for specific playoff match-ups, point projections for individual teams, and much else.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eExpository Writing\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow should we think about hockey?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn addition to making descriptive and predictive visualizations regularly, I also write accessible, scholarly articles delving into every aspect of hockey for which data is available. For instance, I schemed up a method\nfor calculating \n\u003ca href=\"http://hockey-graphs.com/2014/11/13/adjusted-possession-measures/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003escore-adjusted shots\u003c/a\u003e which has become widely used, as well as a method for doing \u003ca href=\"http://hockey-graphs.com/2014/11/25/schedule-adjustment-for-counting-stats/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003estrength-of-schedule adjustments\u003c/a\u003e for counting stats.\nSome of these articles are theoretical and technically sophisticated; others are simple and short.\nI illustrate all of these with custom visualizations and publish them free of charge for all who are interested in understanding hockey better.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
