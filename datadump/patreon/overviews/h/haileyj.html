I like art that is a bit weird and brings together contradicting emotions and themes.\u00a0 I try to highlight oddities and imperfection in my own way.\u00a0 I also enjoy shooting in public and on large structures, creating surrealist imagery, merging modeling with my visual art, and experimenting with different materials I find.  I try when I can to be my genuine, strange, angry, mellow, humbled-by-the-beautify-of-it-all, dark humored self, and that\u0027s the type of work you will mostly see here as I will be posting a lot of self portraiture and collaborations with close friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt Modeling and Me - Why do I do this?
