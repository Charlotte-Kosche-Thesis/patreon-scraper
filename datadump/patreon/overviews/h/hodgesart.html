I\u0027ve been a full time illustrator and comic artist for over 15 years. I have worked on various properties such as The Simpsons, Lord of the Rings, Transformers, and HALO just to name a few. But what I\u0027m really known for is my work in the Star Wars Universe. Ranging from Comic work on the Clone Wars web comics for starwars.com, in which I co-created (with Pablo Hidalgo) several characters for, to my Star Wars Celebration pieces, most notably the \"Star Wars Universe Dream Park\" Map from Star Wars Celebration V in Orlando (below, 2010).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://art.cafimg.com/images/Category_5997/subcat_102714/Hodges-C5_SWU_small.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve been around, done some things and I am currently working to build a comic universe of my own (along with my wife, Terri) with Antiis Comics.

This is where my Patreon Page comes in...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially, I am going to give folks an opportunity to purchase art on, for lack of a better term, \"layaway\".
