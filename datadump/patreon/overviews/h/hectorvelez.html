Patreon would provide me with resources that would be able to further my capabilities and free some time constraints for me, and maybe one day, even make my dream of art as a full-time job a reality! You\u0027d be totally in charge of fueling just how much art I can output, and get some cool stuff outta doin\u0027 it too!
