I focus primarily on space and sci-fi games like Star Citizen, Elite: Dangerous, and Space Engineers, but I have been known to dip into games all over the map, from Dark Souls to The Long Dark and everything in-between. I also play Horror games on Sunday with my lovely wife JR. I\u0027ve been streaming as a hobby for a little over a year, though I didn\u0027t start taking it truly seriously until March of 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhy start a Patreon now?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the amazing generosity of my viewers so far, I have been able to make a lot of improvements to the stream, and I cannot thank them enough. Unfortunately, it is hard to plan for the future when my budget is based on unpredictable gratuities from viewers while I am streaming. In 2016 I hope to start making strides in turning the stream into an honest to goodness job, and to do that, I need be able to plan accordingly. That\u0027s where the Patreon comes in! With a number I can see that will allow me to predict what I can spend towards the stream in a given month, I am able to make realistic plans and deliver on them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can we expect from you?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who have already been with the stream so far know that regardless of what happens with this Patreon, nothing will stop me from streaming. What your pledges will allow me to do is improve that content, as well start to produce new things! I have a lot of ideas, and here are some things I would like to start doing in 2016:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$200 Milestone - Equipment Budget / New Podcast!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA pre-recorded Podcast with my wife JR. Probably some kind of re-watch cast. Current front-runner ideas are the DC Animated Universe (Timmverse), the 2003 Battlestar Galactica remake, or the 90\u0027s action TV show \"Xena: Warrior Princess\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGeneral equipment improvements, so I can deliver the best quality video and audio possible.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$500 Milestone - Convention Budget / Pre-Recorded Video Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLet\u0027s Play style content for my YouTube channel.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConvention travel! I\u0027d love to meet more of you in person, and events like TwitchCon and the various PAX\u0027s would be a great way to do this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if we reach these goals, every Patron will get early access to things such as the  Podcast and the Let\u0027s Play content. Also, you\u0027ll receive exclusive viewing rights to a funny/cute picture or video involving my cats that I will post to the Patreon once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA note on... Catnip?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reward tiers all include a bonus of something called \u0027catnip,\u0027 and you\u0027re probably wondering \"what\u0027s up with that?\" Catnip is what I call the points you can accrue and spend in my Twitch.tv chat to bribe my bot, DJMeowMix. The DJ handles a few different things involving catnip, but the most important ones are Giveaways, and Song Requests, both of which require \u0027nip! While you can gain catnip just from watching, pledging for the reward tiers give you a bump of extra \u0027nip when points reset every month, including an extra percentage for being a Patron. Being a VIP Patron also allows you to queue up extra songs, depending on your reward tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSo how much should I pledge?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps, and there are no minimums! The reward tiers reflect the little special bonuses you will receive when watching the stream live, but  are just guidelines. Feel free to pledge any amount you feel the content I produce is worth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
