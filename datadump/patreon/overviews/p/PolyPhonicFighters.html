    "summary": "Welcome. \u00a0I am Andrew Strawder, an illustrator and comics artist living in Northern California. I have been a passionate creator of art since before I can remember. \u00a0I am working with 4 groups of musicians to create a fictional world and fictional band out of amazing collections of music. \u00a0The story and music will continue to unfold for month. \u00a0The group ECKY, Genghis Bob, Meyer and Teck, and 1200 cover genres as broad as Hip Hop, New Wave, Rock and Folk. \u00a0The world we all share is dystopian future where idiots control creativity and use it as a club to control and brainwash the people. \u00a0We will not let our creativity stifled and we will not let the people suffer suffer under the yoke of idiots, hacks and biters. \u00a0New music and new art will be released weekly. \u00a0Please help the revelation continue to grow and thrive by supporting the cause one time, monthly or per music drop or just enjoy your attention alone is priceless and appreciated. \u00a0Huzzah! Party on y\u0027all!\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 How Patreon works\u003c/strong\u003e.  Patreon is resource the lets fans become supporters of their favorite creators.  When you become a Patreon, you  agree to give a tip to an artist to help them keep making art.  You can choose a  set amount to donate per month, week or piece.  The different amounts you donate come with exclusive content and \u00a0rewards.  The comic will always be free. However, your support will help me keep creating without wearing myself out and eventually free me up to produce work more frequently.  Its as simple as clicking on a donation button. \u00a0You can help me bring my epic ( its literally hundreds and hundreds of pages) to life."
