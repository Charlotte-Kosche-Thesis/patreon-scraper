Thanks for stopping by my Patreon page! If you\u0027re already a Pow Music Patron - I appreciate you more than you know. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAs you might be aware, my free multi-media video lessons contain very detailed moving graphics and \u003cem\u003eeach one can take between 30-50 hours each to create.\u003c/em\u003e For this reason, my output is very limited since I can only dedicate some of my time to this endeavor. With your support, I will be able to transition to working on Pow Music content all week long and\u00a0eventually, full time.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron of mine at any level, you\u0027ll get exclusive rewards such as access to TABS, song notes, and .GPX files, for all of my lessons. You\u0027ll also get access to patron only updates, vlog posts, and giveaways.\u003cstrong\u003e If you pledge at a higher level, you an join me every week for live online video lessons where you can also join by video! Right now, this is barely being used, so it could just be 2 or 3 of us in the session.\u003c/strong\u003e  At the highest level, you will be able to choose topics or songs for my next lessons, have a 1 on 1 coaching or lesson video session, and help shape the future of Pow Music! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to help musicians like you to develop your craft, stay inspired, and share what you do with the world (which could just be your friends and family too). It is with that mission in mind that I began Pow Music at the start of 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from being a life-long musician and music lover, I\u0027ve spent the past seven years combined, serving as the National Training Manager and then the Director of Curriculum for the awesome music ed non-profit, Little Kids Rock, and teaching general music and modern band in NYC public schools. I\u0027ve had the privilege to teach and train thousands of children and adults all over the world on how to compose, improvise, and play the music they know and love. Pow Music is my medium for sharing all the things that I have learned, and that my guests have learned, with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCurrently, the focus here is on world class guitar, songwriting, and creativity lessons. It is also my goal to invite guest teachers and musicians into my videos, and to join me on the Pow Music Podcast (coming soon) where they can share their knowledge and personal experiences. The podcast topics will include the craft of music, discussions on creativity, education and how to create a lifestyle that enables you to do what you love and share it with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, as one of my most die-hard supporters, I can not wait to support YOU on a personal level, and to look to you for guidance on how to make my resources even better.\u003cbr\u003eI want to create as much value for you as possible so that, with your patronage, we can reach our goals together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappy playing,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGary\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

You can choose a solo, a song, a special technique or musical concept. This video will be made to the highest standard that I am able to make videos, complete with the animated fretboard, multi camera angles, pro audio, and TAB, and it will be posted on my Youtube channel with a shout out to YOU in the INTRO to the video. These videos take me anywhere between 20-50 hours to make, so I\u0027m reserving this extremely time-consuming reward for only this top tier level of support.
