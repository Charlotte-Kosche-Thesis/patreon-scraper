    "summary": "Hi,\u003cbr\u003eFirst, thank you for coming here.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Patrick Zircher, or Patch, and I make comics. Currently, I\u0027m drawing Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman in a comic called Trinity. And before that I worked on Action Comics, Suicide Squad, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Deadpool, and many others. I also contributed to the Eisner-winning anthology Love is Love. It\u0027s been an exciting career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? I love comics, all kinds of comics, and talking about the process of making them. That\u0027s something Patreon is wonderfully suited for. But more, I have, for years, wanted to create another kind of story as well. The story I promised my daughter when she was 12. A story of heart, humor, and fantastic adventure. The kind of story a fan of Harry Potter or Studio Ghibli might love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us to Mavan\u0027s Voyage. Mavan is an adventurer-in-the-making. And like classic adventurers she has a special destiny, amazing friends, and terrible enemies. She\u0027s a teenager living in a far future of vast deserts and sweeping oceans, where lost technology bears little difference from magic, where animals talk, and the earth holds many mysteries.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will be sharing Mavan\u0027s adventures in comic form, including production sketches, notes, doodles, and general thoughts on the project. I\u0027ll post the comic panels, well, whenever I can, with the panels collected as a full page from time to time-- so no patron misses anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, welcome to Mavan\u0027s Voyage. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy making it and sharing it with you."
