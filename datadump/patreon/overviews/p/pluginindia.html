I have been looking for a car for my wife and have been hunting for it for past few months. Did checked out different companies models and took test drive.\u003cbr\u003eThen came across your Plugin India initiative on the You Tube and saw many videos related to EV\u0027s. We walked into MAHINDRA showroom and took test drive for E20. \u003cbr\u003eMy wife and I are pretty impressed with the car and the awareness created by your team on the internet. We finally decided towards putting in our money towards a cleaner Environment and sustainability. \u003cbr\u003eYes we have booked E20 and tomorrow we will be getting the delivery of our car. Only thing now is that the top spec is out of production and we have to go with the T2 model which doesn\u0027t have the onscreen device and reverse camera. Still its worth buying something if we know we are contributing towards a greener future.\u003cbr\u003eHope my mail encourages you all to continue the good work. Slowly but steadily you are helping people make the right choice. Kudos to your team!!!\u003cbr\u003eGod bless you all.\u003cbr\u003eMohit \u0026amp; Ruma Tarachand\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
