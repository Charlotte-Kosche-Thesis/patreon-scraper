    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003ePEOPLE TAKE GLASGOW\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s 2037 and the sky is greyer than usual. The people of Glasgow are angry. Well, they\u0027re angrier than usual. The city has fractured, as has the society. After four more failed attempts at independence \u0026amp; with homelessness now effecting more than 50% of Glaswegians the people are ready to take back what\u0027s theirs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith tensions high the people\u0027s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, is forced into exile until it\u0027s safe enough to return. Until then the corrupt hospitality and human trafficking giant G2 are in charge and they want to turn your tenement into a quirky bar. A quirky bar, with lots of faux-plywood and brass filled with people who haven\u0027t read the quotes they\u0027ve put in frames on the walls. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eG2\u0027s vision for Glasgow is enforced by the Glasgow City Council. After years of being held back from making a difference the council members are frustrated and when the offer of becoming an elite city wide security operation was made they gladly agreed. Not realising they were now essentially stormtroopers, throwing families out of their homes and demolishing the makeshift shelters that inhabit every door way.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThey were right - People did make Glasgow - and now they\u0027re taking it back!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWits This All About Like?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to write, to illustrate and to produce a comic book world. Each issue will be made up of 4 chapters and each chapter will be made up of about 5 pages. Ideally I want to produce enough issues to tell all the stories of this world that I want to tell.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing: there\u0027s different kinds of ideas. There\u0027s ones that stay with you, there\u0027s ones that linger, there\u0027s ones that you struggle with but then there are ideas that grab you out of nowhere and just will not let go. People Take Glasgow is that for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe minute I thought of it and started seeing I couldn\u0027t stop. I walk down the streets of Glasgow and can feel the world I\u0027ve imagined imposing itself onto the streets I walk down everyday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to just tell you all a good story - I want to show you the process of constructing the world that that story belongs to. I want to research the history of Glasgow, the present and begin to create a dystopian future, that might even just make us think about what\u0027s happening right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI moved to Glasgow over 2 years ago to be with the woman I love. With battered boxes filled with my things, having never lived in a city before, I didn\u0027t expect to fall so thoroughly in love with grey skies and the people that make it what it is. The people I\u0027ve met at bus stops, the people I\u0027ve met on the last trains home and the people I\u0027ve met in the park on rainy day are why I love where I live, and why I\u0027ll probably never live anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working as freelance artist now for nearly 5 years. My work spans across street art, large scale environmental sculpture, small scale figurative sculpture, illustration, zine making, theatre production and set, prop \u0026amp; puppet fabrication. I use a lot of\u00a0discarded cardboard as my medium and have explored the city finding pieces to make things with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the thing that I love the most telling stories. I love making worlds, with maps and lineages and conflicts and territories. I love creating characters who are real and who are authentic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*All content and any characters portrayed will be entirely fictional and based purely on my own opinions and experiences."
