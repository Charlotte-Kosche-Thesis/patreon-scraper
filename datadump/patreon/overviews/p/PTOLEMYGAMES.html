    "summary": "Welcome to\nPtolemy Games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHi, my name\nis Ptolemy, I enjoy creating adult themed visual novel style games. Currently\nthere are two amazing games I am working on Dreaming of Dana and Intimate\nRelations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlot and Game\nPlay:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the first\ngame, Dreaming of Dana, you take the role of Chris a rich kid that has been\ngiven everything he could ever want in life on a silver platter.  Consequently, he has lived a life of\nindolence and indulgence. Chris has started to work for his dear old dad\u2019s\ncompany and not being the typical company man discovers that the family\nbusiness keeps getting in the way of his imprudent and carousing ways. After\nyou have had a quick introduction to the characters we give some options for\ndifferent directions for the story, so you may experience the ability to guide\nthe storyline.You can quickly raise the Affection and\nSexuality stats in increments through various unique interactions.  Each of these increments offers new\ninteractions and new scenes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/bs4c6S\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/n3MPmS/Pic_1.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/kdJgY7\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/cfuzLn/Pic_2.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  The second\ngame is Intimate Relations a story about a family that meets life\u2019s challenges\nin an unusual style.  Introducing\ncharacters like the Andrew, also Andrew\u2019s wife Christine and his daughter\nKelly. As the story begins, we find out Kelly and Christine has an adverse\nstep-mother and step-daughter relationship. Also, we learn that Kelly has been\nattending the university in town and Andrew wanting to give Kelly the full\ncollege experience arranged for a place of her own closer to the school. Kelly\nwanting to be close to her father she spends half her time at home with her dad\nand Christine. This is where your story begins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/jyFvt7\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/dZATD7/Pic_3.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/eLYtfn\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/doxKLn/Pic_4.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  To receive\nthe latest version of my games guaranteed to be unaltered and virus free, I\nwould ask you to support my games and become a patron.  Should you decide to become a patron, there\nare a few benefits to patronizing me. One is you get to vote on the direction\nof the storylines or the scenes in the games and the second to receive latest\nversion of the games when they are released. \nYour patronage will go towards things like purchasing more resources\nsuch as textures and models as well as upgrading my equipment.  This would help to get updates out faster and\nperhaps one day allowing me to quit my fulltime job and concentrate my time on\ncreating even more remarkable games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are many ways to distribute a game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd recently I\u0027ve created my own website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ptolemygames.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.ptolemygames.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is how in the future all my games will be exclusively distributed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for now, you can get all my games from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternatively, patrons can also get the game, from post on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLatest\nDreaming of Dana build for all patrons\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/15919826\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/dreaming-of-dana-17201391\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLatest\nintimate relations build for 5$ patrons\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/intimate-0-30-16132477\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/intimate-0-40-17827175\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLatest Alexandra build for 5$ patrons\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/alexandra-0-12-18427780\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat if you\ncannot patronize me at this time:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s OK.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor me, this\nis a labor of love and I will continue to create these games. I understand\nthat money isn\u0027t easy to come by these days, so a version of the games will\nalways be free.  The only request I have\nis if you download the free version of the game that you will share feedback\nhere or on the appropriate forums.  Any\ncomments or critique will help improve my games, by taking the time to share\nfeedback really helps in the creative process. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut if you\ncan afford to help please consider becoming a patron of mine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am super\ngrateful for any support.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPtolemy\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
