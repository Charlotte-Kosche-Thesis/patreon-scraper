    "summary": "Psy Reviews It is a video game reviews that doesn\u0027t mess about. Heck, the title should be a clue. No fancy name or bells or whistles - what matters to me is a high quality video that looks at the game as fairly as I can manage it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Psyniac and I have been a creator all of my life. My childhood memories are of drawing, writing and dreaming up grand concepts for video games. In my teen years I found a penchant for critical thinking, writing reviews of games and albums as well as appearing on community radio and various podcasts to analyse and debate various aspects of multimedia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn March 2015 I began a video game review show on a dime and found that it married so much of what I loved doing - writing, editing, voice over - that it quickly became something larger than I original expected. For two years straight I released a video every week reviewing a different game (from all kinds of eras and different formats) or giving my take on different subjects in Psy\u0027s Top 5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeason 3 of the show so far has been at a reduced capacity because, naturally, the show has been a huge time-suck and becoming increasingly more difficult to make amidst the financial aspects of life. Playing a game, writing about it, recording the VO and editing the video every week was not possible anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t tend to \"play the game\" on YouTube. I avoid trends, I don\u0027t request that people \"SMASH that like button\" and if I don\u0027t see a point to it, like an intro video, I won\u0027t do it. For a long time I wasn\u0027t confident enough to even set up a Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three years that I have made this show have been incredibly fulfilling and I feel no shame that Psy Reviews It has become a large part of my identity. In order to keep it that way, and to keep delivering quality videos, I might need your help. So please consider donating to keep the show alive.\u003cbr\u003e"
