    "summary": "Hi! My name is Hannah. Pacha apparel is the wearable aspect to my art that I have been sharing through instagram and etsy. All of the textile materials that I use are organically sourced, OEKO-TEX certified and are the most sustainable and environmentally friendly options I can find. I use hemp, bamboo and cotton blends and herbal dye them by hand with raw plant materials and minerals in very small batches. As the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, through pacha apparel I wish to bring awareness and consciousness to the fashion industry and the fashion choices that we make and how they impact our bodies and the world. Before I started creating This wearable art, I worked with many other mediums that I wish to also share through this platform. Art and expression has been a huge part of my life since I was very young. I want this platform to serve as a more in depth look into my creative processes as well as various other mediums of expression including drawing, painting, dancing, yoga, poetry, live videos, stories and Q\u0026amp;A sessions and so much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am beyond grateful for the love and support I have received towards my art and am so excited to share more with you. It is thanks to the endless support of amazing people like you that I have been able to pursue and manifest these dreams. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u00a0"

I understand that sometimes funds can be tight and other times abundantly flowing, and I want my content to be accessible irregardless. In a way we can mutually help each other. As a patron you will see all of my posts, that could include anything from blog posting, vegan recipes, herbal dye information, tips and tricks, sewing tips and inspirations, other artistic endeavors, Q\u0026amp;A posts, live streams, and more. I will also send out discount codes for releases that happen while you are a supporter, and secret gifts and more. I also have a few \"gift tiers\" that you can choose that will give you tangible goodies if you want to go that route ;)",
