    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hello People of Patreon, First I want to thank you for checking out my Page. Plenty on the internet and you came here so much appreciated. I am an artist/illustrator living in Pomona Ca. As far as I can remember I loved drawing and creating worlds for interesting characters to live in. A lot of my inspiration comes from watching films as a kid. I loved classic Horror, science fiction and fantasy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 I was enamored with comics before I could even read them. My Dad and big brother were collectors. And they would let me mess with duplicates they had.Whenever I picked one up I was in another world. I always wanted to do the same for someone else. And hopefully with your help we can make that. happen.I have a lot of ideas but not a lot of resources or time. Your donations can help me with both. Now i know that your money and time are precious so I will do my best to make sure that you get your moneys worth from me every time. Here\u0027s hoping we can make a lot of fun things together.\u00a0"
