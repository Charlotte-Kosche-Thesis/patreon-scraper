I am passionate\nabout understanding the most complex structure in the universe, the\nhuman brain! For many years I have been investigating how the mind\nworks and have come across the simple principles on which the human\nmind operates. With my background and interest in technology I have\ndeveloped a platform to replicate these principles in artificial\nsystems to build adaptive and intelligent robots. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConventional\nrobotics have misunderstood how behaviour works and the real-world\nrobots built are clumsy and stupid. I want to change that and\nleap-frog current technology and build a community of roboticists and\nsupporters to develop this approach which will not only allow us to\nbuild sophisticated artificial systems but also to understand\nourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you thought\nrobotics was difficult and complicated think again. It doesn\u2019t need\ncomplex mathematics and you don\u2019t need a PhD. The fundamentals are\nquite simple and you actually do them everyday without realising. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor more\ntechnical details of my approach see my recent paper published in the\nArtificial Life journal \"\u003cstrong\u003eA General Architecture for Robotics\nSystems: A Perception-Based Approach to Artificial Life\u003c/strong\u003e,\"\nJune, 2017. The work is based upon an amazing, simple and\nparsimonious theory of how living systems work called \u003cstrong\u003ePerceptual\nControl Theory\u003c/strong\u003e, originally developed by the American physicist and engineer\nWilliam T. Powers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for joining me in this great project! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to make this site free for students. So, if you\u0027re a student and would like access to the site and resources send me a message directly and I\u0027ll add you to the list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nApart from\nrobotics I have many other interests including Salsa dancing, Tap\ndancing, cycling, human rights and Space. The above paper I wrote\nwhile cycling 1,800 kms (1,100 miles) down the west coast of India\nfrom Mumbai to the southern tip at Kanyakumari.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur future is in\nSpace. At some point I would like to form a worldwide community of\nSpace fans to support and advocate space travel for all the people of\nEarth. Not just the robots!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

The conventional approach to robotics is\nmisguided and unnecessarily complex. I can show how control systems\ncan be built on very simple principles to build sophisticated robots\nand you don\u2019t need a PhD to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am passionate\nabout understanding how the human mind works. Along with a great\ninterest in technology this has led me to create real world robots\nbased upon how humans, and other living systems, operate. I have\ndeveloped a radical approach with the potential to outstrip the\nsophistication and intelligence of other robots. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBuilding the\nrobots and designing and testing the robot brains takes a fair amount\nof time and effort, and I am limited in the hardware systems\ncurrently available to me. Patronage from you will enable me to\nexpand the systems to more exciting and intelligent robots and give\nme the time and space to develop them, and to share the knowledge\nwith others who want to build intelligent robots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut no man is an\nisland and what inspires me about Patreon is the engagement with the\ncommunity of artists, thinkers and scientists, who can help shape the\ngrowth and direction of an exciting new technology. As a patron you\ncan be part of that community, get early access to the videos of the\nrobots in action, get the robot designs which will allow you to\nreplicate the robots yourself, contribute to construction of the\nsystems and download and use the unique software platform and\nGraphical User Interface.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
