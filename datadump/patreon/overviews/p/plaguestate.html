    "summary": "Hello there! Thanks for checking out my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve spent much time around me or my work you\u0027ll know that I love the Elder Scrolls series, and Skyrim especially. I love the lore, the detail, and the adventure. More than that, I love telling stories within the environment given to us by Bethesda. My last \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/plaguehush\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e streamed playthrough (you can view the mid-playthrough trailer above) was a full 18-month epic of high adventure where we followed our protagonist, Ashlynn, from her humble beginnings as a child of a lowly hunter, right through to claiming the throne and defeating the Aldmeri Dominion as High Queen of Skyrim; it was a hell of a ride!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently preparing for my next playthrough, a saga of even greater proportions featuring multiple characters with intertwined stories, all leading to one amazing adventure that I intend to tell over a two-year period. This will be streamed live on Twitch, and edited for release as a \"Livethrough\" series on YouTube - Not to be missed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love the community that has grown up around modding the game - the part of the technology that allows us to bend the game to our needs and will, and I have poured thousands of hours into creating tutorials, streamed demonstrations of modding techniques, \u003ca href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/989279/?tb=mods\u0026amp;pUp=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSkyrim mods\u003c/a\u003e, and live advice. My goal is to give back everything I can to the community that has provided me with so much entertainment, in a way that means the stuff I produce can be used by anyone as resources or inspiration to go on to create awesome stuff of their own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of all that, I have the priviledge of being a community leader for the \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/0U8RzC5KLESjnQga\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Save Early, Save Often\" modding community\u003c/a\u003e, which is an amazing collective of mod creators, mod users, gaming enthusiasts, viewers, and all-round awesome people! It\u0027s allowed me to find brilliantly talented people to work alongside, and we\u0027re beginning to form a team creating mods and experiences for both the upcoming saga and other mod users; the largest and newest being the \u003ca href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76101/?\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnofficial Skyrim Modder\u0027s Patch\u003c/a\u003e. Not content with fixing our own heavily modded Skyrim installs, we\u0027re using that knowledge to help fix everyone\u0027s!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis does all come at some personal cost though. I have a wife and two wonderful kids, and providing the content I do takes almost all my free time; equally many of the things that I do require financial investment for software, hosting, storage, etc. This isn\u0027t intended to be a guilt trip, but I want to confirm to you that any support you provide through Patreon will be hugely appreciated - both in terms of offsetting some of the financial cost of what I do, and also in helping me justify to my family that the time away from them is well spent!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust by visiting this page I know you\u0027re a viewer (or ChatNinja!) of the stream, or are a member of the community and are already supporting me with your time, comments and feedback and for that I thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to take that further by becoming a patron then I am doubly indebted to you. You generous few truly are awesome incarnate! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a big supporter of the \u0027\u003ca href=\"http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Open_Modding\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCathedral\u003c/a\u003e\u0027\n approach to content creation, and as such I never intend to put any of \nmy content behind a paywall, so I won\u0027t be offering rewards in return for reaching goal milestones - Everything I do is free for everyone, and if it inspires \nsomeone to take it and create something awesome with it I\u0027ll consider my job \ndone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, you guys deserve to know where your patronage is going,\n so I\u0027m using the goals to show what I can use the donations to \noffset. Again, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
