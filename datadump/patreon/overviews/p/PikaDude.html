    "summary": "Hey! My name is PikaDude. I create bots for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discordapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscord\u003c/a\u003e, websites, and other random things too. I\u0027m just going flat out say that \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027re probably here because of my Discord Bot\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://pikagirl.pikadude.me/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePikaGirl\u003c/a\u003e. While I have created several different projects over the years, PikaGirl is the most popular out of all of them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why am I asking for money?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAm I going to use the money for myself?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe answer is no. Running so many different projects requires a lot of resources and some powerful servers. PikaGirl alone requires roughly 2 gigabytes of RAM at the time of writing this, and a pretty fast CPU to be able to iterate through \u003cstrong\u003ethousands \u003c/strong\u003eof records in its database. If PikaGirl did not have a server that was powerful enough, it wouldn\u0027t even be able to run, or, if lucky, it would take several seconds to do the most basic tasks. This is where I need your help. Paying for a dedicated server isn\u0027t cheap, and can result in paying \u003cstrong\u003eseveral hundreds of dollars a year just for the servers themselves\u003c/strong\u003e. With your help, I can afford fast enough servers that can provide responses to your commands in a matter of milliseconds. If I start earning more money than what is required for servers, that money will be spent either making more projects, \u003cstrong\u003eor maybe even something like commissioning an artist to make an avatar for PikaGirl...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo I get rewarded for donating?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes! Of course you do! The rewards you can get are listed to the side. At the time of writing this, there isn\u0027t much I can give back to you at the moment. \u003cstrong\u003eBut trust me on this, much better rewards are on the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre donations required?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo way. \u003cstrong\u003ePikaGirl\u0027s core features will always be free\u003c/strong\u003e. Similarly to Discord Nitro, donations aren\u0027t a requirement for the people who aren\u0027t willing to make a donation. It will simply give you access to \"perks\" that do nothing but enhance the current experience. The worst thing I would want is to force people to do something that they don\u0027t want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I get my reward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo prevent fraudulent donations, \u003cstrong\u003eyour reward will be given to you once the money is taken out of your account\u003c/strong\u003e. This is to verify that you\u0027re not lying about your donation so I\u0027m not giving you your reward for free. Patreon typically withdraws your money at the end of every month, so until that happens, you\u0027re going to have to wait, sorry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, whether or not you donate is entirely up to you. I\u0027d be extremely grateful if you did, but I\u0027m not forcing anyone to go against their will. If you do decide to donate, thanks! Your donations will be rewarded."
