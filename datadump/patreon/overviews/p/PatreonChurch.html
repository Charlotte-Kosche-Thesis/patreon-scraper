    "summary": "Greetings,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Noah Littlestone and I am starting a Christian \u003cstrong\u003eCHURCH\u003c/strong\u003e on \u003cstrong\u003ePATREON\u003c/strong\u003e.  We are going to call it \u003cstrong\u003ePATREON CHURCH\u003c/strong\u003e (go figure).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot\n a lot of people go to church these days. Can\u0027t blame them. Yet, so many out there are \nseeking truth. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePATREON CHURCH is an Unconventional Church for \nUnconventional People\u003c/strong\u003e.... it is for those of us who are willing to use this online community to seek truth together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it is kind of wonderful that the man I was named after lived in a\n time when \"man\u2019s \nwickedness was great on the earth and ... every inclination of the \nthoughts of his heart was only bad all the time\" (Genesis 6:5). Noah didn\u0027t belong to an amazing church. Noah \ndidn\u0027t have good fellowship. Noah only had God... and that was enough.  Thousands of years later we \nstill have God, but we also have something which Noah did not: the Bible, an inspired collection of stories, histories, and prophecies which allows us to better understand our loving Creator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting a \"Virtual Church\" here on \u003cstrong\u003ePATREON\u003c/strong\u003e means that, like Noah, we are not going to be able to meet face to face with other like minded people.\u00a0 But unlike Noah, we will be able to study together.\u00a0 And this is what is so exciting about the \u003cstrong\u003ePATREON CHURCH\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to honor God and to love my neighbor by teaching in accordance with Biblical truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will do so through free sermons, free articles, and free blogs. But, why free?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJesus tells us the standard for Christian ministry. (Matthew 10: 8) \u003cstrong\u003eY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e received free, give free.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough\n \u003cstrong\u003ePATREON\u003c/strong\u003e wants us to offer rewards in return for your Patronage, I can\u0027t\n charge for biblical knowledge. That would be unbiblical and unloving. \nBut If you want to join our community, please\n feel free to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe welcome you to the \n\u003cstrong\u003ePATREON CHURCH\u003c/strong\u003e community. We just started...so literally \neverything needs to be done.  We need a web site, logo, daily devotional\n emailer, legal documents (do you think Jesus was a sole proprietor or had a\n LLC to limit his liability?)  Seriously, what a fun place to be.  With \nGod\u0027s help, lets get started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessings, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNoah Littlestone \u003cbr\u003eLuke 22:32: \"Strengthen your Brothers\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.s. I loving say the following from the bottom of my heart...\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause there is so much division within the denominations of the so called Christian Church, I refuse to claim a denomination for the \u003cstrong\u003ePATREON CHURCH.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause it is about God, not me.... and because there are so many Pastors, Priest, PHD\u0027s \u0026amp; Seminarian who don\u0027t even believe in God or believe that the Bible is inspired, I refuse to boast about my theological education and background.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease do your own research and test what I say against the scriptures.\u00a0 My only obligation is to honor God.\u00a0 This means that I will only publish that which I know to be the truth, based upon a thorough study of the Bible. \"Yet wisdom is justified by all her children\" (Luke 7:35).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
