We really, really, \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e appreciate all the incredible support you give, and are super excited to provide a way to do that, and we\u0027ve come up with some fun rewards along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Purplicious Cow?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, so technically, I am Purplicious Cow, the lead developer of mods for Minecraft, but also father of the amazing 12-year cy4n (aka a_villager), who makes the textures, models, and helps with the game design and creative direction of all of our mods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always, always, \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e wanted to be a video game developer. I made games with my father when I was very young, played games all of my life, and then began making games in Flash with cy4n when he was very young. Together, cy4n and I discovered modding for Minecraft a few years back, and the ride has been amazing! I now code about 30 hours/week, and wish I could do more. We currently have 4 mods for Minecraft that we try to keep updated. Here\u0027s a little bit of what we\u0027ve created and are working on now!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eInventory Pets\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.creeptech.net/images/ip/ip_pets.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInventory Pets is our most popular mod, and puts living animated creatures with amazing abilities into your hotbar. It has become one of the most popular mods on Minecraft, found in many modpacks including CrazyCraft, Troll Craft, and Farming Valley. We continue to add new pets and features to this mod, and have teamed up with the incredible RazzleberryFox to start bringing in living models of the pets in the game world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCustom Pets\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.creeptech.net/images/cp/custom_pets.png\"\u003eThe\u00a0Custom Pets mod was highly requested by the Minecraft community, and allows you to create, design, and level up your own Custom Inventory Pet. Players discover Ability Cards found all over the world by killing mobs in certain situations. Ability Cards can then be learned by pets and used immediately in the game world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eVoxels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.creeptech.net/voxels/images/voxels_banner.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVoxels is a unique mod that brings in a new currency to Minecraft (Voxels) which is traded by friendly creepers who live in Creeper Villages all over the overworld.

We have big plans for this mod, and it feels like we are just getting started.\u00a0Animania is an immersive mod that replaces and improves the passive animals in Minecraft, adding multiple breeds, proper genders, new realistic behaviors, and several new species.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have big, big plans for many new animals and behaviors in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so lucky to have such great supporters like you!
