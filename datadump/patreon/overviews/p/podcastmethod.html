The premise:\u00a0watch at home and join us each week to talk about the episodes of your favorite TV show. We discuss the best shows, old and new, season by season, along with special guests and your calls. You\u0027ll never have to watch alone again. Unless you want to. Then that\u0027s ok. And you get to vote and help pick the shows (like Breaking Bad, Dexter, all the great shows!).",
