Fuji have dropped support for the machine making spare parts increasingly difficult and expensive to acquire. This doesn\u0027t just effect us - many high street labs and smaller independents are being forced to abandon film processing as it\u0027s no longer economic to do so despite film photography undergoing a resurgence in recent years. It\u0027s clear that unless something changes film photography will die a slow, unceremonious death as it becomes increasingly difficult to get film processed photographers will be turned off the idea of shooting film. This will lead to a drop in sales which will then lead to increased prices which in turn put more people off -\u00a0 a vicious little feedback loop.\u003cbr\u003eWe have therefore decided to take it upon ourselves to design and build a new machine - one that is easily repaired with off the shelf components. Once we have a functional design we will make them available for other labs in an effort to keep the industry at large alive.\u00a0 In order to do this though we require funding. Since we are unable to process film at the moment (and film was a major part of our business) and given that we have spent thousands in the last two years trying to keep our old processor alive we simply don\u0027t have the resources to do it we are asking for your help so that we can try and save this dying industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fman1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/775263_10153967267035439_2512407764452208145_o.jpg?oh=7c5507da17dfe2ab14351301063525a6\u0026amp;oe=5AABC9FB\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as documenting our efforts to build a new processor we will also produce blogs and videos discussing various aspects of the world of photography, film and other forms of visual media - News, reviews, rumours, tips and tricks as well as mini documentaries and short films on a variety of topics.\u00a0As professionals working within the visual media sector we\u0027re aiming for a higher level of quality for our content whilst retaining our independent spirit and (for better or worse) our unique personalities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eOur Team:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnnan Hamill - Imaging Director\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMegan Archibald - Photographic Technician\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIcarus Owen\u00a0- Photographer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndi Stott - Engineer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMichael Rennie - Engineer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eGoals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePGFP-NX01 \"Enterprise\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fman1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20375965_10155585481815439_4938420233195999475_n.jpg?oh=24b4277f2548017ea33a0e8d10e1b826\u0026amp;oe=5A8F15EE\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur primary goal is to design and build a new film processor.

The main barriers for entry are cost and availability. Processors require a certain number of films going through them to keep the chemistry healthy and when we first opened this was a real concern - how do we encourage people to shoot more? We set up a subscription service - \u00a325 a month for 10 rolls processed and scanned and any over 10 were offered at a discounted rate. This dramatically increased our throughput and in turn increased the number of rolls we were selling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow that our Fuji machine is out of action we\u0027ve lost our subscribers - that was a guaranteed income every month which is now gone not to mention walk in\u0027s of which I\u0027m turning away dozens a week. The market is there but so long as labs continue to close it will come to a point where it will become so specialist, difficult and expensive that it will implode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you really expect to sell units to high street chains?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo - I\u0027m thinking about the indie labs like us who have carved out a niche for themselves. As more and more high street labs close film processing independents like us see more and more customers as the market becomes concentrated. The business is there for us but the ability to maintain that business is at the mercy of antiquated equipment. We don\u0027t plan on manufacturing thousands of units for mass market. We don\u0027t intend to have units lying around in a warehouse gathering dust. We want to design a lean machine that\u0027s easily assembled and can be built quickly when required.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou say it\u0027s specialist - surely that goes against your point about accessibility?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMmmmmm... no. At the moment we\u0027re at a sweet spot - there are enough indie labs out there that it\u0027s still fairly easy to find somewhere to process your film and as such the price of processing is fairly low. In some ways it\u0027s good that the high street labs are closing - it concentrates the demand into a smaller area of specialists - a sort of market equilibrium. But if we continue down this path more and more of these specialist labs will close because they\u0027re unable to provide the service due to failing equipment. When you go from a few hundred indie labs to only a handful that\u0027s when the problems will really begin - prices go up, people stop shooting, film sales go down, film prices goes up, film sales go down further etc etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not pick up old machines from decommissioned labs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe tried this. In the last few years we\u0027ve burned through three different machines. The simple fact is that the machines currently in circulation are old, worn out and often not stored properly so whilst you can pick up and old Fuji or Noritsu machine for very little money the chances of it lasting any significant length of time is low. Repairing the machines is becoming more and more difficult as many of them are now \"end of life\" meaning that new spares are becoming harder to source and prohibitively expensive not to mention the cost of an engineers time. Many parts are now being harvested from old machines and are themselves old and worn out. Last year we spent around \u00a310,000 keeping the service running. The only reason we did that is because there was demand for the service but now there\u0027s no profit in it so we\u0027ve had to drop it - not because we didn\u0027t have the customers, but because we can\u0027t rely on the equipment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not use a Jobo?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJobo\u0027s are great but they can\u0027t handle volume. As I said above as more and more high street labs close the customer base becomes more concentrated. This means that indies who specialise in film have much higher volumes compared to non-specialist supermarket labs. Jobo\u0027s are ill equipped to deal with that kind of throughput. Also using spirals increases the chances of things going wrong - film can be dropped, come loose from their spirals, etc. Using Jobo\u0027s is also time consuming and as the old saying goes \"time is money\" - relying on Jobo\u0027s for commercial work will inevitably lead to increased prices for the consumer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSurely if there was a need for this Fuji, Noritsu or Kodak would make one?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe need is there but the market is far to small for a large company to bother committing resources to it. We\u0027re looking at small scale manufacturing with machines built on demand - this is something a small operation like ours can do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI process my own film.

Great, you have a passion for film. I applaud you for that but not everyone has the time, space or interest to do so. The number of people home developing C41 is fairly small and when it gets to crunch time and it becomes too expensive and bothersome to find a lab most people will just not bother shooting film - not because they don\u0027t want to but because they can\u0027t justify doing so. This will impact film sales which will lead to products being cut and prices going up which at the end of the day impacts you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
