    "summary": "Over 5 years ago Danger Dolan started a little gaming YouTube channel known as TheDDGuides from his tiny Aussie bedroom. Things quickly ballooned, and today,\u00a0Planet Dolan is a network of writers, editors, voice actors, artists and animators spanning members across the globe from the U.S, to New Zealand, and even Macedonia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have two channels:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/planetdolan\"\u003ePlanet Dolan\u003c/a\u003e - where we frequently post countdowns \u0026amp; illustrated true stories featuring art from the PD team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/superplanetdolan\"\u003eSuper Planet Dolan\u003c/a\u003e - our premium content for animations \u0026amp; storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we\u0027re on Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eSince early days, YouTube has been extremely shaky\nfor economic reliability. In 2012, there was a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/youtube-watch-time-vs-views-2015-7?r=US\u0026amp;IR=T\"\u003esilent algorithm change\u003c/a\u003e prioritizing\nwatch time over clicks that killed animation and high quality/slow production\ncontent overnight. In 2013 there was the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/11/youtube-unleashes-strange-storm-of-copyright-claims-on-video-game-content-producers/#68852fe2324c\"\u003ecopyright apocalypse\u003c/a\u003e which mass flagged video footage and crippled the revenue of all channels overnight \u003cem\u003ewithout warning\u003c/em\u003e and not a peep nor help from YouTube. In 2017 we experienced the YouTube\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/analyst-predicts-the-youtube-ad-boycott-will-cost-google-750-million-2017-3?r=US\u0026amp;IR=T\"\u003eadpocalypse\u003c/a\u003e in which a ton of companies boycotted Google and their adsense program because their ads were being displayed over questionable content. It was all over the news, and YouTube said nothing, so we had about a week to prepare before revenue was reduced by 30-40%, and that\u0027s if you were lucky. Revenue has slightly improved since then but CPM will randomly spiral out of control based on the contents of the video. Creepy videos, sexual-related topics \u0026amp; anything YT deems \"non-advertiser friendly\" all earn basically nothing for the work you put in, which killed a lot of channels. And now, for a new nail in the coffin, videos will be\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/bDuo1RqL9Y\"\u003estealthily hidden\u003c/a\u003e if they\u0027re not \"appropriate\" (which can literally mean anything) and will not longer be recommended/monetised with all comments \u0026amp; likes \u003cstrong\u003edisabled\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout all of this we\u0027ve clung on, mainly from the support of our fans continuing to check out our content through all these years. We started an animation channel \u003cem\u003edespite\u003c/em\u003e the 2012 algorithm changes and we\u0027re extremely proud of the content we\u0027ve produced since then. However, we\u0027ve finally reached the point where things are no longer sustainable with all these topic \u0026amp; advertisement restrictions in place, and we can\u0027t rely on crazy CPM levels to pay our animators/voice actors/editors/writers fairly anymore.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, with your support, we will - and we\u0027ll be able to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we will do with your money:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e50% of all pledges will go towards maintaining our current series (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXUtf9YTBhHxQ8PM9P0VwKEp8werMM_Rk\"\u003ecountdowns\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXUtf9YTBhHwYS9KFCsWD0DwD0dm_wU1F\"\u003eDTS\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzZ1xlsAONepazTa0ZXTEs-bkJHp1jQPL\"\u003eSPD\u003c/a\u003e), while the other 50% will be used to create new formats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- At 1000 patrons we\u0027ll be putting together a dedicated Planet Dolan comic team, we hosted a\u00a0\u003ca class=\"hoverZoomLink\" href=\"http://www.planetdolan.com/top-10-comics-2017-competition/\"\u003ecompetition\u003c/a\u003e in which we had over 50+ incredible entries and brought the top contenders to life in a\u00a0\u003ca class=\"hoverZoomLink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CXTipAf_ZM\"\u003efully voiced video\u003c/a\u003e.
