We create memories with cloth objects, connect with them, touch them for so much of our lives - even when we don\u0027t realize it! I followed my passions and ended up with university degrees in theatrical costume design and dress/apparel/costume and culture. Along the way, I taught everything from beginning sewing skills and the history of fashion to a class on textiles and fibers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027d like to share what I\u0027ve learned with you. What kind of things do \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e want to know about clothes? Are you looking for costume terminology for a writing project, or wanting to know more about how textiles behave to improve your drawing skills? Want to find research or inspiration images, but just don\u0027t know where to start? Do you want to know how clothes impact the body, or have you just had a burning question about laundry ever since you invented that fascinating stain with guacamole and a bottle of red wine?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me help you, and I hope we\u0027ll both learn something along the way!\u003cbr\u003e"
