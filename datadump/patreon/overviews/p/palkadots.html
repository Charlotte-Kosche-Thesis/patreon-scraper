    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Matthew Palka (or EverybodyPalka!...as you may have heard)\u003cbr\u003eI make thought-provoking, educational related vlogs such as:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8kRYkgvGvE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat Does It Mean to Be Human?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eBut also goofy ones, such as:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Ojxcxoi6zm4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Upside Down Howling Greyhound\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFirst, I sincerely appreciate you being here. If you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027ve taken your own time, energy, and eye-balls to read this sentence right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0have been interested in journaling leadership images since my involvement in career and technical student-led leadership organizations such as FCCLA, during middle school in 2007. These leadership image ideas began turning into Youtube videos in 2012 and the lessons from them are really close to me.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePalkaDots \u003c/strong\u003eare short, educational thought vlogs that each teach a single idea in a creative, storytelling video approach. The aim of the lesson is to help you grasp an idea through a metaphor, and make the truth that the metaphor communicates about reality better palpable, connected, and understood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project aims to help you use creative metaphors to better understand complex and less concrete ideas that are fundamental to what we experience. They\u0027ve very interconnected and useful in decision-making and understanding ourselves and the world around us. Past images I\u0027ve discussed include: The Inverted U-Curve, The Nine-Dot Puzzle, The Central Self, The Tabula Rosa Canvas, The Caged Freedom Bird, and The Growth Mindset.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy support this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, supporting will directly enable me to spread the value that I create to more people that are interested in it! This is a tremendous help to increase the time I have to dedicate to my creative pursuits using Patreon. It will lead to higher production value in the videos, projects you can collaborate on and grow, and a diverse assortment of content for you to value and enjoy. Second, the money you contribute will go directly into the fruition of this creative endeavor and not my only source of stable income. I\u0027d love it to become that. Third, you\u0027ll be building a remarkable and small community HERE on my Patreon page to connect, create, and interact with any time you wish, around the content and value that I create. Think of it like a welcoming, community tent that grows in proportion to the people that bring value and contributions to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccumulative reward levels, from the smallest to the largest, will enable you to choose the subscription contribution level that best works for you. If you\u0027re international and not in the US, Patreon will show you the exchange rate in US dollars for your own country\u0027s currency too! See the perks below on the right hand side!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely appreciate any amount of connection that you bring to this online space. Whether you simply discuss, share and follow along, or create even more with me at the highest contribution level, it\u0027s up to you. Please don\u0027t go pay and go beyond your own means! Even at $1, you\u0027ll receive early access to content to connect, discuss, and enjoy what I make. When you\u0027re signed up, you will be directly notified by your choice of Patreon feed or email every time I upload or create something and share it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re here because you are curious, interested, or want to understand and appreciate the value that I create. I aim to bring valuable ideas, knowledge, and perspective into your life in a form that hopefully you enjoy and look forward to appreciating, for however long you decide to stick around. You make this journey as possible and as remarkable as I do. Every person adds a thread to this small internet corner\u0027s tapestry. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest wishes,\u003cbr\u003eMatt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003etl;dr - The Project is called PalkaDots.\u003cbr\u003e- They\u0027re really funny, sincere, and interesting metaphors that teach fundamental and cool ideas you can apply creatively in what you do.\u003cbr\u003e- You choose your contribution level perk to your own liking\u003cbr\u003e- Reward perks accumulative the more you contribute\u003cbr\u003e- Your donation is monthly\u003cbr\u003e- The money goes into creating and expanding this project\u0027s value and the rewards to you.\u003cbr\u003e- You make this possible, so THANK YOU to the millionth power!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
