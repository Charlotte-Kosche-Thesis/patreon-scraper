    "summary": "If you\u0027re reading this, it means that you\u0027re considering donating to Physical Attraction via Patreon. And that means that I owe you some very squishy, very drippy chat-up lines. Thank you so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating to the show, not only do you express your thanks for the content that you hopefully enjoy, but you also make it possible for me to carry on going: it will help to pay hosting costs, I can put it in a fund towards new equipment, and books aren\u0027t cheap either. But more than any of that - if you love podcasts as much as I do, you\u0027ll appreciate that they can provide, for free, a better source of entertainment than billion-dollar movies and TV shows. You\u0027ll appreciate the thrill of excitement when a new episode drops. You\u0027ll grow to love the voices that have kept you company before falling asleep, or while you\u0027re cooking or doing household chores, making the day easier to get through. I don\u0027t know if my podcast will ever reach those levels. But I will try my best to make it as good as I can. But without an audience, without your support, we\u0027re nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to offer contributors - as well as all of this gratitude - full episode scripts, commentary, reviews of the books that I use for the show, and eventually a feed with bonus episodes for those who donate a little more. These will probably be released irregularly, as funding drives, but it\u0027s always nice to get something back for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScience communication feels more important than it ever has. We face so many challenges, and a choice: embrace our present and future, so much of which is based on scientific endeavour, or remain forever children. My goal is to talk to you about the ideas that blow my mind, and change the world... and maybe flirt a little on the side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nstudied physics for four years, during which time I did a lot of problem sets\nand almost no chatting-up. Which might be familiar to any other physics\nstudents out there. But one thing I did notice was how the subject is just\nfilled to the brim with innuendoes. It seemed that every way I looked, there\nwere hot, dense bodies, fully degenerate limits, or just\u2026 references to wet and\ndry friction. So I wrote a whole bunch of physics based chat-up lines\u2026 more as\na kind of ironic \u201cHaha I\u2019m going to die alone\u201d type exercise than as a genuine\nattempt to attract people. And then ended up having to deliver them in a speech to a room filled with tutors and students...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, this would have been just another side-note in a life filled with\ntragicomic events. Except I still had all the chat-up lines, lurking in a dark\nand musty corner of my computer. And I still had a whole bunch of physics\nknowledge, lurking in a dark and musty corner of my brain. And I wanted to\ndemonstrate to the world that I\u2019ve got the moves, as well as the looks. And I\nthought, maybe, just maybe, some of you out there are trying to seduce\nphysicists, and you could use a little help, or you\u2019re trying to learn physics,\nand you could use a little light relief. So in this podcast, I\u2019m\ngoing to explain some ideas about physics using my chat-up lines. This will\ncombine my four great passions in life: awful puns, awful flirting, awful\nphysics, and blathering endlessly on about stuff that no-one could possibly be\ninterested in. \u003cbr\u003e"
