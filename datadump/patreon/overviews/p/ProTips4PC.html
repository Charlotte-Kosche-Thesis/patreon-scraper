    "summary": "Thanks for visiting my Patreon page. I\u0027m going to be using this as a way to help people with their PC problems of all sorts - the problem many IT guys like myself run into is that everyone likes to ask for advice \u003cstrong\u003eall the time.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0My clients and friends text me, message me, and call me \u003cstrong\u003eday and night\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and they do so with the expectation that I\u0027ll just answer their questions and that it\u0027s not inconvenient. If it were just one person, once in a while - that\u0027d be true - but I\u0027m constantly inundated with requests of all sorts. Sometimes 10-15 people a day contact me just to ask a question or ten - can you imagine if that were you? Or if that were your significant other attached to their phone because another person wants free advice?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page exists for those people: If I\u0027ve helped you in the past and you\u0027d like to show your gratitude, you can do it with a small monthly donation through this Patreon page. If you\u0027d like to have future access to asking those questions - you\u0027ll need to subscribe. This way, you can get the help you need - and I can make money from the work I do for so many people. Patrons who support my work and support my business will recieve top priority and will have access to (soon) a private tech support group only for patrons - Patrons will be able to ask anything and everything they want in that group (On Facebook) and not have to worry about receiving a bill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy business is 100% of my income, and I know, I know - I\u0027ve done this to myself. I\u0027ve created my own problem by allowing everyone to have such easy and open access to my time, but at this stage of my life I can\u0027t continue doing that without some form of compensation. IF you value my time and the services I provide to you - \u003cstrong\u003econsider donating the cost of one large soy latte per month\u003c/strong\u003e (I\u0027m lactose intolerant) as a thank you and as compensation. Thank you for doing so, it means a LOT! I\u0027ve worked in the IT industry for 18 years now, and that experience has value. I hope you\u0027ll view it that way too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part? \u003cstrong\u003eYou don\u0027t have to be local\u003c/strong\u003e. I have a full corporate Teamviewer license (It cost me over $4000 and I need to pay for it!) and can help anyone in the world on practically any device in the world. Mac, PC, Linux, pick your poison - all you need is an internet connection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
