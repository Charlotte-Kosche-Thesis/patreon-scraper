    "summary": "On a random Sunday in July 2015, we finally got off of our asses, got drunk and made a thing. Look, we had spent about a year talking about video ideas, coming up with story lines, and discussing shot lists... \u00a0But, unfortunately, we were drinking shots at the same time so nothing ever got done. \u00a0We\u0027ve got a whole lot of quit in us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo when we finally decided to record our first video, we got drunk, tossed out all of our ideas and plans, and just filmed us making fun of a video that Pat had found on the internet. \u00a0It was cringey. \u00a0Bad lighting, horrible sound, awful dialogue, and edited on iMovie. \u00a0Who cares, right? \u00a0No one was ever going to see the fucking thing anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had spent around 2 years doing a podcast that got very little feedback. \u00a0We were used to putting shit on the internet and it staying pretty much hidden and obscure. \u00a0If you dig back into the archives, you will find our old videos. \u00a0Dozens of pieces of crap that we made at random times or filmed during our podcast sessions... \u00a02 years and 20+ videos of that netted us 15 subscribers. \u00a0Mostly our friends and Pat\u0027s mom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell...  People did see it.  And, much to our surprise, people started subscribing and commenting on our channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost channels set Patreon goals that allow them to upgrade their lights, audio, video, editing software, etc. \u00a0That\u0027s probably smart. \u00a0However, we think too highly of ourselves and started throwing everything that we could into new gear way before we knew this channel might even work at a modest level. \u00a0We got new lights, new backdrops, upgraded to Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects (because we saw it mentioned in the credits of an Avengers movie and... yes... we consider those producers to be our peers) and purchased all kinds of crap that is completely irresponsible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, we have finally hit 3000 subscribers. \u00a0We had set that as a goal to reach before we started begging for patrons. \u00a0Would it have been easier on our credit cards if we had put Patreon up months ago? \u00a0Yup. \u00a0But we just didn\u0027t think people were going to appreciate being yelled at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo.... \u00a0We did it! \u00a03000 of you enjoy the crap we make for some odd reason and now let the cyberbegging begin! \u00a0Thanks so much to you guys that subbed to us early and helped us grow by sharing our videos. \u00a0You guys all fucking rock. \u00a0Even if this Patreon thing doesn\u0027t make us a dime, we\u0027re going to keep making videos and getting drunk on Sunday afdternoons... \u00a0Because we love this shit and we need the attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with that all said, welcome to the official Poisoning The Well Patreon page... \u00a0Make your money, our money!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"They were too quick witted and funny and they made me look bad.\"\u003c/em\u003e - DarkMatter2525 / April 2016 on The Goddamn Podcast episode 66."
