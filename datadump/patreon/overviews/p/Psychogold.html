    "summary": "Hello there ladies and gentlemen Psychogold here and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a YouTuber and Streamer who\u0027s been going about this since 2015, I was mostly focused on Gaming related content at the time and not really in a position to commit the time needed to deliver the amount of content that I wanted. Fast forward to today and I\u0027ve started YouTube up again this time focusing on a more reaction based channel with reviews and discussions being thrown in as and when I find the topics that mean enough to me to do so. Between November 2017 and January 2018 I\u0027ve gained 800+ subscribers and to me that is a huge growth and one that I am very proud of and thankful for. My subscribers meant the world to me and providing entertainment or my own perspective on things is what my channel is all about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those people who are because of my streaming on Mixer and Twitch before it have no fear! That isn\u0027t going away and if you are one of those people who\u0027s ever wanted to donate to me but couldn\u0027t then this is the place for you! I will still be doing my sporadic streaming and if this all goes well I may even FINALLY be able to set a schedule in advance and stick too it :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI honestly wasn\u0027t sure about starting one of these and a part of me still feels a little bit weird about it but I\u0027ve had people ask me about making one so here it is! It\u0027s still pretty barebones at the moment in terms of rewards or looks as I really want feedback from you guys! What kind of rewards would you like to see in the future added to this Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I get my Discord up and running I will be adding in Discord roles to each of the tiers below but for now I just want this to be a way to give people who want to support this channel a way too. I plan to post frequently on Patreon either with behind the scenes thoughts and vlogs or potential Q\u0026amp;A scenarios.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way guys even if you decide against it just know that from the bottom of my heart you guys have been amazing and I can\u0027t wait to see where we as a community go from here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePsychogold OUT!\u003cbr\u003e"
