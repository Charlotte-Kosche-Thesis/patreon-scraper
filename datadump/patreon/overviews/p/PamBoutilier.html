I also readily answer to \u0027Boots\u0027.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWelcome to my Patreon page! If you are here I assume that you have some interest in the type of artwork that I am producing - and if that\u0027s the case then you actually already know what this Patreon is all about!\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e1) Why did I start a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am transitioning from a career as a veterinarian to being a full-time artist. I\u0027m still early in this process and strategically speaking it may be \"too early\" to start a Patreon - but my goal is to plant the seed that could grow into \u003cstrong\u003ea place where I can start to gather a community of people who are interested in the work that I am doing\u003c/strong\u003e. What kind of work is that? Primarily whimsical illustrations (digital and mixed media) and more realistic animal art and pet portraits (done in scratchboard). If you want to see a fully gallery of my work, please check out my website (www.PamBoutilier.com)!\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\nSo just the fact that you are reading this means that this Patreon is doing it\u0027s job! And in\u00a0the spirit of that goal, I will be posting content to this Patreon page for anyone who wishes to enjoy it. You don\u0027t have to pledge money to see most of the content on this page.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThat being said, I am trying to build a career around my art and that does involve making some money. If you do wish to support me financially I would be VERY grateful for ANY level, and I\u0027ve tried to construct tiers that I can honour and will make me feel that I\u0027m giving something appropriate to those who wish to invest financially in the work that I am doing.\u00a0\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n2. What am I offering?\n\t\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am offering a variety of things on this site;\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t- Artwork to view (and hopefully lots of it) including finished work, \u0027works-in-progress\u0027 and preliminary sketches, thumbnails, and studies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t- Timelapse videos (sometimes called \u0027speedpainting\u0027) showing how work is produced. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t- A studio Vlog (I\u0027m at least going to give this a try and see how it goes :D).\u00a0\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t- Exclusive content (not released on other social media)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t- Exclusive \u0027passion projects\u0027 content (super secret for my patrons eyes only!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tMuch of the content be available no matter what tier of support you choose. Some of the items that are require more time and resources to produce are reserved for my subscribers, and my biggest backers have the option of getting custom artwork made!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e3. How can I see more of X on this page?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI consider the offerings on this Patreon to be a starting place - and as my community grows I welcome input into what kinds of things I offer here. \n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cem\u003e- Do you like the timelapse recordings?
