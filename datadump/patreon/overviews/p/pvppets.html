    "summary": "Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ryan Bly but I\u0027m also known as pvppets here on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a 23 year old American artist and illustrator that focuses mainly on darker concepts and human emotions. I am a firm believer that you can always make the best out of a bad situation, and that it\u0027s ok to not be ok. I work in various mediums such as pen and ink, markers, watercolor, digital, acrylic, etc. I\u0027m heavily inspired by comic books, tattoo flash, cartoons, pop culture, horror, and lowbrow art. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills with new mediums and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Pvppets\" started as a simple artistic alias but it has expanded into so much more than I ever would have imagined. It is an extension of myself, a part of me that isn\u0027t afraid to express anything no matter how extreme. I\u0027ve exposed a side of myself that I would have been terrified to share in the past. I don\u0027t want to say that I owe my life to art but I definitely would not be what I am today without it. Art has given me an identity and a place where I will always belong. It has taught me things that no other person would have be able to. It is the healthiest outlet I have and I am more than thankful for it. With that being said, I want to continue to share my work, feelings, experiences, and knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my Patreon I want to:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e-Create inspiring work.\u003cbr\u003e-Give tips and advice to fellow artists and share ideas, thoughts, and concepts.\u003cbr\u003e-Create an accepting and positive artistic community and space to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on my page I want to offer exclusives to those who want to know me a little bit better and therefore offer a more intimate experience for my audience. I want to inspire others and help out anyone that I possibly can. I plan to use this money to continue my craft, buy supplies, expand \u00a0and upgrade my workspace, start higher quality livestreams, make youtube videos and tutorials, provide higher quality products and prints, and create multiple zines and books that I have ideas for. I have a ton of long term goals. I want to constantly expand my work and equipment and this will help me do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of this sounds interesting to you I have created multiple tier lists for monthly donations. This will range from more frequent and exclusive updates, seeing all of my current sketchbook pages, winning original art, exclusive prints, asking in depth questions, and seeing all of my behind the scenes content. I want to be able to help out anyone and everyone that I can, and share my work in as many ways as I can. Any amount helps and it will help me create more and more content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my work I have a few shops available:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pvppetsart.storenvy.com/\"\u003ehttp://pvppetsart.storenvy.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/pvppets?asc=u\"\u003ehttps://www.redbubble.com/people/pvppets?asc=u\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.teepublic.com/user/pvppets\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIf you want to stay connected with me I\u0027m on the majority of social media, don\u0027t be shy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pvppetsart/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/pvppetsart/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTwitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/pvppetsart\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/pvppetsart\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pvppetsart/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/pvppetsart/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: \u003ca href=\"https://pvppetsart.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttps://pvppetsart.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePinterest: \u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pvppetsart/\"\u003ehttps://www.pinterest.com/pvppetsart/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLifsvPcIqN56j31OrSYP_Q\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLifsvPcIqN56j31O...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitch: \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/pvppets\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/pvppets\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThank you for reading and I hope to see you around!\u003cbr\u003e"
