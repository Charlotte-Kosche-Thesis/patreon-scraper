And for over 3 years now, I\u0027ve been making self produced videos of my arrangements and uploading them to my YouTube channel. It is a huge passion of mine to see the soundtrack of my childhood transformed and brought to life by performing it on live instruments!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve poured a lot of my time and money into making my videos as great as they can be. However, recording and video equipment are expensive and I can only do so much on my own. I would love to take my videos to the next level with professional quality audio and video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is kind of like an ongoing Kickstarter, except instead of paying a large donation for a large one time project, your donation is split up over time to support an ongoing project. You could also think of it like a virtual tip jar, where you throw in $1 or $3 every time I upload a new performance video. Having a recurring donation will help a LOT even if it is small at first. Small expenses add up very quickly and having those things taken care of will help me save for the big upgrades like stereo mics or studio time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support what I am doing, you can become my Patron! All you need to do is click on the \"Become a Patron\" button above. Then select your pledge amount, select your reward tier (my thank you for your support!), and set your monthly limit. This is in case you are worried about going over a certain amount, in the event that I post more videos than expected in any given month. My plan is to post 1-2 videos per month, but occasionally there may be more or less. (Note: I will never be charging for vlogs or tutorial videos, only full music videos!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards? What do I get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank you for becoming my Patron, I have set up a list of thank-you rewards based on your support level. Just $1 gets you 24 hour early access to everything I release, exclusive behind the scenes updates, and an invitation to my private Discord server! More support will get you audio downloads and other exclusive content, the chance to vote on what I record next, access to behind-the-scenes vlogs, and more! If there is anything else you would like to see added as a reward, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust a reminder....\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content on YouTube will always be free, so nothing is changing! I am so grateful to you all just for watching my videos - I love what I do and I\u0027m going to keep doing it even if no one decides to donate. \u003cbr\u003eBut if you really love the work you see on my channel and would like to help me take it to the next level, I hope you will consider becoming my patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for stopping by and taking the time to read this - your continued support means so much to me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
