It started as a website with comically inaccurate essays on pop culture, then moved to Youtube where I stopped talking about a bunch of things I didn\u0027t understand and instead focused on one thing I understood very well: Animorphs, K.A. Applegate\u0027s hit young adult book series from the 1990s. If you know me from anything, you know me from the Opinionated Animorphs Book Guide, a six-year project of doing extensive video essays on all sixty-four Animorphs books, set to conclude this fall.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince starting the Animorphs Book Guide, I have branched into other projects and have opened the doors to requests*, resulting in video essays on movies, tv shows, video games, anime and manga, but about 70% of my focus in on talking about books. The Pop Arena continues to be a living, evolving entity, and who knows where it might go next.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQGz0X6DOUM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Animorphs Book Guide concluded in April of 2016, and I wasted no time in gettting to the next big thing: the Doctor Who Book Guide (aka Crossing the Wilderness). The focus of this new series to take an in-depth look at the Doctor Who books published between the show\u0027s original cancellation in 1989 and its revival in 2005, a time period fans have come to call the Wilderness Years. It was an interesting time for the franchise, a weird, experimental time, and with you help, we can explore that time together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEyi2aqGxck\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? What\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs much as I would love to keep The Pop Arena going, I do live in a world where having a roof over your head and food in your fridge requires a full-time job, and I don\u0027t have nearly enough time to do all the things I\u0027d like to do with this channel. By becoming a patron, you\u0027ll be an active part in improving the quality of these videos and allowing me to release more of them quicker. If this proves to be especially successful, I\u0027ll be able to branch out into a book-themed podcast and (somehow still book-themed) Let\u0027s Plays.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt just the $1 level, you get a special thank you at the end credits on my major video project (currently the Doctor Who Book Guide) and a link to your website, Youtube channel DeviantArt page or wherever you might call home on the internet. Effectively, you\u0027ll be allowed rotating advertisements on my most popular series. At the $5 level, you get to see videos a day early AND access to exclusive content, including audio commentaries on old videos and never-before-released footage. More rewards are in the works as we speak!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJVYjTMu8tk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA huge thank you to my patrons, my fans and everyone who watches my videos! I wouldn\u0027t be doing this if it wasn\u0027t for you guys!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n*At the moment, requested reviews remains a separate system from Patreon.
