    "summary": "Hi, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Preacher and I\u0027m a cabaret artist. I specialise in fire eating, sideshow, knife throwing, sword swallowing, and more. I hold several Guinness World Records for difficult stunts and have performed countless shows over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u2019ve worked with the likes of Alice Cooper, McFly and Lilly Savage to name but a few. \u003cbr\u003eI have broken many Guinness World Records as the fastest fire-eater, fire-breather and fire-staff spinner in the world. I\u0027ve also broken for balancing a running lawnmower on my chin for the longest time plus many other records like cutting apples from my face with a running chainsaw.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am dedicated to giving back to the community as much as I can. Several of my successful world record attempts were to raise money for charity. \u003cbr\u003eI also studied health and safety, passed my knowledge on to others to help keep them safe, and have taught and mentored many other talented performers, all gratis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, my aim is to progress and develop with ideas for new, never-seen-before fire stunts, and unique twists on the most dangerous sideshow stunts in the world. \u00a0I want to break some adventurous world records, and thrill audiences in person and online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo proceed, I require materials to build props, fuels to train with, and specialist fabric to make one-of-a-kind costumes. Some of the props include specialist throwing-knives that I can set on fire, a more precise compound bow, and a specific type of chainsaw which I can balance on my chin. For safety reasons I can\u0027t practice any of this in public - I need to rent a suitable rehearsal space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many world records I can break but haven\u0027t attempted yet because I simply have not been able to afford them. There is no financial reward for breaking a world record, and I have to provide all the equipment on the day, to Guinness\u0027s exact specifications. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I hope to attempt one world record a month, starting from March 1st 2016. All record attempts will be filmed, and all those who help me will be invited to witness the attempts. I will also upload photos and videos of my progress as I train.\u003cbr\u003eI also will work on a full-scale, \u201cOne-man\u201d show (with some very special guest performers) .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond this, I also:\u003cbr\u003e-  plan to help the performance community\u003cbr\u003e- will be allowing other performers use of the rehearsal space and tools\u003cbr\u003e- will be holding open days where performers can free practice under my supervision\u003cbr\u003e- will be uploading a variety of tutorial videos on how to make equipment and tips for performance etc as well as regular blog updates, videos and even live streaming of me at work,  so everyone can see where their money is going and how I am progressing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you can help me to make 2016 a game-changing new year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: MILESTONE GOALS ARE TOTALS, NOT PER MONTH! The goals detail what I need and why and how much each item costs.\u003cbr\u003e"
