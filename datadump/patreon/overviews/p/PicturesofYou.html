Every year, more and more time is spent crafting the comic and making it better, with sweat, aches, and profanity to prove it. By supporting us through Patreon, you can help make sure this story you love and follow page by page can keep going forward, getting deeper and deeper until it breaks your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the nature of the music at the heart of Pictures of You, think of me as the one on the corner playing guitar, and this Patreon is my hat on the ground. Throw in some coins, and I\u0027ll play you something special. We\u0027ll even take requests from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis platform will be an evolving process, we\u0027re still building, changing to suit the needs of we (me) the creator as well as those of the audience and patrons. Our patrons are supporting not only the creation of the comic, but the ability for everyone to be able to read it, and for that we want to give special thanks. More ways to say that thank you will be added as this Patreon goes forward, in hopes that you always feel like what you give comes back to you in some way.\u003cbr\u003e"
