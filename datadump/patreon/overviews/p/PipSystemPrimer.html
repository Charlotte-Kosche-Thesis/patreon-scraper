    "summary": "The Pip System is a genre-bending rules system perfect for any level of roleplaying experience. With the release of the \u003cem\u003ePip System Corebook\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThird Eye Games\u003c/strong\u003e is now going to be releasing brand new supporting material on a quarterly basis. Each publication will be a different theme, such as fantasy or spycraft, with supporting essays highlighting different aspects of that theme, a ready-to-play adventure, and supporting Extras for the adventure or to use in your own game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach quarterly e-zine will be combined into a year-end anthology that will be available in both PDF and print formats through \u003cstrong\u003eThird Eye Games\u003c/strong\u003e. This anthology will include everything published over the year and will be available for purchase outside of our Patreon. For future publications, after the first, we will also be putting calls out to artists and writers who want to contribute to the \u003cem\u003ePip System Primer\u003c/em\u003e. More information on that will be released in the next few weeks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThird Eye Games\u003c/strong\u003e has been around for almost a decade now, and has created a number of amazing worlds across several systems for new and old players alike to dive into and enjoy. Our latest is the Pip System, capable of taking any shape needed for just about any game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pip System Primer Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eNot only is Third Eye Games working on official setting books for the Pip System, such as the upcoming A Kid\u0027s Guide to Monster Hunting, we are reaching out to talented writers and creators to come up with even more material through the new Pip system Primer. We\u2019ve already seen so much great creativity in our Pip System G+ Community, and we want to start highlighting all the ways people are (and can) use the Pip System to make awesome games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach Primer will follow a theme, such as Spycraft or Fantasy, released roughly quarterly. Each will also include a minimum amount of material, composed of a combination of the following: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 or 2 Articles on the Theme\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew mechanics to add to your games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReady-to-Run Adventures\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePremade Characters\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eTo get a subscription to the Pip System Primer, just become a paton at the $2 level (which is a discount on what it will sell for outside of this Patreon). That\u2019s it! You will only be charged once a quarter when we publish the Pip System Primer. Our schedule for publication is currently February, May, August, November, but we\u2019re keeping it flexible (as long as it\u2019s released within the Quarter). If you want to gift a subscription, you can go to $3 pledge level, and get two copies (one for you and one for a friend). If you want to be more involved, at higher levels you can participate in Q\u0026amp;As that we\u2019ll be recording each quarter after the publication comes out. These will then be put up on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Can I Help?\u003c/h3\u003eBecoming a patron today and you\u2019ll get your copy of the Pip System Primer as soon as it\u2019s published each quarter!
