On top of this,\u00a0I have been interviewing top professional players such as Nick Slowiak, Scott Kemp, Raney Stanzcak, Kirill Prihidni \u0026amp; Archie Montemayor in live Q+A sessions giving players direct access to some of the worlds elite paintballers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis process, whilst it is something I enjoy and something I am passionate about, is more time consuming and involves more effort and planning than I ever anticipated. Due to this, I spend less time working on my local paintball field which is ultimately what pays the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m dedicating to keeping PBHQ free for viewers. If you can\u0027t pledge, or don\u0027t wish to pledge, that is OK. With sponsors, and personal pledges, we will continue to create interesting paintball content and cover events locally, nationally and internationally as well as continuing the popular interviews with PRO players. Pledges allow us to dedicate a reasonable amount of time to the show to ensure quality content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in an inclusive, positive paintball industry and want to see events grow via coverage and promotion of the game and the sport across Australia and would appreciate any support towards allowing us to continue to do that. For businesses, please let us be clear that we will continue to cover ALL events and companies in one way or another. Those who pledge and support the show will simply be guaranteed additional coverage.\u003cbr\u003e"
