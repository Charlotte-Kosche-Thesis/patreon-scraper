I have also been streaming on \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/petesgameroom\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch.tv\u003c/a\u003e for just as long (dating back to when it was known as Justin.tv!). I am currently on a temporary hiatus from making YouTube videos while I pursue streaming on Twitch full-time. By supporting me on Patreon you help me to continue streaming on Twitch 5-6 days a week, and also contribute toward funding the purchase of new games for me to stream for your entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitch Subs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are currently a subscriber to my Twitch page (thanks!) you will still enjoy the exclusive benefits of the emotes as well as my sincere gratitude. Patreon is simply an extra way to show your support for my stream but also get something back in return based on the current donation incentives I offer. I prefer that you subscribe to me on Twitch before pledging on Patreon, if you can only consider one or the other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
