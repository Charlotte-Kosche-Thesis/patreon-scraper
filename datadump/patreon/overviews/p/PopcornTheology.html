What is the film trying to say about life, meaning, the world? What can we as Christians take away from the story, for better or worse? How can we use our diet of media to start engaging conversations with our unbelieving friends and family?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe get to answer those sorts of questions regularly, and we\u0027ve had the honor of being joined by some amazing guests over the last two years too! RC Sproul Jr, James Harleman, Brian Godawa, Dr. Jason Lisle, Joe Thorn, and others!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027ll consider supporting our little podcast. We are doing this as a hobby (one that we care a lot about!), and this hobby does cost some money. We would also love to be able to stash some funds away for the purpose of future promotions, being able to see new movies more regularly, and upgrading equipment for a better quality show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you that opt to support us in this way, we are super grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
