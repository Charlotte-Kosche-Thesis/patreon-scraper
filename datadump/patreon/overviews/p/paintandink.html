I\nlive in a world of imagination and color, adventure and story.\u00a0I have been\nmaking maps and art with dip pens, India ink and watercolor for a decade now, exploring\nlands both real and imaginary and sending my maps and other artwork off on incredible journeys around the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img1.etsystatic.com/051/0/5128284/il_570xN.680813485_rwcu.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nI see art and story as intertwined, both vital to a full human experience, and\nI use them both to make sense of the world and life, and to do my part to make\nthe world a bit more vibrant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img0.etsystatic.com/000/0/5128284/il_570xN.122276584.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eI have so many ideas for maps to come: I want to tell stories with the maps, and hide clues all around them. I want to work poems into the maps themselves. I want to improve my drawing skills to a level that allows me to fully include all the elements I dream of, from sea gods and goddesses to realistic aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna. I want to incorporate myths and legends and whispered tales, both old and new. I want my maps to take viewers on extraordinary adventures without even demanding that they get out of their chairs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img0.etsystatic.com/000/0/5128284/il_570xN.122256960.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut now that I have two young high-needs sons, the first born just as my art career was picking up, time in the studio has become\nnearly nonexistent. We have chosen to homeschool them, to give them the structured\nfreedom to learn in their own way and discover their own paths, and as we wrap\nup the first year, I can tell you that it is working! But they are still too\nyoung to leave unsupervised, and they will be for several years to come. Thus they are with me almost all the time, and my\nhusband\u2019s intense schedule means in order to spend any significant time in the studio, I must hire a sitter. My foremost goal with Patreon is to raise the funds to\nspend more time in the studio, so I can both explore new paths and continue my\ncurrent adventures in art while still giving my sons the freedom and joy of a\nchild-led education. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img1.etsystatic.com/055/0/5128284/il_570xN.690743477_5s2e.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nI have worked out the rewards levels so that I can underpromise and overdeliver; my plan\nis to add on more tiers and more rewards at each tier as time goes on.
