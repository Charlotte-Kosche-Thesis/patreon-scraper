    "summary": "Hello there!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jaimee Lee, I\u0027m the artist behind Paintings For Hummingbirds. \u003cbr\u003eJust\u00a0a little miniaturist trying to make it in this big crazy world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is my passion, and like most anything else in life, it\u0027s meaningless if you can\u0027t share it with others.\u00a0I\u0027m so grateful to be alive in this fresh age of instant social sharing. To be living in a world that put my art in front of you, which led you to being here, reading this. Hi. Thanks for being here! Thanks for seeing me, dreaming with me and supporting my soul\u0027s work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this place. If you\u0027re enjoying the fruits of my labor, my instagram, facebook, website, whatever, and want to be a part of it all, this is the place to jump in. All of the energy and support given to me becomes the life force of each tiny painting. Whether it\u0027s\u00a0words of encouragement and appreciation, stories shared sparked by little watercolor portals or some dollars sent my way, these are the many tiny but mighty experiences that keep me picking up my paintbrushes. If you want to peak down that rabbit hole... these paintings are born of the deepest part of you that\u0027s behind each of these encounters. Your joy, your magic, your pure open-hearted, giving/receiving, gleeful best self is the essence that carries through the paint into the tiny faces and places that are Paintings For Hummingbirds.\u00a0Your\u00a0grace is reflected back to you through this work. It\u0027s a source connection and it\u0027s made of all of us.\u00a0No wonder you like them, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I\u0027m just saying thanks and I love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, If you want to feed these little guys a dollar or two each month, this is the place to do it.\u003cbr\u003eOR if you feel so inclined, you can tap into a higher tier with your pledge and treat this page like a monthly treasure delivery system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe true value of your contribution is difficult to fully express.\u00a0Dollars are a\u00a0currency of energetic exchange. Your patronage allows us to be\u00a0spiritually collaborative and connected in a powerful way. You and my art fuel each other; I\u0027m just caught up in the middle feeling nothing but gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate you all\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being you \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eJaimee\u003cbr\u003e"
