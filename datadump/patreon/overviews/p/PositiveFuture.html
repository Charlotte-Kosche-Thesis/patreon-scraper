I educate locals, and travel teaching workshops on Mushrooms, Spirulina, Insects, Information Technology and Permaculture. I run a micro/molecular biology lab out of my home, and experiment with applicable models for food, medicine, and energy production. Help me to continue developing models to replace our current systems with Ecologically Regenerative systems! Your support will go to better YouTube videos, Educational DVDs, Publishing handbooks, Upgrades to my systems, and helping me travel to get great content around our Beautiful Planet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
