I came to Earth for... reasons but ended up creating mods for video games in my spare time and I must say... it\u0027s way more fun than poking the local fauna with probes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou most likely know me from projects such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=790903721\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Asari Civilisation\u003c/a\u003e (Stellaris) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24222/?\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVampiric Thirst\u003c/a\u003e (Skyrim) and more. I have been creating and maintaining mods since early 2012, both as personal projects and as part of larger development teams.\u003cbr\u003eIn the future I\u0027m hoping to create more and even higher quality mods. To that end I\u0027m learning coding, game design theory, texturing and modelling in my free time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron, you would allow me to dedicate more time and money to modding, purchase better tools, afford games and DLC more frequently, and in the long term, hire help and maybe even consider doing this for a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOWEVER, before you pledge anything, I want to make it absolutely clear that \u003cstrong\u003ethis Patreon exists to support me, not pay for the content I create\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eNONE of my mods, or any of their components, will EVER be locked behind a paywall, I will NEVER ask any money to add features, create assets or release mods at all.
