Firstly, Peacock will not only be a plugin (.gha) for Grasshopper and Rhinoceros, it will also be a generative jewelry framework (a code library written in C#), where advanced designers will be able to use all of Peacock\u0027s functionality from code, to go even further in design and creation of new tools. I think I\u0027ll be one of the first to liberalize all the basics of jewelry software, at least in the Rhinoceros environment. I will encourage all developers to participate in this project so that it really is a collaborative project. And I aspire to make Peacock the frame of reference for advanced modeling of jewelry, make it popular enough to introduce the new aesthetic standards in the market,\u00a0facilitate the adaptation of the jewelry sector to a new era, and\u00a0be able to live doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I need to move the current version to Visual Studio to build the library and create an SDK (Software Development Kit) of the current state, upload it to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/DanielAbalde\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and wait for response from the dev community.\u00a0Whatever it is, I will continue to work on any of the many pending tasks, which include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrepare \u003cstrong\u003ebasic-intermediate-advanced learning content\u003c/strong\u003e for my Patreons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImprove components and \u003cstrong\u003eincrease the collection of jewellry tools\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eGems settings, bevels, cutters, claws...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvanced tools for paves\u003c/strong\u003e, the holy grail.
