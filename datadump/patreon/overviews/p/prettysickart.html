    "summary": "All of my work comes from a very personal place.  As a queer disabled\u0003woman, I\u2019m affected a lot by the lack of representation of people\u0003with disabilities and illnesses in media and art, but I\u2019m also profoundly\u0003affected by the current political climate in the USA.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile my past projects (\u003cem\u003ePassion\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ePrettySickArt\u003c/em\u003e) are not *over*, \u0003my current pet project is \u201cNEVERTHELESS.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the election in November, I\u2019ve struggled a lot with how I can\u0003express my own resistance to this increasingly hostile atmosphere. Because of my pain and mobility issues, I can\u2019t march or protest- even\u0003though I really want to.  My anxiety makes calling senators and representatives\u0003(if I had any that cared... I don\u2019t- thanks Texas) pretty much impossible.\u0003\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then Elizabeth Warren stood up against the appointment of Jeff Sessions.\u003cbr\u003eShe began to read a (pertinent) letter by Coretta Scott King protesting his initial\u0003 appointment to state A.G. decades earlier. For her efforts- she was essentially told to sit down and shut up.  And, although I hate to give that hateful, hypocritical old coot credit for anything positive- Mitch Moconnel\u2019s\u0003words about shutting down Warren struck a chord for me (and for so many others obviously).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy new series, \u201cNEVERTHELESS\u201d plays on his words, \u201cShe was warned.  She was given an\u0003 explanation, nevertheless- she persisted.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese pieces will feature women (both current and throughout history) who have refused to\u0003give up, refused to shut up, refused to sit down or surrender.  Activists, Athletes, Musicians,\u0003 DAPL Protestors, Political Figures, Scientists, Trans and Women\u2019s Rights Champions, \u0003Civil Rights Heroes.  Women of all creeds and colors and religions and sizes and abilities.\u003cbr\u003eAll those who were warned- but persisted anyway.  \u003cbr\u003eThis is my resistance.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately I\u2019ll be offering each portrait as a stand-alone poster- you can get your favorite\u0003as a one-off, or wait for completed collections to be gathered into a single larger poster piece.\u0003Stickers, mugs, and more will be offered eventually as well.\u003cbr\u003eNew goals have been added to reflect available rewards featuring the NEVERTHELESS\u0003 project subjects.  I\u2019m sure I will occasionally be peppering in other work from both the \u003cem\u003ePSA\u003c/em\u003e\u0003 and \u003cem\u003ePassion\u003c/em\u003e projects (currently both on hiatus, but not over!), but for now- my focus is here.  \u003cbr\u003eOn my own small act of resistance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery so often I\u2019ll offer a new portrait up for non-subscribers to see too, but most of this project\u0003will be visible only to patrons- until I\u2019m ready to release the first \u201cset\u201d of portraits as a single combined poster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, patron support keeps me creating and (hopefully) gets me closer to some much needed mobility assistance. But eventually I\u2019ll be using funds to create and offer high-quality stickers,\u0003and possibly a book with all of the portraits and blurbs about each woman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I ever get to a point where I am bringing in $100 or more through this project in a month, I\u0027ll be able to begin donating some of those proceeds back to places like the ACLU. \u00a0My ultimate goal would be to be donating 50% of what this project brings in back to relevant charities. \u00a0For now, I\u0027ll just keep creating, because that\u0027s the only way I can contribute. \u00a0To continue trying to inspire the way these women have inspired me."

During treatment for Cancer in 2012, she acquired a chronic and debilitating pain condition  which she endures to this day.  In the 4 years since beating Cancer, she\u2019s become passionate about creating art that more fully represents those with chronic illnesses, pain, and disabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 Semester away from completing her Associates in Digital Media Design, she works as a freelance designer, and with most of her time (when not bed-bound by pain) she creates illustrations of individuals who a wide variety of chronic conditions and disabilities- showcasing both individuals and the equipment and devices that aid and assist them.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to various side projects and commissions, she has 2 ongoing series projects:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://prettysickart.tumblr.com/tagged/gallery\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrettySickArt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/prettysickart/collections/519868-passion\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePassion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.  The first is a submission-based online art project wherein persons with disabilities and chronic conditions submit photos of themselves to be illustrated, and the second is a project which features illustrations of amputees (with or without prosthetics) in sports and the arts, places where these people are not usually seen or expected to excel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, SarahCate\u2019s goal is to give visibility to all individuals who are often rendered invisible by their health conditions, pain and/or disabilities.  To fill some of the gap within the world of art (digital or otherwise) with their beauty, strength, and perseverance.\u003cbr\u003e",
