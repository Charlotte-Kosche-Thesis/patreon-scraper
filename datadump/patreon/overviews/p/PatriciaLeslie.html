    "summary": "Well now, I\u0027m just starting work on a new vegan cookbook, aiming for a 2019 release. Title is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eHELL WITH NOUVELLE: Unfussy Vegan Cookery\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI went veg in 1974, vegan in 1998-99. So I\u0027m long past needing to be convinced or coaxed by elaborate, exotic, \"exciting and unique\" efforts at vegan cuisine. I never have viewed these significant life-decisions as being about \"giving up\" anything. I see them as being about \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eacquiring \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003epeace of mind and lightness of spirit. All I really need or want my vegan food to BE is - first and foremost - in keeping with my \u003cem\u003eahimsa \u003c/em\u003eethos and my love of animals ... beyond that, it just needs to be tasty, nutritious, convenient, free of chemicals, and most of the time, last for more than one meal or one dessert. I really \u003cem\u003enever \u003c/em\u003ehave time to arrange an avant-garde plate of fiddly, pompous food, or run to \nthe store for two tablespoons of capers and three shallots. I suspect there are lots of other vegans around, who are on the same page with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now, having just wrapped up an almost-year of posting my satirical Steampunk adventures here (which of course have all vegan or veg protagonists), there will be a shift of \u003cem\u003efocus\u003c/em\u003e, although not a shift of the author\u0027s character, values, or (I think) voice. \"Irreverent\" is probably a good adjective for me; or to use more words, \"finds it hard to treat cultural icons with reverence\". Hence, the title of the forthcoming cookbook. \"Opinionated\" is undoubtedly another adjective that has been applied from time to time. As I settle into the new rhythm here, it seems quite probable that within a month or two (maybe sooner) I\u0027ll also start blogging on topics of vegan-adjacent interest. It could be sooner. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut mainly - now that posting of the Steampunk adventures is at an end here - I\u0027ll be \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eposting recipes on \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eWed\u0027s and Sun\u0027s\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, to start! All will be from a list of ones that I\u0027m considering for my 2019 cookbook. Feedback will be much appreciated! All the recipes will be PUBLIC, because what I want most, is for more people to cook and eat and share more vegan meals. There are, of course, additional benefits available, for those who decide to support this creative journey. Subscribe for a buck a month, and get your name on the book\u0027s \"Member of\n the Test Kitchen\" acknowledgement page! Make it $3, and have a recipe \nnamed for you or a loved one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost important ... thank you for stopping by, and even if you only add one or two tasty, reliable items to your \"life list of cookery\", I\u0027ll feel that my work here is done! But I\u0027ll bet you end up \"loyal\" to a lot more of my recipes! Post me a comment about a recipe you\u0027ve tried, and I\u0027ll comment back! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. If you like my \"taste in tastes\", you may well also discover you also enjoy my taste in written entertainment! Everything I write comes from my own sensibility - all my sympathetic characters are veg or vegan, no-one attends barbarian feasts with giant animals being roasted, and no-one goes out \"shooting for a day\" (my only real problem with Jane Austen\u0027s beautiful storytelling).

She has had an eclectic life, which has included Scottish dance, directing theatre, a degree in anthropology, a very long marriage (ongoing), and quite a few dogs (current one named Ursula). She has always done writing of some kind, but in May 2009, she started the first novel of her speculative-fantasy series, \u003cem\u003eThe Elfin Scots\u003c/em\u003e (formerly, \u003cem\u003eThe Randolph Family Saga\u003c/em\u003e; 4 novels \u0026amp; a novelette, to date). At present she\u0027s having a great deal of fun with the new Victorian Science Fiction series about Valedictoria Scott and her adventures in an \"alternatopian\" 19th Century (neither utopian nor dystopian - just alternate!). She also writes and publishes short stories, peculiar humor, parody song lyrics, occasional poetry ... and irregularly, blogs on \u003ca href=\"http://carterhaughbooks.tumblr.com\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e.

Since then, I\u0027ve published the first four novels in one speculative-fiction series, a collection of short fiction, a humour book, and two collections of alternate song lyrics and parodies. In Summer 2018, I\u0027ll be bringing out my satirical \"Victorian era science fiction\" novel (a compilation of 3 linked novellas, plus a variety of supplemental \"cultural context\" stuff). Now, I\u0027m coming \"full circle\" with a \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enew\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e vegan cookbook.
