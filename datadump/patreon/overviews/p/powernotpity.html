    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHey everyone! I\u0027m Bri M, and I\u0027m new to the podcasting world. I started this whole thing because I longed for media about disabled people of color. Where were the stories of the Black disabled little queer who\u0027s figuring things out? Where were the stories of the Latinx disabled elderly woman who wants to leave her nursing home? There is a dire lack of media created about disabled people of color and that creates a disconnect from the fantastic world of the disabled.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWon\u0027t you consider becoming a patron of a disabled person who lives below the poverty line? Your subscriptions would go towards, paying for conferences, and paying for equipment and website maintenance, paying my medical bills, and my overall health and well-being.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePOWER NOT PITY amplifies the voices of the disabled people of color community everywhere! Through candid interviews, analysis and commentary, I hope to open a door to the world of disability justice. I also hope to engage with more disabled people of color on a genuine level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I love about podcasting is the immediacy of it. People will always connect storytelling because of the tradition that it taps into. \u003cstrong\u003eStorytelling is as old as the beginning of time and it will go on until the end of time\u003c/strong\u003e. I believe that my experiences can change the narratives and tropes around what a disabled life looks like. I intend to keep sharing my story through podcasting and the stories of others like me who are underrepresented because we deserve to be heard and seen as fully human. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf any of this resonated with you, or if you love the show, please consider become a patron of this project.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading,\u003cbr\u003eBri\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Ze started zir radio adventures ten years ago while in college. Over time, ze hosted three radio shows and loved every minute of it. When ze left college, ze stayed in the world of entertainment: bustin\u0027 ass at music venues, working with record labels, and collaborating with cultural workers such as Climbing Poetree. When ze was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis three and a half years ago, things got worse before they got better. Most recently, ze presented a Disability Justice workshop at the Willie Mae Rock Camp for Girls. Now, Bri wants to amplify the voices of disabled people through the stories and perspectives of those ze interviews.",
