     "about": "I have been a Taoist my entire life. As a child, I spent most of my time wandering rivers and forests just exploring nature. I spent countless moments wandering up and down rivers and learning what it was to flow with life and nature. In this, I consider nature itself to be my first true teacher in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter finishing several official degrees so I could pretend to fit in society, I went off in my disguise to discover what it meant to be in the mainstream culture. I ended up working at first as an engineer building things out of Teflon. Then for a few years, I built paper airplanes and real airplanes. Every three years I would just switch around to something new to experience. At some point, I began computer programming and chasing logic patterns. I spent time exploring the Internet and building Drug and Alcohol treatment systems for purposes of helping people recover and get aid. Later on, I even spent a year or so writing a few very boring XML and programming books. However, I did manage to slip poetry into those programming books. So officially, I am also a published poet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwenty years ago I decided the main-stream culture was indeed crazy from my perspective, but it wasn\u2019t a fun crazy. People seemed to have a bad habit of stressing out and concentrating on not enjoying their life.  I decided to focus on teaching kindness and see what I could do to lighten things up a bit. I mixed my Taoist background with my work experiences and used it all to create materials that help people live better. A Personal Tao grew out of this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I am today, slowly building a Taoist Temple, helping others find a modest, graceful lifestyle, teaching spiritual practices and over time polishing A Personal Tao to help others\u003cbr\u003e",
