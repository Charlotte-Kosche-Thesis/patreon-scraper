Well, my channel grew a lot faster than I was expecting. I feel like I\u0027ve discovered my passion, and I want to make this youtube gig a full time thing. I want to improve and expand this channel. With your help, I think we have the potential to grow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re living in a new age of media, an age where stories are told through interactivity and immersion; an age where the old rules of board rooms and focus groups no longer apply; an age where small creators, critics, and analysts are more relevant than ever before, and since I\u0027ve gotten into youtube, my appreciation and passion for this new age has only increased.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also found an incredible audience that likes this stuff, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this channel to be a community, a forum for all things fun and nerdy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example of the sort of stuff I like to talk about.

Don\u0027t worry, you can set a limit on how much you donate each month, so if I decide to make a hundred videos in 4 weeks, you don\u0027t need to worry about overspending!

For those who don\u0027t know, this is the software I\u0027ve been using to record my videos. It\u0027s a very flawed, glitchy program that crashes literally dozens of times whenever I try to make a video, slowing me down considerably.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also has a tendency to erase all of my work, forcing me to start back at square one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest hurdle for this channel right now is my current editing software. If we can fix this, then I can produce better quality content at a much faster pace!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know very little about editing software, but as of now I\u0027m looking at Cyberlink Power Director 14 (http://amzn.to/1mwyRnT). If you guys know a better software out there, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhichever software I end up going with, it\u0027s going to need the following features:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Built in screen recording that includes game-recording (movavi wont let you record games unless you trick the software)\u003cbr\u003e-Multi-track editing for video and audio\u003cbr\u003e-Simple editing tools and effects\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can produce better videos faster, turning this channel into a powerhouse of content!\u003cbr\u003e",
