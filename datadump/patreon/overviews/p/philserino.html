I know it\u0027s cliche to say, but in all honesty, I actually \u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e music. The best way for me to describe it is like a relationship. You see, there are people who simply \"like\" music, meaning they like the idea of it, and will go after it for a time, but won\u0027t actually take it seriously. Love, however, is more than a feeling, it\u0027s a commitment. Something you sort of \"give your all\" to. It feels as though the one person in this world that knows me most, besides my wife, happens to be music. And when I give my all to it, not only does it brings out the best of me, but I also experience the best of it. So this is why I love music. And yes, I am very aware of how weird this may sound. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eThere are a few different routes to go with music - creating, performing, producing, etc. But for me, \u003cstrong\u003ecreating music\u003c/strong\u003e is the most fulfilling.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat I\u00a0Do [with music]\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eThis is my process of creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: initial;\"\u003eConceptualization\u003c/b\u003e\u00a0I listen, I muse, I discover, I explore, I get lost, then I capture and record what I hear, what I see.

NOT. In fact, my boss is trying to do everything he can to get out of his label. Signing to a label is signing up to losing your freedom and becoming someone else\u0027s slave.

Music has a way of bringing peace, of acting as the mediator and bringing people together. It has the ability to make people smarter and to create things unimaginable. Think of all the natural causes in the world today, the effects of mankind on the earth with global warming, manufacturing, poverty, and so much more. Music has the ability to return a gentle heart inside of someone, who in turn has the power to make a difference. It causes people to rise up. It keeps us in tune with the movement of heaven. Music keeps us moving forward instead of falling back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will do everything I can as a musician and artist to keep the world alive and functioning properly.
