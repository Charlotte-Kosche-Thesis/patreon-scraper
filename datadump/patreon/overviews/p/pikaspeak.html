We\u0027re gleefully printing the first issue of Pika\u0027s Peak so we can bring it to the con! We\u0027re also printing postcards, posters, magnets, and other cool stuff to promote the comic \u2013\u00a0and you can get your hands on any or all of that in our rewards tiers. The more support we can get here, the more we\u0027ll be able to print, and the more we\u0027ll be able to maximize our time at SPX. We\u0027d like to get Pika\u0027s Peak to as many readers and publishers as we can.

By all reasonable standards, this should be a train wreck in the making, but instead it\u0027s a grand melding of styles and voices. Akire and Patch bounce story ideas off each other by phone and email to build the overall shape of the story, and trade off scenes, with Patch doing a few pages, Akire doing the next few, Patch doing a few more, and so on. Through this game of narrative hot potato, a story is born and a world created. Here on Patreon, you get to be a part of that creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
