    "summary": "Hi everyone and welcome to my page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing and painting since i can remember... And I finally understood that this is what i want to become the fundamental purpose in my life! I\u0027m a pretty eclectic person: I attended music, fashion and art schools and am still attending a luthiers\u0027 school; I not only love to draw and paint, but I also love music, woodworking, tattoos, sports, any kind of art and craft that you can imagine! There is an italian motto that goes: \"Impara l\u0027arte e mettila da parte\" which means \"learn the skill and stow it away\"... That motto totally reflects my way of life! Though I\u0027ve changed it in \"learn the skill and turn it upside down\" \u003cimg height=\"16\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v6/f9f/1/16/1f61b.png\" style=\"\" width=\"16\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project for the future (after finishing the luthiers\u0027 school) is to become a freelancer, mostly working on illustrations and calligraphy but always keeping in practice music, luthiery and woodworking...\nWhat I want to do regarding music, as soon as I learn to record music and edit videos (technology isn\u0027t one of my strong suits), is to make multitrack videos of me playing and singing my favorite songs, like a sort of \"one girl band\".\nAnother thing I\u0027ll do as soon as I earn enough money is to buy tattooing equipment and attend a tattooing course! I especially like hand poked tattoos...\nTherefore, if everything goes as it should, don\u0027t be surprised if you see me making an insane amount of different things everyday! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve just began taking things seriously, which is doing what I really love and what I\u0027m really good at, to make a living from it... this means that I\u0027m not a professional and I don\u0027t earn a significant amount of money yet. This is why I decided to come and try out Patreon! I\u0027m a perfectionist and I always strive to to do things as best as I can, so it is essential to me to use high quality materials and tools, attend courses and workshops and travel to spread my work all around the world. For this purpose, any help will always be wholeheartedly welcome!\nOf course a bit of money will also help me to pay rent, buy food...briefly... to survive! \u003cimg height=\"16\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v6/f9f/1/16/1f61b.png\" style=\"\" width=\"16\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you are thinking of supporting me, let me explain how Patreon works:\nthe minimum you can pledge is 1$, so, not much expensive! If you become a Patron you\u0027ll have access to my Patron-only feed and i\u0027ll give you special rewards, depending on how much you pledged! Money will be deducted from your card or paypal account at every beginning of the month... It\u0027s easy as it can be! :)\u003cbr\u003eYou can also cancel your patronage at any time if you change your mind!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I think I told you everything you ought to know, so...
