Together they comprise half of Puig Destroyer, 40 percent of Less Art, and 100 percent of Productive Outs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProductive Outs started as a twitter account. It turns out that most heavy music fans don\u0027t care about baseball! So rather than continue to bum out their personal twitter audiences, they started @ProductiveOuts as an outlet for their baseball nonsense. That evolved into the PRODcast, which has lasted more than 100 episodes, and spawned the aforementioned Puig Destroyer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey post new episodes about once a week, during which time they talk about baseball, music, and other shenanigans. Each episode also features a musical \"guest\" that either Riley or Ian feels deserves more exposure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far!",
