It aims to be an inclusive place to get news about America but at the same time offer a platform for people to discuss American culture (or anything) intelligently and respectfully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the creator I clearly have a passion for the United States, I studied American Studies as my undergraduate degree and plan on going on to do a PhD in the field. The reason I have joined Patreon is to offset some of the costs of hosting the website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank anyone that helps support this cause, no amount is too small to receive my full gratitude!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to point out that I want to foster a positive atmosphere for other artists/writers/creators who enjoy the American Studies field and am happy to consider the publication of any work. I would love for this website to grow so that people such as myself can express themselves in a safe and enjoyable environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again."
