    "summary": "I am Palaverous, a writer in the Adult Erotic Fiction\ncommunity specializing in text parser adventure games with erotic content. In\nshort, interactive text-based titles that use written commands to explore, talk\nwith other character, manipulate the environment and, of course, have sex. After many years of lurking the scene, playing\njust about anything that was released and pawing awkwardly at the various\nauthoring systems while nursing some project ideas, I finally buckled down and\nwrote something myself. And so in March 2015 I finally released The Lost Hound,\na sword-and-sorcery fantasy adventure game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs my handle might suggest, my work leans heavily on the\nlengthy and wordy side. I feel context and build-up are a vital aspect of\nfiction, erotic or otherwise, and so I tend to focus on fleshing out the\nsetting and personality of the characters in my games, trying to make them feel\nas real people rather than NPCs who merely exist to fulfil a role. That does\nnot mean that every character must be strictly realistic or down-to-earth as\nfar as I\u2019m concerned, but rather that if I present an outrageous situation or\npersonality I should make them believable within the setting presented.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the time being, most of my projects are tied\nconceptually into the setting stablished in The Lost Hound, a medieval-ish\nfantasy world, though I do have some ideas in the backburner of games set in\nthe real world. When and if I get around to them.\u003cbr\u003e\nThough in the past I felt resistant to use 3D modelling\nprograms, preferring instead to keep the games entirely text-based, I\u2019ve been\ntrying my hand at a particular poser and produced results that I\u2019m rather\nsatisfied with, so I am currently experimenting with graphics for my upcoming title.\nWhether this works out or not will decide if I continue using them from here\non.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll my games will ultimately be released for free as is the\ntradition within the AIF community, so there is scant little I can offer as an\nincentive to donors beyond my deep and unbending gratitude and some early\naccess privileges. Regardless, I would be sincerely thankful if you could\ncontribute even just a single dollar a month to help facilitate the work on\nthese projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Games\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll download links contain both standalone executables and\nthe standard TADS .t3 executable files. See Readme for more details. If you\u0027re wondering why the links have been run through Google\u0027s URL shortener, it\u0027s because Dropbox does not let me easily track the number of downloads, which is a metric I\u0027m understandably interested in. Same reason these files are not hosted on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Lost Hound\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first title released in March 2015.

Not quite a full sequel, but featuring an entirely new location, many\nnew characters, the inclusion of threesomes and a somewhat quicker progression\ninto the naughty bits. Not entirely incomprehensible if you haven\u2019t played The\nLost Hound first, but yes, there will be quite a lot of lost context.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDownload link: \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/NZRjmf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Aftermath V.1.05\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Aftermath \u2013 Interlude I \u0026amp; II\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTwo individual sex scenes released as standalones taking\nplace, respectively, one year and a deliberately vague number of years after The\nAftermath. They contain twist scenes that I wanted to include in the original\ntitle but could not really fit on the narrative flow, yet also did not merit\nbeing games of their own.
