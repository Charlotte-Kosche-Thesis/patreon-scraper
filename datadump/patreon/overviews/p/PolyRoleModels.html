    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Kevin and I curate Poly Role Models as a free resource for polyamorous people looking for direction and representation. This means that I\u0027m not trying to change any minds. But if you\u0027re wondering whether ethical non-monogamy is for someone like you, however you identify, I want you to find validation here. \u00a0If you\u0027re scared that a mishap means that you\u0027re doing it all wrong, I want you to gain perspective from that experience through my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I mean to keep Poly Role Models as a free resource, your support would mean a lot to me and the polyactivism I serve. Away from the blog, I work as a tech contractor. This Patreon would serve to bridge the gap between managing this in my free time and flirting with the idea of going full time. It would free up some space for me to expand the scope of the blog as well. Also, similarly important, it would keep me from going dead broke when I\u0027m in between contracts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this, I want to publish a minimum of five pieces of new content per month. These posts include Poly Role Model profiles, Cautionary Poly: Teachable Moments in Polyamorous Relationships, Poly Origin Stories, and original content posts of 750 words or more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as Patreon Rewards, I\u0027m open for suggestions! My work is always about speaking your truth and collaborating for better experiences. So, tell me what you\u0027d want to see. A behind the scenes look at my process? Advice? Online meetups? Let me know what you\u0027d find value in. I\u0027m all ears.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
