I play the didgeridoo. Together, the didges and I tell all kinds of stories from beats of the urban streets to tales of the modern day forest-dwelling shaman to lyrical songs of the cosmic divine. I love hanging out on a variety of worlds and letting that inspire the music I make. The result is a mix of rhythm, voice, composition and power that is sometimes soft and sweet, sometimes loud and crazy and sometimes tinged with a sense of humor. Playing didgeridoo isn\u0027t the only thing I do though. I also play keyboard, sing and have a passion for sound synthesis. I love blending all of these worlds together and creating love fueled, organic trance music to share with listeners and music lovers as well as producing music for video projects, meditation readings and, of course, albums!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summer of 2014, I took a leap of faith, resigned my position as a piano instructor and moved from Seattle to Oregon. It has been a crazy, exhilarating and positively thrilling adventure to make a living as a creative entrepreneur sharing my passion through being a full-time performer and recording artist, a busker (street performer), presenter, instrument maker and a private music instructor teaching didgeridoo, piano and singing. I\u0027ve made several albums, taught many workshops, performed internationally, won a few awards here and there and have loved every moment of what I\u0027m doing even if when the going gets a bit rough. If I happen to inspire others by what I\u0027m doing, then all the better!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking and playing music has always been a vital part of my life ever since I can remember. It\u0027s been my comforter, my inspiration and my healer. I am living my passion but it\u0027s not without help. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here on Patreon. The music I make takes time to rehearse, record, edit and push out to the web or onto a CD. I also spend a fair bit of time maintaining\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pamelamortensen.net\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, building my music fan base, developing recording and performance projects and workshops, making videos for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/didgegirl6\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, building marketing campaigns, connecting and corresponding with people and much, much more. It\u0027s a lot of hats to wear and I couldn\u0027t do it without support. That\u0027s where you can come in as a Patreon supporter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you sign up,\u00a0you can set the amount of your contribution to fit your budget and you can opt out any time. The rewards you get in return are music downloads, inspiring videos, monthly tutorials on making music and posts and articles on creativity and inspiration all for five bucks a month. You also get my undying gratitude for making the leap of faith to help out. The contributions I receive help to support all I\u0027ve mentioned above, plus help out on some future projects that all goes back to helping to foster a planet of happy humans!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you consider becoming a supporter.

It\u0027s been an instrument of personal evolution for me in ways that that is very different from playing keyboard. At the moment, I am self employed as an independent musician after a lifetime of working others. I\u0027m at an age when most people are in full swing of a career working 9-5 but I\u0027ve done that already. So now I\u0027m pursuing my passion for making music as well as traveling, discovering new places and spaces and kicking back and enjoying a cuppa great tea.",

So I\u0027m arriving at a plan to manifest a place where I can live and work out of the same space. I have a chance to live with other artists and instrument makers out on the Oregon Coast and it would be an opportunity to become part of a community where I can learn, give, share and participate. Between Facebook, my email list and other social media, I have a ton of people that love what I do (at least I hope you love what i do). If each one of pitched in a dollar a month, we can do this thing. The type of space I have in mind would allow me to consistently produce more music for meditation, yoga, dance and just plain fun listening, make even better quality didgeridoos and maybe even to hold didgeridoo and music workshops. This are just the beginning of my vision. I also envision making music that can be placed in films, video games and other media. There\u0027s no limit really so I\u0027ve got my sleeves rolled up and working on this. As a thank you, we can have a victory party together whether in person or online. Doesn\u0027t matter where you are, we\u0027ll figure it out and make it happen! \u00a0Are you in? :-)",
