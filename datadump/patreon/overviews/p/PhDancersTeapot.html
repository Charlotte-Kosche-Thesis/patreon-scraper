If you\u0027d like to have story time for adults on a regular basis (where I will read you new short stories I have written, suited to relaxation with a cup of tea), listen to poetry, or have your say on illustrations, photography and little films, among other general creative outputs, you\u0027re in the right place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://phdancer.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/teacat.png\" style=\"width: 259px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://phdancer.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/teablind2.png\" style=\"width: 247px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to create stories for people to lose themselves in, poetry to relax to, and illustrations and photos that bring it all to life.\u00a0 I\u0027m also starting to work on some arts journalism, reviewing creative outputs made by others and making little films about local creatives and their work. However, I have a day job that is more than a day job, and I don\u0027t have the best art and writing resources, or the capacity to start self-publishing. To improve those things, I need a way to earn some money back from my creative work. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do Patrons get from me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron of my work, you\u0027ll get access to the inside scope on how I go about making these things via the exclusive patron-only feed, including drafts and character notes, I\u0027ll consult you for topics and characters you\u0027d like to see written about, and I might even put YOU in a story. If you have ideas for other things I could do to reward you for your patronage, please suggest them to me and I will see what I can do! A huge thank you to those who are already here, and welcome to those who are new! Let\u0027s tell some stories."
