    "summary": "Loving and amazing people that are reading this and viewing my page, I want to thank you for coming here. I am an artist and I forge\u00a0\u00a0a wide variety of lunacy based videos and art. I came to Youtube to share my bearded brand of madness with the world and I will always share it no matter what. Making puppets, art and comedy are my passion and I would love to continue my craft at a reasonably normal pace but money is tight and my dreams are BIG! I saw many others turning to crowd funding websites to get much needed help from the people who love their works. That is why I am here! I would love to get back to producing many videos a month and creating amazing props and art. The goal is one to two scripted puppet videos, one cosplay or prop build and \u00a0weekly doodle videos during the course of a month. This will also include multiple livestreams and Q\u0026amp;A videos dedicated to the patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Any amount you can give is amazing and if you are unable then I most certainly understand. I will keep making the videos happen and you can enjoy them anytime!!! The position I am in would call for around $600 dollars a month to get everything back in order and calm the stress of gathering funds for bills and materials. With many small monthly patrons that can become a reality. I hope if you are able you will help fund my creations so I can make you smile and teach you some crafting. Thanks for your time and hope you keep enjoying my content."
