    "summary": "I\u0027m trying really hard to become a good streamer for the fans of the channel and make a great laid back entertaining gaming community. I stream\u00a020-50 hrs a week and work\u00a050 hrs a week\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0I like to entertain my viewers with comedy and game content. Over\u00a06000 hrs logged streaming in 3yrs. I use the money I get in any donation to purchase games to show you if they are worth the 60$. I am trying to get out of where I live. I would love this to be my job so everyone can hang out all day every day. I try to answer every message and invite players to games and party chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a Gaming entertainer and love to interact with viewers. I aim to have fun but also show you the ins and outs of a game. Gaming has been my life and so has comedy. I grew up on George Carlin and Richard Pryor. I love to interact with my viewers and create a very engaging Broadcast on Mixer. Its important to me that you save money on Games that may not be worth the buy. which is why donations are used to keep the content going while I try to make my way in this business of Being a broadcaster. Not everything I say will make you happy or may not make you laugh. But I am me and not some fake pretend person. I am who you see on your screen. I\u0027ve had so many jobs in my life. But none of them really made me feel like I was on the pursuit of happiness. Broadcasting gives me a chance to maybe make your day a little better. Broadcasting helps fill a deep sea of depression. It also helps me fight my very own anxiety as it keeps my mind busy answering questions or just entertaining you the viewer. Most people know that a comedians darkest fear and drive to make others happy or laugh, is because of their grasp on reality and through laughter of certain situations. Through my life I found out that I write Poetry as well. Most people really like the stories I create. I plan on getting a few published.  But when I\u0027m having writers block, broadcasting is what keeps me going. My beautiful girlfriend is very supportive of my comedy and broadcasting. There are so many people I can thank who were there at the beginning. For them and me, I\u0027m making the final push to become something more than just a comedian. More than just a broadcaster. Someone others can just watch and never have to worry about being ridiculed because I\u0027m definitely perfect either. But we will be ourselves and that\u0027s pretty damn good enough. Happy Gaming! :-)"
