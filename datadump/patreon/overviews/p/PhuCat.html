Let me separate these four topics and explain them in full. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHorror Games: I\u0027m a horror addict and I do take my horror games seriously, so DO NOT expect any exaggerated reactions. I create these videos because I want to show the audience why this or that horror game is worth your time. Does it have a proper storyline? Is it worth the value? Is it just poorly executed jumpscares? All of that is answered throughout my playthroughs and, for more entertainment purposes, I throw in a comedy skit for those horror games if an idea develops in my head. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkateboarding: I\u0027ve been a skateboarder since 2003 and my specialty is in flatground(flip tricks). I have won 1st and 2nd place in the very few game of skate contests that the local skate shop has offered. I don\u0027t see myself as a great teacher, but I do enjoy giving tips on how to do these flip tricks that I\u0027ve learned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTravelling: I\u0027ve been doing outdoor vlogs since summer 2010 and I thought it would be a wonderful idea to keep a video archive of my life especially since I suffer from short term memory. It\u0027s always fun watching back on my trips to Caliornia, Texas, Arizona, etc. And I would love to inspire others to record their life outside of other categorized videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDieting: This wasn\u0027t really a concern until Thanksgiving 2016. I was fed up with the \"fat shame\" and decided to go on my very own diet. I had a starting weight of 216lbs and I\u0027m currently standing at 161lbs. There\u0027s a variety of ways to diet because it is so customizable and not as difficult to lose weight as people describe it to be. For patrons only, I can give my personal tips on how to lose weight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe money that I make from my job goes towards college. However, I use up my entire payment every month on groceries and video props so basically the money I\u0027ve earned for education has been on a halt. With the Patreon revenue, it would be a lot easier to save up on college money and live my hobby and life the way I want without concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWell, that solely depends on what reward tier you decide to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn closing...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI would love to continue creating content without hardship.
