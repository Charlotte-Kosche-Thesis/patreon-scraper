    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m the Pudding Earl, a long time on-and-off developer of an adult game, as well as an aspiring author off on some entirely different tangent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Game\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game I\u0027m working on is Shield High. It\u0027s a text-based adventure which I\u0027m programming in C# about lesbian schoolgirls, essentially. At present the game is entirely combat driven, you fight other girls to enslave them, or be enslaved by them, depending on if you win or lose. Down the road I\u0027m aiming to develop out some systems of relationships, and diplomacy, to allow you to take a combat-less approach to the game, however that\u0027s still a decent way off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in trying this game, you can find the free releases over on my blog here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://puddinggames.blogspot.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://puddinggames.blogspot.com.au/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis also includes some of the previous, much more terrible versions, if you\u0027d like to take a sample of my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, right now you wouldn\u0027t be. I\u0027m presently in legal limbo, living in America but not legally being a proper resident until some paperwork is sorted out. As such any pledges made right now are basically for when I release 0.69, which will be in several months time as of writing this(mid-October), at which time I\u0027ll be charging for the update, and then back to my monthly updates. Said updates will be lesser in scope, and I\u0027ll probably only charge every second or third update, based on how much content is being added. Old explanation pre-hiatus of the game being kept crossed out for saving me time in the future. Though it\u0027s still sort of relevant I suppose?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdel\u003eSo I can make a job of this, basically. Right now my living arrangements aren\u0027t the best for being productive on an adult game, meaning I get to work on it only one to two hours a day. The dream is to use Patreon to enable me to move out and into my own place, or eventually to move overseas to live with my girlfriend. There I could pretty easily up my rate of work to four or even eight hours a day, depending on what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an extremely long view of it, beyond just supporting me, if the Patreon grows big enough, I\u0027d like to look at branching out, and possibly funding a second project. Or taking on an artist, to turn Shield High from an exclusively text game to a mixture of text and images. This is a fairly long term goal however, for the moment I\u0027m just hoping to be able to support myself.\u00a0\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
