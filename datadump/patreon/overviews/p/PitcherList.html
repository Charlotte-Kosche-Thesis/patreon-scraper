I realized GIFs were the perfect medium to express the joy of a beautifully placed Fastball or witness the incredible break of a nasty Slider. Since then, we\u0027ve created the definitive Pitching GIF database for starting pitchers in the MLB, featuring a GIF of every pitch inside every starting pitcher\u0027s repertoire.

In order to take the next step with the site, we need your support here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo give you an idea of our vision for Pitcher List, here are a few features we\u0027re aiming to add in the near future: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery pitcher in the majors\u003c/strong\u003e (not just starters) with their own page and GIFs, updated the day after their MLB debut\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003ePlayer pages revamped with estimated future schedule, injury history, archives of their SP Roundup blurbs and GIF roundups\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHitter List fully realized on the site,\u003c/strong\u003e including unique player pages, daily roundups, and weekly updated rankings\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eShort daily podcasts giving you all the fantasy updates you need to know about if you don\u0027t have time to keep up to date\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eNew stats (including VPR) fleshed out on the site, including team and player pages\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eDaily projections for heavy streaming players and those in DFS leagues\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpansion to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://football.pitcherlist.com/\"\u003eFootball\u003c/a\u003e, Basketball, and Hockey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.pitcherlist.com/store/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e More Merch!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA bunch more Podcasts and Live-Streams because those are a blast\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eMore daily article content.

Everything raised here will be poured straight into the site, let it be server costs, adding those great features above, and supporting our talented writing staff. In other words, I personally won\u0027t see a dime of it as I am fully dedicated to making Pitcher List everything it can be.
