Following my Dad\u0027s death, I decided to pack up and move away from my small town and take a chance on Hollywood. Again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCity life ain\u0027t cheap or easy, and although I\u0027m managing, it\u0027s become increasingly hard to be able to focus on creative endeavors, and despite that being the whole opposite of why I came out here in the first place - it just plain sucks. To be honest, even with getting my rent paid, I could still use help with stuff like transportation and also growing my creative projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNu02-MVoAAVCtq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is it that I do? Well, most people in my life know me for just doodling. I am a pretty active artist, despite not really taking up that title for a long time. I do a lot of commissions for friends and family, but occasionally also do ~*~*~ fancy~*~*~ branded stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a writer and producer and have had the chance to work on some really cool projects this year, some of which haven\u0027t been released yet, but they are coming! I\u0027m working on a small follow-up to my first independent ARG, Escape From Eden Park, this winter. If you subscribe to my patreon, you\u0027ll be getting a closer look on how we\u0027re building that from the ground up - and at a certain level, you\u0027ll get access to discord and BTS stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also, also - do audio stuff from time to time! Whether it\u0027s acting (like as Greg in Join the Party) or podcasting, or interviewing animators and voice actors, I\u0027m most always pumping out new stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, while I\u0027m creating all of this, I have friends who\u0027ve encouraged me to reopen my Patreon so they can donate, and I don\u0027t see the harm!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like it,\u00a0 you can donate and unlock my stream and get updates about my projects and stuff before anyone else! If you want to! No pressure!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

As a producer of community-based experiences, I went on to work for Fahlo, an app designed to bring communities together and bring them closer to the artists and content they love, with artists and brands such as Funny or Die, Tori Kelly, Marina and the Diamonds,  Carly Rae Jepsen, Ricky Martin and many others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndependently, my small team has undertaken various community-driven creative projects. Such as the LGBT reimagining of Jane Austen\u0027s work, Pride Week and Prejudice. Operation Always, a Pottermore community that ushered over 400 users into JK Rowling\u0027s Pottermore Closed Beta and Anwhistle Aquatics, a fan-run alternate reality game built around Netflix\u0027s A Series of Unfortunate Events. Anwhistle gained over 1000 players in its less than a week run. \u003cbr\u003e",
