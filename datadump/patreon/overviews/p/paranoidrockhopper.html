My name is Stefan Axelsson, and one of my favourite pastimes is pretending that I can draw. Combined with a fascination with a certain type of flightless bird, this has resulted in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.paranoidrockhopper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eParanoid Rockhopper\u003c/a\u003e, a webcomic which is nearly exclusively about penguins. At the time of writing this, I have drawn just over 300 one panel comics, and they can be found on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/paranoidrockhopper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e which so far has been my main portal for distributing my comics. I\u0027m working on learning HTML and CSS properly to be able to make my web page work better, and mainly more mobile friendly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy penguins?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not penguins? Penguins are awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be able to make a living drawing comics and creating other things for people to enjoy. However, I don\u0027t really want to put what I create behind a paywall in order to make money, I want everyone who wants to to be able to enjoy my comics. With Patreon, people who want to support my art can, while I can still keep it free for people who don\u0027t have the means to pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support Paranoid Rockhopper?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can support myself with the help of my patrons, I have more time to spend on creating new things, so supporting me financially means making Paranoid Rockhopper better. Not only that, but supporting me means that other people will be able to enjoy my creations too. If you love my work, your donations mean others get to love it too. You\u0027re basically a superhero of generosity!"
