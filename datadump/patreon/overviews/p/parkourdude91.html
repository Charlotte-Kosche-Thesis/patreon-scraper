Everything we make will always be free and DEAGLE NATION will never be Pay to Win like certain Online FPS games that I will not mention. *Coughs* Thanks one percent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever we live in a cruel world set up by puppets like obama and \"Crap Guys\" from places like wall street. So unfortinutely we actually have to get money to do certain stuff. If you like what you\u0027ve seen so far, and you want it to be even better, then this is for you. All donations will be used to rank up the quality of all our content and no dollar will be wasted!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREMEMBER: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy donating, you\u2019re not only funding freedom fighters to protect American values,  you\u2019re investing in your own personal entertainment! You give \u2013 and we give back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be using your pledge to the cause in three main areas:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEQUIPMENT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e We will use your pledge to acquire high-end, military-grade Loadouts. Right now we have camera equipment down pat but we still need audio equipment, green screens, and mobile lighting setups. Thank you so much for buying me a GoPro camera for filming parkour and sparring/Airsoft matches. Now we just need high quality tactical mics to increase the fidelity of our videos and streams! This will allow you to not only see areas of Deagle Nation you haven\u0027t ever seen before, but to witness them in stunning HD quality. With GoPro Helmet Cams and High-Fidelity Microphones, you\u0027ll feel like you\u0027re really there, with me in Atlanta ghettoes, starting the next race war LIVE!!! Your AMAZING donations have already bought us a GoPro HERO 3 with \nlivestreaming capability ($300) This will be actually allowing us to livestream wirelessly with 4G,\n so we can walk around in public, with a mounted head-camera, and you \nget to watch it all in 1080p HD quality!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMISSIONS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e We need money to change the world. We have entire dossiers filled with confidential plans for future missions, but often lack the money to start them. For example, we might use your pledge to buy gas money for a Deagle Nation Road Trip to travel cross-country and meet the fans, or for plane tickets to travel on overseas counterterrorism and embedded journalism ops such as Operation Tupacalypse, Wu-pocalypse, or Operation Japanime. This also includes our R\u0026amp;D budget which is used to fund research into new areas, such as the cures for homosexuality. Our hypothetical idea is to purchase mice that appear homosexual and try to rehabilitate them in a safe environment and/or with various non-intrusive methods. And then we will also document the results for public consumption and post them on youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMULTIMEDIA:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Deagle Nation is all about media and entertainment. We have a diverse portolio to entertain you in as many different ways as freaking possible dude. Including me actually writing books for my digital extra or mde. So if u want me to write my spec ops life story as a book u can buy u should basically donate!! We run a Garry\u0027s Mod server with a custom RP/FPS/RPG multiplayer game which costs us about $30 a month. After that fee is paid, any remaining funds will go to misc. multimedia projects, like hiring actors from Fiverr.com for our multimedia experts (CIADude420, John Pelech, Enig, VexGod, Jetstream John, Jackie Chin) to use in their videos, as well as items like a green screens for our political talk show, FACT ZONE, so it can look like I\u0027m talking in a newsroom when I\u0027m actually not talking in one at all, which is actually pretty spec ops if you think about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will always make sure to stretch your dollar as far as we can! One of our lieutenants (Elijah) has Jewish relatives who seem pretty smart because they read books and shit all the time.So we will possibly attempt to get financial advice from them. Thank You\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
