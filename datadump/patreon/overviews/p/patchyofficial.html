This Included a track called \u0027Broken Bells, with D/R/U/G/S producer Callum Wright. Right now, I\u0027m working with DJ Matt Darey (you may have heard of him!) and we\u0027ve written a couple of tracks together. Matt is currently working on THE first album in Dolby Atmos (surround sound) which features two tracks with me.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nocturnalnouveau/promises\"\u003ePromises\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; Wolf.

This is why I\u0027m here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to release my next album, full electronic music production and vocal recording!

Well, except with the help of you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know how the age-old problem goes. You\u0027ve gotta work to pay the bills, but then where do you find the time to keep making the music and keep going with the project that means the most to you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to keep you all in the loop with how this process is going and even if I get 0 subscribers, I\u0027ll still post, post, post as this journey/project is massively important to me and I\u00a0really want to get the finished album out to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake care everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCandi (AKA Patchy)",
