Your support will also fund other, various projects and ideas that I am in the process of developing, by giving me the time and ability to actually create and put these projects into form, for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will attempt to get out at least one new short story a week. My topics will vary, depending on what I dig up in my old notes, or an idea I come across throughout my days that I feel like tapping into.\u00a0 I tend to come up with ideas fairly easily, (who doesn\u0027t?) and I will randomly determine which one I want to write each week. If I have an exceptional week, I may be able to get more than one accomplished, which would be ideal for me. If I can stay focused, I can easily write 2,000-2,500 words an hour at my top rating, although a good day will generally equal a little over 10,000 words in a single day. I have not been able to get that pace down on a regular basis, but I hope to be able to get there, in time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease hang with me, as I sort out the various rewards and pledge amounts on this site.

I have a great many hobbies and passions and I do my best to engage them as often as possible, to keep myself happy and to keep moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to write a new story or a new part of a story every week, depending on what you, my readers, are interested in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you support me, and what I am trying to do? My greatest desire is to write my stories, to bring them to life, so that I might be able to share them with the rest of the world. I am consistently coming up with ideas, like everyone else is doing. It is my fondest desire to be able to write every day and being able to have my stories come to life so I might share them with the world. This dream has been mine since I was young, in middle school. I have self published a single collection of poetry and stories I wrote in high school, and that collection came out nearly 10 years ago now. I have been writing since then, but having the desire to eat, to be warm at night, these have taken dramatic precedence in recent years, but now I am fighting to free myself so I might be able to write and produce my stories in the fashion that the stories demand and in the fashion I require of myself to give.\u003cbr\u003e",
