    "summary": "For anyone who has known me for any length of time knows that writing has always been my passion. I have always felt the desire, no... the need to write. To tell my story and the story of the world as I see it. I explore that world in both personal essays and fictional pieces. Many of these are posted on my blog site, Which Way to Hollywood? Of course, this doesn\u0027t include the tragic period of high school poetry that I wrote... and really, the whole world is better off for that. No, really... no one needs to be doused in that much teenage angst.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore importantly\u00a0is a place for me to interact and receive gratuity for fans and friends. This is also a way to get information out to people who are interested in my various writing projects, namely my screenwriting, fictional writing (that may one day turn into a novel), graphic novel scribblings (initially writing, then visual as I find an artist that would be interested), non-fiction essays, and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than anything, I would love to give my undying gratitude to my friends and family who have supported me wholeheartedly in my writing endeavors. Without you, this would be even more difficult. Thank you so very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(This is currently under construction. There will be more pictures and a video, reward tiers, thank you video, and goals to be added in the near future. I want to create sincere and wonderful thank yous for all of you out there.)"
