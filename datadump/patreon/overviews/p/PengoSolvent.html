With my comics, I focus on character interaction. I really have no idea how to describe what I do except that I really like to make things that strike me as memorable and leave people with something to think about. I like to concentrate very hard on what feels unexpected but believable, as that is what I want to see more of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see a collection of my comics on \u003ca href=\"http://www.pengosolvent.com/art.html\"\u003emy site\u003c/a\u003e, on \u003ca href=\"https://pengosolvent.tumblr.com/tagged/comic/\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://pengosolvent.deviantart.com/gallery/59689616/comics\"\u003eon DA\u003c/a\u003e.

The two comics I am doing before TwainTense are both about 20 pages each, so actual comic work (and not planning) on TwainTense is actually starting relatively soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor music, I\u0027ve been working on a personal album, with 11 planned tracks, called The \"I\" Concept. It\u0027s about the feeling of not knowing when one thing ends and another begins, and about questioning what determines being \"one.\"\u00a0Unlike my other albums, this one will have lyrics for every track and clearly mark out a thought process as it progresses. You can hear the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4-5d8xk6s\"\u003efirst track here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIocop_XgAAWcwN.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery single day, I\u0027ve been working hard at these projects (and others I haven\u0027t talked about publicly yet as well).\u003cbr\u003eFor TwainTense, I\u0027ve been researching a lot of the details needed for the setting, been practicing perspective and interior design, drawn and am drawing a lot of comics to figure out how to quicken my process (and drew out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqOab7UEvw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea 20 page comic with some of the characters\u003c/a\u003e to test them out),\u00a0been designing all the characters and locations, been planning all the main events, been thumbnailing each page, and so on... For The \"I\" Concept album, I\u0027ve named each song in accordance to the concepts I want them to discuss, written out and refined the lyrics for all tracks (currently almost 1000 words total), drafted many of the tracks, recorded the samples needed, and so on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...But despite all this work, and despite the fact these two are the biggest projects I want to work on right now, I keep being stymied by having to work on other things first for money for food, rent, emergencies, etc. I\u0027ve been trying really hard to be self-sufficient so that I can concentrate entirely on my original works, and right now it looks like Patreon can really help with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGetting funds on Patreon means I don\u0027t have to spend time making that money elsewhere, which translates to more time and effort for my own work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing is, I usually don\u0027t post what I\u0027ve been working on if I haven\u0027t finished it yet, as I often feel that in-progress works aren\u0027t worth posting until the final is out, but with longer projects, that means I don\u0027t get to post anything. Patreon seems like a nice way for me to show what I\u0027ve been working on to people who want to see that progress and also help me complete my current long term projects and my future ones as well! (and wow do I have big things planned)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar is greatly appreciated!
