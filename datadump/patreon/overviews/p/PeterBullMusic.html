    "summary": "Thanks for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating and recording music for over 10 years but never really had a place to share it. When I graduated high school in 2009, I went straight into a four year University Music program and right away moved to New York to study towards a masters degree at a prestigious, high pressured music school. Well, as you might have guessed, I got a little burnt out. I\u0027m now back in Canada, living in Toronto, and getting back into my first love of composing, performing and recording original music. I\u0027m really looking forward to sharing it all with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"So how does this all work?\" You may ask! It\u0027s really easy! You just have to click the \"BECOME A PATRON\" button, show your credentials, and choose a pledge amount/reward tier. You will be charged automatically every time I upload a music video! If you\u0027re thinking, \"Wait a minute. What if he uploads, like, a dozen videos at once???\" don\u0027t worry! You can set a monthly maximum so that you won\u0027t break the bank. If you decide at some point that you want to increase or reduce your amount, you can do so at any time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am planning on putting your pledge money towards upgrading my limited bedroom studio equipment so I can continue to improve the quality of my recordings and videos. I have also recently taken on a few instrument repair projects that will inevitably lead to more cool custom instruments working their way into videos. Your pledge will help me pay for that stuff too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for listening to my music and supporting my creation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Peter"
