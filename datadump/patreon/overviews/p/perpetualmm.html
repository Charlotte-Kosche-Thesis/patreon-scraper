For that to happen, I need a little extra help. Running a channel requires a lot of time, not only for the broadcasts themselves, but also the setup involving console/game setup \u0026amp; capture, lighting, program configuration, digital media, sound (oh god, so much sound balancing...), and many more things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancial support would help with my immediate goals of basic needs, but could eventually help with long term goals. \u00a0Goals to improve stream quality such as equipment \u0026amp; location upgrades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for looking at my Patreon profile!"
