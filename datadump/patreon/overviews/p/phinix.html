It is a journey\nand a life philosophy, a constant grounding reaffirmation of what positive\nthings technology grants us capable of, and of how fortunate we are to live in\na time and place where such things are possible. I have always found the\nexperience itself to be the greatest reward, which is why I have and will\nforever choose to offer my works freely without any expectations to all who\nmight enjoy them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have been making digital content in one form or another\nfor the past two decades. Anything from open source software, photography,\nYouTube guides and commentaries, Wiki edits, even a Mars \u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/a/ef8Un\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eimage processing\u003c/a\u003e server for MOC and THEMIS\ndata. More recently however it has been my efforts writing apps, mods, and GUI\naddons for various online and single player video games that has received the\nmost attention.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome of my projects are quite well known. \u003ca href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24235/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePhinix Natural ENB\u003c/a\u003e for\nSkyrim has consistently remained among the top 10 most endorsed and downloaded\ngraphic overhauls on the Nexus.

Your support would help me to continue doing\nthe things I do, writing and coding and creating fun immersive content, and\nsharing that content freely with the world. That in turn would help me to\nmaintain a generally healthy and positive outlook on life. It\u0027s a win-win!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you have enjoyed any of my works and just felt like\nsaying \"thanks, I support what you do, here\u0027s a coffee on me,\" you\ncould of course still do that with \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026amp;hosted_button_id=6WL6KCHVGTAJU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea\none-time donation through Paypal\u003c/a\u003e, which is always much appreciated. Patreon\nsimply presents a timely and convenient way for people to show support on a\nmore personal, long-term basis with scheduled monthly donations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am also hopeful it might help me to connect with people\nbetter than I have been able to in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat To Expect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be perfectly honest, I\u0027m not as quick and efficient as\nI once was. I mentioned the stroke, which is the result of a brain cavernoma (\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/a/OE5Ib\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy brain\u003c/a\u003e) that was recently discovered\nafter an emergency room visit for a sudden episode of garbled speech, head\npain, and serious cognitive dissonance. Basically it is like a mini-aneurism, a\ntangle of veins likely the result of a poorly healed childhood trauma\n(according to my neurologists), which tends to balloon out and \"leak\"\nwhen under pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nObviously bleeding in the brain is scary and not good, but\nwith rest and medication (blood pressure and anticonvulsants mainly, and pain\nkillers... and coffee!), I am able to maintain an enjoyable and rewarding\nlifestyle, mostly thanks to the love and kindness of friends and family. I\nwould say that while the QUANTITY of my work may have diminished somewhat, the quality\nand care I put into everything I do is stronger than ever. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to be clear that setting up a Patreon \u003cstrong\u003eis in no way a promise to create specific\ncontent\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eon demand\u003c/strong\u003e or on a\ndeadline. Instead, think of pledging as a way to say \"I appreciate what\nyou do, thanks!\"\u003cstrong\u003e and know that your\nsupport will go a long way to helping me continue doing it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeanwhile, I will continue to share all of my creative works\nas I always have, freely and without expectation to everyone that might enjoy\nthem, both Patreons and non-Patreons alike. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt is people like you that keep me going. Your appreciation\ninspires me and your support is what allows me to continue to do the things I\nlove. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFeel free to contact me here or on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/_Phinix\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Twitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMay the future bring you joy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
