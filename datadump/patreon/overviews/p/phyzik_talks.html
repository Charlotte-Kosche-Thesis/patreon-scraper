However with your help I will be able to put so much more into this channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eYour funding will go straight into the channel. This means I can vastly improve my production quality with new props, equipment, sofware etc. I will also be able to put far more time into my videos, more time into editing and polishing to give you the best experience I can. This also gives me the ability to focus more on my music as well, allowing me to create theme music for my videos and start producing an album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery Little Helps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI know this term is over-used but it\u0027s for a good reason.
