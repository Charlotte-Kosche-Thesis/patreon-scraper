    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon! My name is Penelope, and I enjoy drawing and digitally-painting different Characters and People from Comics, Anime, Video Games, Pop Culture. I also like coming up with my own original concepts from time to time that are influenced by the many artists and things that inspire me.I am using Patreon as a platform to develop a following with my art and keep in touch regularly with people, in hope that I can receive financial help with medical costs... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 7 years ago I was diagnosed with Lupus, an autoimmune disease where the body\u2019s immune system attacks any or all organs (skin, stomach, muscles, nervous system, brain, etc), also causing severe debilitating chronic pain that has impeded on my life and normal daily tasks. There is NO CURE, and the medications for this disease cause other health issues and long term problems. Not long after, I was also diagnosed with a similar disease called Sjogrens Syndrome, and Fibromyalgia. In late 2017 I had finally received access to Medical Cannabis for pain-relief, which is NOT addictive, and has NO adverse health side effects. I can truly say it has given me a life where I don\u2019t fear going out, walking, sitting, or standing for more than 5 minutes, shopping at the supermarket, and just doing normal people things! Before this, I was self medicating with Tylenol \u0026amp; other over the counter Pain Meds my whole life, and those have long term damaging effects to the body. Doctors would also prescribe opioids and other highly addictive pain meds that are no good. Medical Cannabis is VERY expensive and incredibly limited in the state of New York (it may take YEARS before it is covered by any type of insurance, if ever.) But like I said, I feel like a whole new person, who doesn\u2019t have to use a cane, be in a wheelchair, or in bed for days on end from severe excruciating pain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to do is give you guys a look into my daily art-makings. You\u2019ll see sketches, works in progress, commissions, and full high resolution completed art with NO watermarks (all downloadable!), for a small monthly donation of $1. For $5 you\u2019ll get all that, and be able to request 1 thing for me to draw (don\u2019t forget to send me a msg at the first of the month so I can put it on my To-Do List!). And for $10, You get all the previous rewards, as well as a monthly Print Pack sent straight to your Mailbox of everything I\u2019ve made that month (with free shipping)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly gift donations of $1-10 will help me lead a better, pain free life so I can continue making art everyday, learn and apply new skills to my work, and give back as much as I can for your generosity. Thankyou and Have a Wonderful day :) \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
