    "summary": "Greetings, Friends!\u00a0 I make stuff.\u00a0 And videos.\u00a0 And videos about me making stuff.\u00a0 It\u0027s really a big circle.\u00a0 Anyways, until now i\u0027ve been doing this with a mix of out-of-pocket money and YouTube ad revenue, but some of you amazing people have told me repeatedly that you want to help (mentioning patreon explicitly), so here\u0027s an opportunity for you to get involved, if you want to!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, I make videos on a variety of topics all centered around making stuff.\u00a0 My lack of focus and manic desire to learn everything means I try 3D printing, welding, casting, wood working, car restoration, forging, electronics, interpretive dance, everything.\u00a0 Ok, no dancing, i\u0027m never going to do dancing.\u00a0 That\u0027s a promise.\u00a0 Materials and equipment cost money, so i\u0027ve been rolling out the stuff slowly as the budget allows and i\u0027ve been happy to do it, but a little bump to the ol\u0027 bank account would certainly spur a bit more speed and ambition in these projects.\u00a0 I could buy metal for casting, more propane, a couple tools to speed up the boring stuff i do with cheap hand tools off camera, and so on.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALL money that I receive from Patreon will go back into the channel, either for tools, filming equipment, materials or that kind of stuff, none into my own pocket or for a sweet new Timex watch or anything like that.\u00a0 I mean, watches are nice, but I already have one.\u00a0 You know what I don\u0027t have? A crucible big enough to hold enough metal to cast that big lathe bed i kept talking about before.\u00a0 But I digress...\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*DISCLAIMER* This Patreon thing is in response to multiple people asking for it, in NO way do I need money.\u00a0 I\u0027m perfectly happy to plug along at the slow pace I was.\u00a0 If you are on the fence, struggling to decide to give money or not, don\u0027t.\u00a0 I\u0027m not starving, my day job puts food on my table and pays for my house.\u00a0 This is a hobby of mine, but if you want to contribute, I\u0027m truly grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a couple very small perks for patrons to express my gratitude, but all major benefits from your pledges will go to improve the videos and stuff available to EVERYONE, not just patrons.\u00a0 This is more of a \"\u003cem\u003edonate if you want\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0kind of thing, not a \"\u003cem\u003eI\u0027m doing extra to get more money\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0kind of thing.\u00a0 If i have extra time to do anything, it\u0027s going to be videos for \u003cem\u003eeverybody. \u003c/em\u003eAs a result, the \"goals\" are just guidelines to give you idea of how i plan to improve the channel.\u00a0 In short, there is no paid content here, and higher tiers \u003cem\u003ebarely\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0receive more perks.\u00a0 If that bothers you, don\u0027t sign up.\u00a0 You can continue watching the videos for free, you won\u0027t miss a thing.\u003cbr\u003e"
