    "summary": "First of all, thank you for checking out our Patreon campaign. It doesn\u2019t matter\n if you came here simply out of curiosity, or if you\u2019re really \ninterested in helping us out: the very fact that you\u2019re here reading \nthis means a lot to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWe need your help\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\n reason we launched this Patreon is because we need your help. Right now, we \ndo have several people on our team, but only one full-time writer: \nmyself (Lite Agent). A significant amount of time is spent working on \nthe website (writing posts, updating pages, etc.), pretty much every \nweek day (and week-ends), including on public holidays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this does not include a significant amount of extra time \nspent every day looking up for news / sources, covering special events \n(such as E3, or Nintendo Direct), and more. This is often done at odd \nhours (very early in the morning, or in the middle of the night), and \nmore and more often during week-ends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nShort story short: Perfectly Nintendo is, for me, a full-time commitment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u2019s wrong?\u003c/h3\u003e\nOur current problem is not the amount of work or time spent working \non the website (far from it: we enjoy every single minute of it), but \nrather how much the website allows us to earn. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, ad revenue is \nridiculously low (it literally took us months to get our first payment).\n So low that even getting a part-time job to help compensate would not \nbe nearly enough. The only thing it would do is reduce the amount of \nfree time to work on content for the website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis would not be an option either, as I personally want to work full\n time on the website, and provide the best coverage (humanly) possible. I\n have been writing about the video game industry, and Nintendo in \nparticular, for almost 11 years. Being an active part of it all, not \njust a passive fan, is something that I have been wanting to do for a \nlong time, and something that I am not ready to give up on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile it definitely sounds a bit (lot?) pretentious, our aim is to \nmake Perfectly Nintendo a reference for Nintendo-related news and \ncontent. We\u2019re quite aware we\u2019re nowhere near that status, but with your\n support, we will strive to turn that pretentious statement into \nreality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s for this very reason that we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat will the Patreon money be used for?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur immediate goal is, quite simply, to keep writing new content for Perfectly Nintendo. Our finances are not really improving, and our previous call for help has had a limited effect so far. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, our Patreon campaign will be in two parts:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) the first one will be about renewing hosting + domain (about 161.84\u20ac)\u003cbr\u003e2) the second one will start when the first has been completed. It will be about further improving our coverage, with more and better articles and features. We have several things in the works, including a mobile app, a refresh of the website, more translations, and more. Unfortunately, (almost) all of this requires help from external contributors, so it might take time for those plans to come to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy no rewards?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve thought a long time about possible rewards for our patrons, and decided we wouldn\u0027t have any (at least, no content-related rewards). The reason for this is that we do not really have the time to write extra content, and we do not wish to restrict access to said content (even temporarily, as content always end up posted somewhere else on the internet, like forums for example).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want our content to remain accessible to everyone, patrons or not. We want you to support us because you enjoy what we do, and would like us to keep going, improve, and keep going some more. Not because you want to join some super elite club or anything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping our content completely free is something we do not want to go back on, ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and thank you for support!\u003cbr\u003e"
