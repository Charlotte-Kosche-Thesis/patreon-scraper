However, unlike traditional subscriptions, you choose what you want to pay, and can change that amount or cancel at any time. I continue doing what I\u0027m doing, and as I reach milestones I will be able to do more cool things thanks to your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we get for supporting you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the perks that come with being a patron are listed on the right side of this page. Each tier has different rewards, including exclusive access to updates on my writing, writing excerpts, and even writing requests for the higher tier patrons! There\u0027s also a NSFW option. If you subscribe at this tier, you will have access to one NSFW short story every month.

These stories will cover all genres of fiction, and will be very, very NSFW. Some may be fan fiction, but most will be original work. One month it may be a modern day, perfectly vanilla sex scene. The next month, perhaps it\u0027ll be all-out monster porn. You\u0027ll just have to wait and see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this tie in with your Twitch?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is completely separate.
