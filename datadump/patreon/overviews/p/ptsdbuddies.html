    "summary": "Hello I\u2019m\nJamie MacWhirter and I run an online support group for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) called PTSD Buddies. \u00a0It has become so popular that we have thousands of members from all over the world all finding support in PTSD Buddies. \u00a0The problem I am having is i\u0027m limited to what I can do for people because I also have to work for a living to provide for my family. \u00a0So I have set up this Patreon account to help allow me to run PTSD Buddies full time. \u00a0I have done so much and helped so many people all in my spare time can you imagine what i can do if this was my job. \u00a0Below I have created a small bio on myself and PTSD Buddies. \u00a0Please take a look and after you read it you can contact me if you have any questions about PTSD Buddies and what I am doing to help people with PTSD. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy PTSD started when I was a young child and I survived a house fire but\nreally took over my life when I returned home from a tour of duty in\nAfghanistan.  My life became filled with\ndays of anger, anxiety and panic attacks while my nights were filled with\nnightmares.  Like many of you I have\nspent years trying different medications and seen my share of doctors trying to\nfind a normal life again.  I even at one\npoint in my life tried to end it all because I thought the world would be\nbetter off without me.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n  I\u2019m a father of two wonderful boys\nand I wanted them at some point to know what I went through in\nAfghanistan.  I guess you could say I\nwanted them to see why their father has PTSD and acts the way he does.  But after the book was finished I decided\nthat to publish it because I knew the book could help someone out there.  So I released my first book called; \u2018A\nSoldier\u2019s Tale \u2013 A Newfoundland Soldier in Afghanistan.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Not long after the release of my\nbook I started to give speeches on PTSD and I was sharing my story on\nstage.  The best part of this was getting\nto meet and talk with the people after the speech was done.  I was making so many friends with PTSD and\ngetting great contacts.  I was getting\nmany emails sent to me from people with PTSD and messages from people with PTSD\non Facebook asking me questions and just wanting to talk with someone who\nunderstands.  Then it came to me.  What if I could get all these people into an\nonline group so we could all talk about PTSD, share stories and lean on each\nother in times of need.  So on March 15\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;th\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\n2015 I created a Facebook group called PTSD Buddies and all the people I had\nmet through my work with PTSD I added them to the group.  Right away members where posting stories and\nsharing ideas on how to better deal with their PTSD.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Now PTSD Buddies has thousands of\nmembers and many different PTSD Buddies groups you can join.  I created a PTSD Buddies YouTube channel so I\nand other members could share PTSD stories with the world, make videos of\ngrounding techniques and helpful tips to better deal with your PTSD.  I hope you check it out and share our\nvideos.  The more the videos are shared\nthe more awareness we raise for PTSD. \nMaybe you have a video to add?  Let me know if you do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Now we have the PTSD Buddies website\nto link everything together and to better help our members.  If you would like to add something to our\nwebsite or if there is something you would like to see in our group please let\nme know.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  At PTSD Buddies there is no judging\njust understanding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to know more about PTSD Buddies or if you would be interested in joining i have provided links to everything on this page. \u00a0You can also reach me on Facebook messenger or email me at j.macwhirter@hotmail.ca\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
