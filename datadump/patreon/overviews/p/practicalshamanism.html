Prior to that, I worked as a mechanical\nengineer. To be honest, my engineering background of pragmatism, practicality,\na focus on \u201cwhat works\u201d in complex systems (i.e. human beings) plus\nsustainability and efficiency informs my shamanic work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGuided shamanic journeys, training material, and messages from the guides are a\ngreat way to help people strengthen their own direct, personal connection to\nthe divine. And, more to the point, to come into right relationship with\nthemselves and the world around them. My tag line is \u201cPractical Shamanism for a\nReally Good Life that just keeps getting better!\u201d and I have a great deal to\nshare on the \u201chow to\u201d aspect of that subject.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you subscribe on Patreon, at any level, you will be placed within the scope\nof my concern and support. While on a transpersonal level, I hope that all\nbeings may be well, I must be invited to and in alignment to support an\nindividual with my personal intent and shamanic team of guides. Becoming a\npatron of my work puts you within the circle of those people for whom I invite\nenergy and shamanic support to flow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy shamanic connection provides an incredible wellspring of information. In\nrecent years, I\u2019ve noticed turning away from inspiration for content because of\nthe time and energy that goes into my directly paying work. My fondest hope\nwith this endeavor is to create a win-win that allows me to develop exclusive\ncontent for people who want to receive it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWant to check out more of my content before committing to signing up? I have\nlots of free material on my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.handsoverheart.com\"\u003ewww.handsoverheart.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile there are special rewards for those who contribute at higher levels, it\u2019s\nmy intent to offer most of the rewards to those who contribute at any level. A\ncontribution of any amount matters to me and I want my rewards to reflect that\nfully.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn a personal note, your contribution adds to the gift of grace in my life. I\u2019m\ndelighted that my practice has thrived. I\u2019m grateful for everyone who has been\na part of that! Becoming a patron here helps me have enough money flow to add\nin things like freedom from credit card debt, paid vacation and sick time, and\nto money put away for retirement savings. I confess, I\u2019ve fallen into the\npattern of many inspired entrepreneurs wherein aspects of life balance are\ncompromised for the work I love. I\u2019m excited to start shifting that! Thank you\nso much for taking the time to read this!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWarmly,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKatie Weatherup"

     "about": "My commitment to healing work is part of my deep commitment to my own\n growth and healing. As a former mechanical engineer, I have always \nunderstood the necessity of system integrity. The human spirit is a \nhighly complex system, which can break down in complex and subtle ways. \nMuch of my shamanic work is oriented towards wholeness. I help people \nfind their way back to themselves, all the parts they\u2019ve lost, \nforgotten, denied and disowned. I love the elegance, simplicity and \npower of soul retrieval. It is deeply rewarding to know that an hour of \nmy time is often life changing for my client, affording them \nunprecedented levels of wholeness and right relationship to the \nuniverse.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith over 18 years of experience, I draw from a tremendous wealth of \nshamanic experience. I\u2019ve done thousands of healing journeys and am very\n comfortable working with the hard, scary stuff. To better pursue my \nvocation, I constantly explore additional healing modalities and \ntechniques. I\u2019ve studied with Hank Wesselman, Alberto Villoldo, and \nMaria Yraceburu. I\u2019ve also received training at the Natural Healing \nInstitute and through Michael Harner\u2019s Foundation for Shamanic Studies. \nMy articles have been published in Vision Magazine and PlanetLightworker\n and I\u2019ve been a guest on several radio shows. My books, \u003cem\u003ePractical Shamanism, A Guide for Walking in Both Worlds\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eSex, Shamanism and Healing, My Kissing Quest\u003c/em\u003e are available.",
