    "summary": "The Post Mortem Show is a horror movie podcast with a dark sense of humor. Dom \u0026amp; JD are the hosts and have been bringing you a FREE weekly show for over 2 years. Unfortunately, producing the show costs us over $100 per month out of our own pocket. Between hosting, promotion, and research/buying movies the show takes up a lot of our time and money. We want to take the show to the next level and give you more content as well as videos and MAKE OUR OWN HORROR MOVIE. Any amount helps. Thank you for listening and for your support. As H.P. Lovecraft once said, \"If it smells like fish... Throw the fucker back!!!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://www.postmortemshow.com"
