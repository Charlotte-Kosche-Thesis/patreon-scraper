    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR: What are you paying for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour money is going towards the server\u0027s development. Botwindr\u0027s fees, Rythm\u0027s fees, advertisement fees, as well as stabilizing my IRL bills and payments. Your money will also go towards upgrading streaming software and equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Hearth Discord has given so much to one another. So many laughs, so many friends, so many amazing experiences. Genuinely amazing, funny, and kind people have come to the hearth discord to do nothing but share their laughter with one another. I want to share this with the world. I want to build A Network to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Hearth Network:\u003c/strong\u003e A Network of discord servers with the goal of \nspreading positivity and laughter through a simple, easy to navigate \ninterface. Servers of all kinds are welcome, from gaming and \nlivestreaming to roleplaying and writing. From Art and Music to \nAnimation and Modding. Everybody is welcome to connect to the network \nand be connected to one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hearth exists for promoting content creators of every kind. If you want to promote your works, come to the server and hit me up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor nearly half a year I\u0027ve administrated for the Praise The Sun Discord before it\u0027s transition into the Tremily Discord before finally moving into The Hearth Discord. In that time, I\u0027ve met some of the nicest people that want nothing more than to help one another. Through this discord, a venture I took on a whim, I\u0027ve garnered a passion for community management, something that I\u0027ve dabbled in throughout the years but never truly committed to. Right now, I have a wonderful team of people that want to see the server become something more. Arx, Auria Gauld, JP. Everybody in the team of greeters wants to see the discord become something more than just a single server. Through them, The idea of the Hearth Network was spawned, and through them it will become something more than just a fleeting dream...through your help here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to dedicate myself fully towards the servers. I want to greet every single person that joins and hear their stories, see their reactions to such a large and welcoming community. But right now, it\u0027s difficult to do so. I have no job IRL, having to scrape money together just to get by every month. If I had the funds, I would work on the server see to every need all day every day. Which is why I\u0027m now calling on your help. If every person in the current server server gave a dollar a month, I\u0027d be able to do this for a living. Every dollar that you give helps me get to that goal and helps improve the server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the community of the Hearth Discord. Many of them I see as an electronic family that I don\u0027t want to let go. I care about everybody there and want to continue to serve them for a very long time coming. Thank you for reading this far. It\u0027s hard to show gratitude and emotion over text, but I truly do appreciate the support that I\u0027ve been given.\u003cbr\u003e"
