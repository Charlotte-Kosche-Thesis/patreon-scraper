    "summary": "I started creating these \"Photo Moments\"\u00a0on a lark, and they seem to have caught on. As a long-time educator and professional photographer, I\u0027m excited to be able to quickly and easily share educational moments with my friends and followers. Some Photo Moments are just that \u2014 brief moments of photography and video thoughts, tips, answering questions, and a look behind the scenes. On the other hand, certain Photo Moments can be quite involved, detailed, and, well, time consuming. I\u0027m enthusiastic about doing this and I\u0027d love to really expand what I \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0do in a Photo Moment \u2014 but this isn\u0027t sustainable without financial support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to engage viewers in a system of contribution that allows me to build Photo Moments with their direct help. Creating a system of viewer-funded support will be a situation in which people contribute what they feel compelled to give, making these educational moments possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEspecially when it comes to any kind of gear review; private funding allows me to stay totally unbiased (except for LUMIX gear \u2014 as a Panasonic LUMIX Ambassador, I\u0027m naturally biased towards that!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere do I see this going? That\u0027s a great question. If I could turn this into a full-time job, traveling the world answering your photography questions, showing tips and techniques and creating elaborate shoots just to educate my audience, that would be incredible! Your contributions could lead to amazing opportunities. I could work with underprivileged kids, teaching them photography and gifting them cameras. I could document stories with a behind-the-scenes angle of events you care about. I could visit schools, workshops, camera clubs and more. There\u0027s no limit to the possibilities; your financial support is what can make any or all of this possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for trying to make this happen. As a Patreon supporter, you can help craft what this little project becomes."
