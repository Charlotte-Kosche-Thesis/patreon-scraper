    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lee Garbutt, and I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/pughoofgaming\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePug Hoof Gaming\u003c/a\u003e in 2015 to play and talk about the things that I care about - To make videos for other people like me, who are fed up with \"angry\" YouTubers and screaming teenage vlogs. Ultimately, Pug Hoof Gaming\u2019s entire purpose is to celebrate the medium of video games in a positive way. I\u0027m just here to be me, and make the best videos I can possibly make, to convey a passion that\u0027s stayed with me for almost three decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What is Patreon, and how does this Patreon campaign work?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the uninitiated, Patreon is a service that helps fans (like you!) directly support a content creator (like me!). Essentially, when you become a Patron, you agree to financially support a creator for an amount of money, either for each individual piece of created content, or a monthly subscription - In some cases, in exchange for some virtual or physical rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a win-win situation: Creators can continue to make the content they believe in, knowing that their fans can keep the whole endeavour financially viable, and even create even better content as a result. Meanwhile, Patrons can get exclusive content and/or input into what their favourite creators are doing, and know that they\u0027re really helping creators out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1070.photobucket.com/albums/u500/PugHoofGaming/cutest-characters-in-videogames-kirby_zpseby5oe1j.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am launching a Patreon campaign. It is important to me that I\u2019m honest and absolutely transparent about my intentions for this campaign. This is entirely optional, and I will not be withholding any content from non-Patrons. You can donate as little or as much as you want. Supporting me financially will give me the resources to invest in even more equipment to ensure that my videos are even better produced, and even allow me to obtain more interesting gaming-related items that I can make videos about. In short, this Patreon isn\u2019t about me making a profit, but about me being able to do more of the videos you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can make bigger and better videos that not only celebrate gaming, but help preserve every aspect of the medium, through retrospectives and high quality captured footage. Maybe you\u2019d like me to cover every Zelda game ever released, even on non-Nintendo consoles? How about a look at every peripheral released for the Mega Drive? If you want me to do it and can help fund the purchase of required items like games, peripherals or other hardware that I don\u2019t have, I\u2019ll do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Where will my money be going to?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy campaign isn\u0027t motivated by greed - Any money you decide to donate will be put straight into the videos I make. I create videos using original hardware, with the aim of preserving the experience of playing these real games on the hardware it was designed for. I recently did a massive look at the Super Game Boy, creating over an hour\u2019s worth of video content, consisting of historical retrospectives, high quality captured footage, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat content took me months of planning, writing, recording, capturing and editing, and the result was one of my most well-received videos so far. I want to do more videos like that series, to celebrate, educate and preserve these classic games and hardware in video form, in the best quality I possibly can. With your financial backing, I can not only continue to do that, but do it even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to cover tons of interesting and unusual pieces of hardware and software, preserving them in video form for everyone to enjoy. I believe in capturing footage from real hardware, and to avoid using emulators where possible. But I can\u0027t always justify the cost of purchasing some of the more obscure items out there - My wife would probably kill me if I spent \u00a3150 pounds \u00a0and upwards on an obscure console, just to capture footage for one or two games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I have enough money saved up through this Patreon, I\u0027ll draw up a list of items I\u0027d like to purchase and make videos out of - From that list, I\u0027ll pitch video ideas to my Patrons, who will then be able to vote for the pitch that they would most like me to cover in a video. When I\u2019ve made that video, everyone that helped fund it will be credited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1070.photobucket.com/albums/u500/PugHoofGaming/cutest-characters-in-videogames-yoshi-super-mario-world_zpsvx4evugp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get in return for giving you money?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, that\u0027s undecided. Many Patreon campaigns will offer physical rewards, or different virtual/physical rewards depending on how much money you give the creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, I\u0027ll be posting behind the scenes information, photos and blogs, and crediting Patrons in every video. For videos that are finished early, I\u0027ll get them available for Patrons first, before they\u0027re published on the channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most of all, Patrons will be given a chance to take a greater role in the direction of this channel and what I make videos about (and what could be a better reward than that?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t afford to become a Patron!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s fine - I appreciate that you even took the time to watch this video, and there are plenty of non-monetary ways to support Pug Hoof Gaming and help it to grow. You could share this Patreon campaign with your friends, or even share my videos on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc. How about taking a few minutes to watch my videos and comment on them? These are things that are as valuable as financial support, if not more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, regardless of whether you contribute or not, you won\u0027t be missing out on any of my videos if you decide to not be a Patron - Don\u0027t worry!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you got this far - Thanks for reading, and whether or not you choose to be a Patron: Thank you for supporting Pug Hoof Gaming.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
