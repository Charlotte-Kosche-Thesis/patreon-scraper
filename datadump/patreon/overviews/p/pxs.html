We love what we do and have a wide variety of interests, from video games to anime to movies, TV and everything in between, and we would love nothing more than to keep doing it forever and do even more--like more consistent video content, features, and other such nonsense. In addition to all that, Marc has been creating \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.pixelatedsausage.com/art/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eart\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e since they were still in diapers and would love to continue doing that for a living, especially being able to create the art they love, not just art that others love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, If you like what we\u0027ve been doing over the years and want to see more (or just want to support the site in general) think about pledging a few bucks a month because, while that may not seem like much, \u003cstrong\u003eevery penny counts\u003c/strong\u003e and, depending on how many people support the show, a few bucks a month can really add up. And no, when it comes to rhyming, Marc will never give up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample of Marc\u0027s original artwork:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pixelatedsausage.com/storage/art/illustrationsetc/Lines_3-2_700.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you can\u0027t/don\u0027t want to pledge any money, helping the site by telling other people about it, spreading the love like cinnamon on a fresh bowl of oatmeal, would also be greatly appreciated. No matter what you choose to do, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e for taking the time to read this because you\u0027d be surprised by how many people (probably) don\u0027t even do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers.\u003cbr\u003e"
