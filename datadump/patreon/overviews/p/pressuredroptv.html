We started PressureDrop.tv to promote our favorite new and underground bands from all over the world.  With these bands we produce live music experiences, and bring these unique performances to our fans on our YouTube channel.  We\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to raise the bar and bring even more content to our fans through Patreon, so we can produce more live music experiences than ever!\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?  We want to work with Patreon to take a big step forward and we\u2019d like to make you a part of it.  We can currently create only about three new music performances per month.  It\u2019s a lot of work, but we\u2019d like to be able to take on even more: our first goal is to double that number!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you get out of it?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e  We\u2019ve got some amazing rewards waiting for you.  Access to our Patreon feed is a no-brainer.  We\u2019ve also got loads of behind-the-scenes footage with the most amazing bands out there, where you can see what it\u2019s like to put on a pop-up show in one of our unique secret locations.  You\u2019ll know what bands we\u2019re going to work with before anyone else.  You can get thanked in our credits at the end of every stream. Or you could receive autographed digital photos exclusive to our patrons.  If you\u2019d like to go deeper, we\u2019ve got signed merch from the bands in the form of CDs, cassettes, tote bags and posters. We have band t-shirts and for you vinyl lovers out theres, we\u2019ve got amazing 45 adapters, custom designed and 3D printed!  And at the highest levels, we can offer you access to our secret shows for in-person access to our live music experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe can\u2019t wait to get started.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e  Come with us and have access to the most exciting new independent music community in the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how do I help support new independent music?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou join PressureDrop.tv by becoming a Patron right here on this page.
