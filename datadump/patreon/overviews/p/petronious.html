Each one can take anywhere between 10-20 hours to make, not including the time it takes to play through the games I review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to set this up as a totally optional way for people to support my efforts in video making. As an incentive I\u0027ll be doing a behind the scenes styled blog posts on here for those who tip :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
