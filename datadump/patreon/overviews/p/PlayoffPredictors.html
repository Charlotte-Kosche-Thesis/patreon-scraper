    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027m Ray Lehnhoff, creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://playoffpredictors.com\"\u003ePlayoff Predictors\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been working on Playoff Predictors since May 2014 back when it was called the NFL Schedule Picker, and was the spiritual successor to a web application made for the NFL Subreddit to break ties. (You can even see the older project on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Raylehnhoff/nflschedulepicker/\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlayoff Predictors has come a long way since those days in terms of reliability, user experience, and complexity of the application.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOkay, but what is Playoff Predictors?\u003c/h2\u003e\nPlayoff Predictors is a suite of tools that, in a nut shell, allows you to predict the outcome of every game of a season. It then takes those game picks, runs that sport\u0027s tiebreakers against your picks, and generates the league\u0027s seeds and post-season. You can then pick the post-season out to the end and share it with your friends, family, blog readers, twitter followers, or anyone that will listen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe site\u0027s success comes from our willingness to work closely with our community to fix issues with our tiebreakers and to add features to the website at a fairly rapid pace. We concern ourselves greatly with getting tiebreakers correct, and work diligently to make sure our tools are the best available tie-breaking engines on the Internet.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOver consecutive seasons, we\u0027ve consistently broken complex ties \u003cem\u003ecorrectly\u003c/em\u003e, as opposed to other tie-breaking engines out there from much larger companies. We\u0027re not perfect, however, when we have been wrong, we\u0027ve quickly corrected the issues with our tie-breakers. In some cases, we\u0027ve even paid out bounties to people that have reported serious issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSo what\u0027s the Patreon for?\u003c/h2\u003e\nPlayoff Predictors began as a passion product, and has increased in size and scale to cover two major American sports, the NFL and the NBA. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlayoff Predictors is entirely run, built, and maintained by a single person - me - and it\u0027s been slowly getting too large for just one person to do it all.\u00a0The costs of hosting a web application like Playoff Predictors scales with the amount of data and users it gets, and the cost of developing, testing, and maintaining web applications is ever increasing. Additionally, maintaining a project the size and scale of Playoff Predictors isn\u0027t feasible off of ad revenue alone in the long run. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt some point, which is quickly approaching, I\u0027ll need to hire help to continue to grow the site and add new features that I know you\u0027ll love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the direct support of you and our wonderful community, I want to be able to ensure Playoff Predictors can continue to grow, scale, add new sports, and add awesome features. The goal is to ensure the financial stability of Playoff Predictors and the continued viability of the platform. I want Playoff Predictors to be around for the long haul.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe ads ruin the user experience, slows down the application, and generally makes the Internet a worse place to be. As a result, I don\u0027t want\u00a0to rely on ads alone to support Playoff Predictors. Thus, the necessity for something like Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to become more directly involved with Playoff Predictor\u0027s continued success by being a financial supporter.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNo, really, what do you need the money for today?\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027m glad you asked!
