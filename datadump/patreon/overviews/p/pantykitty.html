Donations are in no way pressured or obligatory, but \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e extremely appreciated. Pay what you want, if you feel like supporting me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Ariel, and I love creating Lewd Pinups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore specifically, digital art. I create both safe for work, as well as lewd pinups, which I try to make and post almost every day, if I\u0027m able. Most of my stuff consists of either fan art for friends and other artists, as well as my own original characters and designs. \u00a0It\u0027s also worth mentioning that at no point will this Patreon \u003cem\u003eever\u003c/em\u003e have pay-gated content of any kind. I\u0027ve worked and posted for free up to this point, my content being visible to everyone, and that\u0027s how it\u0027ll stay. Any content posted here will also be posted publicly on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PantyKitty\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up this Patreon for the soul purpose of giving those that\u0027d like to support me and my work a venue to do so. Chuckin\u0027 some cash my way every month, no matter the amount (Every dollar counts, and is greatly appreciated!) will help to fund the betterment of both myself, and my artwork by allowing me to finally save up for things I\u0027ve wanted or needed for ages, such as tools, software, tablets, etc. \u00a0And hey, if this Patreon becomes successful enough, I can also start funneling a bit of cash towards other fantastic artists that deserve it as well. Share the love, dig?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, if you enjoy my work and would like to throw me a few bucks, I\u0027d be incredibly grateful, and it could lead to some pretty drastic improvements in my life. But, if not, that\u0027s perfectly all right too. No pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time, and for even reading this far. I appreciate you."
