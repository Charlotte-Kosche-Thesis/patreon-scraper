By becoming my patron, you will help enable me to get the bills paid so I can have more time for creating beautiful artwork to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a photographer since 2009, based in the Richmond, Virginia area. I have shot with dozens of excellent models over the years. Making art is my soul, my passion, and my reason for existing. I pour myself into my photo work, and strive to create images that inspire, intrigue, and even titillate. Creating fully fleshed out concepts, making the viewer experience emotions; these are the things that I strive for. I hope you enjoy my Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXOXO\u003cbr\u003e"
