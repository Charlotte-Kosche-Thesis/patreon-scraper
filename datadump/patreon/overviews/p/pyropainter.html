I take pride in that individuality,\nwhich lends itself into my painting techniques, and yet, I also believe that my\nwork ethic includes artistic traits such as being detail oriented; while having\nan impressive output to produce art as well. This diverse method of mine begins\nwith photographing real fire, and then digitally manipulating those images into\nan entirely new work of various themes and concepts, based on the inspiration\nthat strikes me when studying the photographs that I take. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI ask that you please support my creative process here on Patreon, as I wish to\ndemonstrate and even instruct others in the manner in which I work! After all,\nwho else is better qualified to teach such a radical technique than the one who\ninitially imagined it? Ultimately it is my goal to extend my craft to others,\nand to also share my art nationally or perhaps even internationally, in a full\nlength feature film where these fiery illustrations come to life!"

     "about": "\u003cbr\u003eThe artist recognized as Pyropainter (both nationally and internationally) has a very precise and rather unique method for creating his renowned works of art.  Firstly, he begins by igniting a carefully controlled fire in the outdoors, and then taking a number of photographs of the blaze.  Additionally, he proceeds to study and identify the complex formations found in the flames; capturing it\u0027s natural, free-flowing movements with the aid of his digital camera.  This process is then repeated as he encircles the fire, the focus being on the discovery of even more interesting angles found within the flames; as well as capturing it\u0027s very life and vibrancy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, Pyropainter imports the selected photographs into various graphics editing software, digitally manipulating the images into a rough composition.  Whether the flames erupt into a gritty gothic city skyline or the form of a demonic wraith, Pyropainter makes clever use of the organic quality of the flickering inferno to create a basis for his pieces.  Following this step, he would then dive deeper into the image, creating sharp, captivating details with the use of acrylic paints.  By finalizing the artwork with his honed painting techniques, Pyropainter is able to create hauntingly realistic images with their own individuality and a distinctive narrative describing them.  The result is an intriguing presentation of what a single artist can visualize, re-imagine, and solely bring about with his own imagination and the use of the a natural element.\u003cbr\u003e",
