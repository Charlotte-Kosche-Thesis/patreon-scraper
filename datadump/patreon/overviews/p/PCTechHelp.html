    "summary": "I have a big fascination with knowledge and information, with a heavy focus on\u00a0 technology and security. Which one is my main love? Well I have two, first one is \u003cstrong\u003esecurity research\u003c/strong\u003e and second one is \u003cstrong\u003eteaching\u003c/strong\u003e those who are interested in the same things I am. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeaching people technology, or any subject for that matter, takes time and effort. Teaching more difficult subjects such as \u003cstrong\u003ecomputer security,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003efilmmaking\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eprogramming\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003egraphic design\u003c/strong\u003e, or \u003cstrong\u003emusic\u003c/strong\u003e takes a little more time and if you were to get lessons on your own it would be expensive. Not everyone who would like to learn those things can afford it. Yes my YouTube channel has not been updated in awhile and that\u0027s how it goes when you have to work to pay the bills. Sometimes there are many months, or years, that pass between videos and I don\u0027t like that any more than the subscribers, or regular viewers, to my channel do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would \u003cstrong\u003eREALLY\u003c/strong\u003e like to change that and expand my production and research team to more than just myself. I would love making videos on all the fun things I do such as building power-house computers, 3D modeling/animation, awesome short movies, professional gambling, special effects, music (guitar and keyboards), and lastly security research (my TRUE love).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos are going to be wide varying with some serious topics, others not so much and naturally some purely comical and entertaining ones. So there will be something for everyone. Those who know my background have said I should write an autobiography because my life has been so fascinating and different from normal people. Does that mean I\u0027m not normal? Probably, but who cares, we all have some \"not normal\" genes in us somewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of writing an autobiography, I\u0027m going to put \u003cstrong\u003eEVERYTHING\u003c/strong\u003e up in video because it\u0027s more enjoyable and entertaining in my opinion. And along with way maybe I can teach others some of the things I\u0027ve learned in my life, both good and bad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo without further ado, lets get on with the show. Off making video\u0027s I go! See you all in \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCyberSpace!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOR \u003c/strong\u003eYou can visit us in chat at irc.dal.net #pctech-help\u003cbr\u003e"
