    "summary": "Hello! My name is Kate McDonough and I am a comic artist/illustrator living and laughing with social anxiety disorder. I have always been passionate about making art. My style and interests have evolved over time, but have always come back to two basic things; I love to write and I love to draw. From the time I was a little kid, writing and illustrating stories on notepad paper then trying to tape the pages together (not understanding why it always fell apart...) to creating my first 20 page comic book about life with anxiety, my senior year of college, I have always been combining the two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating comics has given me an outlet to express my thoughts and emotions. The feelings of anxiety are no laughing matter, but I have learned to use humor to cope with the pain. My comics are relatable not only for people with anxiety disorders, but for any person going through a rough time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope my comics make you laugh, maybe cringe, and then sigh knowing you are not the only one going through this complicated, anxiety filled life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to be able to have more time to create art, and to be able to attend more comic and zine conventions. With your support, I would be able to focus more of my energy on writing and illustrating my way through life. I would also be able to travel farther to new conventions and meet more of the amazing people who like and support my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out my page and for any support you are able to give, every little bit makes a difference! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
