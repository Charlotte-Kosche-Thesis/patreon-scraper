    "summary": "My name is Brian, you may know me as PS4Trophies on YouTube. I create some of the best trophy guides on the internet. In the past 2 years, I have created over 1,500 videos. Your support for the channel has been astounding, and I really want to thank you. The reality is that in order to continue producing these videos I had to quit my full time job and work full time on the channel and while it\u0027s been a dream come true, it\u0027s been difficult to keep up with the purchase cost of equipment, games, beer, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I created this Patreon. By becoming a patron, you will allow me to continue doing what I love while at the same time afford me the luxury to buy better equipment, hire some help and ultimately assist with paying the rent. My landlord will appreciate that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, becoming a patron is not just simply a means to help me pay the bills, it\u0027s also going to allow me to give back to you. Reaching various milestone goals will enable me to do more giveaways, live streaming and give you the opprotunity to play games with me and other trophy hunters."
