See our rewards to the right. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We are Stock and Rachel Schlueter, a married couple, finding our way to the dream life through painting and travel. Ever since Stock and I met we agreed, the most awesome thing would be to hitch up a little trailer and take our painting gig on the road. Painting on location is known as plein air painting, it\u0027s a thing... and very popular right now. For years we talked/fantasized. \u00a0iThen! suddenly destiny began to emerge through a series of strangely correlating events, and the money came too, thanks to Patreon and the cool article my famous author friend Amy Stewart wrote for the local paper, on how we were embarking on this creative adventure which included a big Everything Must Go (studio) sale. We had a good send off -sold a lot of art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith hearts open, money in our pockets and faith in the universe we hit the road on June 5th 2016\u00a0Now one year later, we can say we did it and our journey far surpassed our expectations! Only with the help from friends could we have done what we did. We painted up a storm. Life and painting had reached a new level of astonishment. We created over 450 plein air paintings during our passage, they\u0027re really cool too, look\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pleinairpassage/\"\u003efor yourself\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we got home after 11 glorious months of wanderlust we began work on our art exhibit. First we got a an interview with journalist Heather Sheldon, which was published in the local newspaper:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.times-standard.com/lifestyle/20170603/a-creative-journey-local-artists-paint-en-plein-air-around-the-country\"\u003eLink\u003c/a\u003e She did a beautiful job. Then\u00a0paintings were hung in chronological order in our \u00a090\u0027 long hall gallery in Eureka Ca,. accompanied by a map of the our travels from beginning to end. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe were fortunate to have my son, photographer Tyson Ritter, join us for two months of the trip! He made an amazing video with drone footage!\u00a0We showed the film he created on the studio wall during our reception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1910024095693829\u0026amp;set=a.1380839481945629.1073741826.100000587710097\u0026amp;type=3\u0026amp;theater\"\u003e\u00a0show\u003c/a\u003e was big and lots of friends came.
