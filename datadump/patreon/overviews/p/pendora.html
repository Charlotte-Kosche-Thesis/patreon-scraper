It features weekly articles, opinion pieces, interviews, book and film reviews, essays, as well as original artworks, short fiction and poetry by new and upcoming writers.\u003cbr\u003eThe Pendora team consists of people from different countries who have a passion for the arts. Most of us were, or still are, students of English and literature, and having finished our degrees, we now want to continue our passion for literature by nurturing the innovative literature and arts platform that is Pendora. \u003cbr\u003ePendora Magazine features regular contributions from writers from all over the world. Our posts concern storytelling as well as aesthetics, how and why we tell stories and how we digest them, what can we learn about ourselves through them, but also the way we present them and how are we affected by the way things look.\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment it is a self-sustained passion project, but if you like the content posted on the magazine, you can support us! This way Pendora can grow and be able to pay successful fiction and poetry contributors, and maybe even be in print someday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Pendora is an online magazine with a focus on literature, film, and art, featuring weekly articles, reviews, essays, creative non-fiction, as well as original artwork, short fiction and poetry by new and upcoming writers.\u003cbr\u003eWe started in January 2016 as a small collective of writers and artists and have since grown to a platform for more creative people to showcase their work.\u003cbr\u003eWe love literature, and particularly books that have a strong sense of aesthetic, innovative fiction, non-fiction focus on the Self: literature concerned with memory and personal experiences, which strip away elements of conventional fiction in order to reveal a genuine truth within the author\u0027s Self. \u003cbr\u003eWe like films that put an emphasis on cinematography and express their themes through cinematic language (as opposed to more artificial means like exposition in dialogue). That said, we do love well-written and well-delivered dialogue. But we focus more on contemporary films that experiment and create their own distinctive look, and which we think might go on to become classics (or at least cult classics) because of their visual excellence. \u003cbr\u003eAt the moment it is a self-sustained passion project, but if you like the content posted on the magazine, you can support us!\u003cbr\u003e",
