We consist of 6 members, all of whom are super driven and passionate about performing! We\u0027ve been at it for nearly two years and have since come a long way from a group that started out as only two people, dancing in a hot field. Since then, we\u0027ve performed at many conventions, appeared as guests, and even had performances in Japan! We\u0027re always trying to improve ourselves and take things a step further! As such, we have really big dreams!\u00a0(*\u2022\u0300\u1d17\u2022\u0301*)\u0648 \u0311\u0311\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur dream is to one day be recognized as a true American idol unit both in the states and overseas. We know we have a lot of work ahead of us but we\u0027re eager to keep pressing forward! What makes idols so special is their dedication and hard work, and their ability to inspire others to follow their own dreams! We were similarly inspired, but we realized there aren\u0027t the same opportunities for people here in America. We want to spread idol culture and to forge a path for everyone that has the motivation but doesn\u0027t know where to start. It\u0027s meant so much to us to connect with talented people who share our vision and even inspired others to follow their passions, but we know we are capable of so much more!!\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re hoping one day, with your help, Peachy Parade won\u0027t represent 6 individuals but a title under which anyone who TRULY wants to be an idol can achieve their dreams. Our end goal is that others will carry Peachy Parade into the future after those of us who started it have graduated, much like Morning Musume or AKB48!\u00a0( \u00b4\u2022\u0325\u0325\u0325\u03c9\u2022\u0325\u0325\u0325` )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/b7dc/f/2018/020/c/f/what_do_i_get_by_leaveatonce-dc0kke8.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt this point you\u0027re probably wondering what you\u0027re going to get out of supporting us!
