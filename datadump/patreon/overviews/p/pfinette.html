    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eOk, we\u2019re about to get real. Let\u2019s talk about why I\u2019m setting up this Patreon account.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many people, companies, books, etc. trying to tell you how to lead (and be a leader) in these exponential times we are living in. I undoubtedly have encountered my fair share of it. From well-meant advice to people selling you snake oil. I am trying to cut through the noise for you \u2014 highlighting what worked for me. It\u0027s the reason why I created \u003ca href=\"https://theheretic.org/\"\u003eThe Heretic\u003c/a\u003e, a place where we get to work, cut to the chase and get real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit about myself: I founded a couple of technology startups, led eBay\u2019s Platform Solutions Group in Europe, launched a consulting firm helping entrepreneurs with their strategy \u0026amp; operations, invested into early-stage tech startups, led Mozilla\u2019s Innovation Lab, created Mozilla\u2019s accelerator program WebFWD, headed up Mozilla\u2019s Office of the Chair and invested into social impact organizations around the globe at Google.org. I also founded the non-profit organizations\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mentorforgood.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMentor for Good\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thecoachingfellowship.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Coaching Fellowship\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0the \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://gyshido.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGyShiDo\u003c/a\u003e\u201d (Get Your S%#\u0026amp; Done) movement. Having a vast amount of experience I wanted to give a voice to my fellow entrepreneurs about what it\u2019s really like being in this world and how to push through. Thus The Heretic was born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started The Heretic in 2012, and it now has nearly 1,000 posts and a book comprised of all the best posts. The Heretic has grown into a beautiful community of incredible doers, gravity-defying builders, heretical business leaders, corporate irritants and paradigm-shifting change makers. People like yourself. Through sharing my own experiences, the good and the bad, I hope to help inspire and motivate fellow entrepreneurs to get out there and show the world what you got! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow us to bring more content faster. It will also help us create new ways to share stories, news, advice and everything entrepreneurship! I have some great ideas and can\u2019t wait to keep The Heretic growing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart for any support, and I hope you become a part of this great community! And as a special thank you for all Patreons you will receive an invitation to our private WhatsApp community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePascal Finette,\u003cbr\u003eChief Heretic\u003cbr\u003e"
