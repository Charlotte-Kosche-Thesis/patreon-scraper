    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there. \nI\u2019m ElectricGecko, and I am a terrible salesman.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019d like to sell you on what I\ndo, talk about \u003cstrong\u003ePuck, my weekly webcomic\u003c/strong\u003e, and say why it\u2019s\ngreat and all that, but that likely wouldn\u2019t work because of the aforementioned\n\u2018bad at sales\u2019 thing.  All I\u2019m going to\nsay is that I churn out a weekly webcomic. \nThe webcomic is called Puck.  It\u2019s\nabout a \u003cstrong\u003eredheaded unemployed mother with anger management issues\u003c/strong\u003e. (Said redhead mom also happens to have elf\nears and is theoretically a fairy, but that never really plays into the plot\nmuch.)  If you\u2019re here, it\u2019s probably\nbecause you already know about my webcomic. \nIf didn\u2019t already know about my webcomic, then I suggest\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.puckcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou CLICK HERE and check it out\u003c/a\u003e before actually giving me any cold,\nhard cash.  Caveat emptor.  Just sayin\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.puckcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/patreon-tease-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo what do you get if you become a patron of Puck?   Well,\nat the moment, if you pledge the \u003cstrong\u003elow, low price of one dollar per\nmonth\u003c/strong\u003e, you get access to the growing back catalogue of \u003cstrong\u003ecrazy extra\npics\u003c/strong\u003e that I\u2019ve run on TWC over the years. \nThis includes tons of pinups, cosplay pics, gags and extra comics that\nhave been used as voting incentives in the past.  They\u2019re available for you, now with\ncommentary.  They\u2019ll be popping up over\nthe next many months in a steady stream, so stay tuned! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.puckcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/patreon-tease-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBe aware that nothing ever gets really NSFW.  Things might get a little naughty now and\nthen (with a heavy focus on bikinis), but things generally keep within the\nPG-13 limits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 a month also gets you access to the high-res image of each new Puck comic as it comes out. \u00a0See Puck as it was meant to be seen: big and clear and not squashed down to some tiny JPEG! \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to up the ante and be an even bigger supporter, $5 gives YOU a say in what Puck voting incentive images I draw for the future! The possibilities are endless!  You could suggest a joke or gag!  You could request a cosplay costume for Phoebe!  You could send me a pic of an outfit that you\u2019d like a character to wear! Whatever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want more information, here\u2019s a Five Buck Tier FAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ: How does the suggestion system work?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I collect suggestions every month or so, and we have a little dialogue about possibilities. \u00a0I usually go with the suggestions that sound the most interesting, or the ones I\u0027d like to draw. \u00a0 Some months might also be themed, so I\u2019ll give the theme (like \u2018Disney\u2019, say) and people could suggest what they want to see on that theme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ: What kind of pictures can I request?  Can I request anything?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pics will need to be Puck-related (it\u2019s not a commission thing, so I\u2019m not drawing someone\u2019s OC) and I\u2019m not going to accept every suggestion, but I\u2019ll try to work with people and accommodate where I can.  \u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll want to draw pictures that I think lots of readers would enjoy seeing, so weird and obscure cultural references would probably not be my first choice.  Also some pictures might be simply too much work.  An elaborate pic with eight characters in a complex environment might be a bit ambitious.  I\u2019d prefer to stick to single character or two-character images most of the time, though if the idea\u2019s really good, I could make an exception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ: How naughty can the suggestions be?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s just say \u2018reasonably naughty\u2019 is fine by me, but we\u2019re probably going to keep within the vaguely PG-13 confines of the existing incentive pics.   Probably. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any other questions, just ask!\u003cbr\u003e"
