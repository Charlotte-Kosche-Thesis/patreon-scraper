    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComposing music has been my life\u0027s passion. Over the last 7 years, I\u0027ve written all of the music for the video game company Arcen Games, and it has been an absolutely dream. Times have been tough for indie companies, but I hope that with the help of patrons, I can continue to compose music for the upcoming games. Thank you so much to the fans of Arcen Games, you have allowed me to live my dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a company that allows musicians and artists to be able to share their work as well as facilitate patronage between artists and their fans. It will make it possible for me to be able to continue composing and at the same time give you even more input on what gets created!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now the focus is AI War, and the tiers of patronage are based around that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- For $1/month you will get access to my patron-only feed, including weekly blog posts and updates on my compositions. I will take an in-depth look at the upcoming AI War 2 soundtrack to start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e- For $5/month, you can also join into polls for sheet music.  I\u0027ll release the piano sheet music for one track every month -- from any Arcen title -- based on what gets the most votes.  Anyone at this tier can also get access to any prior sheet music released this way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- For $10/month, you can also join in monthly livestreams where I\u0027ll spend an hour in front of the camera answering questions on a twitch stream and playing bits of songs as requested.  If you can\u0027t make the livestream, then you can submit questions in advance, and watch the video later at your convenience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe BEST part, however, is that for every $1000 generated through patreon, I\u0027ll compose a new track for AI War 2.  So, quick math, if we have 100 $1 backers, then every 10 months that\u0027s a new track for AI War 2.  Free for everyone, but with you guys hearing it first and getting an ultra high-quality file of it.  If we have 10 $10 backers, 25 $5 backers, and 275 $1 backers, then that is a new track every other month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"
