Both of us have a long history in photography, with a foundation in traditional darkroom and film techniques. We specialize in fine art photography with an emphasis on Nature and the Nude. Our strong commitment to working with \u2018natural\u2019 models, photographing in natural light almost exclusively, and employing a variety of camera types, from 35mm to 8x10 large format, contributes to the recognizable \u2018flavor\u2019 of our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of our Patreon as our new gallery space. Our goal here is to present new and interesting images, and provide you, our patrons, with an enjoyable experience. We would also be delighted to share thoughts and ideas about photography and answer your questions. Let us know what you would like to see and share your thoughts! Read through the perks offered at the various pledge levels. There may be something there that interests you - custom photo sets, original prints, even one-of-a-kind Polaroids. For over 20 years, making archival fine prints has been part of our process. We again have the capacity to make fine prints, and if you are a collector, we would like to get some of our prints into your hands!  At the $50 pledge level and above, you can choose almost any image we have ever posted to have a beautiful print made from. Thank you for your interest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtists\u0027 Note:\u00a0Although we enjoy our work immensely, it is not without effort or expense. We will continue to post work in select locations as we have in the past, but we would also appreciate your support. Since we no longer have a physical gallery, Patreon is our way of filling that void, at least for now. We have added some enticing perks, including the possibility of getting a custom print, a unique polaroid or a series of photos of a model that particularly appeals to you. If you enjoy our work, follow us and consider making a pledge or a purchase! We are open to customizing your Photosensualis Patreon experience.\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
