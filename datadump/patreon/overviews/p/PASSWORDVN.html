    "summary": "G\u0027day, mates! I\u0027m Grizz, a guy from down under that likes to write and draw and figured that it was about time I did something more substantial with what I make. I\u0027ve been writing to various levels of professionalism, increasing as the years have gone by. I\u0027d like to have a book published sometime soon, but a lot of that is confidence and... eehhhhh...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tStill! Visual Novels have been a great past-time for me, and given it is literally the combination of two things I love doing, I figured I\u0027d give it a shot. At the moment we\u0027re looking at once a month, at the start of each, to coincide with Patreon billing. This will likely change as I learn more about what works best with you guys, and with Patreon as a whole.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tTHE PROJECT\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nSo the game I\u0027m presenting at the moment is called PASSWORD, heavily inspired by a number of other visual novels both on and off Patreon.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou play the role of the main character, who at the end of their final year of schooling decide to, with the urgings of some of your friends, to have one last get together before you all head off in different directions with life. As luck would have it, through some family connections and good timing, a whole mansion is yours to stay in for a full month! Will romance flourish in your time away? Why is it that there seems to be so little staff around the place though? Expect a story that grows more serious over time while flashing back to lighthearted moments as affection flourishes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis game earns its name by the gimmick of passwords. Certain passwords will prompt alternative scenarios, advance the plot in different ways, and in some instances prematurely call a game over. Consider it a Pandora\u0027s Box sort of situation.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are plans for this game to delve into an R-18 rating with explicit nudity beyond initial launch, but as it stands, nothing has been implemented.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOverall, the game intends for there to be 30 \"days\" for each character spanning the month spent at the mansion. Upon completion, the game will be distributed to Patrons of a yet to be decided tier and above, before the commencement of the next project.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eCURRENT DEMO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Up to Day 2)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ltab3yxux8qmcca/PASSWORD-a0.02-pc.zip?dl=0\"\u003ePC Build: a0.021\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8lk7gkqt45xis86/PASSWORD-a0.02-mac.zip?dl=0\"\u003eMac Build: a0.021\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e"
