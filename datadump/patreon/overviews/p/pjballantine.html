Or perhaps\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Books of the Order\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eGeist\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSpectyr\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eWrayth\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eHarbinger\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pjballantine.com/about/about/\"\u003eOr maybe you\u0027ve read some of the other things I\u0027ve written over the years.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeck, perhaps you\u0027ve found me through podcasting. I\u0027ve been a podcaster since 2006, where I produced four of my novels as audiobooks with guest voices, music and special effects. I\u0027ve also done chatty podcasts like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theshareddesk.com/\"\u003eThe Shared Desk\u003c/a\u003e and been interviewed on a bunch.\u003cbr\u003eOr perhaps maybe you just accidentally stumbled over here and are wondering what I can offer you?\u003cbr\u003eWell, right now I am working on several novels in the Ministry world, as well as punching away on new titles, but part of me wants me really wants to justify doing experimental stuff. I\u0027m a professional writer, this is what I do for a living, and that can make that justification difficult.\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s what I want to do.\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago I did a podcast called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://scribl.com/books/P6643/erotica-a-la-carte-season-one\"\u003eErotica a la Carte\u003c/a\u003e. I gave people a choice of story ingredients (scene, main character, etc), and let them chose which ones I was to use in a story for that month.\u003cbr\u003eBut after three seasons of the podcast the boundaries became a little too much. I had reached the end of road with it.\u003cbr\u003eIt was however a lot of fun, and I loved the connection with my audience, as well as the challenge of creating like that every month. Writing you see is a mainly solo event, and I feel like I flourished in that environment.\u003cbr\u003eSo the plan is, in addition to the check-ins with my patreons, peeks behind the curtain etc, once I month I will produce something you and I come up with. Well...you collectively pick the genre and what \u0027ingredients\u0027 I will be working with.\u003cbr\u003eYou supporting this Patreon means I can be more experimental with my writing, and we can see where we end up!\u003cbr\u003e"
