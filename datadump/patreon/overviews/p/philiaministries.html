Please check us out on our website for more info!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.philiaministries.org\"\u003ewww.philiaministries.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs God has been rapidly growing this ministry and it has taken more and more of our time to devote to serving our brothers and sisters through this, we have come to a place where we need community around us to help us to be able to continue moving forward. We have been overwhelmed by those of you who have been willing to cover us through our prayer team, get involved in our small groups, help us to moderate things, and freely give your resources to support us. As you know, youtube has been highly censoring us and its making it difficult to give the time we need to it. We care deeply about our YouTube community and want to be able to continue to be on YouTube in the capacity that we are now. In order to do that we are relying on brethren like you to walk beside us and support us.\u003cbr\u003eMISSION STATEMENT\u003cbr\u003ePhilia Ministries is a non-profit organization based out of Northern New Jersey. Our mission is dedicated to seeing hearts in this generation come to repentance and be set on fire for The Coming Messiah. We live to love The Most High Creator with all our hearts, serve others as the Ruach of Elohim (Holy Spirit) leads, and exalt the Gospel of the Messiah. \u003cbr\u003eThis is the Truth. For the Most High Yahweh, Elohim, Abba (God) so loved the world, He sent His only begotten Son, that whomever believes on Him shall not perish, but have life everlasting. He who repents, confesses with his mouth that Yeshua (Jesus of Nazareth) is Lord and believes it in his heart that God raised Him from the dead shall be saved. It is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Yeshua HaMashiach), you can be saved.\u003cbr\u003eWe believe the entire word of God from Genesis to Revelation is true and relevant. \u003cbr\u003eWe believe that works are a symptom that your faith is real and alive.\u003cbr\u003eYeshua is the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father but by Him. We are all sinners in need of the grace and salvation of God. There is one name under heaven given unto men by which we can be saved.\u003cbr\u003ePhilia Ministries is a bible based outreach that serves individuals searching for light in the darkness. We\u0027re a community of believers who are chasing after Truth and pursuing a relationship with the Father. It\u0027s our desire to live out the teachings and commission of Yeshua in all that we do.\u003cbr\u003eOur ministry creates a loving, family atmosphere where believers who are seeking the whole truth can grow together. We partner with other people, missionaries, and outreaches that have the desire to serve the Kingdom of The Most High. We know that God is getting ready to pour out His spirit and truth on a remnant people in this generation, to raise up leaders and prayer warriors for the work of the Kingdom. We exist to love The Most High, to serve people, to exalt the Gospel of the Messiah, and to look to our Coming King!"
