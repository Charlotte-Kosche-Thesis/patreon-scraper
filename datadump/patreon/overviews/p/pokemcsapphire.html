    "summary": "My given moniker is Jessica Christine Evans, but I\u0027ve been known as Sapphire, Lady Sapphire, Sapphiepoo, Laffy Sapphie, and most recently Pok\u00e9MC Sapphire. I\u0027m just a weirdo trying to share my art while working my \"side job\" and being a mom/wife.\u003cbr\u003eI try to mix some raw emotion and truth in with satire and sass, because I feel we should be able to have real talk about life without losing our sense of humor about ourselves.\u003cbr\u003eMy influences range from Lauryn Hill, to Eric Clapton, to Pat Benetar, to Alice in Chains- and that\u0027s just from my youngest childhood. I LOVE Punk, Metal, Grunge, Blues, Jazz, Funk, old school and new school hip-hop, Nerdcore, Alternative, Classical, Folk and Bluegrass, I mean that\u0027s leaving some out and without touching sub-genres, so the list is exstensive to say the least.\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t beat around the bush- my lyrics will range from kid-friendly to flat out raunchy. But that\u0027s why it\u0027s important to use discretion at all times when listening to any kind of music, so I guess that\u0027s my disclaimer! Listen to it before you play it for others, and know that no matter what, my music is about a journey, not just something to make you bounce in the club."
