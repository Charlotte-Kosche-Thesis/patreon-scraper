    "summary": "Populous Map is based in New Westminster on the unceded territory of the Qayqayt, Katzie, Skwxw\u00fa7mesh \u00daxwumixw, St\u00f3:l\u014d, Tsleil-Waututh (s\u0259l\u0313ilw\u0259ta\u0241\u026c), and x\u02b7m\u0259\u03b8k\u02b7\u0259y\u0313\u0259m.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePopulous Map is working towards answering the question:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow may we make diverse, private, and unknown archives as accessible as our primarily white settler archives? How do we do this while maintaining autonomy, privacy, and reciprocity as we share these stories?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe host live events, run a timeline website at \u003ca href=\"http://populousmap.com,\"\u003ehttp://populousmap.com,\u003c/a\u003e teach school programs, bridge networks of Knowledge Keepers and Elders, and complete story and data collection across British Columbia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re grateful for you contribution but encourage you to consider funding or supporting Knowledge Keepers or Elders in your own community. Populous Map is a place to start looking for histories but if you\u0027ve already been in contact with a Knowledge Keeper or Elder that\u0027s a tremendous gift and much more important than the work we\u0027re doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpend time with that person, document, listen, and care. You won\u0027t need a place to start, you\u0027ve already found it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistory is usually one-sided. Not just in its storytelling but in its sourcing too. Things are documented with no guarantees of permission, consensus, or autonomy. It\u2019s not ethical.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Populous Map and what I want us to get from it. Yes, a mapping website is a huge part of it, something people can land on and search points they haven\u2019t had the opportunity to explore before. A place where I can share the patterns I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019ve hosted live events, gathered hundreds of volunteers, and made connections with 90 amazing Elders and Knowledge Keepers across the province. When I reflect I can see that together we\u2019ve built a community of people who are interested in history. But still, something\u2019s missing.\u003cbr\u003eFor eight years I\u2019ve been traveling across BC and the Pacific Northwest. I\u2019ve been to over 300 ghost towns and rural communities and have been slowly documenting and sitting with their people. Noticing their buildings and the things that move around each year. I\u2019ve also been thinking about and deeply researching into their shadow histories: indigenous owners of the unceded lands, minorities who\u2019ve settled or have been erased, the ecology. All in an effort to answer the most important question I have had in my tool belt: \u201cwho is missing?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe question has now advanced to:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHow may we make diverse, private, and unknown archives as accessible and researchable as our primarily white settler archives? How do we do this while maintaining autonomy, privacy, and reciprocity in the histories we gather?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe true answer: we won\u2019t, but we\u2019re sure gonna try.\u003cbr\u003eTo make an archive accessible it can\u2019t just be a website. It has to find a way to share back the history with the person who shared it first and meet them where they are. It also means doing thorough ethnography to be certain that the archive serves the person who is giving their story. Or, if that person is no longer living, does justice and can be shared with their community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTo make an archive reciprocal it can\u2019t just be a website. If having something digitized doesn\u2019t make an impact in the person sharing\u2019s life, then it doesn\u2019t make an impact. That story not only requires further permission but also clarity in what the value could be. I am more than willing to pay people for their time and make things happen that they wouldn\u2019t usually have access to.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe anthropology and history in Populous Map will not only take and store knowledge. Because only taking has created a disparity in our history that I see in every town I go. Historical erasure exists because history is disgustingly colonial and owned by its victors. Only taking erases living people and their experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo what does accessible and reciprocal history look like?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI spent about six hours flipping through the pages of an elder\u2019s scrapbooks in Ocean Falls, BC. Despite this being the most comprehensive, personal, and cared for collection from the town it\u2019s possible it will never be seen once she\u2019s gone. Of course, I\u2019m itching to digitize all 10 books, each about 70 pages. But digitization isn\u2019t a value-add if you don\u2019t know what that is. She gets it, why it could help people, but it\u2019s clear that she\u2019ll never feel the rewards of the process. 700 pages is by no means a short process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter chatting a bit more, it became clear that putting together a sign for the cemetery would actually have a much greater impact for her. Because she\u2019s spent the last 10 years carefully mapping the decaying tombstones, picking dirt out of names with shish kebab skewers, and lifting moss from the edges of the graves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe got to talking about this, her work mapping the site. When she\u2019s not there, visitors have no access to know where their loved ones are buried. She takes this personally but doesn\u2019t have a solution yet. She\u2019s wanted to make a sign but hasn\u2019t gotten around to it. The town wasn\u2019t interested in funding it either.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOf course we\u2019re going to make her a sign. Waterproofed and to be delivered this coming spring. That\u2019s an easy one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I don\u2019t expect each town to bring on a project like this, I\u2019m open to it. History isn\u2019t about one-off points, it\u2019s about how we\u2019ve connected as people. History can\u2019t just be a website.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2014Laura Cuthbert, 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
