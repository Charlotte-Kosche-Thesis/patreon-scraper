    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a tool, a virtual tip jar, to allow anyone the opportunity to support my digital ministry efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use my seminary training and local church experience to share the gospel online, so that you will grow in faith \u0026amp; spirituality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy online ministry efforts are specifically intended to make educated ministry more accessible to people and places where they are less likely to have access to trained pastors. This could be anywhere from rural parts of the United States to a small village in Thailand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use multiple platforms, such as YouNow, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, to share my experience of faith in hopes of encouraging others to a new more positive perspective of the world around them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, I post scripture images and reflections to Instagram and Facebook. I post quotes about the faith to twitter (more than just my personal account). On YouTube, I upload sermons preached in the church on Sunday Morning, along with \u00a0topical videos, devotionals, scripture reflections, personal faith experiences, and pastoral care. When time allows I also enjoy ask me anything style live broadcasts via: Facebook, YouTube, and YouNow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledged Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge of $__ /per month goes a long way in making it possible for me to continue my digital ministry efforts. It takes time, equipment, and energy to share the gospel online. The more support, the further the efforts can go. Please ensure that any pledge of support is over and above what you are contributing to your local church.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking videos as a tool for faith is very important to me but it requires time and resources. My digital ministry presence is not considered part of my work at my local church. Supporting my channel will help keep content flowing when my time is being demanded from many different places and will progressively increase the quality of production. With your contribution I commit to dedicate 10 hours a week toward the creation of digital ministry content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Contributions to this digital ministry effort are not tax deductible, nor should they take from your contribution to your local church*\u003cbr\u003e** Contributions do not earn you additional Jesus points, tickets to heaven, good karma, or even additional prayer attention (if you need prayer you don\u0027t need to be a contributor, just send me your prayer request**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is my content important?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet is an ever growing and changing tool, and people practically live on the internet these days.\u00a0There are a lot of \"Christian\" things on the internet and unfortunately not all of them present an image of God that is coherent, sound teaching, or even as good news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content is different. My content is centered on a Wesleyan perspective of faith. Meaning that instead of punishment, or fear of hell, the primary driving force behind the whole message is Grace. The moral principle that I understand from scripture is a radical acceptance of others. Other essential elements that distinguish my content \u00a0is an understanding of Free Will, \u00a0the Goodness of Creation, and radical inclusion. The Wesleyan understanding of the Gospel is especially helpful for people who are marginalized or hurting because it puts God on their side suffering with them, instead of God being the source of their pain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a pastor or person of faith, I highly encourage you to create digital ministry content as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Qualifications to talk about this stuff:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently in Seminary and will have my Masters of Divinity by May of 2017 from Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. I serve in a local church in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area as an Associate Pastor in charge of Youth Ministry. I have 7 years of full time Youth Ministry experience, and several years of volunteerism and internship before that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Family\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a wonderful wife named Kim Fields, she is the All-Star Cheer Director and Coach at North Texas Tumble and Cheer in Argyle and also does home Health Physical Therapy as a PTA. I have three children, two little boys named George and Jordan, and a little girl named Madeline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support"
