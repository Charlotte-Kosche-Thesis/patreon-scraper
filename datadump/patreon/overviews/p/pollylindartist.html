I\u2019m here to do one of the hardest things an artist can\ndo, let alone an independent spinster like me - ask for money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo here we are, welcome to my Patreon Page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pollylind.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_8505.jpg?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m an Artist who works in the medium of fabric, and\ntextiles.\u003cbr\u003eI create what I call Modern Appliqu\u00e9 Tapestries, and cloth art dolls,\nin the form of Fetch\u2019s, Faeries, and Poppets. I am inspired by mythology and\nthe natural world, as well as this wonderful city that I live in, where the\npeople and views are colourful and vibrant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI work with textiles and fabric because I don\u2019t like getting\npaint on my hands, (ha!) and I love the challenge of taking a medium that is so\noften considered \u2018craft\u2019 (and therefore less valued) and creating fine art with\nit.  I also love the challenge of getting\nthe various patterns and textures of the fabrics to look like they belong\ntogether in artworks that are rich, touchable and that people can connect\nto. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy Goal with Patreon is to have enough money so that I can continue\nto create works of art, and experiment with creating other products from my designs\nsuch as prints, postcards, badges, and doll patterns. I also want to continue\nto support myself as I build my business into something that will eventually\nbecome full time, with the added bonus of finding more people who I can create\nwonderful works of art for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pollylind.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_9297-2.jpg?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you become one of my Patreons, you will have access to the\nPatreon only side of this website, including early sneak peaks of what I am\ncurrently working on, (both original artworks, for my website, sneak peek of my gallery work, and a special sneak peak of the long term projects that i am working on). \nYou will also have early access to prints, cards, Fetch, Faery and Poppet\nfabric doll patterns and other products as i create them. \u00a0there will be a quarterly video on, works in progress, studio tour, your questions answered, and about my art process and artworks. The rewards will range from singed prints, \u00a0greeting cards\nand postcards with my artwork expertly printed on them, through to prints,\npatterns, calendars and tapestries, and early access to other products as\ncreate them, and access to some patreon only projects. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/pollylind.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_9338-2.jpg?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goals for this year are to have available prints of more\nof my work, as well as postcards and a set of greeting cards.

You will have early access to prints, cards and other things that I get made or printed. You will receive a limited edition signed print (for each year you are a patron, approximately 8x10-11x17 in size). You will also receive a yearly package of printed materials such as postcards, greeting cards, badges and or Fetch Fabric Doll Patterns. This will be sent out in October, so there is time to make some of the patterns, and/or decide what you want to keep and what you wish to give as Christmas/yule presents. \u003cstrong\u003eYou will also be entitled to a custom Tapestry of your choice for each year you are a patreon, (approximately 47cm x 67cm or equivalent).\u003c/strong\u003e",
