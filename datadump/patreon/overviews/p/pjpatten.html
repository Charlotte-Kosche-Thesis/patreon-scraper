    "summary": "I create illustrated narratives.\u00a0 Whether through stories or single paintings/drawings my goal is to create work that invites the viewer to pause and reflect. I love using this medium to share my experiences of life - the trouble, the pain, the loss and ultimately the growth. I also hope to bring attention and awareness to issues such as addiction, the many situations that being homeless presents, mental illness, juvenile justice, autism and poverty, all from my first-hand experiences of these matters. In the future, I hope to explore other, less personal but no less important topics, like modern reserve life of indigenous North Americans and the bleak situation that is the downtown Eastside of Vancouver, BC. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first graphic novel Tower25 is finished and seeking a publisher to call home.\u00a0 Pages from Tower25 along with other original art have been featured in solo shows. Your contributions will allow me to focus my time on creating art and graphic novels that explore the above mentioned themes. It will also enrich and deepen future work by being able to go draw more locations and to\u00a0 interview the people that will make up each work. I\u0027ve recently committed fully to life as a visual artist, and I\u0027m thrilled to be able to do this every day. So thank you, because your support gives life to the work inside of me. It allows me to get it out on the page, and out to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on instagram @pjamasvonpatten\u003cbr\u003e"
