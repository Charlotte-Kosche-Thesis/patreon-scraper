Would you believe it? You should see what\u2019s possible today with our Polar Permaculture project!\u003cbr\u003eI believe modern technology gives us the potential to not only feed our families and communities with better locally-grown food, but to inspire people around the world with advice and encouragement to do exactly the same thing. I\u2019ve already established a proof of concept in an Arctic town called Longyearbyen.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Benjamin Vidmar. When I set out to make my vision a reality, I wanted to offer the benefits of advanced agricultural techniques to the world, and I\u2019ve taken the project as far as I can on my own. I would be honored if you would consider a contribution to my new Patreon campaign. With your generous support, I can make this project a reality and continue to build a sustainable community we can all participate in.\u003cbr\u003eI have some exciting and interesting rewards in mind for my contributors, and I\u2019m looking forward to keeping you updated on the new projects I have planned for the future. I appreciate your support and hope you enjoy what I have to offer. Thank you for your time."
