One of the featured events at the convention was \n\u003cem\u003eAn Evening With Kevin Smith\u003c/em\u003e. It was during that presentation that the seed was planted that would one day become the Pop Goes the Culture podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EiFfzYrdW-Q\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\nWithin this twenty-plus minute segment lies the secret origin of Pop Goes the Culture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eIt took another year and a half--give or take--for that seed to sprout, but here we are. Started in December 2017, Pop Goes the Culture has grown from a weekly podcast to twice-weekly audio podcasts and video recordings of those podcasts, multiple scheduled gaming live-streams a week (along with a number of unscheduled \"pop-ins\"), and bonus episodes from influencers in the worlds of podcasting, live-streaming, and pop entertainment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Support Provides\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nAs you might be able to imagine, it takes a lot of resources to provide this quantity and level of content. Recording the conversations we were already having anyways is the fun and easy part. The planning, the hardware and software, the time spent chasing leads and polishing the audio and video in productions... and on and on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis started as a labor of love. A reason to force us to sit down together regularly and keep connected with one another. A reason to find like-minded people and bring hem into the discussion. We\u0027ve grown a lot (surprised the hell out of us) in the few short months since we started this project. If we want to continue to grow--and we do... we have some plan we\u0027ve not even gotten to yet--then we\u0027re going to need the financial resources to allow us to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust doing what we\u0027ve been doing requires money. For example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e$1/month pays for our web domain\u003cbr\u003e$10/month pays for the web domain and our podcast hosting service\u003cbr\u003e$100/month pays for the web domain, podcast hosting, and internet in the studio\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eThen there\u0027s utilities, equipment, subscriptions to the entertainment services we talk about on the shows... you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Support Gets You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nAs we launch our Patreon campaign, we have a couple of tiers of support that offer a different set of rewards for backers at different funding levels. Both tiers get you access to backer-only content here on our Patreon page, including behind-the-scenes content not available on our podcasts and live-streams. Additional tiers and increasing levels of rewards will be added as we acquire additional backers and continue to grow. You can find out more about specific rewards by clicking\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/bePatron?c=1576074\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e on the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for enjoying our podcasts, live-streams, and the content we crank out. Most of all, thank you for your support!"
