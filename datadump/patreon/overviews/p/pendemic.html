    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Garrett Green but some of you may also know me as \u003cstrong\u003ePendeMic\u003c/strong\u003e. I am currently making my first full length recording project and being original as well as staying true to myself is very important to me but it\u0027s also not easy. The music business is not about individuality, it\u0027s about following what ever formula is hot at the time. So many talented artists are pressured to abandon their creative freedoms if they want to make a living from their art and then it all sounds the same and everyone talks about the same things. We have a word for when assembly line music has nothing fresh or new to offer and that word is BORING. Which brings me to why I wanted to share my vision and music with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChange can happen with the efforts of one person but it happens faster when the idea of change is shared and supported by groups of people. Believing this to be true, I want to ask as many of you that can, to become a patron supporter of the music, the videos, art etc, I will be creating and uploading to share here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you take a closer look at my page you will see how you can give at different levels of support and the rewards we have for you based on whatever level of support is comfortable for you. Now I want to say that if you can\u0027t afford to support with money, the art is still here free for everyone to enjoy so don\u0027t let that stop you. However for those of you that can give a buck or two for each upload (or whatever you can afford) that creates the resources necessary to make music and art uploads the way I believe they should be made and not the way a popular trend demands I make music. Thank you for watching and listening. The info you need to support is below.\u003cbr\u003e"
