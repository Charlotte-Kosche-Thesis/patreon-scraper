    "summary": "We are Phil and Julie McNeish from Roanoke, Virginia, USA. We live with our three fur babies, Casey, Cody and PattiCake. We began making short humorous videos of our dogs \u2018talking\u2019 about their daily lives. We started posting the videos on Facebook and YouTube and the response has been overwhelming. We have millions of views on Facebook and YouTube and over 176,000 followers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started making talking videos with our dogs and posting them on my Facebook page I was just trying to give my friends and family a little chuckle. Little did I know that my friends would share it on their pages and our views would spiral up into the stratosphere. Our first \u0027Casey on a diet\u0027 video now has over 27 million views. My private page was getting so much traffic that we decided to divert the traffic to a new page-\u0027If Dogs Could Talk\u0027. We began to see that we could spread the laughter around the USA and to countries as far away as New Zealand and Australia.Our fans even started to ask for merchandise like calendars, coffee mugs and T shirts with our pet\u0027s faces on them. So, we began to offer these items.\u003cbr\u003eFrom the beginning of our journey one of our goals has been to donate part of the proceeds of all of our merchandise sales to a local animal rescue shelter called Angels of Assisi. The work they do to offer low cost veterinary services to low income families who simply cannot afford the costs associated with owning a cat or dog is nothing short of wonderful. They also provide bags of food for those who are struggling to feed their fur-babies.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0As we become more involved in \u0027If Dogs Could Talk\u0027 we find ourselves spending more time making videos and writing scripts of what our canine babies are going to say next. Besides this, we are following our social media pages, responding to comments, developing new merchandise, running our online store, shipping merchandise around the world, processing payments through PayPal and maintaining our website-all of which incurs substantial expense to us. We are doing our best to provide quality merchandise at a reasonable price to our fans. This means that we make a very small profit on the sales on our online store. \u003cbr\u003eThere isn\u0027t much financial return for all of the hours we devote to the dog\u0027s stories...but we can\u0027t seem to stop ourselves from carrying on this wonderful story we\u0027ve started. We\u0027re always getting comments like \u0027Don\u0027t ever stop making videos\u0027 or \u0027We just love Casey\u0027. You may have seen a recent comment on YouTube where one of his fans has proposed marriage to Casey. A lot of people have come to expect to hear from Casey and his siblings on a regular basis- Thus, the Patreon page. If we want to continue our story, we need fans who are willing to become members or Patrons as we take the time and effort to continue making our videos and offering an on line store and website and all the while donating to charity.\u00a0 \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003eWe are just blown away with the support and fan base that has been generated from what began as a cute little one minute video to make our friends and family chuckle. Thank you again for considering membership.\u00a0 \u00a0If you become a patron, you will join a small group of supporters who are the reason we can continue to spread the love and laughter on \u0027If Dogs Could Talk\u0027."
