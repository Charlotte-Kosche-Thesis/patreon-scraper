    "summary": "In the fall of 2015 Dylan \u0026amp; Jen, an everyday, average married couple, decided that it might be interesting to make a podcast about the pilot episodes of our favorite (and not so favorite) TV shows. Finding that the market wasn\u2019t \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely \u003c/strong\u003esaturated at the time, our decided to go for it. And so, Pilot Inspectors was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, two years and over two hundred episodes later, we\u2019ve decided to get into porn. Your generous donation will help buy cameras, lighting equipment, and a bewilderingly wide array of outfits and sexual paraphernalia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust kidding, but we do need your support. We\u2019ve loved doing this podcast for the past two years, and we hope to keep creating the content that we hope you will love for years to come. But podcasting costs money, even if it is just two people recording on a laptop in a living room. We pay for all of our equipment, hosting fees, and promotional expenses out of our own pocket. You can help support us by meeting at a crossroads at midnight and signing a certain document in the blood of a black ewe, thereby committing your immortal soul to forever serve us in this world and the next. Or you could become a patron, make a small donation each month, and provide yourself not just the smug satisfaction that you\u2019ve done a good deed (you could even tweet about it!), but also some actual rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour continuing support will help us not only bring you the great content that you already love, but also help us make our podcast better with new equipment. We also hope, with enough support, to increase how frequently we bring new episodes of Pilot Inspectors to your feeds each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u2019re a new listener or a long time fan, we appreciate the support that we\u2019ve gotten over the past two years. And we hope you\u2019ll put your money where your ears have been and become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you."
