Currently, I work across a wide range of creative skills, and it can be really hard to focus on building up the areas of work that matter most to me. Being a freelancer means there are peaks and troughs in my income and work frequency, which can be really hard to predict, and even harder to ride out when times are tough. I sometimes take jobs with clients who I\u0027d rather not work with (for ethical or personal reasons) in order to pay the bills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in my art enough to think that it\u0027s possible to shift more of my focus towards that, and I know I have the discipline to make it happen. I just need the income to get me started, so that I can have more time to create beautiful work to share with you. Supporting an artist can be really rewarding, and I\u0027m determined to make it worthwhile for my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5706fbbc859fd05eb6c793a5/5a713d910852295f5a28c406/5a71407353450aa858847380/1517371513233/trad_samples.jpg\" style=\"width: 366px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get if you become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs my patron, you\u0027ll get a first-hand look into my works-in-progress, sketches, and doodles. \u00a0You\u0027ll also get product previews, pre-order options, and access to awesome giveaways!
