    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI am a father of a nine-year-old girl. \u00a0Lately I have been debating what the right age is to introduce her to social media, and how to introduce her to it. \u00a0We have all heard the stories in the news about sexting, bullying, stalkers, etc. \u00a0So I decided to do some deep research into the social media apps being used by children so I could know what really goes on in that world, and if it is a safe place for my little girl to spend time. \u00a0What I discovered was shocking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe average typical parent has absolutely no clue what their children are doing behind closed doors with their phones. \u00a0They think they know, but they do not. \u00a0Parents need to wake up and become educated on this topic. \u00a0I am confident if parents really understood what was going on, they would think think twice about their children having a smart phone or unsupervised access to the internet. \u00a0I know many parents would tell me they trust their kid, their kid would never do anything like that, etc. \u00a0I don\u0027t like to say this, but parents have a tendency to be naive when it comes to their own kids, myself included.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it is painful to hear, but it is true. \u00a0That is why this campaign is called Painful Truth. \u00a0No matter how good and sweet and lovely your young son or daughter is in the real world, they have a secret persona in their social media world, a world where there are no rules, only freedom and peer pressure to do some of the most vile things imaginable. \u00a0Parents would become physically sick if they saw how their children behave online. \u00a0Girls as young as seven years old are being trained by social media to prostitute themselves in order to gain popularity. \u00a0Boys are being taught that it is perfectly acceptable to treat girls with as little respect and courtesy as you could possibly imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the social media apps are designed to encourage this behavior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, if you are a parent, help me sound the alarm about this. \u00a0Even if you have no interest in providing patronage, that\u0027s okay, just as long as you share the content with others. \u00a0Right now it is a dirty little secret that only the tech companies and the children themselves are aware of. \u00a0There are very few people who truly understand the extent and depth of the filth our children wallow in every day on social media. \u00a0I want to share this information with as many people as possible. \u00a0It \u00a0is not pretty, it is not a nice subject to talk about, but if nobody talks about it nothing will happen to fix it, so I intend to speak truth no matter how painful it is to speak. \u00a0I am not alone. \u00a0There are others trying to spread the word. \u00a0We all need to work together to shine a giant spotlight on this problem. \u00a0Nobody wants to talk about it, but every day a fresh crop of boys and girls is entering this disgusting world, and parents can\u0027t fight back until they understand what is really going on. \u00a0That\u0027s what this campaign is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI welcome constructive feedback. \u00a0You can reach me at painful.truth.patreon@protonmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
