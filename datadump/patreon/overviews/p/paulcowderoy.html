You buy my albums, watch my videos, come to my shows, and you let me pester you on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my\u00a0sophomore album about to arrive I thought it would be the perfect time to get everyone involved. The album was produced by\u00a0California\u0027s very own Grammy winner \u0027Philip Allen\u0027 (Adele - Someone Like You). \u00a0Patreon is how we plan to fund this project and hopefully many more albums and videos to come. If you\u0027re unfamiliar with Patreon, it\u2019s kind of like\u00a0Pozible but instead of pledging $100, you pledge a couple of dollars for each new piece of content that\u00a0I release. Whether it be a song or a video. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be able to follow my passion full time, devoting all of my day to creating music, videos and art that grabs your attention. Stuff that makes us all feel good about the world. So If you are interested in supporting me, you should check out our different reward tiers, but\u003cem\u003e please\u003c/em\u003e do not feel obliged to give\u00a0me your hard earned\u00a0money. My videos will always be FREE and the songs will always be available for download digitally, we\u00a0will continue\u00a0to make these for you. If you have a\u00a0small amount\u00a0to spare each month, and want to become a bonafide patron, then I will be forever grateful. Either way, I am so lucky to have you guys as fans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003ePaul\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*For more details on how Patreon works (becoming a patron, privacy, payments, etc.) you should check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003ethis handy-dandy FAQ page!\u003c/a\u003e :)"
