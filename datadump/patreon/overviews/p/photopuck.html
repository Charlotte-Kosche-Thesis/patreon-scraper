I\u0027m Sean M Puckett.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been enchanted by light ever since I was a very small person looking at the sparkles of the winter sun reflecting off fresh snow. It\u0027s my earnest hope to create photographs that capture some of that enchantment and to share them with you both online and in the form of beautiful prints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI use a wide variety of equipment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI tell my students \"light doesn\u0027t care how much you spend on it\" and that philosophy follows through everything I do. I use whatever camera, lights, studio equipment and printing methods I need. And I\u0027m happy to share the details of my results-first research with you in technical Q\u0026amp;As, how-to workshops and behind-the-scenes info.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI make digital carbon prints.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy current work in photography is primarily centered around exploring the possibilities of the digital carbon print. This is a process that uses home-blended carbon pigment ink to create exclusively black and white prints that are exceptionally detailed, lusciously smooth, rich in tone, and 100% archival. I talk more about this in my blog posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI photograph people, places and things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy typical subject matter is an equal mix of architecture, landscape, textural abstracts, figure studies, and thematic portraiture. My image style is typically formal, balanced and well composed, but with elements of discord that explore how carefully breaking rules is much more interesting than just blindly following them. I believe that true art is found in the borders between order and disorder, between right and wrong, and, of course, between light and dark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI believe art is about sharing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePhotography is never a solo art form no matter how some auteurs try to make it seem that way; like every other form of art it is truly a dialogue between artist and audience. Without an image, there\u0027s nothing to see, and without a viewer, there\u0027s no experience. We\u0027re partners -- each of us just as important as the other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to travel more and photograph more people, places and things. I\u0027d also like to upgrade my printing process, and become more sustainable as an artist by handling more of the bills. To help, you can purchase prints without becoming a patron in my public store. But, even better, you can support me and my artwork through Patreon -- and I have some exciting rewards for you if you do, including free prints!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003efor stopping by, and thanks even more for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.\u00a0visit my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://photopuck.patternbyetsy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprint store\u003c/a\u003e to see everything that\u0027s available right now!"
