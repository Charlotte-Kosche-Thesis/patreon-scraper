    "summary": "It is hard to convince someone to give you money. Especially for entertainment. Consider this though, when you decide to either give or not. If every subscriber gave me 1 dollar I would never need ad\u0027s. That would mean I would need a donation of 1 dollar from every subscriber once a year. No ad\u0027s, no promotions, no product placements. Not everyone can do that, and I understand. But for those that can, those that can donate 1, 5, 10, or 20 monthly, one time, or yearly, it would push my channel even higher. I use all donations to improve my Channel, by upgrading hardware and software. I give away 10% of my earnings every month. If you can give anything, I would be greatly appriciative and it would help to fuel my work and my dreams. Thank you\u003cbr\u003e"
