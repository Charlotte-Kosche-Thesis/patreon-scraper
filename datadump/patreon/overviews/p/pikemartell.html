    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my page here! I\u0027m a writer of queer fantasy and romance. As a transgender writer from Puerto Rico, I write to fill the void I felt when I was younger. I write mainly about women of all types who love women, transgender persons living their best lives and saving the world, and fantastical creatures living in the modern world. Your support means so much to me, because all I want is to fill the world with stories that I never had as a teen and young adult. I currently self-publish on Amazon KDP, but future possibilities are not written in stone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current WIP is a novel called Emissary, about a trans man who is given magical powers and a mission from the fae. It takes place in a universe I call the Faetouched World, which is also the basis for the tabletop RPG I\u0027m designing."
