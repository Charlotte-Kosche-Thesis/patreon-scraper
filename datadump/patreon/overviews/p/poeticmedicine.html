    "summary": "\u003cblockquote\u003e\"Mary Ellen is not only a talented poet, but a woman of great spiritual and humanitarian strength who knows how to reach often marginalized students. She\u0027s the real thing and brings to the table a way and a presence, a special touch, which I can only term a calling, a gift, a kind of magic. A woman of indisputable mettle with a generous spirit of shared purpose and joint humanity that her writing and her very life embodies.\"\u003cblockquote\u003e-Joseph Bathanti, Former NC Poet Laureate\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We are here to midwife each others\u0027 dreams,\" a dear writing teacher told me. And dear reader, full of longing, full of love, this little online community helps me to write, and teach, to help shape and nurture the dream. Poetry is a way to connect us with the \"anima mundi\" - the soul of the world - to begin to get that small sense of our place in the family of things. It brings us to full presence and engagement with the world and our story. It is a deep drop, a \"sacred pause in the day,\" when things long buried come close, come near to us, and we begin to see a dim light on the path. I use intuitive and poetic healing as a tool for soul recovery, to gather up the broken bits that we have lost along the way. Like gathering sticks in the woods, we find small pieces and place them on \"la chispa\" - the ember of our hearts - and give it our own breath in order to bring it back to flame, and invite the world in to warm itself by the fire. I believe great stars line the road home to our true belonging, and that the angels and the whole world is conspiring to help you live your highest good in the world. I know this to be true. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon helps me to spend my days doing what I do best - it lets me be about my work. But that work is bringing Poetic Medicine to you as well!\u00a0 When you sign on to Patreon, you will get weekly poems, insights, writing prompts, and even group and personal poetic medicine sessions. THANK YOU!"

     "about": "I am a poet, a single mother of five children, a teacher, and a healer. I have backpacked across the world working as a community organizer and social activist and writer. Now I homestead on an old tumbledown farm in southern Appalachia and teach poetry as a path to healing and growth. I am a poet-in-residence at the VA hospital working with veterans with combat related PTSD. I also teach poetic healing to postpartum mothers, women with trauma, and just everyday folks like you! I was awarded the 2016 Resilient Woman Leadership Award and have been nominated for the Pushcart Prize. I live wide open and write as a form of love. I especially love sharing everything tender and astounding that I know and learn with you, and Patreon allows me to write, teach, and bring poetry to those who either can\u0027t afford expensive classes or wouldn\u0027t go near the arts or poetry otherwise. And still put food on the table for my children. Thank you for your interest in my world and being a part of this beautiful, crazy journey with me.\u00a0",
