Creativity is all about the energy that we put into the world that taps into our passions. It\u0027s not necessarily being able to produce a specific form of creative work, but it is all about engaging in, exploring, and expanding in your experience with creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat lights your heart up?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMusic?\u003cbr\u003ePoetry?\u003cbr\u003eDance?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the energy that emerges from experiencing AND expressing creative flow is connected to our senses, and it can enlighten our experience of ourselves and the world around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think that you are not a creator, or are not creative, then try this on for size.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider yourself a co-creator.\u00a0 You help co-create the world with your thoughts, which influence your actions, which direct your interactions with everyone around you.Positive thoughts and intentions more likely lead to positive actions and interactions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany times, positive thoughts and actions are influenced by how we take the world in, how we process it or if we make time to embrace beauty and joy.\u003cbr\u003eMore often than not, we experience great joy and resonate with beauty when we are directly experiencing a product of creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eif you feel like you don\u0027t have the know-how or skill set to produce a work of beauty, you can still help support that work in a way that it impacts the world positively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to co-create this possible space with me,\u00a0to assist the creative flow\u00a0 as it moves to stay active and alive and accessible to more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
