For audience, organizations, agencies etc to see and for\nfilm makers to reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you get exclusive access to films that we will post here, and benefits such as online access to Film Festival selections, early access to new content and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou don\u0027t have to visit the Festivals or even live in the same country to see the films \u2013 you can watch the selection online!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you don\u0027t know us and like to to know more, read on and you will :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://berlinliberi.com/onewebmedia/_IMG6507.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Festivals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe started out with one simple ambition that we have stuck with - to screen and promote true independent films!

Because of the accomodation cost we pay for\nwe have had film makers and film organizations traveling to the festivals from Iran, USA,\nCanada, France, Tunisia, Spain, Singapore, Argentina and Finland to\nonly name a few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://berlinliberi.com/onewebmedia/_IMG63772.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIllambra\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs many things\nIllambra grew as a natural branch from the Festivals. While Youtube\nand Vimeo are great for certain content they are free to watch and\nnot curated and when it comes to Subscription Streamingsites after\nNetflix, HBO and some other giants the field is really, really thin. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe realized that the audience who missed the screenings have no opportunity to watch the films and also that after the festival run has\nended for a film maker there is not \"home\" for the film to\nland in.
