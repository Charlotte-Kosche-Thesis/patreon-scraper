I want to create more, improve and expand myself, but my time is reduced due to making commissions for a consistent income. Making this Patreon will give me the support I need to create free content available to the public in a more consistent way. \u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81711756/chibi11.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 256px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBros just wanna have fun!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to expand the universe of my characters and create the adventures of my twins Arno and Celio in their world populated with chances of having fun. If everything goes well, I have an idea for making a full colored page for each update if I get to make it each to weeks to once a week, and you\u2019ll follow them in their adventurous travels. This means that a lot of characters will be born and added to this universe and all of the sketches and designs that I come up with will be included in the packs for all of the supporters. The comic is up and running right now! so don\u00b4t forget to check it out. Also it\u00b4s a public release so everyone can see it thanks to your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCats Love Water is the story of Arno and Celio, twins that are on vacations at the mistery Golden Dolphin island. they will find out in their adventure and free time, that there is more in the island than it seems to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be an adult story, with mistery, drama and sex included.

If I receive enough support, I could work on my personal pictures and projects more as a serious job! And of course the comic(!!), which will make Arno and Celio come to life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make one update per week or every two weeks so you won\u2019t receive more than 3 updates per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to update at least once a week on weekends with everything I\u0027ve drawn in that time span.
