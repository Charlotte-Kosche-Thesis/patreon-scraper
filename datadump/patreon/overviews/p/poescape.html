He has been recording and producing music for years. He recently started a music production company, \u003ca href=\"http://blastyblastmusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBLASTY BLAST\u003c/a\u003e. He is a fantastic musician. (See \u003ca href=\"http://www.nickdandthebelievers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNick D\u0027 \u0026amp; the Believers\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://bellaruse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBella Ruse\u003c/a\u003e.) He owns a music teaching studio, \u003ca href=\"http://www.musicologielessons.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMusicologie\u003c/a\u003e, in Columbus, OH with his wife, Kay. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOriginally this project was created as a way for me to learn about recording, sound design, and sound editing. It turned into a joint creative project that combined Joseph\u0027s musical skills and my love for performing poetry. The poescape pieces released in 2014 are from this era of the poescape project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Current Project:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e My husband, Jackson Nickolay (actor, director, designer, musician), is joining me to continue to create poescapes and other performance poetry pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon thing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nA way for people to support what we\u0027re doing by becoming patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\nA way to distribute our work.\u003cbr\u003e\nA way to do this sustainably as an ongoing project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPoescapes will be posted in the \"Creations\" section found above. You\u0027ll be able to listen to them on here or even download them for free.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\nPoescapes can also be found on my \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/poescape\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e[soundcloud]\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe poescapes we make are available to you for free, whether you\u0027re a patron or not. And we will keep making them whether you become a patron or not. But having patrons allows us to do this work better. The money would pay for us to hire other artists to work with us (yay collaboration!), buy better equipment (yay better quality!), etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd it lets us know that there are people who want us to keep doing this work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you want to support us, there\u0027s a button at the top of this page, left-hand side: \"Become a patron.\" Click it. You may pledge as little or as much as you want. Even $1. Every little bit helps. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe pledge you make is per poescape that we release. And at the moment, the plan is to release one poescape per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully someday we\u0027ll be able to create more often than that. Once we hit that point, if you\u0027re worried about it, you\u0027re able to put a cap on how much you give us total per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf, for any reason, you need to stop being a patron, that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for you support, whether you\u0027re a patron or just a happy listener. We are so excited to share these creations with you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e[further updates and a new intro video coming soon!]\u003c/h3\u003e"
