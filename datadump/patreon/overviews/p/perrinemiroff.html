But it turns out, even that\u0027s not enough. When I get home from the workday, I want to keep at it and review even more movies, talk about even more news stories and produce some fun vlogs about the things I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube channel is chugging along nicely and I\u0027ve greatly enjoyed building and interacting with the audience, but as I well know about myself, it\u0027ll never be enough. I\u0027ll always want to continue growing, continue covering the biggest blockbusters and also the lesser known independent releases you might not be aware of. I want to share my experience going to conventions, festivals and any other movie or TV related experience I can track down. And, of course, I want to give my cat Dewey as much screen time as possible as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out, it isn\u0027t easy achieving all of those goals and then some on my own. If you\u0027re already a subscriber, you\u0027ve already helped me out. If you\u0027ve ever shared a video I made on a social media platform, I appreciate that as well! But I decided it was time to extend the support to Patreon as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I want to do is keep sparking smiles and talking about the things we all love so if you\u0027re inclined, feel free to support the channel on Patreon. Really looking forward to interacting with more viewers through the rewards process!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for checking out this page and for supporting my YouTube channel!
