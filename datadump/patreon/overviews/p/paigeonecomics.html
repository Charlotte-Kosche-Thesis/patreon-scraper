Despite looking for resources and courses on art business, it\u2019s really an underserved community; especially if you\u2019re a young artist trying to dip your toes in and get used to the basic concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I\u2019m creating this comic series for my Patreon. I want to provide my Patrons with a series all about creating an art business. I\u2019ll share the hard lessons I\u2019ve learned, the useful skills I\u2019ve developed, and the best tools that have made the difference in running my own art business. My goal is to make it easy for artists to take charge of the business of making and selling their art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of every month, I\u0027ll post a calendar of events so you\u0027ll know when to expect the comics that month and what events I\u0027ll be tabling at or attending.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month will have one long comic about running an art business and one short comic about a tool or technique I\u0027ve found useful. These pages will be available to view for only $1 so every Patron in the $1+ tier will be able to read them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $5+ Patrons, in addition to access to the comics, I\u2019ll be creating motivational coloring page PDFs every month that you will receive digitally. These will be designed to encourage you while you make your art and business plans! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to stay organized and beautify your workspace, $10+ Patrons will receive the upcoming month\u2019s desk calendar print. This 6x9 watercolor print calendar page will only be available to backers at this tier. This tier also includes access to the comics and coloring page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out this Patreon and I look forward to sharing what I know with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"251\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7jb9szINeEkERYK8FqxREepAZM3vEf3IuO0CdoRIG1etnrdP5OUfZgb_pyXI9zMymCUn2Mi54Gjzwo6o8ljiauWZyfUhEcalXRm0nqjzXL5I-0Um0poXTszHXhYTjVbUStWKQgk8\" width=\"512\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work can also be found here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rampaigehalsey/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rampaigehalsey\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://halseyland.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/paigehalseywarren\"\u003eyoutube\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PaigeHalseyWarren/\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PaigeHalseyWarren/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
