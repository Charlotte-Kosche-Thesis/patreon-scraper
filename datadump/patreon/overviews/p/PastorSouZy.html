    "summary": "Over the past two years I have had the privilege to minister to people all \nover the world online through video games. People log into a website \ncalled Twitch.tv and while they watch me play video games I am able to \ntell them about God\u0027s love for them and take passages from the Bible and\n make it relevant to their lives. Over the past year I have had the \nprivilege to lead over 440 gamers to follow Christ. I am able to connect\n with them one on one through Skype calls and pray for them, encourage \nthem with God\u0027s word and just be there to talk to them. Many of them \nhave gotten plugged into their local churches, have gotten involved and \nhave even gotten baptized. The phrase I keep hearing again and again is \n\"Thanks Pastor for being willing to come to where we are. If you had not\n come to us, we never would have come to you\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.8 billion gamers \nworld wide are spending 30 billion hours every week. This means that \nmost gamers are not spending time in our local churches, so what if we \ncould bring the church to them? After doing this ministry, GodSquad \nGaming for a little over a year we decided to take it to the next level. On March 24th at 8pm we launched the world\u0027s first ever church for gamers, GodSquad Church where we host weekly service where gamers \nfrom all over the world can attend a weekly church service. There will be worship and a teaching from the \nBible that will be relevant to their lives where gamers can begin an \ninteractive relationship with Jesus. From there we can also encourage \ngamers to fulfill one of the main purposes of our ministry, getting \npluged in to their local churches where they can get involved and begin\n to serve. GodSquad Church is never meant to replace the local church \nbut to be a first step to reaching gamers who would have otherwise never\n had heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in watching my personal stream Sun-Fri tune into \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/pastorsouzy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.twitch.tv/pastorsouzy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo check out the GodSquad Church channel check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/GodSquadChurch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.twitch.tv/GodSquadChurch\u003c/a\u003e"
