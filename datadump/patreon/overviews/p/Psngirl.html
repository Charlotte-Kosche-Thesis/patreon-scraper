I loved it\nbecause of the interaction with the awesome community that was\nforming as the channel grew!  As some of my long time subs know, over\nthe years family health issues forced me to quit more than once! \nAlways coming back in the end because of the massive and overwhelming\nsupport of you guys and I can never thank you enough for that\nsupport!  Then the worst thing that could happen, happened.  I became\na widow in August of 2017.  Feeling the most lost I have in my life,\nI took a very long hard look at things and there was one saying that\nmy husband always had, \"If you are unhappy, CHANGE IT!\". \nSo I looked even harder at my new life and not being happy at all, I\nthought to myself what can I do to \"change it\"?  The\nanswer?  \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYOU!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \ud83d\udc9c\n I set off to start my change and that change is doing what I love\nFULL TIME!  That\u0027s right!  I quit my job and I\u0027m going at YouTube and\nTwitch full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWHAT\nDOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell\nthat means I\u0027m picking up where I left off, but in full swing and\nbetter than ever before!  New art, designs, animations, new capture\ncard, updated software and more time to edit videos like I always\nwanted to do, but never could because of my job.  It also means\nreturning to streaming on Twitch and Youtube at the same time like\nbefore and as luck would have it, my ISP just updated their upload\nand download speeds \ud83d\ude42.\n It also means I can have an actual streaming schedule for once! \ud83d\udc4d\n (Schedule to be announced)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\nDO YOU NEED FROM ME?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSUPPORT!\n Like with any channel or streamer, they are there because of the\nsupport.  I\u0027m not gonna lie, this is a little scary for me and with\nall that has been happening with YouTube lately the revenue just is\nno longer there like it used to be.  So by branching out to 2\nplatforms and like I said before, support on those platforms, whether\nit is by pledging on Patreon, watching the YouTube videos,\ntipping/cheering/subbing during streams,  \u003cstrong\u003eWE\u003c/strong\u003e\ncan do this!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eI\nAM READY!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nam so very ready and excited to make this journey,  this new chapter of my life\nand the challenges that will come with it!  I hope you will join me! \nIf you do, please give your feedback, suggestions and ideas in the\nPatreon only feed!
