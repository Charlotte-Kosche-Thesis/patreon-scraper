The gear, wear and tear is expensive, the miles are endless, the editing is longer, and to top it off, I create almost all the music in the final presentations. The process is a mountain of labor, but extremely rewarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons are people who support artists so the artists can focus on their creative works. Michelangelo, Da Vinci, and many modern artists we appreciate today had patrons.\u00a0This site provides a safe and popular platform for many generous people to offer support to artists they like. Through a donation that may seem small to you, in aggregate for the artist, becomes a patronage that directly enables them to continue to create and increase the quality of their work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE WAY IT WORKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEach month, your donation will automatically be charged to your credit card.  In turn, You will gain access to all sorts of recurring rewards I have to offer.  Tiers begin at a dollar a month and you can quit anytime. \u00a0Check out the rewards on the right. I have a feeling it\u0027s gonna be mutually beneficial fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMucho obliged,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHank\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
