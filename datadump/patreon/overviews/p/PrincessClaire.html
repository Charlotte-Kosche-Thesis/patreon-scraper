Every $100 pledged will allow us to create an additional page per month. Patrons who have pledged money will get to see new finished comic pages 1 week before they are posted anywhere else. Patreon does not allow adult content unless it is Patron only, so even though the content is free, non-patrons will need to find it through other portals.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, I have two chapters firmly planned after the Introduction is finished, the second of which features a great deal of futa on futa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nThis comic centers around Princess Claire, a petite space elf princess who is cursed with a massive dick. With her star empire invaded by the mysterious Zarg Collective and all the males of her species wiped out by an engineered plague, Princess Claire and her trusted entourage will venture across the stars in an effort to rebuild (and repopulate) what remains of her imperial holdings. In order to do so, she\u0027ll have to battle ravenous space monsters, manage a set of unruly nobles and inspire loyalty in her followers- all while being repeatedly sodomized in an effort to harvest her royal semen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis comic will regularly feature\u003c/strong\u003e: futa, hyper futa, hyper balls, anal, pegging, femdom, penis worship, futa on futa, amazons, exhibitionism and humiliation.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eLess regularly, this comic will feature \u003c/strong\u003e: monsters, tentacles, orgies\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eLong Term Plans\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe long term goal for this comic is to become a pulpy, serialized dickgirl sentai space opera. At the end of Chapter 2, I will begin offering voting options for the story content of every chapter after that. These options will be based on characters created by Duchess level patrons. Chapters are 25-30 pages.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those who are already fans of Princess Claire and are disappointed to see she is the only futa in the comic, don\u0027t worry. Her guards and several other characters will become futa in the next chapter with tons of hardcore futa on futa sex.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eDuchess Tier Reward\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAs it stands now, the Duchess level reward has several components that I think are important to go over in more detail because it has some long term aspects to it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) The pinup reward\u003c/strong\u003e.  I originally had this as a raffle, but Patreon doesn\u0027t like raffles as they seem like gambling. Instead, pinups will be offered in the order pledges were made. If you were the first person to pledge to the Duchess tier, you get a pinup first. I have added onto this aspect of the reward, though. Nobody cared about the $25 sketch pinup reward, so I have rolled it into the Duchess level. Now, one person will get a pinup, and the third person in line will get a sketch pinup, and then going down the line. I am skipping over the second position so as to better spread out the pinups and not front load them.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) The side character reward\u003c/strong\u003e.  I want people to know that their characters are present in the comic beyond just their featured chapter reward. For some characters that have been discussed, this has been rather straight forward and will entail a few panels when appropriate. For other characters, they are much too exotic to show up in every day circumstance. What I would offer those characters is not a character appearance, but references to their exotic nature and the fact that the characters are aware of them. If this is not enough, or if some people feel short changed, I am happy to work with them on a creative solution.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Featured chapter\u003c/strong\u003e. Each Duchess gets the chance to see their character in a featured chapter where their character will appear for a guaranteed 10 pages. This chapter will establish this character as not a main character, but a critical part of the plot. These chapters will not begin until chapter 3, which is 60-70 pages away. That is a long wait and something I have tried to make clear to all the Duchesses. I will try my hardest to increase my monthly page contribution to 2 pages instead of 1 as I have been considering for a while, but I can not guarantee that as I\u0027m already paying $140 a month and putting in a lot of work to promote the comic. We are currently very close to 4 pages a month.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) Voting on featured chapters\u003c/strong\u003e. Each Duchess chapter will be voted on by all the patrons as to which one to do first. If a Duchess needs to stop pledging after they have invested several months already, we do not throw the chapter or the character away. When voting comes up, the top 5 Duchess chapters with the most money invested will be considered. That way, we encourage long term investment, but we also dont penalize Duchesses for dropping out. I\u0027ve also tried to make each Duchess chapter feature a different fetish that people have often requested of Princess Claire. Currently, this include: size growth, self suck, bondage, urethra play/milking machines and cum inflation. My hope is that as pinups and sketches come out of the Duchess characters, patrons will learn more about them and what their chapters will be like.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
