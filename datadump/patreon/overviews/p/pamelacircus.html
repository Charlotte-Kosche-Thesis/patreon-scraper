    "summary": "I have been performing as a dancer and circus artist for over\nten years. I was trained as a competitive gymnast, started dancing in high\nschool and then continued into aerial arts. After graduating from Stanford\nUniversity with a degree in Cultural and Social Anthropology I moved to New\nYork to dance. I then started working at the University of California, Irvine as\na research associate studying socio-political inequalities and conflict and how\nto create peace and sustainably livelihoods for vulnerable communities. Our\nresearch areas were primarily located in Africa. Four years, multiple\ninternational trips and promotions later I left my day job to perform full time\nin Le Reve in Las Vegas. Le Reve is the first show created by the legendary\nCirque Du Soleil director, Franco Dragone, under his own company name.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPrior to joining Le Reve I had created a number of solo\nacts, duos, performed in dance companies and tours and began setting up my own\ntours. After performing with Le Reve I felt something was missing. Although I\nhave more than enough skills as a technical acrobat that\u2019s not all there is to\nme. Performance for me is about creating and communicating, not just\nregurgitating for a particular audience in order to bring a larger profit to the\nwealthy. Upon leaving Le Reve I started performing all sorts of gigs while\ncreating my own work and growing to the point that I am at now. I performed on\na German cruise ship, starred in dinner shows, did commercial work and live television\nbut found it difficult to maintain a reliable income while allocating enough\ntime to creation and training. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am on Pateron for three reasons:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e1.When a circus performer is performing every day\ntheir body is not physically capable of also putting in hours of physical\ncreation work and advancing their skills to keep up with the industry; therefore\nthey require support from their community to pay bills and stay alive while putting\nin the blood, sweat and tears it takes to create incredible work. \n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e2.Artists and performers often have to hustle and\nthen really fight for their living wage. Because as circus has become\nincreasingly popular and we do not currently have a union professional standards\nhave been thrown out the door and undercutters have come flooding in. This\nmeans I have to spend a tremendous amount of time getting booked on a gig and\neven more time advocating for a decent rate. This method of fundraising is in\nno way sustainable and completely counter intuitive to artistic production.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e3.MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! I am here to provide a\nplatform for my friends, supporters, fans and soon to be fans to be part of\nsomething great by supporting my artistic vision and company mission.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAudiences often only see a completed act (typically about\nfive intense minutes of performance). They don\u2019t often see or comprehend the hundreds\nof hours that go into creating that act or show. This involves: skill training,\nrehearsals, costuming, music creation, etc. In addition, just like any self\nemployed person, self employed circus artists do not have employer sponsored\nhealth plans or liability insurance, but they do have mortgages, car notes and\na general need to eat. Although the quality and accessibility of circus arts\nhas advanced tremendously, the funds allocated towards these artistic\nadventures and plummeted to shameful levels. Rehearsal space, training and\nproper circus equipment is expensive and we artists need your support!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e"
