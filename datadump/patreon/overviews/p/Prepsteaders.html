    "summary": "Thank\n you so much for making your way to our Patreon page. We have some \nreally big plans for the future and we\u0027re blessed to have you to be a part of it\n all. Our intention since the day we began was to make weekly videos that educate and inspire people regarding how to prepare for the days ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much confusion about the \"End of Days\" here on earth.\u00a0 It is easy to forget just how many times we are told in scripture to not fear anything except God himself.\u00a0 There is no real security in this world, but to know Christ, and then to be found standing up for him through every day, every moment, no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime is short, but there is much to do before it is over.\u00a0 In this waiting time, we have grown quite reliant on modern conveniences and food suppliers and entertainment and comfort.\u00a0 Many of us have never had to live without ....well, anything! That is a very precarious place to be, believe it or not.\u00a0 The wise will take notice and prepare for days ahead that may not provide such ease.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are just a few important topics we believe are useful to learn:\u003cbr\u003e-How to garden (organically, with heirloom seeds \u0026amp; homemade compost)\u003cbr\u003e-How to forage (loving the variety of edible plants around us!)\u003cbr\u003e-How to cook good basic meal (with AND without electricity)\u003cbr\u003e-How to preserve and store foods\u003cbr\u003e-How to hunt and trap and fish\u003cbr\u003e-How to defend oneself and one\u0027s family and home\u003cbr\u003e-How to rescue water and make it useable\u003cbr\u003e-How to raise animals\u003cbr\u003e-How to survive in the city during a disaster\u003cbr\u003e-How to sew\u003cbr\u003e-How to make your own cleaning products (naturally)\u003cbr\u003e-How to prepare for eternity (not just tomorrow)\u003cbr\u003e- ....the list is hundreds of topics long, but you get the idea\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with God\u0027s help, and your support, this little website was started called PREPSTEADERS.com.\u00a0 It is at the intersection of\u00a0 prepping and homesteading.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxMBB_UPbCM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGroup 1 Crew says it best in the words of their song Forgive Me.\u00a0 Look it up when you get a chance. \"Lord, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not scared cause You\u0027re holding my breath\u003cbr\u003eI only fear that I don\u0027t have enough time left\u003cbr\u003eTo tell the world that there\u0027s no time left.\"\u003cbr\u003e"
