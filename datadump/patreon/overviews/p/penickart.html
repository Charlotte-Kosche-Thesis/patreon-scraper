I\u0027ve drawn storyboards for advertising and film, done illustrations for all kinds of things, and created comics for people like Devil\u0027s Due, Boom Studios, and Marvel Comics. As you may have noticed, I\u0027m a fan of the Oxford comma. I also seem to have this strange aura that says to people, \"Hey, I\u0027m friendly! Please feel free to ask me for directions!\" My greatest passion, however, is writing, or more precisely, telling stories from inception to final product. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here: to bring the stories that have been kicking around in my head for years to life. With your help maybe I can finally dedicate all my time to my real life\u0027s calling and entertain you in the process. Thanks for stopping by! \u003cbr\u003e",
