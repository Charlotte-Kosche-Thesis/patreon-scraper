We\u0027re based in Western Massachusetts and we play thrash\u00a0metal music in the\u00a0vein of the 80\u0027s greats such as Slayer, Exodus, and Vio-Lence.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been at this band thing since 2004. \u00a0It started off as a one-man project by our ex-vocalist Tom, which then inexplicably gained traction on thrash forums and blogs around the internet before developing into a full blown band in 2009. \u00a0To date we\u0027ve\u00a0put out five albums and played hundreds of shows on tour across the US and Canada while forging on with a DIY ethic, doing all of our own album artwork, recording and mixing, and most of our own tour booking.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcast Mosh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://public.lichkingmetal.com/images/PodcastMoshImage.jpg\" style=\"width: 240px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eAbout two years ago we all got into various podcasts, particularly Harmontown and Rooster Teeth. \u00a0We figured hey, we\u0027ve already got the recording equipment - why not try doing a podcast of our own? \u00a0And so, Podcast Mosh was born.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe went into this without any idea of what to expect or if we were even going to keep going with it. \u00a0Turns out, we REALLY like doing the podcast - for us, it\u0027s fun to just get together and talk music, TV, movies, video games, and other stuff that we don\u0027t really have a musical outlet for. \u00a0On top of that, it\u0027s turned out to be a pretty cool way to keep in touch with fans and let them know what we\u0027re up to, giving them a little peek into the behind-the-scenes band stuff.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHowever, given that we only have time to get together once a week, it\u0027s difficult to justify spending big chunks of time, effort, and gas money on another goofy thing that we put up on the internet for free when we should be practicing, recording, and writing instead. \u00a0That\u0027s why we\u0027re launching this Patreon campaign. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to do Podcast Mosh on a regular basis and keep it free for everyone to listen, but also give people the opportunity to support us financially if they like it. \u00a0Patreon lets you choose how much you want to donate per episode, and we give you perks based on that amount - kind of like a recurring Kickstarter. \u00a0Some of the rewards for being a Patron include chatting with us on the podcast via Skype, getting episodes early, or having us play your music on the podcast and giving you feedback on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWe\u0027ve got a few goals in mind that we can achieve if we reach certain amounts of monthly donations. For example we would love to do Podcast Mosh while we\u0027re out on tour, or do episodes more than once a month. \u00a0Further down the line we would like to add a video stream to the podcast. \u00a0Your contributions can help us make those goals happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWe hope you all enjoy Podcast Mosh as much we enjoy making it, and we hope you dig it enough to become a Patron. \u00a0Cheers and thanks for your support.\u003c/div\u003e"
