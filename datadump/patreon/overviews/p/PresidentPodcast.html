    "summary": "Here at President Podcast, we really only have one goal. My single goal is simply to educate, in an entertaining fashion, my listeners about the lives and backgrounds of the executives of the United States.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for history, as I am sure many of you do, simply because you are reading this. I consume books by the bag full, and podcasts and audio books with a voracious thirst. When looking for this type of content, I found that there is a bit of a shortage. History is a big subject, and some great podcasters that I admire have begun to fill in those gaps. Since this is the type of content I was looking for and it just didn\u2019t happen to exist yet, then I should step in and do my part to help create an abundance of free audio education for people just like you and me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this podcast, I want to take you through the lives of each person to bear that great mantle of responsibility of leading the nation. I aim to help you, the listener, see them as people, to strip them away of their reputation and celebrity and portray their humanity. I hope that you feel their struggles, their moments of indecision, and their failings as people and leaders. I also want you to feel their successes and their triumphs.\u003cbr\u003e"
