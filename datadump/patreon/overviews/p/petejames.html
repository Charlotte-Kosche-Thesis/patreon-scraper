And I want to share this feeling with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I will mostly offer here are intuitive guitar recordings. This is my favorite form of expression. I pick up the guitar, and just let my hands do what they want to. When I play like this, it feels like a channeling of sorts to me, and I cant repeat what I\u0027ve played unless I study the recording, since it\u0027s entirely spontaneous.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just getting going here and want to welcome and thank you for checking out my page.
