I run a \u003ca href=\"http://pawstoconsider.com.au/Paws%20to%20Consider%20Home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esmall Pet Care business\u003c/a\u003e and also look after the \u003ca href=\"http://www.nadacaustralia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAustralian Division of NADAC\u003c/a\u003e (North American Dog Agility Council).\u00a0 Most of my daily life is spent with dogs and I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my passions is teaching.\u00a0 I hold agility workshops and agility seminars but there never seemed to be enough opportunities to work with my students.\u00a0 They wanted more and I wanted to give more to them.\u00a0 I decided to create podcasts for my existing agility students.\u00a0 You can find all my podcasts on my \u003ca href=\"http://pawstoconsider.com.au/Podcast.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and in \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/paws-to-consider/id1021016022?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e and right here in my \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/PawstoConsider?ty=c\"\u003epatreon posts\u003c/a\u003e where you can pledge support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my little idea to venture into the world of Podcasting evolved from addressing a need of my current students to something much more.\u00a0 My aim is to provide a unique way for agility enthusiasts to gain access to me and the material I teach whenever and where ever they want to.\u00a0 I envisage people armed with their smart devices out on the training field with their dogs.\u00a0 They tune into one of my podcasts and get access to training exercises, lecture and video demonstrations etc....\u00a0 Perhaps they are enjoying a coffee break in their busy day and tune in to get some ideas for a training session later on.\u00a0 It is all about accessibility.\u00a0 I would love to be able to do podcast interviews with some of my mentors who are great dog trainers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am pretty new to Podcasting and I am excited about where this idea will take me and how it will be received by my listeners. So please tune in and if you like my shows let others know about them.\u00a0 If you are able to consider donating by \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebecoming a patron\u003c/a\u003e that will help me with much needed resources to keep producing more podcasts.\u00a0 Ideas are free it\u0027s creating that costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to check out my patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarm Regards\u003cbr\u003eShirlene\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "After more than 20 years as a Registered Division 1 Nurse, Shirlene \nleft nursing to concentrate on her passion for animals and establishing \nher small business Paws to Consider.\u003cbr\u003e\n    Shirlene has always enjoyed the presence of animals in her life, \nfrom family pets to horses and other livestock on the farm where her \nGrandparents worked and lived.\u003cbr\u003e\n    She has been involved in the sport of dog   agility since the mid\n 90\u0027s and in 2005 has been actively   involved in the introduction, \npromotion, establishment and   administration of NADAC in Australia.  \nShirlene\u2019s passion for   facilitating NADAC is apparent to all who meet \nher.  Through the   facilitation of NADAC in Australia Shirlene has been\n fortunate to have   mentoring and guidance from the most amazing people\n within NADAC.    Through this mentoring, predominately via email and \nher trips to the   USA, Shirlene has evolved as an agility handler.  As \nher skills   developed so too did a new passion.  Shirlene has always \nbelieved that   with the acquisition of knowledge comes the \nresponsibility to share that   knowledge with others.  With a Clinical \nNurse Specialist background and   a love of teaching others it was only \nnatural that she began holding   private agility lessons.  One thing led\n to another and Shirlene is now a   popular seminar presenter in her own\n right. \u003cbr\u003e\n    Shirlene\u2019s training philosophy is centred on building a strong \nand   solid foundation.  A foundation that will support and enable the \ndog and   handler be the best team they can be together.   She believes \nto be   that team there needs to be a combined effort between both dog \nand   handler, and that each team member needs to be willing, \nenthusiastic and   able to think and perform their roles.  The handlers \nrole to visualise,   create and support a path for their dog making sure\n that what they do   creates impulsion for the dog in the right \ndirection.  The dog\u2019s role is   to correctly perform the obstacles \npresented on the path created by   their handler.  The foundation is \nwhat holds everything together and   stops it all from collapsing.",
