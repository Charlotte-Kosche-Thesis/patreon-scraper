We began development before the official Vilous Staff formed the Gold Ring Gazette (GRG) and before they wanted to finish writing The New Canon. A representative from the GRG has stated to\u00a0us directly that the Old Age Canon was abandoned and that the Project Freelance Games team had free reign over artistic decisions regarding their interpretations of The Old Canon. We are required to mention that we are not directly affiliated with the GRG and that the game we are making is a fan-made creation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eEveryone knows of the Great War that has existed between the Reono\u00a0and Shigu clans; the two races of Sergal who inhabit Vilous. The fighting over territory has spanned many years across different generations and has been a bloody and violent endeavor. Spears, axes, swords, and maces were employed in battle; barbaric methods of killing and torture were utilized by both sides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago, both sides were heavily wounded; neither clan is stronger nor more powerful than the other, as time has proven. Should the fighting continue, it is possible both clans will be wiped out entirely. A time of peace was accepted by both sides on the grounds that territory controlled by the North belongs to the North and territory that is under Southern control belongs to the South. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it was written, it was done. The war has seemingly\u00a0come to an end with no result of the fighting other than the loss of life and malice for one another bred to the younger\u00a0generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou were born in the South, in the Sailzane Desert to clan Reono. You\u0027ve grown up to become a beautiful woman with no care for the war earlier generations have endured; you have a peaceful and calm demeanor about yourself. You care for others and the others\u00a0have great respect for you because of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis summer season has been harsh with higher-than-average temperatures. This has caused a lot of local water reserves and oasis to dry up. Your small village is suffering just as much as the crops they\u0027ve been trying to grow. Your neighbors, your family, and you are dehydrating and starving because of the inability to grow the water-retaining plants necessary to survival in the Sailzane. Without these vital resources, you shall suffer and perish along with your\u00a0village.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have made the decision to head North, to the more lush and hospitable Tatola Plains to grow crops for your village in secret. The haul will be plentiful and the reward of your life and the lives of your family and village will be immense.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not an unusual tactic for your people; establishing secret\u00a0farms in the North has been done before. The problem comes in with the uneducated counterparts of your generation believing that everything with grass is theirs and everything with sand is yours. The lines have become blurred and there has been much fighting along the border of the two lands as tensions continue to rise. Each aggressor will claim their territory line is five body-lengths that way while each defender claims the line is five body-lengths in the other direction. Small skirmishes have occurred between the two clans without much political attention. All of these small skirmishes have begun to add up and the North has started to take notice of the frequent Southern encroachment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour farm is seized one late night and you, captured. You\u0027re taken as a prisoner to the nearest Northern encampment, which happens to be a fortress. You\u0027re thrown in the jail. It is unclear of what will happen to you? Will you be executed? Will you be left there to die? Are the nightmare tales about the Shigu true? Will you be tortured for information, or used as a live archery target, or be kept alive for worse? After exhausting yourself with thoughts of terror, you manage to get to sleep for a few hours. You wake with a startle at some small sound in your cell. Upon examining your cell, you come across nothing different and, unsuccessfully, try to get some more sleep. Just as the sun begins to rise you realize your attempts to sleep are in vain and begin to get out of your excuse for a bed. As your feet plant on the floor, you realize you\u0027ve stepped on something. A small envelope with a mysterious key inside and an even more mysterious message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[ABOUT THE GAME]\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project was originally called \"Vilous: Soldier of the North.\" Upon receiving some inspiration and reviewing what the plan was for V:SotN, the team came to the conclusion that our game wouldn\u0027t be fun and the message that was trying so hard to be broadcast with V:SotN was likely better for some other medium or game. Because of this, we scrapped our story progress on V:SotN and wrote something that the team agrees is infinitely better than the original. (The original was about a 1.5 out of 10.) The original idea for V:SotN was to relay an idea and belief that was personal to the lead developer and shoehorn a story around it and to force it into the Sergal universe because Sergals are cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be able to see why this would have failed. We were making a game to make a something and we wanted Sergals in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, we are making a game. We developed and followed a method of creating a believable and enjoyable game, all focusing on a captivating story. World density is paramount in this situation because we believe that is what makes a good game. A massive open world could have a story that connects all of the locations together, but we want to make a dense world where everything has its own story and can connect itself together. It is incredibly important that everything in our game has a purpose; as an example, you should be able to look at a character\u0027s desk and be able to tell something about them. Our ultimate goal is to make a world that is like an onion; you can walk through the same area five times at different parts of the story, and have that one area be explored five different times; the world has layers and will be seen differently as you get deeper and deeper into the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur new game, which has yet to get a new name, is going to be a third person puzzle and exploration game with elements of stealth. This game is going to be very heavily story oriented and will feature some very nice details such as dynamic character fur, procedural clouds, day/night cycles, and weather. The world will try to breathe and move around you as you\u0027re experiencing our story.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
