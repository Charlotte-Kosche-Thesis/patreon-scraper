    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m pululon and make an adult game was always one of my greatest desires. Well, now I started to work on it and my objective is take into the visual novel genre and make the game that I always wanted to do. I mean, with the options and gameplay that I think that would improve the experience in this kind of games. This is it, I\u0027m here on Patreon presenting my stuff and hoping that you people like it and support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Build -\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/19000751\"\u003eBuild 11\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 Tier Build\u00a0 -\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/18551772\"\u003eBuild 10\u003c/a\u003e Next release 05/31\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree release! \u00a0-\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/19000868\"\u003eBuild 10\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe games will be a mix with horror/mystery and erotica. You will have blood, kills, monsters, sex, and a lot of more stuffs. Everything in a non linear way and with a lot of options ahead. The style is black and white to help reach two objectives, one, give a manga/comic feel of the game, two, get a old atmosphere like an old horror tale.\u003cbr\u003eYou play as Aisha Diamond, of that is what you believe, since your character isn\u0027t Aisha Diamond, she or he awaked one day in the body of an exuberant girl, some of her memories were fresh, some are hidden, the only thing for sure is that she/he knows that she/he isn\u0027t Aisha Diamond and now she/he have to live her life. But things won\u0027t be that easy, Aisha\u0027s body is quite erotic, in fact, people turn around when she walks, people wants to talk with her, and she feels that she can use some kind of advantage over people and situations thanks to this. The more erotic she is, the more power she have.\u003cbr\u003eThe general idea is that you are living as Aisha while trying to figure out who you were and what is going on, since you start having strange dreams. The game will be played in a non linear style, you have an area to explore, people to talk and events go get fired by with your own actions. At the same time I want to build a world where you can take on different activities, with different ways to solve them. Other thing that I always wanted to do is expand the gameplay experience with this kind of games, for that I made some minigames to solve different situations, minigames that can be modified by bonus, situations, stats from other characters and stats from your character.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://image.gxzone.com/images/0/a/0a73f7a35ae.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you can do in this game?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already build a lot of thing for the game. The idea is build a system that let me add content fast so I don\u0027t have to be doing everything from scratch. But, what is available now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNeighbourhood map with 20 locations to visit\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e30 characters\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA time system, with days divided in 6 parts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA dialog system to interact with the characters that you can find in the locations.
