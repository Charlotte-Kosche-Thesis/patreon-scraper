That means, nonstop submissions, public readings, editing roles, writing retreats, and conferences so that my pretty face is insanely visible. I want this year and every one that follows to focus on the creation of choreopoems that speak to marginalized communities and poetry that uplifts and illuminates the realities of \"bein alive and bein a woman and bein colored\" (Ntozake Shange). The more support, the better this work becomes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong this journey, my fans have been large and loud, and I\u0027m so grateful. I can\u0027t stop writing simply because the love and support of those who have championed me from day one would never let me. None of this would be worth it without you."
