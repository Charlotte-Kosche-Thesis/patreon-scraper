    "summary": "I started \"PsychedSubstance\" because someone had to. Someone had to stand up and put their face behind this taboo practice that needs to end. I have witnessed first-hand how dangerous misinformation can be. In regards to drugs, the wrong information can cost you your life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention that our society doesn\u0027t help people to actually be safe with drug use. Most governments would rather imprison an addict than recognize they have an illness which needs treatment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur society fails to acknowledge that telling someone, \u003cem\u003e\"Don\u0027t Take Drugs\"\u003c/em\u003e doesn\u0027t work. It\u0027s not what realistic harm reduction looks like. People need to be told the truth about these substances, and how to use them safely. Otherwise more unnecessary death is going to accumulate and people will suffer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf more people understood some very basic things, such as the importance of reagent testing, we\u0027d see far less harm associated with drug use. But this basic safety information isn\u0027t being taught anywhere. You don\u0027t learn about how to \"test your drugs\" for safety in school.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s equally as troubling, is that most people still believe ridiculous propaganda that originated decades ago. In order to help people view both drugs and users in the proper light, we need to remove the stigma. For example, the vast majority have no idea that alcohol is just as much of a drug as cocaine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, I can\u0027t do this alone! The single greatest reason I\u0027ve been successful with my channel is \u003cem\u003ebecause of you\u003c/em\u003e. Your pledge means I am able to continue educating people on the safe use of substances as my full-time gig. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you value the type of content I make on youtube, then pledge to me on here. Everyone who makes a monthly pledge, no matter how big or small, is personally part of my mission to not only educate people on the safe use of drugs, but to destroy the unnecessary stigma that\u0027s plagued our world for too long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e Rewards will be fulfilled (e.g. names added to video credits) on the start of the following month. \u003cstrong\u003eIf you are a recent top contributor\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eplease send me a message through patreon as soon as you pledge\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eto let me know what name/alias you would like me to display.\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you :)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

One of them is an interactive journey through the stages of each popular Psychedelic (LSD, DMT, Ayahuasca, Shrooms etc) \u003cem\u003efilmed with professional animations and effects\u003c/em\u003e to take you as close as humanly possible through the journey without needing to take the actual substance or leave your screen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen this goal is reached a huge chunk of this money will be funnelled back into the channel each month. I need to treat each episode like a short film and hire editors, actors and effects animators to make this happen without these huge projects disrupting my usual flow of content.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eIt is extremely hard to find the time to work on big stuff like that\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 Patreon is really the only way to make this easier at this point.\u003cbr\u003e",
