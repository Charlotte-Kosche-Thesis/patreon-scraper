So having the job that I have really helps my anxiety or I would try to do something a little different but making my own schedule means I can be at any event that I want.\u003cbr\u003e Please help me make this dream reality! I love all of my fans, my patrons and my followers more than you will know. Any time I even get two followers it makes me very happy!"
