So, I\u2019m asking you to help me be Paul Bielatowicz, and in return I pledge to give my all to the music I create, and to keep you closely involved every step of the journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron you\u2019ll be joining my team and playing a crucial part in making my music possible. The end product will be ours - we\u2019ll share the process together, we\u2019ll take the journey together. As a Patron you\u2019re as much a part of my music as I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecoming a patron gives you a unique insight into the creative process - I can\u2019t think of anywhere else music fans have been given access to an artist\u2019s inner thoughts and creative process quite like this.  You can expect my Patreon page to include: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThoughts on where my music might go next\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSharing ideas of what I\u2019ve got planned\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe inner workings of the creative process\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSeeds of ideas\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideos from the studio documenting the whole creative process\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind the scenes tour blogs \u0026amp; videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLive Q\u0026amp;A sessions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePolls for YOUR input\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever watched \u201cmaking of\u201d documentaries or behind the scenes DVD special features?  Well it\u0027s a bit like that only in realtime, plus you have input into the creative process and the satisfaction of knowing that the art being made wouldn\u2019t exist if you weren\u2019t involved.  So, in a very real sense, its not just me creating the music, WE\u2019RE creating it together. \u00a0It\u2019s our music. \u00a0And you get to be a part of the creative process from start to finish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is not just another social media site. \u00a0Social media posts are essentially forms of promo, that\u2019s not what you get here. \u00a0I\u2019m not looking to sell anything - this is all about creating something. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much does it cost?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI spend a large portion of my working life on tour.  On the road I always enjoy meeting music fans and often they\u2019re kind enough to treat me to a coffee, a beer or even take me out for dinner.  With this in mind I\u2019ve designed my patronage tiers around these kind gestures of hospitality.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiers start with the price of a coffee once a month, and go up to the cost of a mid-price concert ticket once a month. Of course different levels of patronage come with different rewards, but every single level will make a huge difference to being able to create my music with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading.  I would LOVE for you to join me on this exciting journey into a brand new creative world.  This is an opportunity like no other at a time like no other - let\u0027s create something AMAZING together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://paulbielatowicz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13434890_1044131668973422_3362534480544430989_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
