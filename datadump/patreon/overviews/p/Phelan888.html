I am an acrobat, inventor, educator, and visual artist. For past 5 years I have set out to \u003cstrong\u003ebuild a Next Generation Fine Art School\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027d like to call this center, the Triple Infinity Arts School. \u003cstrong\u003eI am funding this by creating art and taking donations.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThis is one of a kind campus that will provide the labs to create fine art also encourage new product\u00a0prototypes that will help the environment and humankind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 This art school will be different from traditional art schools. We will have a light assessment of the artist and start their training based on the artists vision. Traditional art schools start with art history. I do believe in the benefit of art history, I do not believe it is beneficial for an inspiring artist to have to take 2 years of learning it before they are offered an hour of studio space and hands on education. I believe experimenting is where some of the best ideas of the world come from. We will strive to push the forefront of fine art creation. Along with teaching hands on technique we will also teach real world marketing, to let artists loose on the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I am raising funds for the purchase of a main property and construction of several workshops on the same campus. Past 5 years\u00a0I have obtained the majority of machinery \u0026amp; tools for the first 4 workshops to be built. The tools and machines I have gathered so far are for workshops of woodworking, metalworking, ceramics, and printmaking.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eBackers that help get will get literature\u003cstrong\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003evideo content and actual gifts. The content and gifts will incorporate fine art across many mediums such as Woods, Metals, Ceramics, Fiberglass, Electronics, and Printing. Depending on reward tier, I will send thank you gifts every 2 months. Nonetheless every backer will receive updates on new projects and world art news.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The possibilities will be infinite! A school where the curriculum is taught to encourage open innovation in fine arts. The curriculum is to teach artist a deeper technique in their creative vision and provide them with the tools training and studio space.\u00a0 An example of what we will provide is, teaching painters woodwork so they can build their own canvass or, allowing a metal artist to forge their own metals to weld. Our goal is to house several workshops to make almost anything... The center will be offered to students age of 15+. An emphasis in the school will be developing young artistic minds that show above average visual art skills and provide them training with access to workshops also. Workshops will be supervised by our teachers for educational and practical reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Over 15 years of my life, have been spent studying, adapting to different varieties of art skills, schemes, mediums, and trades. The drive and passion created by art is an inspiration that I admire and wish to share with others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Mission statement:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo provide the people of earth a chance to manifest their dreams in visual art and products that support a positive and healthy lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWorking in fields such as:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t - Design\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Sculpting\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Fine art production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Industrial design\u003cbr\u003e\n\t - Study of Electricity and magnetics\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Prototype process\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Manufacturing production\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Music and Theater\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Advertisement consulting\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTop Goals:\u003cbr\u003e\n- Provide Scholarships\u003cbr\u003e\n- Allow less fortunate individuals that show talent, to gain their potential.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Enrich Society, with new inventions and visual art.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Help other nonprofit and charitable organizations (with art donations).\u003cbr\u003e\n- Encourage fine art and new products that make life on earth easier.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Train qualified individuals on equipment and encourage experimentation once qualified.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Pass along artistic knowledge learned over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sales of art that I personally make, along with the help of backers will fund this school. I feel qualified to start this learning center for multiple reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I am a \u00a0Director of a Gymnastics school. Along with running the operations of this school I am a Head coach. For 12 years I have taught kids ages 5 to 18 in gymnastics and athletics. Summer camps at the gymnastics school always have included craft, theater, and dance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I am full time artist. Very well rounded in multiple trades: Graphic Design, Painting, sculpting, wood working, metal working, plastics, ceramics, printing, circuitry, mechanics, programming, robotics, and textiles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0 I am a business owner. I started a printing company 5 years ago with $500.00 and am still in business today. I started the business only to fund Infinity Arts and Production School.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have seen some extraordinary minds within the gymnastics school that were not able to reach a full potential due to lack of guidance and opportunity. I want to provide the space and opportunity for the next great painter, great inventor, and good faith visions that can change the world to better the next generation and environment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vast oceans of creation, within everyone, are available to mold our future in a good hearted way. Together, we can shape the future for open expression and wonderful imagination that can never be restrained!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
