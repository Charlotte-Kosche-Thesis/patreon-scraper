    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Lillian Cauldwell. Since 2006, I have been the owner and operator of Passionate World Radio Network LLC, an Internet talk radio network that strives to enlighten, educate and entertain its global audience. PWRN provides quality content and current information that our listeners can use immediately in their personal, spiritual and business lives. Our programs are heard every day around the world by colleges, universities, government institutions, private businesses, Fortune 500 companies, and a host of other forums, as well as individuals such as you. While our listeners cover several key demographics, we are particularly strong among female listeners and the millennial generation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of our shows on PWRN tackle issues that are considered taboo or otherwise not worthy of discussion on traditional media outlets. That\u0027s what makes us unique. Not only that, while most talk radio formats stir up noise and blather (but little else), we offer solutions to our listeners so that they can make informed decisions as they leave their mark on the world. In that respect, you might call us \"The NPR of the Internet.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePWRN also provides a conduit for voices not otherwise heard in this noisy world. Our total audience around the world is more than 1 million listeners per year and growing, while many of our alumni hosts and interns have gone on to be heard on CBS, NPR, Blog Talk, Blab, Spreaker, YouTube, and other media outlets. Over the past several years, PWRN has also branched out into web casts, live video streaming, and educational courses making us a true multimedia platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout its 10-year existence, PWRN has prided itself on providing free content to our listeners while remaining as independent as possible. We have never charged our \u00a0listeners for content, and we never will. But, it costs money to produce programs of high quality, and the costs of production have continued to rise, especially in recent years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I am asking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you listen to any of our programs on PWRN, and either liked what you\u0027ve heard or learned something useful that made a big difference on your life, family or profession...please consider supporting our efforts by becoming a patron of our show through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does Patroen work? Patrons agree to make a small donation to their favorite content creators every time they release new content. In exchange, we continue to provide new content while offering rewards in return. In a way, it\u0027s like giving a tip...and, just as important, provides value for value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a look at the various pledge options on the right of your screen. For just a few dollars a month, you will help us continue to Educate, Enlighten, and Entertain our global audience of 10 million (and growing!). And \u00a0if you\u0027d like your voice to be heard on PWRN by hosting your own program or podcast, we can make that happen, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much...and remember, please keep listening!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
