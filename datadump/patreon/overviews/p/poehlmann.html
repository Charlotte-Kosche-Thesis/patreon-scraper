    "summary": "I was diagnosed late in 2014 with stage four lung cancer, as a young, healthy non-smoker with no family history of this condition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I move through my journey toward total wellness, I have begun working on an action plan for restructuring the way that people view cancer and the way that they approach it in their lives. This is not just for those of us living with cancer, but also for the people around us. The paradigm has changed dramatically in the past decade and continues to evolve, but public understanding has not kept pace with modern medical science or the realities of survival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCancer is NOT a death sentence and should not automatically be treated as one. A positive mental and emotional outlook is essential for successfully navigating the journey. But equally important is learning how to advocate for a patient\u0027s own health and understanding the pros and cons of both Western medicine and alternative or nutritional therapies. There is no shortage of misinformation out there, especially online, and there are charlatans and unscrupulous predators posing as medical professionals ready to exploit the fear of cancer patients for their own financial gain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have interviewed numerous individuals who have traveled their own path to wellness, as well as various people who had family members go through their own cancer journeys. Taking these stories as my basis, I began to research the techniques they discussed and compared them to the many treatments touted online. Then I vetted everything through the filter of science and reason in an effort to understand the value of different approaches as well as the likelihood that they actually work or whether they cause more harm to the system. Setting the record straight on the conspiracy of the Medical Industrial Complex and enlightening readers on the passionate research being done by so many dedicated scientists is increasingly important. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book I am creating will be a guide, at least in part, based upon my evolving memoir as experimented with and structured in my current blog. I will try to keep at least parts of my blog open to comments, so that it can also be a place for people to discuss their own experiences, ranging from physical issues or remedies to their spiritual approach to success.\u003cbr\u003e"
