    "summary": "\ud83d\udc0d Hello everyone! My name is Python (or Craig) and I have been creating Let\u0027s Play gaming videos since December 2010! I have been fortunate enough to sustain myself as a full-time YouTuber since June 2015, which is truly amazing! I would absolutely NOT give up this hobby/job (or as my viewers call it, a \"jobby\") for anything in the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ud83c\udf33 I play a wide variety of games that I enjoy such as Minecraft, Terraria, ARK Survival Evolved, Call of Duty (BO3 \u0026amp; WW2), Destiny 2 and more. All of this you can find on my YouTube channel over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/PythonGB\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ehttp://youtube.com/PythonGB\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\ud83d\udc8e I have had many messages from my viewer base over the years asking whether they could donate towards my channel/content and I\u0027ve always refrained from it because I\u0027m personally more of the mindset that I\u0027d much rather you\u0027d spend your hard earned money on yourself to make your own lives better. To echo that, while I have set up this Patreon page, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI absolutely MUST insist that you make sure you can still sustain yourself in your own lives first before thinking of supporting me!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I appreciate the thought but please only pledge if you can afford to!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ud83d\ude03 The other thing to mention is I don\u0027t really have a lot of time to be handing out rewards and such. This is more a case of if you\u0027d like to support me financially because of YouTube\u0027s constantly declining CPMs (revenue per 1,000 views), demonetisation, adpocalypses and whatever else YouTube winds up throwing at us, that\u0027d be epic! You\u0027ll get a couple things here and there and my eternal gratitude of course! Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page, thank you so much for pledging if you do and I\u0027ll see you in my videos!\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e==================================================\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2753\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - Why don\u0027t you have a XXXXX server for your Patreons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eA \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- The most likely case for any question like this is because I don\u0027t have the time to run the server and I don\u0027t want to promise that I\u0027ll be active on said servers but actually not be active at all!\u00a0\ud83d\ude03\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - Will my pledge rewards disappear if I stop pledging?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eA \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- The only pledge reward that will remain is on Tier 3 where it specifically states that your Minecraft pedestal with your head on it WILL remain even if you stop pledging/paying!\u00a0\ud83d\ude03\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - When will rewards be processed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eA\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - Payments for any pledges are taken at the beginning of each month so as long as payment has processed and has been successful, I will process rewards shortly after!\u003cbr\u003e"

It\u0027d be uncensored, 18+ and NOT kid friendly. By achieving this goal, I\u0027ll be able to run this channel and have financial security since YT\u0027s \"advertiser friendly\" practices will more likely than not mean that any videos to go out on the new channel will probably be demonetised!",
