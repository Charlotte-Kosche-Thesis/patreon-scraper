I have big plans for the coming months, so it\u2019s\ntime to get moving!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt all\nstarts right here, where I\u2019ll begin building a collection of content and\ngathering ideas for the next phase. It\u2019s my goal to create space and content\nthat\u2019s as smart, accepting, and diverse as you are, and much more positive than\nthe world at large.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the\nbeginning, that will include posts on things like creative pursuits, culture,\nhome life, chronic health issues, work, and other interests we might share. You\u2019ll\nalso be the first to read my short fiction pieces \u2013 many of which will offer a\nmagical view on the world we think we already know. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo if you\u2019re\nabout that intersectional, creative, and slightly chaotic life, and NOT about\nnaysaying or oppression, I invite you to join in. No matter what you look like, how you\u0027re shaped, or what you\u0027re able or unable to do. No matter who you go to bed as, or who you go to bed with. No matter where you come from, what language you spoke first, how you define family, or how you define yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI hope\nyou\u2019ll become a patron and support this soon-to-be-ambitious endeavor. Check\nout the goals and rewards to learn more about what you\u2019ll be funding if you\nchip in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of all,\nthank you for helping bring this dream to life \u2013 for nine-year-old me, and for the me you\u0027ll meet today.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWelcome to\nPlum Inspired. I can\u2019t wait to see where we go next!\u003cbr\u003e"
