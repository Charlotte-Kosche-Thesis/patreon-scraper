It is a kind of \"choose your own adventure\" game; a party \u201cplay-along\u201d game. Instead of just one player, Let Us Forge is to be played by the entire Patreon party. It is a cooperative, creative fantasy endeavour: an exploration of world creation including writing, storytelling, art, and songs that is inspired by and influence by everyday events.

Their forms imbued with primal energy, their bodies wracked by elemental changes. While they may still call themselves humans (or elves, dwarves, orcs, or goblins), they have become unrecognisable as such. They are something new. What that is, and what it means for their culture, is up to them to decide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaces-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of \u003cem\u003eLet Us Forge\u003c/em\u003e, there are five known races on Theia. As the game goes on, more may be discovered. The five beginning races are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHuman\u003c/strong\u003e- First Gift, Firsties, Woodfolks- \u003cbr\u003e\u201cA diplomatic solution is what\u2019s needed in this changing ballet system, right guys?\u201d - Overheard discussion of a 1001AB fashion trend\u003cbr\u003eHumans are a race of high fashion, experienced in the exploitation of nature. They have bark-like skin that can shed and change at will, but despite their name, the \u201cwoodfolk\u201d do not hold the appreciation of nature in high esteem. They are a very young race, naive to bliss, but one which boasts strong community structures and which expands in a balanced pace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eElves\u003c/strong\u003e- Second Son/Sun, Sun elves- \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cThe sun is setting on this one\u201d\u003c/em\u003e- Unknown Sun Elf laying a comrade to rest\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nSmI23z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElves are a poetic, once-proud race and hardest-hit by the changes wrought by the Calamity. Once they were masters of the woodlands. That was before the Calamity. Now, with bodies changed into living flames, they have been driven by necessity from their home forests. They remain banded together as nomads, searching for the answer to the all important question, \u201cTo whence does one\u2019s own lie?\u201d What is \u201chome\u201d to them? This is a question they are still struggling to answer.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDwarf\u003c/strong\u003e- Trinetians, Trinn, Water Dwarf- \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cI bet you can\u2019t build a dam-city thiiiis big\u201d-\u003c/em\u003e Teasing from a little Trinnkin niece as she pull her arms at wild lenght to her snoozy uncle at the dinner table.

They are now even more powerful; hulking amphibians who live in the moment and are easily dared to eccentricity. It would not be unusual to find a Trinn who had not touched water in 20 years because her friend too quickly dared, \u201cI bet you couldn\u2019t live a day without water.\u201d Quick to change in mood and lifestyle, they are bound by bonds of kinship stronger than any metal ever forged. However, choose to take advantage or con a Trinetian at your peril - they do not look kindly on trickery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrcs\u003c/strong\u003e- Fourth, Earth Orc, Rorcians, Rorckies - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201c You shall not- \u201c\u003c/em\u003e Last word of a hunter as a Orc bashes his face in\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrcs boast the greatest ability in physical combat and are highly resistant to damage. This is because, as an orc ages, its skin stiffens and becomes more resistant than the toughest armour. A orc will achieve Chieftain status when it\u2019s body turns completely to stone. At times of great troubles calamity, one would find Ancients Behemoths: living orc statues, defending their tribes and resting again as soon as the danger subsides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoblins\u003c/strong\u003e- Wind Goblins, Windlings, Fifthsies, Timmies(male), Timmlies(female) - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cI can see a gold beetle up that tree!

Can we?\u201d\u003c/em\u003e - Last words of a Timmy \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoofus and prone to the highest Darwin\u0027s Award rates ever recorded in any race, their birth rate literally liters to the wind. \u201cThey just poo em out\u201d as a historian puts it. These windlings are a metamorphosing race that grow in power as they go through each change. Older Goblins become Hobgoblins, who become Ogres and finally Overlords (if they can live that long). Presumably, even the least arithmetically savvy young Hobgoblin could become a genius overnight, once they metamorphosed to Ogre form. Research indicates that Goblins\u2019 collective knowledge is stored in their DNA as potential knowledge, and unlocks as they age. It is also claimed that Ogres can levitate at will, but due to their rarity that is unconfirmed speculation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?
