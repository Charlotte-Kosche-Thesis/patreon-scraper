    "summary": "Hello, everyone! I don\u0027t know where you came from, be it my whimsical and activist Twitter feed, my fairly-whack YouTube channel or from a blog post you read, but here I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Pulak Kumar, and I\u0027ve lived most of my life as just your average guy trying to figure out this monumental puzzle and mystery known as life. But what one of my biggest challenges has been is my passion for art and creativity. Sadly, it was never really something I could ever commit to since I always believed \"there was no real money in it\". So I held back, and hesitated, kept it as a hobby while driving myself crazy looking for a \"real job\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is the bedrock of my efforts to start making a living out of doing what I love. Some of it I\u0027m good at and have practice in. Some of it I do not. But I\u0027m going to learn as I go, and I invite you to be one of the brave souls who will accompany me on my crazy new journey! My long-term goal is to make my passion a team pursuit. A team through which I will create wonderful things with no restrictions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what of my current situation? Well, most of my talents lie with the written word. I\u0027ve been finding my own way in the crazy world of online writing, doing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thoughtfulslacker.blogspot.in/\"\u003eblog posts\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.booksie.com/portfolio-view/Pulak+Km-54660\"\u003eshort stories, poems and novels\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blessed-Skies-Pulak-Kumar/dp/1514780046/ref=sr_1_7?s=books\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1518025714\u0026amp;sr=1-7\u0026amp;keywords=The+Blessed+skies\"\u003e(one of them even has an Amazon listing!)\u003c/a\u003e whenever I felt like it. I\u0027ve also gravitated towards a number of wonderful and talented people I deeply admire, and I\u0027d hire them if I could, but for that I need to build my own foundation first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes my body of work not impress you? No worries. Only you can be the judge of whether my work, and the promises I\u0027m making, justify any monetary investment on your part. But even if my current efforts seem understandably rough around the edges, know that I\u0027m only just beginning to take things to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou yourself can bear witness to my evolution since I will be offering up my writing talents directly to you! ALL patrons get to request my services on Discord, be it a poem, short story, anything you fancy, so if you\u0027ve liked what I\u0027ve put out so far, it\u0027s only going to get better and YOU\u0027LL be the ones to benefit from it!"
