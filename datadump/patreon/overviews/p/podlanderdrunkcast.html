    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re Julie, Allison, and Janine (a.k.a. Aaron), and we make a podcast about \u003cem\u003eOutlander\u003c/em\u003e. Before we do anything else, we want to thank you all for listening, for considering Patreon as a means to show support, and for that support in whatever form it takes. We love doing this show, and you make it possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know what people, especially women, do around the world while they watch \u003cem\u003eOutlander\u003c/em\u003e, or when they talk about \u003cem\u003eOutlander\u003c/em\u003e, or when they read \u003cem\u003eOutlander\u003c/em\u003e? They drink and talk to their friends about all of it: the fights, the hot people, the knitwear, the doin\u0027 it, the excellent acting, the time travel. All of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now we do that and record it. Mostly we do it because it\u0027s fun, but also because we think it\u0027s good to enjoy things, and know that enjoying a thing is not the same as turning a blind eye to its flaws. Allison\u0027s a TV and film critic, Julie\u0027s an actor and writer, and Aaron\u0027s a filmmaker. We all love fantasy, good writing, and pretty costumes. We hate lazy storytelling and taking oneself too seriously (and that goes double for us). Above all, we love the idea that we\u0027re watching this show with loads of other people who love it too, and offering some insight while we make some solid jokes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not a cheap thing to do, and we\u0027ll do it no matter what. But if you dig the show, and want it to keep going (and getting better!) we hope you\u0027ll consider sliding us a buck or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours in the love of Murtagh,\u003cbr\u003eAllison, Julie, and Janine"
