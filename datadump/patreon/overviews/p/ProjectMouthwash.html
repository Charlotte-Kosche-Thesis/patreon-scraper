We want to earn support, not simply be handed it. Charged posts will always be ones that include new content for our Patrons to view or review before anyone else! Additionally we\u0027ve started giving Patrons access to live streams of our actors recording their lines for our work, if that\u0027s the sort of thing that interests you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month on the 28th we may charge for a post called the \"Writing Pledge\", if we\u0027ve written and pre-produced a lot of content that month. The post will include the names of everything we\u0027ve written, status of ongoing projects and a list of how many people have recorded for different series. This post is always at the end of the month, and won\u0027t be made it too many charges have already been made that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings such as the following will be pledge-worthy:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eEpisodes\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eMovies\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eHeavily Edited Videos\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpecials\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eExceptionally long behind-the-scenes content\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWe\u0027ve been working ProjectMouthwash recently as a full-time job to keep 3 episodes(or an equivalent 18-30 minutes) of good quality coming out each month.
