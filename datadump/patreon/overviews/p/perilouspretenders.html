Some of her favorite roleplaying games include: The Warren, Bubblegumshoe, Trail of Cthulhu, Castle Falkenstein, and Mutant Year Zero.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKristy is also a vegan cookbook writer and makes nerd inspired cosmetics for her day job, Pumpkin and Poppy cosmetics. This podcast and role playing games allow her to utilize all of her nerdy high school drama training, creative writing classes, and over-active imagination into a creatively fulfilling passion project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKerry is a graphic designer who worships Batman and is definitely the resident video game expert of the pair. He loves to run Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition and also enjoys action heavy roleplaying games, such as Feng Shui II. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a team of friends we collaborate and play with in the Corridor area of Cedar Rapids, Iowa who will be running different games on our show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would appreciate any support we can get so we take our podcast to the next level and devote more time to writing, reading, and producing more episodes for you all to enjoy! Thank you so much for listening to and supporting our nerdy hobby that allows us (and hopefully our listeners) to escape the dullness of everyday life for just a little while."
