I entered the realm of programming and bot development in December 2015, and have been improving myself by tinkering with bots and software ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy working on projects that provide a service to others. Something about hearing that users make use of and enjoy what I designed really spurs me to innovate, in hopes that I can be of use to people from all around the world. Nonetheless, the more I create, the harder it has become to support what I do, which is where I need help from you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eharu\u003c/strong\u003e is a project that took off in early March 2016. Initially serving only a handful of servers, this became the bot with my aspirations and dreams, serving its users as best as it can, while being feature-packed and easy-to-use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I require funding to power the servers that haru and my other projects run on. Music streaming is a costly feature that needs support from you guys. With your support, this helps keep haru running and allows me to continue working on things I like and want to showcase. I hope that one day my work will provide a useful service for you and your friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon! Feel free to haru\u0027s support server; I really appreciate the support and suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport Server:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/bBqpAKw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/bBqpAKw\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInvite Link:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://pyraxo.moe/haru\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://pyraxo.moe/haru\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Projects:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI develop for the bot\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tatsumaki.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTatsumaki\u003c/a\u003e, which as of the time of writing has surpassed 30,000 servers and reached out to over 1.1 million users. While managing a large project as that, I realised that I like seeing projects and people grow, and I enjoyed teaching people who decided to get into bot development like I did a year ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also wrote\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/pyraxo/sylphy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSylphy\u003c/a\u003e, the bot base framework that haru and Tatsumaki is based on, in hopes that those willing to learn about bot development would be able to utilise what I created to design their own bots.\u003cbr\u003e"
