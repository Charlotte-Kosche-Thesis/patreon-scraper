    "summary": "The Painless360 channel is all about education for Radio\nControl (RC). Often the products and models we buy and use come with unhelpful,confusing\nor incomplete manuals. I try to take away some of that confusion with\nclear, helpful videos on specific topics that you ask\nfor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 10 years ago I started with radio control, In those\ndays the only places you could find help were the online forums and a few\nvideos that weren\u2019t on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I started to learn how things worked I found myself\nhelping others in those forums and answering the same questions time and time\nagain. \u2018There must be a better way?\u2019 I thought. So, I made the very first\ninstructional videos on YouTube that covered how to fix those common problems and the Painless360 R/C channel was born!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it grew I realised that there was a need for a\nchannel where the technology was the star and focus. As the technology became more complicated and the options for builder and pilots grew I knew we would have to put a lot more time and effort into making the\ncontent that you wanted to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I provide videos and reviews of R/C equipment and cover\nthose topics that the audience is asking for and areas that are new and\ninteresting in the hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to cover every level of builder from this making\ntheir first model, to those learning to fly, to those who are looking for the\nnext best thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make this project a go-to place for those who\nwant the technology explained in easy to follow videos and help others enjoy\nthe R/C hobby safely and with less frustration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy have I setup a Patron\naccount?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver had a favourite show or channel whose content slowed\nand then stopped? I have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the demands of the channel, article writing and\nresearch increase the time it takes does too. Eventually the time it takes can\u2019t\nbe supported and the creator ramps production down and moves on. I don\u2019t want\nthat to happen with the me and the Painless360 channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I started I\u0027ve funded the channel privately. The\naddition of google advertising on the videos has helped but isn\u2019t enough to\ncover the costs for the basic living expenses as well as the costs of the\nproducts and technology. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have has PayPal donations (and thank you to all who\u2019ve\nused them) but Patron is a better way to help support the channel and\nhelp continue the work with a little bit of money from many helping continue\nthe channel and delivering what builder and pilots need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it means for you to become a Patreon..\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the experience so far it\u0027s clear that those who have taken the time to sign up and support the channel are the best examples of the support a creator can ask for. To reward this commitment from June 2016 onwards all give-aways from us here will only be open to current, active Patreons. Very few of the give-aways and competitions will include non-Patreons from now on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will it help me and the channel?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have considered sponsorship from some of the large\nresellers of R/C kit but that would affect my ability to be honest in our\nreviews and 100% independent. I tend to try and get in decent stuff anyway as I don\u0027t have the time to look at \u0027crap\u0027 (technical term!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy and have found the Painless360 channel useful\nthen consider contributing a buck or two. Most Patron creators offer various perks to entice people to\ndonate more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not doing that for a few simple reason; I want to have\nall content available to everyone in the community it may help and we want to\nspend the time creating the content and help/review videos not managing many\ncomplex channels of access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do, or I\u0027ve helped with one of the videos or replies I\u0027ve given, then so please make a donation and help me keep doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My work is dedicated to help those starting out in the hobby find their feet and become more comfortable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to put my support efforts into replying to posts in common RC forums but found that the posts quickly \u0027got lost\u0027 in the general messages and the answers people needed were far easier to \u0027show\u0027 then \u0027tell\u0027. As a result I started to create small \u0027how to\u0027 videos on YouTube to help those forum members then found the videos were far more useful for people and easier to find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery video is added to a custom playlist to help subscribers find the information they need and discover similar videos and tutorials they may like and find useful.
