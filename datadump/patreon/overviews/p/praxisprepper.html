    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Praxis Prepper. I\u0027ve enjoyed a lot of success on Youtube as a creator of videos for people who are interested in being more self-reliant in a changing world. My focus has been on creating educational videos that also remind people to ENJOY the life they\u0027re striving to protect - to have some fun, to laugh and keep in mind the purpose of life, which is to enjoy and appreciate it. My fan base has been super supportive along the way, keeping me chugging along with at least one new video every week. As my programs have gained in popularity, I\u0027ve seen that it could be possible for me to devote my full time to creating entertaining and informative programming for my channel\u0027s followers. My goal is to be able to abandon any sense of reliance on Youtube\u0027s advertising revenue model (which has been extremely meager - generally de-monetizing any videos that are deemed controversial), and moving to a model of reliance upon YOU, the person that actually wants to be entertained and learn from my work. I\u0027ve been incredibly appreciative of all the encouragement I\u0027ve received thus far. It really has kept me going. I\u0027m excited about the prospect of potentially being able to work full time on the channel. I have a lot of large and exciting projects that I\u0027d be able to produce and share with you if I were able to rely on this work as a way of supporting myself and my family. These \"next-level\" projects include a series of sci-fi future post-collapse videos, and LOTS more dramatizations of speculative post-collapse life. As many fans of my channel know, I work in special effects and try to use as many of these skills as time has allowed to energize the videos I\u0027ve produced so far. I have the skills to bring these futuristic post-apocalyptic worlds to your screen, all I need is the time needed to do it. Any support you might provide would be both greatly appreciated, AND utilized to bring the Praxis Prepper Channel to a new level of awesome."
