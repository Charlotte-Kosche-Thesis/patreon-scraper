    "summary": "Pack life is a compilation of various stories about \u00a0individuals from a werewolf pack. It is based in rural Connecticut within the United States, but their stories lead them to travel the world. Because Pack Life follows so many different characters, the story is told over years of experience, like reliving moments that were the best, or the worst, as the wolf remembers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe compound, or property where the pack resides, is nothing less than the retired Norwich State Hospital, a former mental institution that suffered from a rather sordid past. Through the stories, Norwich State is rebuilt and thrives along with those individuals who take shelter within its brick walls and beneath its many copper roofs. Even populated, the compound still holds some of the wonder and mystery that surrounds the former state institution, especially for the human neighbors who live innocent to the existence of the wolves and view them as only an eccentric community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe characters are not only the wolves, but those that they surround themselves with. Their stories show that even though they may not be human, there are some very real issues that even a wolf must navigate to walk among them. Each of them deals with this in their own, sometimes graceless, way. Add the general dynamic for how the various family lines within the pack work together and there is often quite a mess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe, the creators of Pack Life, Shawnti Therrien and Mai Wolf, are excited to share our work with you. We both write and draw together, as well as sculpt, customize, and photograph our subjects. We do our best to offer an all encompassing experience and are both very excited to have a platform that will allow us to share our world with you.\u00a0"
