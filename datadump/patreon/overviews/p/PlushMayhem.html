    "summary": "Hi there, thanks for taking the time to check out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Tiff, a self employed artist. I quit my job way back in the good old days of 2014 when the timing was right and the job was not. Thanks to all the love and support I\u0027ve received from my customers, my friends, and my family, this has been a successful venture so far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI gotta be honest though, I don\u0027t really have anything too exciting to tell you guys. I make dolls. I make cute dolls, and I just want to make cute dolls for other people. If you decide to become a patron, that money will help me accomplish what I want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need a patreon if things are going well so far? \u003c/strong\u003eBecause I\u0027m one person, supporting themselves completely right now. I\u0027m getting by but basically by the skin of my teeth. This has limited the kinds of arts I\u0027m able to do, and the kinds of plushies I\u0027m able to offer. Running your own business is a full time job and damn if it doesn\u0027t take a lot of time out of your day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I love making art. I grew up telling myself, pshhhh you aren\u0027t going to be an artist, go be a geologist! HAHA YOUNG ME YOU WERE WRONG! Through the years I\u0027ve gotten my hands submerged in any art that I could possibly get my hands on. I have aspirations especially in 3D modelling, sprite art, game making, and well, the list could go on. Suffice to say I have a lot of love for the arts and I want to make things that will make people happy and inspire them as other artists have inspired me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of these things have had to be put on the back burner though, as I\u0027ve been focusing on plowing away at commissions. Expanding my product line up as well as my personal projects have taken a back seat to keeping up on bills and rent each month. It doesn\u0027t help that my close family have experienced a lot of hardships since the canadian dollar has plummeted, and I\u0027ve been doing my best to help them keep a roof over their head as well. Jobs have been lost to say the least.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnough sob stories though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should YOU become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Lots of reasons that I hope appeal to you! Each dollar helps me use the time it would cost for me to raise that to make other things that may spur your interest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m able to raise enough funds, I\u0027m gonna change internet providers! Why is this good for you? Well if you\u0027re interested in my work, this means you get to start experiencing it first hand! My computer desk is my work desk, and if I have an improved internet connection I can stream my work! You\u0027ll be able to watch and interact with me, ask questions and all that fun stuff, in real time! Coupled with that, I may be able to do tutorial streams \u00a0if there\u0027s some amazing piece of plush knowledge I want to impart upon you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike plushies, but you\u0027re not a big fan of human ones? Being able to spend time away from taking on human commissions constantly means I get to spend time on expanding my skillset! This means I\u0027ll be able to make rad things like pokemon, digimon, all sorts of cute creatures and some that may be not so cute! These will be available for sale, and maybe someday I\u0027ll open commissions for them too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike the sound of that? Well good news for you! All patrons will get first grabs at any plushies I place for sale! That\u0027s a pretty nifty deal don\u0027t you think? In the future if I\u0027m so dang popular I\u0027m drowning in work and need to have closed commission lists, you\u0027ll also get first dibs on slots for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to have lots of art to show you guys, and patrons will be able to get their hands on it! In the future I will give patrons access to my digital art such as my 3d model files, sprite art, plush WIP collections from start to finish, as well as seek your input on monthly themes when I\u0027m approaching other creative work! I want to make cool stuff, but cool stuff you guys would like to see as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you very much for giving me this opportunity!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
