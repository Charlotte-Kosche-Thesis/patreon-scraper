    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi everyone, PushingUpRoses here. Welcome to my Patreon campaign. Since you have in fact found yourself browsing this page, potentially interested in becoming a patron, let me take this opportunity to tell you a bit about myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been creating gaming videos on YouTube for the last 7 years. It started with a let\u2019s play of Quest For Glory I, and continued until I started putting literally every idea I\u2019ve ever had into video form. Well. Maybe not all of them. People would likely run away screaming if I did that, but over the last few years I\u2019ve been wanting to create more unique topic videos and entertaining fare on retro video games (or anything else that churns my butter.) My personal favorites from my catalog are my moon logic puzzle video, my save slots retrospective, a nostalgic video on David the Gnome, and an analysis about how sex is portrayed in video games. I also covered video game food design because honestly, who doesn\u2019t like a nice digital steak? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXYsc50G5_E\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to offer a variety of content with different tones on my channel. You\u2019ll find snarky, humorous videos on specific games and topics, and you\u2019ll also find videos on serious topics, like how mental illness is portrayed in gaming:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ntxpOb5MGc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVariety is the spice of life (or so I am told), so I like having analysis videos alongside snarky ones. I like to show a range of interest and emotion for what I am doing. I compare my serious videos to a nice, elegant lobster dinner with a glass of fine wine. We all want that sometimes. But on the other hand, sometimes I just want some drunk food in the form of greasy burgers and a bottle of cheap beer. That represents my silly videos. ...This analogy is starting to become unhinged and is making me hungry, but you get the idea. We all need a rich diet in our lives, yes? Yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Obstacles and Goals as a Creator\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all have obstacles to overcome. Mine comes in the form of mental illness, which I am very candid about online. I decided to try YouTube not only to make entertaining videos, but to challenge my Body Dysmorphia. It was, and is important to me that I have this outlet where I can create something despite constantly being at odds with myself. It can get difficult. But with the support of my generous fans and patrons here on this campaign, I\u0027ve been able to reach people with my platform and do something that I love and challenges me mentality. My goal as a creator is simple: To keep improving in every facet of this hobby-turned-job. Improving the quality of my videos, continuing to teach people about mental illness, and providing content that not only helps me but helps my audience too. Since starting my campaign my videos have improved as I was able to afford new software and hardware to make them better. I am very humbled by the generosity of my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel is \"smaller\", and revenue is tough these days so every pledge directly helps me and my channel to keep growing and getting better, and let\u0027s not beat around the bush: like most people who create, I\u0027d love to get paid for my work. It will motivate me to keep creating and maintaining the quality of my videos, writing, and other creative endeavors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the benefits to becoming your Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI offer rewards depending on what you pledge! My most popular reward is probably the access to my private streams here on Patreon for $5 pledges; they are completely off the rails, very candid, and we have a good time there. I also offer $2 rewards and $15 dollar rewards which are detailed in the side bar under \"rewards.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering becoming my patron. You have reached the end of this profile. So...yanno. Enjoy your day. Have a coffee and a pizza. And remember: Work hard, play hard, and get plenty of roughage in your diet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
