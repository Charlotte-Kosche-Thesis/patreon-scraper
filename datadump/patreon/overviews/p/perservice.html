We\u0027re classical musicians who used to meet on Skype to help each other prepare for orchestra auditions by playing excerpts and getting feedback. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter playing some Mozart or Strauss, we would talk for a while and realized there are so many important aspects to being a successful musician other than just \"you were out of tune here,\" or \"you were rushing there.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur conversations revealed that there is a need for deeper conversations about what life in the performing arts is really like, how we have dealt with being classical musicians in society, and how we can encourage each other to improve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, we started recording these conversations and created the Per Service Podcast. We\u0027re sort of like \"The View\" for classical music...but without the sleepy classical radio station voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Your Help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating these podcasts takes a lot of time and energy.

And ultimately reach more musicians with our entertaining and inspiring message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it Works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming our patron means that you\u2019re pledging the monthly dollar amount of \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e choice to support our show.

Most importantly, you can adjust your pledge anytime you like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust like Haydn needed\u00a0Prince Esterh\u00e1zy and libraries needed Andrew Carnegie, WE need YOU to be our Patron so we can keep creating great, free, inspiring shows.\u003cbr\u003e"
