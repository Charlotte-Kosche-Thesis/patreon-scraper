I want to take a quick moment to introduce myself: my name is Park Fae \u0026amp; I\u0027ve been an artist \u0026amp; (on-and-off) community organizer for as long as I can remember. I try not to limit the scope of my interests too much, but the majority of my work focuses on: gender, sexuality, non-normative ideas of beauty \u0026amp; love, and the perilous journey that is Living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of my witchcraft, I am an independent witch who doesn\u0027t follow any particular doctrine. My magic is affirming, honest, nurturing - I do not practice magic that is intentionally malicious in any way. I do energy work with crystals \u0026amp; stones to help people grow in self-love \u0026amp; reach their full potential. I also read tarot cards, primarily with my Aquarian Tarot deck. My goal is to open a shop in the near future that sells pre-made \u0026amp; custom tailored crystal-\u0026amp; stone-based spell satchels \u0026amp; tarot readings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as art is concerned, I primarily draw \u0026amp; paint digitally on my phone or computer, though I occasionally dabble in traditional art \u0026amp; this year I began learning pixel art. I am self-\u0026amp; internet-taught, though I hope to go to school to properly study fundamentals \u0026amp; advanced techniques at some point. I am not officially taking commissions, but I am open to them on a case-by-case basis, just message me for more details!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a personal note, I happily live in the Midwest with my wonderful housemate \u0026amp; my cat, Rio. In my free time, I love playing video games, board games, cooking, and watching a variety of videos on YouTube. As my financial situation improves, I would love to get back into some old hobbies that have fallen to the wayside, such as sewing (mostly spellbags, but maybe clothing \u0026amp; other items) \u0026amp; zine production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon because I truly believe in community \u0026amp; crowd-funding. In times such as these, intimate community is one of our most powerful resources. Rather than creating a business focused on impersonal, one-off transactions, I would rather build a micro-culture in which we can all grow \u0026amp; learn a little bit about ourselves (that just so happens to help me navigate capitalism a little more smoothly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my page! I hope one of my many services sparks your interest! If you decide to become a patron, I look forward to the voyage we are about to undertake together. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
