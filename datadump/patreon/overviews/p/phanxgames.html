    "summary": "Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Henry Price, I am the founder, developer and pixel artist at Phanxgames, my indie game development studio.  Together, with Mark Hudd (game/level design/writer) and Gregg Rossetti (composer), we are working on AetherStory, a 2D retro multiplayer RPG!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.phanxgames.com/images/patreon/cliffchest.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout AetherStory:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAetherStory has been my dream to make since I first started making games over 16 years ago.  By supporting me and being my patron you enable me to focus on my dream and create the best game possible.  The goal for AetherStory is to capture the memories of the traditional JRPG that you may remember playing on the SNES, and bring it to the present with a more modern, multiplayer experience.  Imagine: cooperatively playing with your friends to defeat challenging bosses, explore dungeons, and discover the rarest, most epic loot in the land!  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have many great features and ideas planned, but due to time constraints, we have created a plan that includes the bare minimum to make the game playable.  We would love to get additional funding to add all the great ideas we have, and allow our full story to be able to come to fruition.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been working on AetherStory for the past 4 years on-and-off, but I would like to work on it full-time, and Patreon will hopefully allow this to happen!  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFunding:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe use Donations (Tips) and Patreon to pay for the cost of developing AetherStory.  This includes: software licenses, business registration/license fees, marketplace fees, and game server hosting bills.  Additionally, funding will be used for the bare-minimum cost-of-living expenses of our developer and pixel artist, Henry Price (me).  This will enable me to work on AetherStory full-time. The more funding we get, the less contracts and side gigs I would need to take, and the more time and effort I can spend on AetherStory!  Stretch-funding will go towards hiring additional artists and talent to help speed up the development of AetherStory.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead of using Kickstarter, we will be using Patreon.  And there are many great rewards tiers available to you, which are our way of saying thank you for making our dreams possible and allowing us to complete AetherStory! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eLifetime Donation Rewards:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eOur reward system is a bit different than most Patreon pages.\u00a0 In addition to the great patreon exclusive rewards mentioned on the right. You will also get Lifetime donation rewards.\u00a0 These rewards will give you extra rewards if you reach new total donation amounts.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.phanxgames.com/images/lifetime_rewards.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your interest and supporting our passion!

In addition to the monthly rewards you will also be able to get rewards once your lifetime donation total reaches certain amounts.\u00a0 This works best for us, considering we want to reward those who are supporting us for the long haul. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: When will the game be released?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf proper funding can be met we hope to release the first zone of the game as soon as possible!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What are you using to make the game?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game is made with AIR and Starling, and plenty of custom engine code.  The maps are made proudly with the Tiled Map Editor, and the server is powered by Node.JS and a Mysql database.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What systems will the game be playable on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently we are targeting Windows and Mac desktop computers.

All accounts will have access to this content, and will require a \"base game key/license\" in order to continue playing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Will the game have a monthly subscription? What is the payment model?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo, the game will not have a monthly subscription. We will fund the game\u0027s servers by selling \"Perk Keys\", which are keys that let you open a \"Perk Chest\" for a chance at amazing loot and rewards. All game-changing rewards found within \"Perk Chests\" will be obtainable within the game if you look hard enough, however some cosmetic rewards will only be obtainable with a \"Perk Key\".\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What are Perk Keys?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA Perk Key is an item that you may use to open the Perk Treasure Chest (located within the main city).\u00a0 Within the chest you will gain access to amazing rewards: such as: rare potions, equipment, magic crystals, costumes, teleportation scrolls, experience potions, and even gold!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How will I get Perk Keys for months I donated prior to the game\u0027s release?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSince\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Perk Keys will not be rewarded until he game is released, you will not receive any keys until the game is released.\u00a0 We will keep track of your Perk Key balance prior to the game\u0027s release, and you will accumulate keys each month, as long as you are donating to the proper reward tier!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How many players can be in the world at once?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game will be split up into servers, and each server should support at least 100 players concurrently.  This still needs to be tested, and we hope to achieve a higher number.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How many playable classes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are five playable classes in the base game:  the Sage, Warden, Lancer, Trickster and Ranger.

Playing Alpha tests means your character may reset at any time, and the game will be in a volatile state of change.  But it is great opportunity to help us test the game, and get your feedback in while the game is more easily malleable. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is \"Beta\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe closed beta will give you access to the game once it\u0027s closer to launch, allowing you to see the game with more polish, and more content available.  The Closed Beta will become available at least one month before the game will be launched.  We will have Closed Betas for each major release (the base and for each expansion).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How does the \"Game Key\" reward work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe $20 tiers and higher give you a \"Game Key\".

This location will contain a unique tileset and be a meeting place to interact directly with GM\u0027s and developers.  We may also include special NPC\u0027s and merchants here, and other fun surprises.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: If I cancel any Patreon Tier will I lose my rewards?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, you will lose the rewards that require you to renew your patronage. However, Perk Keys and lifetime donation totals will be kept.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://www.phanxgames.com/images/patreon/particles.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
