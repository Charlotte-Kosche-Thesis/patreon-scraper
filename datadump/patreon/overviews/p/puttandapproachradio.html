The people are what make this sport so amazing. I spend anywhere from a 30 minutes to an hour talking to the great people that are engaged and growing the sport in the state of Iowa. It\u0027s a fun show that will hopefully teach you some disc golf skills and will definitely help you get to know the amazing disc golfers across Iowa. Your donations will be used to help grow and improve the podcast while getting you a few bonus features. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for joining the Patreon campaign for Putt and Approach Radio and helping me make this podcast dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Host\u003cbr\u003e-Connor Kisling\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e for stopping by the Putt and Approach Radio Patreon page. Putt and Approach Radio is a disc golf podcast that is centered in the heart of Iowa. The episodes feature disc golfers and supporters of the ever-growing sport in the area. So far we have had some great guests like Kurt Conrad from ProFlight Eastern Iowa, Mitch Rainey from NorthStar Disc Golf, Jacob Lauber and Jacob Mott, 2 local pro\u0027s and I have many more in mind to educate and entertain you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe goal\u003c/strong\u003e of this Patreon campaign is to raise money to upgrade the \"studio\" where the podcast is recorded. This includes new mics and an audio interface that will give me the ability to record great sounding content with multiple guests at once. Another goal is to upgrade my podcast hosting service. That mean\u0027s you\u0027ll be able to hear more from me and all the other great guests each month and, depending on the success of the show, each week. I would also like to make the studio more professional by adding soundproofing as well as a new desk with additional chairs for all my guests. In the future I would also like to be able to do live shows where listeners can interact with the show directly and have their questions or comments answered live on air. Donate whatever you feel it is worth for a month of podcasts which is currently set at 1 a week. That\u0027s 3 episodes a week and as the Patreon community grows I will be making \u0027Patreon Exclusive Episodes\u0027 just for those who donate each month. Future upgrades may also include camera(s) for video podcasts and a podcasting dedicated computer and backup harddrives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to upgrading and expanding the podcast with your help! And remember even if you don\u0027t have a dollar or 2 to spare there will still be free episodes to listen to every week but the money will be well spent if you can scrounge up some pocket change to put toward a better podcast experience. Thanks again for the support and I hope to be hearing from you in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e",
