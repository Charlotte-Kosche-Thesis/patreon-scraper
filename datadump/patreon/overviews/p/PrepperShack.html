However, not everyone\nknows my big secret to making those books even more fun for you to read or\nlisten to. It\u2019s my editor and confidant, Pat, who reads my stories back to me as\nwe go along and I tweak on humorous moments seeing how she reacts or she gives\nme  neat new ideas to add to the story by insights from our conversations. Our most favorite thing to do together other than this is when\nmy books get professionally narrated and I get notice in my email saying that there is a\nnew chapter up to review.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nExcited\nsmiles and comfortable seat arranging as soon as possible starts like two\nrambunctious kids about to listen to their favorite old time radio show occurs\nand the only pause is in the proceeding is to grab an adult beverage and settle\nin. Imagination theater for the ears and mind! Now I love how my books on\naudible sound as narrators of professional caliber and recording studios bring\nmy characters to life. But no one can do it and \"Get\" my story better\nthan my sweetie and biggest fan who knows it start to finish in the way I meant\nit to be. She shall be the narrator for the Prepper Shack Story hour.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHey,\ntimes are tough and audible books are expensive but here is a chance that for just a buck\na month you get to experience the magic, the immersive entertainment and help me keep\nteaching a few survival tips and tricks to those that like learning preparedness from a good\nprepper fiction story. So in order to sit around my campfire and hear a good yarn, and join our exclusive community, we say\nthe price of admission is a buck. Let\u0027s say you are helping to pay on the firewood being\nburned in our circle or you bought me a beer to hear a great story, some insider tips and tricks\nand get the wisdom from annotations I might add here or there live on video.\nSettle in with your significant other, talk prepping, laugh some and learn a\nthing or two maybe. Play in your survival gear on a Saturday morning and get\norganized while listening or snuggle up on a Wednesday to smile the night away\nand discuss character survival strategies you are listening to.

When Pat and I are real happy or sometimes when a good friend visits and parties with us we do the traditional dance with us in the kitchen thing as the ultimate acknowledgement that your forever part of our lives now and Prepper Shack tipsy dancing midnight moment.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant to be part of the reason we are dancing and celibrating? We want a truffle dog. Yea they make these things; they are for finding expensive mushrooms with their snoot face noses. We have some of the rarest of the rare culinary sought out mushrooms here in Alabama, the elusive Pecan grove truffle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are truffles in Alabama -- no not the chocolate ones you buy in a gold box, but the earthy fungi you shave over pasta five star restaurants drool over. It might come as a big surprise to you, it did me, that one of the world\u0027s most sought-after delicacies grows wild in the cultivated or abandoned pecan groves and farms of Alabama and the best ones come from old rundown abandoned groves. As for where we will hunt them \u00a0it will come as a surprise to most Alabama pecan farmers that anybody would take an interest in something that looks like a mangled potato and smells up the whole truck. We have some land owner permissions to go looking already on a lot of old plantations but keep those in our back pocket for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0I have a shovel and trowel but no truffle hunting dog or money to spend for lessons to trying to teach a humane society rescue how to do this task. Another interesting fact thingy is I talk to top of their field College professors of agricultural departments that are working on farming and wild crafting these special mushrooms and offer me their advisement\u0027s and resources free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in, at the 5 dollar or more level, anything over the two bucks for general access to exclusive narrated story vids \u00a0goes towards either A. Lessons in to teach us how to train a truffle dog and some supplies or B. We start out by purchasing a trained truffle from a breeder and trainer. (Think expensive, around $2500 and up) It is just going to depend on subscriber response when and how we do this .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you envision or even imagine anyway possible or better in your golden years or now to get some extra needed money for the homestead or retirement than wandering the overgrown fields and pecan orchards of the deep south with a anxious to please dog wanting to earn its keep and make his or her master parents smile like the Kool Aid Man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can, I want to teach him or her dog some day when I am beach bumming or bugging out to dive for clams and scallops also like I have seen some Labradors and Chesapeake Bay retrievers do in Apalachicola Florida and Port St. Joe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy wouldn\u2019t that be some good story material for a book? Well if you chip in on this prepper furry friend we are wanting that will pay for his or her own vet bills and kibble to make a story complete and we get blessed with one, I will see to it you get some truffle treats from us and some personal book acknowledgement in a story line. Plus, big plus here, you get to watch all the truffle dog adventures! That\u2019s right; we will be videotaping the training, the purchase, the first hunt etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0Sold for $100 or so a pound at www.pecantruffles.com if you want more info , truffle foraging makes for a lucrative hobby. (And for cooks, it\u0027s not a bad deal, since white Italian truffles regularly cost about $1,500 a pound.) but for being able to write books about doing it, being a prepper and old fogey homesteader earning thier own keep teaching others and video taping the adventure and instructions? PRICELESS!!\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelping me to get a new best four legged friend to walk the woods with that pays for themselves and makes money and entertains you is both of our rewards!
