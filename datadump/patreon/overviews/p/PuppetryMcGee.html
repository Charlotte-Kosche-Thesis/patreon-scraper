Based on an Alabaman folktale, live actors meet full scale puppets, with jazzy tunes and lots of theatrical magic. A staged reading was done 2 years ago at the Kennedy Center.

I currently freelance as an actor and designer in the Washington, DC theatre community. And while I\u2019ve been blessed to have worked on over 30 productions in only 5 \u00bd years, it means my stories get put on hold, making small steps forward between gigs. Even so, I\u2019ve managed to invest so much time and energy towards furthering these projects and have even spent my hard freelance-earned money into hiring other artistic friends to help me conceptualize designs or write scripts because I believe in these stories, but I\u2019d love to see at least one of them come to completion. And that\u2019s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to Patreon, you can become a monthly subscriber to my work, specifically, for whatever amount you\u2019d like, for however long you like. So if after a few months money\u2019s a little tighter, you can, you know\u2026.un...sub...scribe...I get it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is only scratching the iceberg with ideas I\u2019ve got planned. There\u2019s more to come as these draw closer to completion. As a subscriber you will be first to know and will have access to various behind the scenes action, schwag, and other rewards. Specifics can be found on this site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can spend more time focusing on the stories I\u2019d like to tell, more time hiring other talented artists who want to be compensated for their craft, more time collaborating and creating and crafting amazing epics to inspire, entertain, and amaze, more time with my family, and less time worrying about finding work to make ends meet or fretting over all the ideas still unrealized. Your subscription will go towards materials for building puppets; designers and artists who bring their talents to these projects; myself for the hours I intend to spend writing, designing, building, and producing; future crew members for filming; actors, directors, etc. With your help, this has the potential to grow into something truly magical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe New York Times came out with an article recently saying that puppets were on the rise again. With Broadway shows and other theater venues utilizing the art form more frequently the world is being reminded once more how awesome puppetry can be. Even the movies have brought back practical effects again, with the new Star Wars franchise and others like Laika as great examples. Many of my puppeteer colleagues have been part of this movement, and while I\u2019ve been proud and excited for them, I\u2019m ready to stop watching from the sidelines and get back in the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you believe in the power and magic of puppetry and want to see more hand-made stories reminiscent of the great puppet classics you\u2019ve come to know and love, please consider throwing money at me---I mean, subscribing today, and let\u2019s make the world a little more magical. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--Matt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
