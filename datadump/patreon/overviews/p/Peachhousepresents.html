    "summary": "Peach House Presents is an abstract creative curation agency based in Sacramento, California. We create events that we see a need for in Sacramento. We have curated everything from a clothing swap, to Queer/POC markets, to an all day music and arts festival. \u003cbr\u003eWe focus on working with genuinely nice artists, musicians, and makers who are as talented as they are kind.\u003cbr\u003eDue to how many events we curate we are seeking more financial support from our community!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur money will go towards these 5 things:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVenue spaces:\u003cbr\u003eFunds will be directed towards paying for venue spaces. With this support we will be able to pay for spaces through community donations as opposed to paying out of pocket or from door sales. Door sales will then be designated towards to artists and staff/volunteer stipends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTouring Artists:\u003cbr\u003eWith these fund we will be able to offer more touring artists guarantees. Guarantees is a set amount of money that a musician or artist requests in order to work. This fund is important because we want the artists to get paid what they deserve even if the ticket sales don\u0027t sell out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePermitting/Administrative funds:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith special events comes special permitting! These funds will go towards properly following legal structures needed in order to hold events. Such permits consist of ABC permits, Special Events permits, and more. These funds are also useful for going towards paying for administrative help. I.e Accounting, Admin work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScholarship tickets:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBeing an all inclusive artist collaborative, we understand that artists and art appreciators are not made of money! Because of this, Peach House offers a handful of free tickets to our low income art lovers! However, we don\u0027t want to take funds away from the artists performing either. Funds directed to Scholarship tickets will fund someones love for the art and keep money in our artist\u0027s pockets!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommunal Art Pantry:\u003cbr\u003eWe are hoping to establish a Communal Art Pantry. Every Wednesday we host a low cost ($3-$10) figure drawing class. We have started a communal box of supplies but would like to properly have supplies always available! We would also like to initiate a less physical financial support system as well. This would consist of funds that will go towards artist\u0027s specific projects. For instance, say we have an artist who wants to create multiple zines but does not have the equipment to do so or money to make copies, we would fund their art project and pay for copies/supplies out of this fund. This is important because many marginalized communities can\u0027t access funds or supplies for their art but need that support in order to continue their work.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
