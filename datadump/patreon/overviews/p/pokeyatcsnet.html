    "summary": "Over the past year, I have worked to help bring online an ATCS net covering the Kenova District between Portsmouth and Williamson (as current ATCS users have seen)\u00a0 With the successful installation of two tower site servers, we completed coverage of the entire line and it\u0027s associated branch lines (with the exception of CP Pevler on the Wolf Creek Branch due to it\u0027s remote location)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e With this setup being used as a pilot, I\u0027m looking to help extend coverage of ATCS and voice to the rest of southern WV and western VA which includes the Pocahontas District, Clinch Valley District, Guyandot River Branch, Buchanan/Dismal/Big Creek Branch, Dry Fork Branch, and the CSX Kingsport Subdivision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial plan is for 5 primary tower sites covering large areas of the lines in question.

The first map shows the five sites with a 20 mile radius, based on the performance of our two Kenova District sites. The next map shows a more realistic coverage area of 25 miles due to the higher location of all four sites except for Keen Mountain, which remains at 20 miles. Note that these are estimated and will be better represented once the sites have been tested and brought online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1UoglfG.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ryAUaFD.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only disadvantage to this method, which is the reason I am calling upon for help, is the cost of renting the tower sites. The lack of population centers along these lines as well as the mountainous terrain greatly limits the range that could be covered with individual server hosts, and by using this method we reduce the amount of servers needed to cover the entire line. Each site will feature a free voice stream via \u003ca href=\"http://www.broadcastify.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBroadcastify\u003c/a\u003e for the areas displayed, which can be streamed live to your PC or cell phone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose that help will receive early access to each ATCS site as we test and configure the servers \u0026amp; ensure they are stable for 24/7 operation, as well as the benefit of continued access if the goals to unlock each site are not met. In addition, supporters will receive our custom decoded ATCS layouts to use, although they may also choose to use the publicly available layouts on the ATCS Monitor Yahoo Group. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we are asking is for people to pledge at least $6 a month ($5 to us + $1 for site/transaction fees) although the more help we can get, the faster we can get servers online and running. If you cannot do that much, we will take any help you can get (and I promise we won\u0027t hold it against you) We are also accepting donations to support the cost of equipment (radios, servers, antennas, preamps, etc) for those that cannot support a monthly payment or want to help out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far, I appreciate your interest and hope we can work together to bring this project to life and enhance the railfan experience for these remote regions.\u003cbr\u003e"
