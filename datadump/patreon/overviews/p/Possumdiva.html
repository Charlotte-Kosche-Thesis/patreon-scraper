    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eHello My Name Is:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0Heather Marie Luttrell. Some friends and family call me \"Heffer\" or \"The Heff\" and some call me \"Possumdiva\". I answer to all three. I am in love with music and art in all forms, well, except death metal.. I really am not a fan, but as with all things on this planet, like mosquitos and fleas, I am sure it has its place...\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI have recorded 6 albums of original music, along with a couple covers thrown in there. I tour, sing, doodle, sculpt, book shows, build my website, write music, build my garden and work on my home, cook, blog, teach yoga, run, love on animals and my family. I play banjo, guitar and piano - and I just picked up the mandolin and violin. I paint on stuff - old records from the thrift store, upcycled jars and bottles, canvas, wood, paper, cars and I am an awesome wedding planner :) .... \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI love sharing my art and music and would love the opportunity to share and communicate with my fans. I love having the incentive and drive to create new things for you that may help or brighten your day.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI have millions of ideas for videos, paintings, tiny works of art and new songs, and I would love your input, and your permission to make them all for you :) I wanna show you what a few bucks, ingenuity, 3 iPhones and a red head with an idea can do!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027d like to take a second to talk about why I think this idea is so cool. I\u0027ve always put videos, pictures, and \"my life\" on social networks and YouTube for free and that\u0027s not going to change. Through posting things on YouTube, Facebook, etc., I think I have developed loyal and generous fans. You guys are so important to me, I never would have believed becoming a working musician was possible without the overwhelming support from all of you. Now, I can\u0027t imagine doing anything else but I\u0027m sure most of us would agree, it is not an easy road, and sometimes it\u0027s hard to make ends meet. I have completed the funding of 2 Kickstarter campaigns, and the difference here is instead of funding one big huge project, you get to help with all of the little ones, and collectively to some bigger ones, but the stream of artistic output is supported and nourished through our exchange in a consistent and interactive method which I am very excited about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe industry for a painter/musician these days is a tough river to wade through and attempt to swim. Labels don\u0027t just come discover people anymore, physical CD sales are not like they used to be, art galleries are closing left and right, so now we artists have to create the path to our own success with more gusto and drive. This lovely website provides a way for you to help me focus more on creating and getting to the next level through consistent support, which I cannot thank you enough for. I like to think of it as a magazine subscription to my artistic output!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThings I will be giving you on this site:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eFree demo downloads of new\u00a0and old original songs\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCover songs that I love or some of your suggestions\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to exclusive deals and discounts on all physical stuffs I put out there\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideos of what\u0027s going on : on tour, in my art studio, during song writing, while I am\u00a0painting, my sketch books doodles, lyrics sheets, random silliness...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePostcards with new art and handwritten love,\u00a0surprises of thankfulness via the U.S. mail\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDownloadable, printable artworks from Craig and I\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInteraction : we can discuss the new stuff I am doing, the new stuff you are doing, any suggestions/ideas you have!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYoga lessons, guitar/song writing lessons, art/drawing lessons via skype\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you be releasing this nefarious content/artistic fabulousness?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(this explanation is borrowed from my friend Carsie Blanton: check her out!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll release new content between 1 and 4 times a month.
