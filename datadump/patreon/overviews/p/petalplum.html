    "summary": "Hello and Welcome!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Ellie Beck, a textile artist \u0026amp; creative maker. I work primarily with natural fibres, botanical dyes \u0026amp; an experimental process towards my practice. I\u0027m self taught in my arts \u0026amp; crafting practice - and am keen to continue developing this process. I\u0027m also a writer, with words \u0026amp; thoughts slipping from my mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Being an artist is in my blood, I couldn\u0027t not do it, but sometimes the process and the creating takes more time that the results of the outcome. My hope is that you see deep value in my work, and are in the situation to financially contribute to my practice.\u003cstrong\u003e In exchange I\u0027ve got lots of gifts as a way of expressing my immense gratitude\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy having your support, I don\u0027t have to stress about the financial aspects of online marketing, or worrying about the bills being paid, and or my kids needing things.\u00a0Being a self-employed artist (my husband is too!), means we put everything into what we make, yet sometimes don\u0027t get the financial stability needed as parents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m a creative maker and mama to 3. We live in the rainforest in Northern NSW, Australia. I teach online and in real life workshops, primarily in textiles and sustainable practices; Natural \u0026amp; Botanical Dye, Loom Weaving, Basket Weaving, Slow Stitch, etc...\u003cbr\u003eI post daily beautiful, inspiring images to my Instagram account\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/petalplum/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@petalplum\u003c/a\u003e, as well as words, tutorials, recipes and interviews to my blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a big advocate of Slow, Intentional \u0026amp; Creative Living and share my viewpoint on this topic through my Instagram, blog, and newsletter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me and my family - you\u0027ll allow us to continue along this path of sharing our slow living life, our experiences being creatives, as well as living a sustainable life in the forest. I create workshops and events to bring a connectedness, I share thoughts and ideas on living a more full and natural life. \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE :: I have started work on a book that I *hope* I will be able to self-publish early next year. It is words, poetry of sorts, combined with my watercolours, and perhaps (I will see later down the track) if there is feeling / space for my photographs. Your Patreon support will help give me the time / financial space to dedicate to allowing the writing to evolve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith deep deep thanks, Ellie\u003cbr\u003e"
