    "summary": "Hi everyone! My name is Katie Underhay and I am co-artistic director of Peafrog Puppetry and our production company, Mumblecrust Theatre.\u00a0We create puppets as commissions for theatre, run workshops for kids and adults and are currently touring \u0027The Tale of the Cockatrice\u0027 - a family show filled with puppetry, live music, epic storytelling and general tom-foolery!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a small theatre company, it is incredibly difficult to create the things we do because there are only two of us (myself and Anthony Burbridge) and funding is often scarce! We managed to create \u0027The Tale of the Cockatrice\u0027 with only the help of \u00a3430 from a Kickstarter campaign, which barely scratches the surface of what it really costs to produce professional theatre. We have so many exciting plans for other projects too and want to keep running workshops and making new puppets for people, but without any sort of subsidy this becomes pretty tough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve managed to struggle on so far though, and have achieved more than you might expect! We\u0027ve just returned from Brighton Fringe where we managed to win two awards - Voice\u0027s Best Newcomer award and the IYAF: Best of Brighton Children and Families award - as well as 5* and 4* reviews.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a few people can give a little bit every now and then, it\u0027ll really help us carry on making amazing theatre and give us more freedom to try riskier projects, and to do things that many people might benefit from but won\u0027t necessarily make us a lot of money...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you fancy lending us a hand I\u0027ll be making weekly videos showing my process of making the puppet commissions I\u0027m currently on and a round up of the week\u0027s events, so you can see all the excitement (and all the tedium!) that goes into creating original theatre and running a puppetry company.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
