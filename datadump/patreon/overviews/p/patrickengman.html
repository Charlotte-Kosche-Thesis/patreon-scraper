    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Patrick Engman Jr. Welcome to my adventure filled with life, beauty and timelessness. I hope to become a prolific fine art photographer and I find it difficult capitalizing on my passion on a daily basis. I love the process of creation, finding shapes, lines, contrast and magic within everything--and all it requires is a tilt of the head and a squint. Photography sustains the wonder within. It keeps me sane and attached to it is my dreams, my identity, my future and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining me on my adventure, I want to share my photography process using 35mm and 120 film. I almost always scan my own film and I shoot with an assortment of cameras. Right now I\u0027m using an Olympus OM2n for street photography and a Pentax 6x7 for portraits and architecture. I scan with an Epson V600, Pakon F135+ and I print with a Canon Pixma Pro 100 and an assortment of fine art papers. I love to goof around and geek out so if you\u0027re into coffee, Q\u0026amp;As, fine art photography and a journey from deep within to find peace of mind, hop on my jet-ski and let\u0027s do this!"

This process played a huge role in my development and without these albums, life would have been very different!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography allows me to sustain the wonder I had as a child. To look through my viewfinder and capture the human condition as soon as it bears its face in all its glory is what I seek to achieve. The truth of the moment immortalized on film, scanned and printed on the fine art paper ready to be seen and imprinted within the minds of wondering eyes.\u003cbr\u003e",
