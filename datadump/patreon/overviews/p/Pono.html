It\u0027s a win-win-win.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur program, with complete transparency, allows you to pitch in a few bucks a month into a pool of money that will get used to green the homes of underserved families, students, teachers, farmers, first responders, and others that give so much to our community and who do not make the money they deserve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead more on our program here: http://ponohome.com/giving-back/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be able to read stories on the people whose homes you helped green, and participate in online discussions with our founding team to help drive the direction of this program!"

That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur goal with this program is to serve teachers, organic farmers, and lower income individuals with free efficiency upgrades.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve worked with several nonprofits and municipalities to deliver free services for renters, elderly, and other residents that would otherwise be unable to enjoy all the benefits of eco-home-improvement, and delivered free (subsidized by a state conservation program) services to these \"hard to reach\" residents. The program is defined by Hawaii Public Utility Commission approved metrics and based on engineering and proven results. The rates we are paid for this work are approved by the state\u0027s energy conservation program, and while it\u0027s not going to make us rich, it can help us pay our bills while we bring sustainability to those that need and want it! Through this Patreon page, we can simply replicate this program with a waiting list of teachers, farmers, first responders, and others that give so much to society and that we\u0027d like to be able support in their goals to reduce their utility bills and green their homes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it will work:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eTeachers, farmers, and others that qualify are put on a list\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEach month, we\u0027ll tally up our Patreon contributions from people like you, and then contact people at the top of the list to schedule their eco-home-improvements\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u0027ll provide 100% transparency throughout the process, showing our pool of money and the homes/people we\u0027ve serviced with it.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThat\u0027s it!
