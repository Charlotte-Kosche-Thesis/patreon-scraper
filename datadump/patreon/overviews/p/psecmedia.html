    "summary": "My name is \u003ca href=\"http://paradigm-shifting.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDave Kelso\u003c/a\u003e and I run two YouTube Channels. One is \u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/psecdocumentary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eParadigm Shift an Educational Comedy\u003c/a\u003e and the other is \u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/pondscape\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePondscape\u003c/a\u003e. The things that I do, are done in cooperation with \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PondscapeWally48\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWalter Kelso\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://generaltate.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRichard Hamilton\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://katerinaroy.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKaterina Roy\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6y_hqAOkggC9qI2O-KLEQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaul Roy\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/krissysparkle/videos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKristen Meyer\u003c/a\u003e and anyone else wanting to participate at any given time, on a case-by-case basis. My goal with patreon is to be able to better \u003cstrong\u003ehelp you all to learn things in new and fun ways\u003c/strong\u003e, especially when it comes to \u003cstrong\u003elearning to be more self-sufficient\u003c/strong\u003e during economically hard times. I want to \"level up\", to put it simply. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to be able to do more\u003c/strong\u003e than what I\u0027ve been able to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs tempting as it is to write you all a 20 paragraph mini-book explaining exactly everything that I would love to accomplish and hope to do, that would just be over-kill. For the specifics on these things, we keep nothing secret. Those truly interested in knowing exactly what we\u0027re up to need only to \u003cstrong\u003ewatch the videos that are freely available on YouTube\u003c/strong\u003e. I will be including a PSEC Hangout Video on this page as soon as possible, where more specific ideas and details are discussed, and you are more than welcome to listen in and comment back with some ideas of your own if you would like. For the purpose of this page, I feel it would be more productive to explain things from an \u003cstrong\u003eethical / philosophical standpoint\u003c/strong\u003e, so that you can \u003cstrong\u003eunderstand the core of our intentions and what is motivating us and why\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many people out there who would love to create the positive change they wish to see in the world, yet do not particularly hold much faith in themselves. They\u0027ve been taught to view everyone and everything else as \"better\" than they are, so it seems to spark a \"well, why even bother?\" sort of attitude. Adding to the problem, is an endless list of groups, movements and self-proclaimed gurus that insist that their way is the best and only way, and seek merely to obtain for themselves a \"cult following\" in order to increase their subscribers, views, likes, etc. Their \"followers\" are left with a bad taste in their mouth, and they become even more distrusting of both their own capabilities, and of people and groups around them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis phenomenon has become so invasive, that people practically think that they need degrees, certifications and the blessings of professionals of celebrity status to give themselves permission to so much as try anything new, to have any fun, or to undergo any aspect of anything that remotely resembles a learning process. People feel trapped in a sense of stuckness, not really liking where they are, but not entirely sure how to move forward, or what to even move forward into. Add to this the onslaught of neurotic judgments and psychological projections from friends, family, peers, co-workers, social justice warriors and basically a bombardment of mental and emotional trash coming towards them from every angle both online and offline: it can be really difficult to figure out how to even think one straight coherent thought of our own, much less actually going out and doing anything worth doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, there are so many people that provide a great deal of \"lip service\" to every possible topic imaginable, but far and few people actually going about the business of \"doing things\" to literally be the change they want to create in the world. Far and few people out there with the bravery enough to show their own personal journeys of trial and error to the public, terrified of discouragement and embarrassment. It has taken us awhile, but we\u0027ve become brave enough to start showing you. The Pondscape side of course is and will be centered around nature. Aquatics and garden stuff. Sustainability. That sort of thing. So, Pondscape is a bit specialized. As for Paradigm Shift an Educational Comedy however, this is going to cover a much broader spectrum of very real human things that most people will be able to relate to. Therefore PSEC is not so specialized as Pondscape, so that it is more compatible with a wider audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur target audience is \u003cstrong\u003ethose who have decided\u003c/strong\u003e that they are sick of feeling sorry for themselves, and wish \u003cstrong\u003eto embark upon the journey of being open to the inspiration\u003c/strong\u003e they require to figure out what their way is, and \u003cstrong\u003eto be brave\u003c/strong\u003e enough to do things their way. Brave enough to make mistakes. Brave enough to learn from them. Perhaps even brave enough to \u003cstrong\u003eunite with others of like-mind\u003c/strong\u003e. People who are not looking \"to be told what to do\" nor are they looking to go out and tell others how it is they think they should be living. People who have started to come to understand that \u003cstrong\u003ethe process of education is one which consists of simultaneous teaching, learning and doing\u003c/strong\u003e. That it is not one of gurus and subordinates, but rather one of humans \u003cstrong\u003elearning and sharing together with other humans\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are someone who feels ready for this, then you may very well be at the right place. What we have to share might very well be for you. If you decide its not, then thats okay too. No judgment against you. \u003cstrong\u003eWe all need to learn to discover what works for us each as individuals\u003c/strong\u003e and that is a process of trial and error over time. What we decide to do with this patron system, will be a process of discovery, learning and changing over time. Seeing what doesn\u0027t work, seeing what does work, adapting and moving forward. \u003cstrong\u003eIt is truly a new adventure\u003c/strong\u003e that we are embarking upon. A frightening yet also joyfully exciting adventure, and we are all looking forward to see what becomes of it.\u003cbr\u003e"
