    "summary": "Hi everyone, welcome to the Polygon Workshop! My name is Bair. I\u0027ve been working in the Game Industry and teaching Game Design for about 12 years altogether. It is a passion of mine so much so that I even do it to relax. I have worked for big places like Disney Interactive and Buena Vista games to smaller companies like Left Field Productions. I have even started my own company and released several iphone and ipad games. I have also taught at several colleges and that\u0027s why I am here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral students of mine asked me to create a Patreon so that I could provide more instruction, a place for them to ask questions, or even to just chat. Thanks Gerardo, Connor, Chris, Justine, and Arjun! It was really them that made me finally decide to launch this Patreon. My goal is to share all my knowledge and experience with you through: conversation, videos, articles, and maybe even some game sessions to anyone that wants to get involved. You don\u0027t have to have any experience doing any of this as I will provide introductory lessons and expand to more advanced levels as we go. Spread the word!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting and I hope to chat with you around the Workshop soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Reward Tiers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you can\u0027t make it to a Hangout session, don\u0027t fret! You can always send questions to me at:\u00a0polyworkshop.mail@gmail.com and I will answer them during the session. I record all the videos and will upload them here so your question WILL be answered! Also, for later tier stuff, I will work with you to make sure you are getting the most for your patronage. Thank you again!"
