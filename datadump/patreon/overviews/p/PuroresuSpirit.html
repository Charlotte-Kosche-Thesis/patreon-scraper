The reality of which is what is, though I still do my best to churn out as much information that I can as I generally enjoy doing this as an active hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been following Japanese professional wrestling for nearly 20 years as of 2015 and have been running my own dedicated project, known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/PuroresuSpirit\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePuroresu Spirit\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, for over 5 years now as of this writing. Of course with the feedback I have received from my time of being under PS, in it is truthfully something I wish I would have started much sooner. Again this is all thanks to those who have followed the facebook page, twitter, and blogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat are you getting by helping out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will allow me to continue doing what I have been doing for years now. Everything posted be it news or results are translated by myself and truthfully that does take an hour or two, sometime even more, out of my day. Earlier in the week usually being a heavy in terms of news being released with the weekends being filled with a dozen shows from all over Japan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore or less all the support will help me in being able to focus more time on covering Japanese Pro-Wrestling which means I can continue keeping you you all informed on what is going on in the Land of the Rising Sun. More time being dedicated to results and detailed and factual news without much of the drama that tends to come forward from time to time. I aim to focus solely on what matters and less of what comes about from trying to make a headline to get a reaction or a response.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would be most grateful for any and all support as it would give me more options on what I can allow myself to do. I really never sought out to make any money from this project and it still makes me a little weary to even make this patreon account. But after consulting with a couple friends and my wife it is better worth a shot to make this and see if any feedback emerges. I guess it is better to try this project than to not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for helping keep the spirit alive, and here\u0027s hoping that I can make it to at least another 5 years under Puroresu Spirit!"
