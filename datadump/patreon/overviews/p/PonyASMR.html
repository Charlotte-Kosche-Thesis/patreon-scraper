At the same time the characters from the show My Little Pony are very endearing, so much so that they would be perfect for ASMR role playing. Seeing that hardly anyone else was doing it we decided to bring both together ourselves and this is the result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to produce calm and relaxing sleep aids; immersive experiences for our listeners that provides an avenue of escapism from anxiety and depression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial target is 2-3 scenarios with a combined monologue of around 45 minutes spread across each scenario, however, we hope to generate enough support to significantly expand the scope of our project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach scenario will be about an hour and a half long, and will blend dialogue from the pony with ambient soundscapes and subtle environmental sound effects, to give an immersive feeling of being somewhere cozy with someone who genuinely cares about you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the scenario progresses, the amount of dialogue will gradually taper down as the listener fades into sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach campaign is for a single, non-profit, fan-created project, not a monthly subscription to supplement our income. Every dollar you donate will go directly to the project to increase the production quality of each scenario and not to pay our rent or utility bills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe voice actors who star in a scenario will earn a percentage of the profits from that particular episode. This is our way of thanking those that lend their talents to us. The only exception to this is Miss Shellah who is a core member of this group and who prefers to see that money go directly towards the project.\u00a0Therefore she will not receive any of the money this project brings in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSchedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an estimate for each scenario. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhase 1: Development\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInput from community\u003cbr\u003eScenario development\u003cbr\u003eScript draft\u003cbr\u003eScript finalisation\u003cbr\u003eScript breakdown (identify soundscapes, environmental effects, and binaural audio delivery)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhase 2: Production\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScenario review (voice actress, voice director, writer)\u003cbr\u003eDialogue track recording\u003cbr\u003eSoundscape recording\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSound effects recording\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhase 3: Post Production\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDialogue re-recording (fine tuning \u0026amp; retakes)\u003cbr\u003eAudio mixing (blending dialogue, soundscapes, and sound effects). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhase 4: Scenario Release. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe video is done and is published on our Youtube channel and digital downloads will be immediately available.
