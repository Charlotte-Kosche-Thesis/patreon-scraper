    "summary": "For one off donations please follow link - www.paypal.me/phuketdogaid\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there, firstly thank you for taking the time to look at my page. I recently went to Thailand on the intention of doing some travelling, I was totally unaware of the problem they had with street dogs at the time. I started my trip doing some volunteering at soi dog foundation and through them discovered the phuket government dog pound. As soon as I seen this pound and the way dogs in there live I instantly knew that I would spend my time in Thailand helping these dogs instead of travelling. There are nearly 600 dogs that live in the pound which in my opinion only has space for around 400 dogs, it\u0027s really overcrowded, there\u0027s a lot of fights which some times can end in a dog being mauled to death, alpha dogs don\u0027t let the weaker dogs get food which results in some dogs starving to death, there\u0027s a lot of disease, dogs with open infected wounds, ticks everywhere, there are dogs dying here all the time. There is no money provided by the government, even the food comes from donations, the conditions are really poor and outdated, some runs don\u0027t have concrete and turn into mud baths in the rain. Unfortunately the government there think the answer to street dogs was to build this pound and round up all the dogs and throw them in, without any care or thought of looking after them and they spend the rest of their lives stuck in the same run 24 hours a day 7 days a week until the die. These dogs where street dogs who where used to total freedom and done as they pleased, to be rounded up and put in the pound is so cruel, they would be much better off on the street but unfortunately have lost there pack and territory and wouldn\u0027t survive. I spent 2 months at the pound 6 days a week where I met the amazing Toni Jessop who I will be working closely with when I return to Thailand, she lives in phuket and dedicates most of her time to the pound with the help of 1 other full time volunteer, other volunteers come and go but unfortunately not many people can stay for long periods of time. There are 2 full time memebers of staff but the only feed some of the dogs in the pound, the majority of the work is left to the volunteers who spend all there time feeding, cleaning, giving medication, breaking up fights and looking for sick dogs. They are very limited as majority of the time theres is only 2 people to look after a large number of dogs every day, any spare time is spent going into the big runs that the staff look after to look for sick and injured dogs. Luckily soi dog foundation help out at the pound massively, they send a group of volunteers every week to help with the cleaning and a group of vets to care for sick dogs and give us the required medication they need, they are always a big help whenever we need them and the pound is very lucky they are there. Unfortunately \u00a0I had to return home after 2 months due to funding, but I am far from done helping these dogs. I have made it a goal of mine to return to phuket and hopefully live there for a year and help theses dogs in every way I can. I am going to work and save as much as possible for 6 months and go back in June, I can hopefully pick up some online work while I\u0027m there for money but unfortunately this will take time away from me that I could be helping the dogs. I am pleading to anyone that can help in any way, a small donation through paypal.me/phuketdogaid, come and volunteer at the pound, or possibly able to sponsor me through patreon.com/phuketdogaid the more sponsors I get means the more time I can dedicate to the pound. I will be working closely with Toni and our ultimate goal for when I return to phuket would be to spend 6 full days a week at the pound, feed and treat around 50 street dogs every day and run our own adoption centre from my garden. Where we will take around 20 dogs at a time from the pound to my home where I will nurse them back to full health, \u00a0feed them, show them what it\u0027s like to be a pet and eventually find them a loving home. Anyone who donates or sponsors me will get daily updates of the work I will be doing and I will once a month post all my donations and sponsors and show what has been used for living expenses and what has been used for the dogs. If you have time please check out Toni\u0027s page- \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/tonijfortheanimals\"\u003ewww.patreon.com/tonijfortheanimals\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/tonijfortheanimals.\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/tonijfortheanimals.\u003c/a\u003e Thank you"
