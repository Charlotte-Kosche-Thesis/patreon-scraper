I love the craft of quality storytelling, so at \"PJL Books\" not only do I put famous movies, books and TV shows under the microscope and examine why they work (or not), I also build my own stories and share them. I even find stories from my daily life in Japan, which I\u0027ve called home since 2010! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/79tp1Xu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I\u0027ve enjoyed writing fiction since I was 9 (when I was apparently famed for my avant-garde poetry!), I\u0027ve been writing seriously since 2007, and have so far self-published three full-length novels:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTick \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(a Kickstarter campaign success)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKami \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(inspired by my first two years of life in Japan and my experience of the Sendai Earthquake)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Sues Santa\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e(a free e-book that has been downloaded over 500 times).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eMy hope is simple: to share great stories with as many people as possible and share with others in the creative process.

I live very happily with my wife and office job on the edge of Tokyo, but the sheer distance from my native UK means that the already high barrier-to-entry for finding a literary agent or publisher is just that little bit higher.

The time \u00a0get to do most of my writing these days is on the packed commuter trains heading in and out of Tokyo every day.

The more people who pledge their support to PJL Books, the stronger it makes my position.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe second aim depends on the first.\u003c/strong\u003e If we do well, I aim to secure a literary agent after the milestone of $500 dollars (or with a community backing of over 100 Patrons, whichever comes first). Or, if we do very well, we could forgo traditional publishing altogether and PJL Books will exist as an independent entity, where I self-publish everything and I can rely on the income of Patrons to support me as well as put it back into the Patreon and writing community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, I will be indebted to each and every person who supports me on every step of this journey. Just your presence as a Patron is vital: the higher that number of Patrons climbs the better my chances become in any circumstance. I pledge back to all my Patrons to make it worth their while in return. I have a mountain of ideas that I desperately want to commit the time and effort to, and I can\u0027t wait to get to that point. With your help, we can do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/taoOQ0o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
