    "summary": "I host and produce the Plant Yourself Podcast, which publishes weekly interviews about individual wellness, planetary healing, and plant-based nutrition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend about 1/5 of my work life searching for guests, preparing for interviews (yes, I do read the books and watch the documentaries!), conducting interviews, editing the audio, writing the show notes, uploading and promoting the episodes, and corresponding with listeners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for help to keep the show going because two things have changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I made the leap from a stable career in digital marketing to a brand new startup business in health consulting and forays into nonprofit public health promotion. So my income has gone way down, and will take a while to get to a comfortable level again. (I\u0027m not complaining - to the contrary, I\u0027m utterly thrilled to be in a position to explore my passions for individual wellness and planetary healing on a full-time basis.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I recently realized that I want to do even more broadcasting and teaching on a public stage. I have two other podcasts and a TV show that I\u0027d like to develop and share with the world, and frankly, pursuing any of them right now would just be downright irresponsible given my need to earn my way in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can always produce paid content, behind a firewall, and I will, but I really like the public radio model of creating great stuff that\u0027s accessible to everyone, regardless of financial situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m asking for help in making my podcasting a significant source of income over the next year, while I nurture my wellness consulting business and expand my free broadcasting projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much in advance for your support. It means so much to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmly and gratefully,\u003cbr\u003eHoward\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
