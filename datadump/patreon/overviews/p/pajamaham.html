I\u0027ve loved drawing throughout my entire life, but only picked it back up less than a decade ago. That being said, I\u0027d love to \u003cdel\u003efall into a pit of insanity and hatred\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0become a freelance artist. I take commissions, requests, trades, collaborations, and pretty much everything in between. I draw just about anything, not very picky, you say jump, I\u0027ll say how high.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t-\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eNow what does Patreon do for me?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eIt helps keep my bills payed, my head dry, and burgs in my mouth. It just keeps the train going; the more money I receive through Patreon, the less hours I need to work at a more \u003cem\u003econventional\u003c/em\u003e job. As for rewards... honestly, I don\u0027t really want to wall off my content, nor do I have any big plans for tier rewards for that matter. Donating lets you check out WIPs, have a spot in monthly raffles, and even access to source files (PSD). Donate what you\u0027d like and you\u0027ll get all the perks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e-\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHow does the raffle work?\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eI will host an exclusive Picarto stream for my patrons and I will randomly draw a name from the chat. When a winner is selected, they\u0027ll get a full character painting with simple shading. Then you get to tell me what to do while I draw your thing, or if you don\u0027t want it, you can always pass it to someone else.\u00a0The stream will take place within the first week of the month, with a one to two day notice in advance. Once the stream begins, the raffle won\u0027t take place until we\u0027re maybe half an hour into the stream, that way no one misses out, doodling and taking requests in the meantime.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\t\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
