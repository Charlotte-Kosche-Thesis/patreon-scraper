    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is way to help fund content creators by donating as little as $1 each month. This allows the creator to have more disposable income that he or she can use to make the necessary investment to make the content they create better, which in the end will give you the patron a better and more enjoyable experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I have decided Patreon Creator\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a lot of work that\ngoes into creating interesting high quality videos for YouTube. Sure, you can\npick an inexpensive camcorder or mobile phone and make a video for YouTube with\nlittle to no effort, but I am trying to produce a viewing experience that engages\nthe viewer and makes them feel like they are a part of the adventure. To carry\nout this I have spent many hours researching film making techniques and made large\ninvestments into my camera and sound gear. I want to continue to push my film\nmaking to new levels and turn my passion into a practical living. The donations\nmade to the channel are a tremendous help to making that dream a reality. I hope\nthat as the channel progresses that you find satisfaction in knowing that it\nyour donation was an instrumental part in the channel\u0027s success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Donate\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating to individuals that\ncreate great content is giving these folks reason to keeping working hard. I\nhave seen many outstanding YouTube channels go by the wayside mainly because it\u2019s\ntoo much work for little to no reward. Many of us have paid upwards and over\n$100 dollars for cable to end up with a bunch channels we don\u0027t watch, and the channel\nwe do watch don\u0027t always have the content we want to see. The internet has\nopened a whole new choice for us, we can now search out and find exactly what\nwe want to see. Unfortunately, many of us are working are butt off to create\nprofessional quality content, for little to no money. We don\u2019t think twice\nabout an actor or a producer making money to be on the shows we like, so why\nwould we feel any different about the personalities we love on internet. Many\nof whom are putting the same, or even more work into producing and editing the\nvideos we love. Let\u2019s start using our money to finance those that creating\ncontent we want to see, and not the cable companies that dictate what we get to\nsee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Ultimate Goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo spend more time outdoors, creating the highest quality outdoor videos and photographs of hiking, backpacking, overland camping, hunting, fishing, etc., I would also like to expand my ability to do unbiased reviews of the gear I use on these adventures."

I spend a lot of time recreating in the thousands of square miles of wilderness, national forests and Public Lands (BLM) that we have here in Oregon.  My adventures include exploring areas around Oregon in my truck with my two dogs and looking for landscape photo opportunities. I enjoy capturing my adventures in a fun and inspiring way, and hope that my videos and pictures will excite you about creating your own adventures in the outdoors. If you find the videos on my channel interesting I would very much appreciate you subscribing to my channel and if you would like to help support the creation of my videos please consider giving me $1 dollar donation here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e",
