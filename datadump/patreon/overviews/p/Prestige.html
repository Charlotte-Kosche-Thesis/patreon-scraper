I personally take a lot of time to make the content you consume daily over on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/PrestigeisKey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePrestigeisKey\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.Youtube.com/PrestigeisKey2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePrestigeisKey2\u003c/a\u003e YouTube channels. It is truly hard to portray how much time goes into the entire process to create the content you enjoy for free. The reason I chose to create this page is to allow my fans and supporters an outlet to support me further if they wish to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you all know, Twitch streamers have the ability to earn tips and boy does it happen daily. For people (like myself) who do not have the means to stream it can be a little disheartening to tell my fans who ask to donate that I have no official page to donate. I wanted to create this Patreon with the thought that perhaps this could be MY official tip jar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do not have the means to provide a donation then by all means feel free to STILL enjoy all of my content! This was simply made for those who would love to show some love for enjoying all the work I put into the content I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate each and every one of you. Thank you for being part of the #PrestigeFamily!\u003cbr\u003e"
