    "summary": "Dear Potential Patron, \u0026amp; Friend of Project 365 by Campbell\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCampbell is 13 years old and has been making a bear a day for sick or hurting people since he was 9. To date, he\u0027s cut out and sewn over 1,500 of his beautiful bears. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as making bears he\u0027s raised over $150k for charities, and in the first six months of his new endeavour, Kindness Cruises, has sent 11 families recovering from (or in remission from) various hospital treatments on a short cruise ship holiday so they can have some time together as a family to reconnect without the stress of everyday life such as the hassle of doing dishes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe says the not doing dishes bit is really important.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eCampbell is determined every cent raised for his beautiful bears or kindness cruises goes into making bears and cruises happen for suffering people and their families. He refuses to take a cent for himself from the money donated, and his family totally supports that decision. Project 365 takes its charity status seriously and knows when people give their hard earned cash they are expecting bears and Kindness Cruises, not groceries and Xboxes. It rather wonderfully never ends - especially as Campbell has a knack for coming up with new ideas on how to help people. His additional goal this year is to fund his very own researcher at the Menzies Research Centre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject 365 has grown to a point where his entire family is involved in one way or another. Even though donations mean the cost of products for each of his creations (around $90/bear) is generously covered, just keeping the supplies up for him does take time and expense. Postage alone on each bear he sends out can be anything from $20 to $70, depending on which country they\u0027re headed for. Monitoring his emails and social media and calendar is a full time job. Even something as simple as when he needs to make an appearance on telly the family has to juggle things around because of course Campbell can\u2019t travel alone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last five years, Campbell\u2019s immediate family has proudly borne the everyday costs of keeping things running. Now it\u0027s time to allow others into the fold to share the feel goods.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to join Campbell\u0027s exclusive Project 365 community you\u0027ll not only be in the know about all the wonderful goings on around here, you\u0027ll be keeping things running smoothly \u0026amp; growing, offering hope and bear hugs and a little happiness into the lives of people who need it most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Campbell says, \u0027being kind and not mean will change the world a lot\u0027. Join the inner circle and keep his incredible acts of kindness going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBruce Devereaux\u003cbr\u003eFriend of Project 365 by Campbell\u003cbr\u003e"
