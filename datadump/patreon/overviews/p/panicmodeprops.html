My name is Melissa and I am a simple novice prop and costume maker, working in a bakery by day and a tiny garage in my house at night. I\u0027ve been into building things ever since I was young, though I\u0027ve left my Lego sets behind (mostly) for life sized replicas from gaming and other media. I love to create and learn new ways to do so - so that\u0027s the hope I have for my Patreon. My dream is to do this professionally one day, whether it be for theatre or movies or cosplay, and after researching this seems to be the best way for me to start on that path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\nAs I said above, my only current source of income is from a part time job. It\u0027s enough to get me by and make props when I have some money to spare or if I know I want to build something for a convention, but if I want to really move forward and try to make this my full time job, I need another way to support it. I\u0027m not expecting or asking anyone to hand me funds - but if you like my work and want to see where I can go with it with more tools at my disposal, supporting me here is the best way to do it. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CzguQFhXEAAnzHK.jpg\" style=\"width: 287px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eLone Wolf Hanzo is one of the costumes I had to plan months in advance for - you can see more of it \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/finruiniel/sets/72157671295489570/page2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 0, 0);\"\u003eI always believe in moving forward...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\nEven if you can\u0027t afford to give anything as far as money goes, just knowing that you want to support me is more than enough. Hearing that people like my work, that it looks professional, and that I should continue with what I love is always going to keep me going forward. That being said, I won\u0027t stop posting updates to Twitter or Facebook just because I have a Patreon now, just that I might be posting more frequently or more detailed logs of builds. You won\u0027t be missing much if words are all you can give, because again they mean very much to me. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/808539109417517059/808539085597999104/P4j4X613.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eProgress has been gradual for my Mandalorian - I\u0027ve been wearing it for four years and I\u0027m still adding to it.
