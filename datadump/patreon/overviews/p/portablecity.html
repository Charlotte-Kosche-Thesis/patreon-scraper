Firstly, I\u0027ll be sharing my process here, and not just sharing it but often asking for feedback, inspiration, participation from anyone here who is interested in what I\u0027m currently making. Secondly, I\u0027ll be sending out pdfs, be they art books, comics or games, whenever I release them, to all patrons who\u0027ve signed up for that tier or higher. Thirdly and finally, I\u0027ll be designing a new canvas patch every month, with your help, and patrons at the top tier will receive them in the mail!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t let me forget to thank those of you who\u0027ve been here all along, encouraging me to find my feet in all these different projects and media.
