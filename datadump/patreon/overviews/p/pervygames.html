So I am working on a few project atm.\u003cbr\u003e2: The facility is still a secondary project, not abandoned or anything. Just waiting for a good time for me to work on the second build of it.\u003cbr\u003e3: The new project is going to be a lot shorter, a lot lighter, and hopefully more fun.\u003cbr\u003e4: Once I finish working on the new project, I plan on going back to AI but I want to get this project finished first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Links - Free build\u003cbr\u003e\n==============================\u003cbr\u003eRemoved the links to the old content will re-add the link to the Facility later, but AI will stay removed until I start working on it again.\u003cbr\u003eNanite controller -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!zowECKrT!b0wqnzF0aVufO9FC5ryCfzGcBco_SWxU6ioQI5y0GiQ\"\u003ehttps://mega.nz/#!zowECKrT!b0wqnzF0aVufO9FC5ryCfzG...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be free builds of the game going out. The first release is for everyone, but I want to reward the people who have followed and supported me and so they will be getting all the releases first, then 10 days later I will release it to the GP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Links - Patron build\u003cbr\u003e==============================\u003cbr\u003eStill Incoming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n======\u003cbr\u003e\nBest location to discuss bugs or anything wrong is below. You can also message me here if you are a supporter, or even discuss it in comments. But if you found something wrong, but can\u0027t support me yet feel free to reach me at the following links.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo threads setup to discuss this new project yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e=======================\u003cbr\u003eThe planned release schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRelease 1: Get the world created, introduce the main characters that you will deal with in the first part of the game, and then get all their generic / non-story related content in the game. I also set the stage for the more advanced parts of the story, and created the areas that will be getting fleshed out through release .02 . -.10.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.02 - Focuses primarily on the first 5 Characters getting their non-sex scenes written into the game, and images placed in them. This will include their hanging out content, going on the basic dates, and what not. (I will also be writing up the areas that the first sex scenes will take place.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.03 - Will focus on the work place environment. I will finish up all the research scenes, and what happens when you finally get them finished. I will add in scenes for when your testing the Nanites to see how they work in the real world. I also plan on getting the rest of the random encounters at work setup (but not fleshed out) in this update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.04 -  Focuses primarily on the sex with the initial Characters. Ensure that they are smooth, engaging, fun, and have images. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.05 - Will be adding the next batch of NPC\u0027s, getting them added into the current locations, add their interactions, and set up their random events, where you can encounter them at randomly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.06 - Flesh out the new NPC\u0027s random encounters, set up their sex scenes, and a couple new locations that you can find while your doing your weekly tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.07 - Ensure that everything is working, no bugs, no missing images, and that all content is fleshed out. That there are no early EOF errors, or anything that will end the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.08 - I will start adding the initial story elements. These will be done as hints for the moment. Random dreams - When you get the dream it will add flags to certain NPC\u0027s so when you go to spend time with them, it will give you a new encounter that explains what happened in the dream. Random events that happen while your doing some of your regular actions - People sitting in cars watching you, your step-sis making complaints about certain people, your step-mom telling you a couple things about your past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.09 - Will expand more on the story, with the PC actually having options to actively search out his history and what happened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.10 - This will be the end of the first part of the game. I want to do it in 3 chapters, so when you finish this when you get to the main screen there will be new options on the main menu - Chap 1, and Chap 2. This will be done so if you want to replay Chapter one differently you can do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n===============================\u003cbr\u003e\nGame breaking bugs -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n==============\u003cbr\u003e\nMinor bugs -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n======\u003cbr\u003e\nNew content -\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n======\u003cbr\u003e\nRandom notes -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n===============================\u003cbr\u003e\nPlanned new content -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n===============================\u003cbr\u003e\nKnown issues NOT fixed (Not fixed means I am still working on the issue) -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n================================\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGAME DETAILS BELOW.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSet later in the timeline of the world that I created in After Invasion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou plan an introvert who never had many friends in his life. Your father was murdered when you were a very young child, and you didn\u0027t know it until just after the game starts but your Mom and Sister are actually step-relatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Mom convinces you to go to college and get a degree, and after college you get a job working in the only field that interests you. You will eventually have 3 choices for living conditions (Live with your Mom and Sis, live with a girl you went to college with, live in company provided housing.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Character is like a super idiot savant. Slightly higher than normal IQ in most subjects, but in Nanotech and robotics he is in the top 3 smartest people in the world. He\u0027s a bit of a pervert, a bit of an ass, but also a sweet guy. He can also be a little immature at times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game will revolve around week long intervals, where you plan what you want to do during the week. Then random events will sometimes happen in your normal day to day actions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e==================\u003cbr\u003ePlanned content types.\u003cbr\u003eM/F, M/M, M/F/F, M/M/F, seduction, coercion, hypnosis, physical and mental changes, water sports. Relationship trackers, physical and mental stats, variable encounters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDetails to stop patron using the Ban hammer on me.\u003cbr\u003e1: Anyone who is an Altered being, has had their genetics twisted by science, so those NPC\u0027s have no genetic relationships between anyone else in the game. (They are considered step-relatives)\u003cbr\u003e2: The PC is only related to his relatives by marriage. (Step-mom, step-sis)\u003cbr\u003e"
