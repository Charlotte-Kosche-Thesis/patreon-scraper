    "summary": "I am the Lady Baroness Rev. Panik EVlynn Bedlam Esq. (Messenger Demigoddess \u0026amp; Spc. Ret.). In addition to being a time-traveling cyborg from a doomed future who erupted fully formed from the earth, I have spent the last thirty years developing my skills as a visual artist, writer and occultist, as well as dabbling in music (Uke \u0026amp; Bass).\u00a0Those who have not known about me in the past, I\u0027m always creating \u0026amp; posting new things: drawings, stories, carved statuettes made from wood I found by the road, photos of my adventures, and videos on Tarot instructions or playing music. It is not an exaggeration to say that 90% of all my time is focused on researching, creating, and developing interesting projects, and entertaining bodies of work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have worked as a professional graphic designer \u0026amp; multimedia illustrator for the military (US Army Veteran 25M), followed by periods working in commercial and non-profit settings, I prefer working on my own projects. \u00a0For the last 5+ years I have attempted to focus on my own work and produced a graphic novel, several illustrated books on magick, two different advanced sets of tarot cards, and several other illustrative works as well as holding several gallery exhibitions. At present my focus is a quarterly journal of post-modern pulp fantasy serials and short stories. Although many of these projects sold some copies, I am having trouble maintaining the resources to continue to produce these projects and the art related to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who are aware of my work (likely through Facebook) often recognize my work by its detailed hatching, new school pen style mixed with vibrant digital colours, and its esoteric content. I did have difficulty monetizing the work I was sharing on Facebook, however the audience was able to reach made it worth it. But early last year I was locked out of my primary account over Facebook\u0027s trans-person name policy, and this could not have come at a worse time. \u00a0Because of this I was effectively unable to promote two new books that I was releasing and made almost no money off of almost a full year of work. Due to this and other financial difficulties, just having the money to purchase supplies\u00a0I need to produce my work became hard to come by and I decided it was time to attempt moving in a new direction since this old model was unsustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why it is so important to reach new viewers and earn patrons. I\u0027ve already created a large body of work with next to no resources, but I am finding myself in a precarious position of lacking the ability to continue my work or promote what I\u0027ve already created. I am attempting a consolidation and redirection to move what I\u0027m doing to the next level instead of fizzling out; which requires the kind of resources I just don\u0027t have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will make it possible for me to purchase supplies, rent a studio space, produce a better web page, and make it easier to create new products and rewards for fans and patrons!\u00a0Please consider becoming a patron to my work. I have done everything I can to dedicate myself to the production of insightful, quality art, and there is no way I can do it without you! \u003cbr\u003e"
