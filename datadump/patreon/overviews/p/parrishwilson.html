    "summary": "Thanks for checking out my Patreon page! I know it can be tough for people to find their way here because they\u2019re not familiar with Patreon and don\u2019t know why it\u2019s such a great platform for creators. So let\u2019s talk about that first, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStraight up, Patreon is a way for artists to get paid to do what they love to do: create art. And the connection is direct, patron to artist. That means I\u0027m creating my best stuff for YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn turn, your support (or patronage) allows me to put more time into my personal writing on the topics of raising boys, mental health and modern motherhood, giving me the opportunity to make a bigger impact in these areas and advocate for change without worrying (as much) about how to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking my mark on the world through writing has always been my dream, and Patreon is a powerful and effective way for me to do that. I\u2019ve tried a number of other setups to make it happen but Patreon makes it sooooooo easy which means more time writing and less time fussing in the background. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you for venturing into the (possibly) unknown territory that is Patreon. I hope you enjoy my writing and find many more creators to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy 2018 Patreon Project:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, in advance of the publication of my full-length memoir about my experience with postpartum depression, \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m writing nine essays on my experience of motherhood which I will self-publish as a small book titled, This Motherhood of Mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to use my stories to capture truths other mothers can relate to so they may know they are not alone in their struggles, nor their celebrations. These essays will explore modern motherhood with my always underlying themes of mental health and creativity. I will write about raising boys in a world when we desperately need good men, about how children can wreak havoc on love, sex and dreams, about the identity crisis and \u201chaving it all\u201d and escaping to the bathroom for a good cry and some dark chocolate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my motherhood, and I want to share it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron of my work, you\u2019ll get to see these essays develop over the year as well as enjoy smaller pieces I create along the way. I\u2019ll post something most weeks, either a blog-like-piece or an in-progress essay or a behind-the-scenes tidbit. Thus, if you choose to support me for $3/month you can expect to receive something from me weekly (most of the time), and be a big part of my creative work this year. The higher support levels have more involved monthly rewards that I encourage you to check out, especially if you want some really cool opportunities to write with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut no matter how much you pledge, I thank you. Your patronage will allow me to focus my creative energy on my writing and bringing my work to a bigger audience in hopes of becoming part of the national conversation on motherhood and mental health. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am often asked if it is hard to be so vulnerable when it comes to the struggles I experience but I believe it is my service to the world to share my stories so that they may give hope to others who would otherwise feel alone. Putting my truths out into the world is the right thing to do. We need more truth, it builds connection. We need to share more of our hardest moments, to know we\u0027re not alone in them. Especially as mothers, we need to know that we are enough, just as we are. In the mess of it all, our truth is enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so this year, I share with you, This Motherhood of Mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI bestow upon you my endless gratitude for making this project possible through your patronage."
