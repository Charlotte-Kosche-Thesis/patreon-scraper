Visit \u003ca href=\"http://packingtherabbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epackingtherabbit.com\u003c/a\u003e for all current and past comic strips. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support the work or are another creator just here learning about patreon it really is a great program. It allows artists like myself to connect with my audience and other creators. Right now I have a limited amount of time to devout to the comic strip, about 1 day a week. With some support from the more discerning and attractive patrons out there, I can commit more time to the work. The more time I spend, the better it will be, the more support it will attract, and I\u0027ll be able to spend even more time on it. Ultimately, it\u0027s my chance to make a thoughtful mark on the world of art and humor, but I need your help to do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePTR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Russell Bertrand is a recently graduated writer who lives in a studio apartment with his own personal demons, more singularly, his own personal demon, Silvio, a low-stakes cross-dressing devil send by the infernal powers to corrupt him. Finding the job already accomplished by a high-carb, consumerist, overly-stimulated society, Silvio becomes less of a contaminating influence and more of a pal, and underachieving demon for an underachieving creative. Rounding out this pleasant domestic situation are the enigmatic Mr. Rat, a household rodent and haberdashery enthusiast, and the appropriately named Creepy Gary, a neighbor who assures us of his forthcoming exoneration by the local courts of any and all offenses, imagined or otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSwimming and debt an unable to monetize any of his creative endeavors, Russell stumbles from one minimum wage job to another, the indignity of it all only exceeded by a non-existent sex life and a loosening grip on his recreational drug use. The daily escape from these more-or-less self inflicted woes is the Rabbit, a local bar, suitably dark and loud enough for an un-remarked writer to hide from his failures, or worse, the slim chance of success. The Rabbit is owned and operated by Cutter, a quiet confidant and entirely neutral witness to Russell\u0027s follies and fuck-ups, and Sasha, Cutter\u0027s dangerously attractive niece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a constant stream of collection calls only interrupted by mustached old men demanding to know just where the hell he was as his shift at the cannery started 45 minutes ago, two roads stretch before our hero. One ends with an uninspired middle-age sad sack finally buying that hand gun haunting his dreams, and the other, far more frightening path, leads under the guard towers and over the barbed wired fences of this post-modern prison that seems to have sprung up over night to beautiful ocean sunsets silhouetting taught forms dancing under tyrian skies. Join Russell as he runs screaming towards that uncaring horizon. Laugh at his sorrows, cry at his fashion sense, and storm defiant against the gaping oblivion that awaits us all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso there will be a TON of dick jokes. I promise.\u003cbr\u003e",
