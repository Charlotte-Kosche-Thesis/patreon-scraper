Paints are a bit on the pricey side. It\u0027s like makeup. A small tube of a cadmium-based pigment like Cadmium Yellow or Red can cost $20. A good brush as much, as is a decent canvas. Cheap brushes, canvas and paints can be had, but the artist pays in usability. The brushes may be cheap but they don\u0027t maintain their shape or the perform well, the paint maybe not cover well or have a waxy appearance when dry. Cheap canvas comes un-coated, requiring more materials to prep it for work.\u00a0The recipient of the artwork suffers as well. Cheap brushes lose bristles easily, which can end up in the paint. Poor paint can crack or discolor, as can the canvas beneath, sometimes discoloring the paint.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with any serious work, materials are important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 96, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am an artist.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eI create art. \u003cem\u003eLots\u003c/em\u003e of different kinds of art. The hard part about creating art is getting it seen. While I love creating it for its own sake, it means so much more if I know I touch others with it. What good is making beautiful things if no one sees it, or if you can never tell whether or not people enjoy seeing it as much as I enjoy making it. It\u0027s like making music. It\u0027s so much more fulfilling playing for others than just playing for yourself.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://m2.behance.net/rendition/pm/6697681/disp/a1e36c53fcf9d5d386c089c12e19f4e0.jpg\" style=\"width: 619px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://pre11.deviantart.net/f924/th/pre/i/2017/052/c/d/luke_freeman__esq__by_protoguy-dazwksu.jpg\" style=\"width: 426px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://pre06.deviantart.net/ef29/th/pre/f/2015/147/c/d/leeloo_16x20_4000_by_protoguy-d8uxfdo.jpg\" style=\"width: 748px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003eThat\u0027s where the problem of motivation enters the picture. Knowing there are people supporting me, waiting for more stuff from me motivates me to create more. Like most artists, aside from making money doing what we love, we also want to show the world what we create and hopefully attain some sort of fame for it. This is also part of the deal with Patreon.

To pay my bills and have food and a roof (or at least KEEP my roof).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eShort-term goals are fairly numerous. Primarily I\u0027d like to be able to afford the paint I use to create. A single, small tube of Cadmium Red or Yellow goes for about $14 if you buy the cheaper varieties. A good brush will set you back about the same. I\u0027ve gotten to the point where I can paint an entire piece with just three colors and white, just like they taught us in that first art class. The Primaries: Red, Blue and Yellow, though often for the sake of skin tones, I substitute a bright orange for yellow.\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img14.deviantart.net/549e/i/2017/056/0/d/daryl_by_protoguy-d8a0i1n.jpg\" style=\"width: 824px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThe goal is not to limit my palette for financial reasons. To not limit the size of the canvas I paint on because I can\u0027t afford that much paint or too large a canvas. I would LOVE to paint epic sized works, but the initial costs of doing so, with no guarantee of return is not possible right now. That\u0027s where you guys come in. That\u0027s what a Patron is.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did Michelangelo eat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eFor the most part, artists from the age of the Renaissance up until the Industrial Revolution didn\u0027t get paid per piece, they made a living through the patronage of a wealthy donor. Artists would often take commissions or teach students to supplement their income, but the day-to-day expenses of just living were covered by the generosity of their patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I use the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eThe money is something that allows me to take on more creative risks than I would be able to otherwise. While pledging is not required to be a part of my team (It is just one way to participate of many) it does provide me with resources to pursue that next creative hurdle with great gusto. Yes, I make money from the sale of my art. But just like any other business there is overhead and those bills get paid. So when I receive money above that threshold, it allows me to pursue things that didn\u0027t fit in the budget before. One example is for Patreon funds to pay the entry fee to a competition (The last one I submitted to was $45), should I win - that investment will bring more income, should I loose - it won\u0027t. So those types of expenses often aren\u0027t made. But with Patreon, I can! \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eNow the Emotional Bribery!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eNot really.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am a cancer survivor (so far). In 2011 I was diagnosed with Head and Neck Cancer. That\u0027s the official type of cancer I had. Technically, I had Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the right tonsil. Radical Neck Dissection with Pec Flap Procedure is what they call the surgery I had done. Do not Google. 35 sessions of radiation and 3 sessions of chemo. The resulting side effects of all three are significant but manageable. Unfortunately, cancer also gave me an autoimmune disease: Dermatomyositis. There are treatments available (pricey meds) but there is no cure (yet!). Essentially, my immune system sees my own muscle tissue as \"alien\" or foreign and does it\u0027s best to destroy it. Muscle tissue is attacked, destroyed and replaced by calcium deposits and connective tissue. It was about 3 months before I finally got a diagnosis and in that time I went from feeling perfectly fine, to not being able to lift my arms or get out of bed easily. If I fell, my legs weren\u0027t strong enough to get up again and my arms weren\u0027t strong enough to pull me up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOnce diagnosed and on the right meds those issues went away, but the damage was already done and my muscle mass is significantly less in my shoulders, arms, legs and especially my neck, which was already having issues from the cancer surgery. I can\u0027t lift my head off of my pillow without using my own arm to pull my head up. Frustrating is too mild a word for how this makes you feel day in and day out.\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that once the muscle is destroyed and replaced, it doesn\u0027t come back. It\u0027s been replaced. I can exercise the muscle that\u0027s still there, but what\u0027s gone is gone. The end result of not getting treatment or even a lifetime of flare-ups is that eventually I could end up wheelchair-bound or worse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll these words are not to make you feel sorry for me, but to help you understand my predicament. I lost my job when I was diagnosed in 2011 and again in 2013 and I haven\u0027t been able to get back to work in my field since. Hiring me can seem like a gamble to an employer, so I\u0027ve chosen to rely on my own resourcefulness. This is why Patreon is a blessing for me, and my Patrons (saints). It isn\u0027t going to earn me enough to live on, (it could, but that\u0027s a long-term goal) but it does supplement my freelance and commission work. Prescriptions aren\u0027t cheap, even with insurance (which also isn\u0027t cheap!)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eSO\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eI know. Everyone has a story. Mine is not nearly as rough as many, but now you know it and maybe my griping helps you understand why I\u0027m here, more than just the wish to get paid to make pretty pictures. \u003cem\u003e\"Help me, Obiwans, you my only hope!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNah, but you\u0027d definitely kick ass if you drop a pledge on me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
