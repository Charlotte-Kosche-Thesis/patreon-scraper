    "summary": "What is Pixelrater? Well, it\u0027s a website I (Antonio) created because I wanted an outlet to express my love for gaming and general geeky thoughts. Who is Pixelrater? Well it\u0027s me and three of my best friends who all used to work together but now have separate jobs. Yet this site, and more specifically our podcast (LAN Party), has propelled us from work friends to family in no time. We all love each other so much and it\u0027s something you can hear in our episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e At the moment we all have regular IT jobs but would love to do this full time. I mean, that\u0027s the dream if I\u0027m being honest. But even if that doesn\u0027t happen, we\u0027ll continue to do this podcast for free because we hate ads and we\u0027re proud of the fact that we don\u0027t have any on our site or in our podcast. Instead we\u0027d rather you pay what you think we\u0027re worth. The more we get, the more we can invest in better gear like capture cards and lighting kits and the more content we can create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping us out. We love you. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
