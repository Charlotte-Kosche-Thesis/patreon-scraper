As a Patreon backer at the Beta and Experimental levels you\u0027ll be getting builds that are in-progress. In the worse case there will be game breaking bugs (though those are rare), but likely there will be little glitches, animation issues, or other bugs. Being part of this process you\u0027re helping me identify these issues, and I\u0027ll do my best to solve them in subsequent releases. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour feedback helps me shape the project, and your support allows me to continue the development!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso fyi, this is a solo project. I\u0027m just one dude. I currently put in as much time as possible on evenings and weekends, but until the campaign reaches a level where I can safely quit one of my part time jobs, I\u0027ll be putting in long hours to make this thing happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little more detail about the reward tiers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon Exclusive Content - \u003cem\u003eYou get some Patreon exclusive content \u0026amp; NSFW images \u0026amp; video. This is more \"behind the scenes\" than the public content I post in other places.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFeedback Polls - \u003cem\u003eOccasionally I\u0027ll post polls, clothing designs, sex positions, hardware preferences, etc. Feel free to vote on previously gathered polls if you like, I do check back over them occasionally.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBeta Releases - \u003cem\u003eThese are generally big updates roughly every 2-3 months containing many new, and hopefully stable feature \u0026amp; content releases. I generally post an overview at the start of each Beta \"phase\" with the planned content, although this sometimes changes a little during the development.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExperimental Features - \u003cem\u003eThe experimental builds are more frequent, usually 1 per-month, and contain content that is fresh off the press. With the experimental builds I\u0027m often looking for feedback \u0026amp; testing of specific new content, so this reward tier will get you the most engaged in the development process if that\u0027s your jam!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s the project going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a public production plan posted here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/YzRtxydB/icandy-final-release\"\u003eiCandy Trello Board\u003c/a\u003e which gives you insight into the features planned, and their planned release schedule.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe current prototype is just a proof of\nconcept. The full release will have more extensive options to customize and control the\nexperience.

I\u0027ll be adding 4 additional positions for the full release.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGender Selection and modification of yourself and your partner.

Given my rate of progress so far the final release will likely be mid-2018. However, if this campaign reaches a point where I can transition and focus 20+ hours/week on the project that timeline could move up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe final price?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI expect the full release to cost\nbetween $10-$15.
