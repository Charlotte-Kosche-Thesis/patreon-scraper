My appreciation only has grown with the positive feedback passed along with each subsequent book I\u2019ve written and published. Thank you very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStephen Grant \u2013 the onetime Navy SEAL, former CIA operative and current Lutheran pastor \u2013 and the remaining cast of characters, including family and friends from his church life as well as former colleagues (and much more!) from his CIA days, seem to have struck a chord with many readers. I\u2019ve also heard from various reviewers and readers that these thrillers and mysteries are not your typical Christian fiction, and that they offer a nice balance between action, suspense, faith, humor, intrigue, romance and adventure. My mission, if you will, is to create novels that offer compelling stories and interesting characters, are fun to read by a wide audience, and embrace and reflect a Christian worldview without, well, hitting people over the head with wooden earnestness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u2019s been a fun ride for me, and I hope for readers as well. In fact, my only frustration has been finding ways to write more! I have ideas outlined for additional PASTOR STEPHEN GRANT novels, an assortment of short stories, a spinoff series, and more. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo make this happen, I\u2019m turning to you \u2013 the readers, including so many that I\u2019ve come to know a bit through social media, book gatherings and signings \u2013 for help via Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ve always said that I\u2019ll keep writing as long as someone wants to read what I write. Thanks to reader support from this Patreon effort, I will be able to pen more PASTOR STEPHEN GRANT and related novels, while also generating short stories, reader guides, and other fun material. At various levels of support, you can become an essential part of making this happen, while getting to read everything written before the rest of the world, and earning other exclusive benefits \u2013 some that are pretty darn cool!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you for your support. If you have enjoyed reading the PASTOR STEPHEN GRANT novels half as much as I love writing them, then I\u2019ve managed to create something worthwhile. The fact that you spend your money and time on my books is both humbling and encouraging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod bless!\u003cbr\u003eRay Keating\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, Ray Keating has published the following PASTOR STEPHEN GRANT novels (with more on the way!):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1979463514/ref=nav_timeline_asin?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;psc=1\"\u003eREAGAN COUNTRY\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lionhearts-Pastor-Stephen-Grant-Novel/dp/1548964182/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1504129660\u0026amp;sr=8-2\"\u003eLIONHEARTS\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wine-Into-Water-Pastor-Stephen/dp/1515274950/ref=pd_sim_14_5?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=1515274950\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=MH093J2YJJT0VDRN6197\u0026amp;pd_rd_w=cnYBU\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=kTKm5\u0026amp;psc=1\u0026amp;refRID=MH093J2YJJT0VDRN6197\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWINE INTO WATER\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Murderers-Row-Pastor-Stephen-Grant/dp/1514137615/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=1514137615\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=P4PWKP6YSXA73ZHY2BF6\u0026amp;pd_rd_w=X5wMK\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=JXDiI\u0026amp;psc=1\u0026amp;refRID=P4PWKP6YSXA73ZHY2BF6\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMURDERER\u2019S ROW\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/River-Pastor-Stephen-Grant-Novel/dp/1499514174/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=1499514174\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=8H1SW5KQ4ZEMTWR70TRV\u0026amp;pd_rd_w=sQIjD\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=wQGrF\u0026amp;psc=1\u0026amp;refRID=8H1SW5KQ4ZEMTWR70TRV\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTHE RIVER\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Advent-Religious-Liberty-Pastor-Stephen/dp/1480174491/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=1480174491\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=ZTRFX1ZPJ0MPKS324AG7\u0026amp;pd_rd_w=z9Kqx\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=7PIHs\u0026amp;psc=1\u0026amp;refRID=ZTRFX1ZPJ0MPKS324AG7\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAN ADVENT FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Root-All-Evil-Pastor-Stephen/dp/1479112194/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=1479112194\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=E8D3NMW1AJY8ZCWJTC35\u0026amp;pd_rd_w=0YsG6\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=U72AB\u0026amp;psc=1\u0026amp;refRID=E8D3NMW1AJY8ZCWJTC35\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eROOT OF ALL EVIL?\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Warrior-Monk-Pastor-Stephen-Grant/dp/1453801030/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=1453801030\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=GDP1EMJHF79Q12Q2VQN3\u0026amp;pd_rd_w=AamVs\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=aeVHc\u0026amp;psc=1\u0026amp;refRID=GDP1EMJHF79Q12Q2VQN3\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWARRIOR MONK\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat have reviewers said about the PASTOR STEPHEN GRANT novels? Consider just the following recent 12-point sample:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. About REAGAN COUNTRY, Kirkus Reviews declared, \"Keating has accumulated an impressive assortment of characters in his series, and he gives each of them ample opportunity to shine... As in the preceding novels, the author skillfully blends Grant\u0027s sermonizing with intermittent bouts of violence. It creates a rousing moral quandary for readers to ponder without either side overwhelming the storyline. Tight action scenes complement the suspense (uncertainty over when the next possible attack will be)... The villains, meanwhile, are just as rich and engrossing as the good guys and gals. The familiar protagonist, along with sensational new and recurring characters, drives an energetic political tale.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.\u00a0Kirkus Reviews offered a stellar review of LIONHEARTS: \"In this seventh entry of a series, terrorists attacking Christians in the United States must contend with the proficient recurring protagonist armed with Scripture and a Glock\u2026 By now, fans of Keating\u0027s \u2026 thriller series will anticipate skillfully drawn characters. [Stephen] Grant, for one, is a considerate husband and unquestionably capable in action\u2026 The narrative\u0027s swift momentum is retained even during profound moments, like a scene in which terrorists debate their cause after murdering two men that\u0027s intercut with clergymen reciting biblical passages. Though sequences of Grant or [Paige] Caldwell and her team engaged in combat are exhilarating, the story\u0027s brimming with everyday heroes. One political figure, for example, is rescued by a neighbor whose courage is measured by the hefty Desert Eagle gun he brandishes. First-rate supporting characters complement the sprightly pastor, who remains impeccable in this thriller.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Pastor Rod Zwonitzer, the retired host of KFUO radio\u0027s BookTalk show, says about LIONHEARTS: \"Keating builds on solid theological ground in all his novels and this is no exception. In this novel, a homegrown radical jihadist scheme that attacks soft US targets creates the scenario into which Grant and his cohorts enter to produce a highly charged mystery train for the reader to ride with anticipation to the outcome. Again, I recommend to prospective and veteran Pastor Grant novel readers, \u0027Ray Keating is a great novelist!\u0027 Thanks Ray and let\u0027s go for a least a dozen in the series.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. About WINE INTO WATER, Kirkus Reviews says, \"A first-rate mystery makes this a series standout\u2026\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. MURDERER\u0027S ROW: A PASTOR STEPHEN GRANT NOVEL by Ray Keating named \"Book of the Year 2015\" by \"BookTalk\" on KFUO Christian radio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. On MURDERER\u0027S ROW, Kirkus Reviews says, \"Action fans will find plenty to love here, from gunfights and murder sprees to moral dilemmas.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Kirkus Reviews also gives a big thumbs up to THE RIVER: \"A gritty, action-stuffed, well-considered thriller with a gun-toting clergyman.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. THE RIVER: A PASTOR STEPHEN GRANT NOVEL was a KFUO \"Book of the Year\" finalist in 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. From a Washington Times review of THE RIVER written by a pastor and former CIA officer: \"What Ian Fleming\u0027s 007 series has probably done for ex-MI-6 agents and Tom Clancy has done for retired CIA officers, Mr. Keating has done for the minority of former CIA agents who have served their country by working in the intelligence community, but now wish to serve God.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10. The host of KFUO radio\u0027s \"BookTalk,\" calls Ray Keating \"a great novelist.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e11. A Touchstone magazine review of MURDERER\u0027S ROW says: \"This is a fun read, though the embedded theology is real and salutary. There is death and life, adultery and commitment, friendship and betrayal, violence and victory over violence\u2026 Perhaps the best part of the book for the reviewer is that the clergy are good at helping people bring Christ into their vocations.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e12. Lutheran Book Review says: \"I miss Tom Clancy. Keating fills that void for me.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
