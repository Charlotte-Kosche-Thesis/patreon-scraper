I enjoy working on my stories as they allow me to express different possible scenarios and predicaments not found in original stories. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that it is my hope to live up to the expectations of those following my fan fictions by providing more frequent updates. I believe that pledges would allow me more time to spend writing than out working any jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s also not to say that I have to be payed to work on my stories that are primarily to do with Fate Stay Night like \"Fate-In time,\" \"Vasto of White,\" and \"Huntsman of Red.\" As a fan fiction writer, I can guarantee those will always be free. As I previously stated, the pledges are only for those willing to donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can say at this moment is that updates will be slower during my months in university, but will increase during the off semester.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any who decide to pledge, I sincerely thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
