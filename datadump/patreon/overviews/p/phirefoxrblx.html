    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eOBLIGATORY STORYTIME\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my life I\u0027ve been interested in creating and YouTube really helped nurture that aspect of mine. I grew up with YouTube, it was \u003cem\u003emy version of television, since I didn\u0027t have a television in the first place. \u003c/em\u003eSo I\u0027m growing up watching these amazing people like wowcrendor, ralphthemoviemaker, IHE, Smosh, Cynical Brit, and even back in the day I would watch Shane Dawson -- and all I would think to myself back then was \u003cem\u003e\"how do I make videos like this?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWell, I had no idea how but I sure did begin trying and it all started back on Windows Movie Maker. My first YouTube channel has since been deleted (by myself), RIP \"rougesrus\" (which, at the time I was really into WoW, and I apparently had no idea ROGUES is how you spell ROGUES)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I moved onto JSimonTV and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/pyromentaljosh\"\u003ePyromentalJosh\u003c/a\u003e, where I was heavily inspired by Shane Dawson, yet that channel didn\u0027t quite hit the mark either.. There was something lacking, aside from the .. you know .. Experience I needed to make a good video, lol. Eventually I quit both channels and stopped making videos for a short period of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen came the idea of PhireFoxRBLX. Inspired HEAVILY by wowcrendor at the time, and a whole lot of interest in Roblox, I decided \"you know, no one has really made a dedicated roblox channel with weekly uploads and machinimas yet.. I should do that.\" and so .. I did that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s exactly what I needed, I needed a focus point for each video. A topic to surround my topics around. A niche I could garner viewers from. I love Roblox, I love making videos. It just kind of... Fell together perfectly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here I am, still with PhireFox. Five year laters and I\u0027d like to say my edited and voice acting has gotten tremendously better, my writing has improved and so on and so on..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePoint being, I was molded by YouTube as I grew up. I\u0027m a creator, I love creating and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever stop. So, if you like my content, maybe think about supporting me for me. Unfortunately YouTube has been getting stricter and stricter with what you can say and make money off of lately and it makes it kind of hard for people like me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, sincerely.\u003cbr\u003e(and thanks for taking the time to read this freaking blog post of a bio)\u003cbr\u003e"
