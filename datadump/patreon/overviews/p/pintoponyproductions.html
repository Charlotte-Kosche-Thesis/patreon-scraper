    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027ve been working on making my e-commerce shop successful. It has been a year of learning sales-copy on the fly, marketing niches as they become available, remembering holidays, using my knowledge as a niche retailer, and just trying to be a good, busy human. I\u0027ve made nearly 100 sales in the last year, and now want to progress into some bigger, heavier projects. I could continue with what I know, but I want to progress, I want to offer more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The shop is a passion project. The shop is how I want to spend every minute of the waking day, if I\u0027m not doing my cardio in the pool. Every piece available is the embodiment of work-ethic: created with intent, with thought, and practiced skill. Each piece available has heart, is passion imbued. This is where abstract, unfocused creativity meets focused, concrete effort, with results that sparkle. It is a woman-owned, woman-operated, and woman-created business. A one-woman-show, showing the world what is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I create hand-made jewelry designed with forethought and concern for aesthetic and novelty. I enjoy investing time in detail-oriented things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have tried my hand at just about every fiddly hobby imaginable. I\u0027ve taken up writing, sketching, miniature model assembly and painting, photography, assemblage and decoupage, gardening-if it keeps me busy, I\u0027ve done it. On the grander scale, I\u0027ve taken up great feats of physical ability-HIIT training/cross-fit, equestrian sports, endurance swimming. Needless to say, I like to stay busy and keep my mind active.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making jewelry fulfills not only my drive to do, but also my drive to create. I enjoy finding an aesthetic, and working within its parameters, but then pushing that envelope just a little to make the piece fit a few other aesthetics. I enjoy creating a set of pieces that fulfill a niche in the market, without being too kitschy, too trendy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adapting to trends is not a problem; having trendy inventory lapse is the problem. It creates waste, and I do not like waste. I create to avoid waste, and provide long-term, wearable, affordable jewelry you don\u0027t have to upgrade to fit the new fashion season.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some of the pieces in-shop use repurposed and reclaimed beads and charms. So much old jewelry is donated to thrift shops, and it has so much potential, if it is just put to work. Every reclaimed piece is cleaned and carefully considered for use to prevent waste, and prevent it going to a thrift shop next season.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am my own boss, but you, the client, do advise my direction. I strive for fast, friendly, personal service. I always hope that when you wear your purchase, you feel that purposeful drive, that personal consideration, and the forethought in each piece.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you for stopping by! Do not hesitate to drop a note if you have questions about a piece, or need some extra service. I will do my utmost best to accommodate or direct you to a business that will be more helpful."

Totally all jewelry and accessories, totally medium USPS Flat Rate Box of stuff. Maybe stuff pulled out of inventory. Maybe stuff never even offered to the public. Maybe experimental stuff I\u0027m throwing around as a possibility for sale, but need a field test. You\u0027ll see, if you subscribe at this tier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I say thank you yet?\u003c/p\u003e",
