    "summary": "My name is Pauline McDaniel, and I recently graduated ENMU with a degree in Music Education. I\u0027m using this platform as a way to practice teaching, essentially! I will be posting videos to teach music reading and guitar. Just want to learn the basics of music? Great! Just select the first option \"Basic Music Reading Lessons\" and you will pay $10/month, for as long as wish to view the videos. I will be uploading at least four videos a month. Want to learn the very basics of guitar as well? Choose the \"Music Reading + Guitar Lessons\" option, and pay $15/month. I\u0027ve also created the option, to where if you want to learn songs, you can pay $20/month. My goal is to upload two or more songs a month. Have requests for what you want to learn? Just reach out to me and I\u0027ll see what I can do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Note: I am an amateur when it comes to playing guitar. This is a very basic approach, for the ultimate beginner. I\u0027m not a professional guitarist. I have not taken one class in guitar in my life. I am largely self-taught, with the help of my dad and the internet. If you\u0027re just wishing to learn guitar as a hobby, and something to do for fun, I highly recommend using this resource! If you\u0027re considering pursuing a career in guitar, I highly encourage you to take lessons from a professional!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo... What is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTypically, Patreon is a website that gives people a chance to share their artwork. It allows creators to ask for financial support so they can make their artwork as high quality as possible. In this case, I\u0027m taking the unconventional approach and using this platform to teach!\u003cbr\u003e"
