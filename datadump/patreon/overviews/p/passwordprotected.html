A whole new world opens up to her, taking her away from the pain and anxiety in her everyday life. She has hope. She has a new outlet. She makes mistakes. She gets lost. She escapes. She makes friends. She makes enemies. She gets caught up in drama. She shares too much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re all familiar with this girl. I\u0027m certainly not the only person who used the internet to escape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter how much I shared, though, there were always layers that I hid.
