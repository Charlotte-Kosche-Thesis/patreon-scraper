    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! First and foremost, thank you very much for finding your way to my patreon page!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Harry Bradshaw, but I am more commonly known as the partnered caster, \u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/pewgeminilive\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePewGeminiLive\u003c/a\u003e. I stream 7 days a week, for at least 6-8 hours a day, playing a variety of games, all the way from massively difficult, to story driven games. In between setting challenges for myself on stream, and interacting with chat, I try my best to be as entertaining as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot too long ago, I managed to achieve partnership [\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/H6Gv5rvimo8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/H6Gv5rvimo8\u003c/a\u003e]\u00a0which means that I also managed to get a sub button! This is fantastic for the reason that people can subscribe to the channel, to gain channel emotes, which is brilliant; for certain people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI found myself asking one day, what about the lurkers? The people who are here to watch the show, not to interact, not to put emotes in chat, and who\u0027s sub is really meaning that they aren\u0027t getting anything back, aside from emotes that they\u0027re not using.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis led me to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a place where I can actually give back to people who want\u00a0to give to the channel, it means I can set group goals, and it also means I can reward individuals who want to support me above and beyond, Instead of just a \"thank you so much\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal is to be able to earn enough from this, the stream, and my sources of income that all derive from everything I do on twitch, so that I am able to move out with my girlfriend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy second goal is to be able to keep \"PewGeminiLive\" alive, and to use Patreon as a system to which I can create goals that allow me to make the stream more exciting, and interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far, and haven\u0027t clicked out just yet, firstly thank you so much! Secondly, I urge you to look at the goals I have set, and hope that you won\u0027t be disappointed. I hope to see you on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-Harry\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/pewgeminilive\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePewGeminiLive\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
