    "summary": "Hello, my name is Tadej Kurepa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my website \u003ca href=\"http://politfilm.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epolitfilm.com\u003c/a\u003e I publish \u003cstrong\u003ereviews of political movies and documentaries\u003c/strong\u003e. Behind every text there is an in depth research and an effort to place the film in its adequate social and political context. The general idea of this effort is to prepare the reader for a proper understanding of the film they are about to see. Thanks to this educational aspect, over the past few years \u003ca href=\"http://politfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epolitfilm.com\u003c/a\u003e has grown into a \u003cstrong\u003eserious online resource on political films\u003c/strong\u003e. In addition to writing, I organized over fifty film screenings and other events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of the films I screen and write about are addressing some of the most important issues of our society: war crimes, privacy, corporations, investigative journalism, corruption, the military-industrial complex, mass media, dehumanization, poverty, repression, resistance and social change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I was working on several different jobs in the meantime, it took me over 4 years to write and publish 100 film reviews, but from now on, I intend to publish at least 100 reviews every year. For this to happen, however, I need your help and support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first long-term goal is to create and \u003cstrong\u003epublish a book with 250 film reviews\u003c/strong\u003e, which I will send as an e-book to all those who support me. In the future I also plan to conduct interviews with filmmakers and other film professionals, and to write about how certain topics are treated in the movies, as well as longer articles about several films that together represent some phenomenon or a historical period.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike crowd-funding platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo where you run a one-time campaign, Patreon is a tool for long-term support. Basically, one chooses to support my work by automatically giving me some small amount of money per every film review I write. If I don\u0027t write, I get nothing. You can also set your monthly maximum. For example, if you decide to give me $5 per text and set monthly maximum to $20, even if I publish 10 reviews that month I will still receive $20 from you, as this is set to be your maximum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who choose to support my work will have my appreciation in form of various rewards which include regular film recommendations, access to various materials regarding political films and insight into my work-process. For more information please take a look at section \u201cRewards\u201d on this page. If you decide to support me, click on \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button. If not, thanks for your attention and I hope you will find some interesting films on my website \u003ca href=\"http://politfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epolitfilm.com\u003c/a\u003e"
