I\u0027m on several sides of publishing as some of my work is self-published, while other stories are handled traditionally. I write for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cracked.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCracked\u003c/a\u003e, and I have edited on a freelance basis for Dragon Moon Press, the \u003cem\u003eHellmaw\u003c/em\u003e series from The Ed Greenwood Group as well as private clients.

For example, I love writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jamiewyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=246\u0026amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eflash-fiction\u003c/a\u003e. Flash pieces are complete stories of 1000 words or less (that\u0027s about 4 pages). I also like writing shorter fiction in the universe of my urban fantasy series, and blog posts about the writing and publishing process. On top of writing, I also love to draw and color. I\u0027ve been doing Zentangle doodles, coloring in various books, and have even taken to drawing my own intricate mandalas. These things sometimes take a back seat to the work I\u0027m doing for various publishers, but I\u0027d like to change that. All of these things help recharge my batteries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI wish I could promise regular content, however...\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I deal with chronic pain, fatigue and depression. I\u0027ll be honest, sometimes it\u0027s difficult to do much of anything. I\u0027m very open about living the \"spoonie\" life. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e, you will\u00a0have a hand in helping me select my flash fiction topics, so I\u0027ll be writing stories FOR YOU. You\u0027ll also \u00a0get access to \"behind-the-scenes\" posts about my current works in progress, including previews and even calls for beta readers. And you get first dibs on all posts. I will post stories or pictures here at least a day earlier than the rest of the world will see it, AND, sometimes you\u0027ll get exclusives. As we grow I\u0027d like to offer other things like exclusive merchandise, live Google chat Q\u0026amp;As, and story critiques.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverything I post will be free to everyone to read\u003c/strong\u003e.
