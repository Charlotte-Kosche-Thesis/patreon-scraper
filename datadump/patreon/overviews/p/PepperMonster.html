    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eI have been cosplaying for fun for three years now, and have been very happy making what I can with-in my means. But I am looking to expand. It is difficult to get money together to do large projects, and now that I have started competing it\u0027s nearly impossible now to grow with people\u0027s expectations of me. I am having fun, and that will always be my goal, but if I want to compete at NYCC this year, and C2E2 next year, I need a little help from friends family and fans to get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is purely here for those who wish to help me with my cosplay goals while I with my adult life struggle on with my adult responsibilities. I want to make people proud, I want to make people happy, I want to be a challanger at competitions. I believe in raising people up, and mentoring, and that is my ultimate goal here. To be a positive light in the cosplay community. While I am new and not as talented as so many, there are things I have learned that I am eager to pass on to others. Helping me cosplay opens up opportunities for me to attend events and conventions and meet people who I hope to inspire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will be going into my grand cosplays, as well as my prints, my tutorials, and other content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My biggest claim to fame is my New Thor cosplay that appeared on Marvel\u0027s Cosplay Varient Covers released in 2015. My letter about \"Lady Thor\" in issue #1 of The Mighty Thor, and my appearance on Marvel Live pod-cast about the new female Thor. I competed in 2015 at C2E2 with New Thor, and at NYCC 2015 with Angela of Asgurd where I won my category in Comic Books and took second place over all. As of 2016 I competed for a second time at C2E3 2016 and took Third Place in Comic Books with my Dark World Thor cosplay. I\u0027m a micro-blogger on being a female fan in nerd culture, and am an all around goof on instagram.\u00a0",
