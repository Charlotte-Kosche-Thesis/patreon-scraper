    "summary": "So, I guess you have some extra moolah to spend, don\u0027t you? And to be real with you, I did google \"How to write an emotional donation request\" which made me realize that writing is not my cup of coffee. Hence, back to the academics: Our vision (and, of course, by \u201cour\u201d I mean \u201cmy\u201d, though \"my\" sounds a little self-centered, that\u0027s why I don\u0027t use it, and see, I\u0027ve gone off tracks again) is to \u003cstrong\u003emake creative education Fun and Free for everyone. Forever! \u003c/strong\u003eWhat a creative way to add 3Fs, now let\u0027s a fourth, Finance!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow am I able to create all tutorials for Free? Well, my extreme love for teaching (and a little camera attention) pushes me to do it, no matter what! Also, there\u0027s one more reason, a couple of years ago, while I was desperate to learn all these wonderful programs and software, and was looking up at the tutorials on the internet, most of the really awesome tutorials were asking for money, some as high as $150-200. As a student, affording an internet connection was difficult, set aside a tutorial. That helplessness made me promise to myself that when I learn all these softwares, I\u0027m going to teach and make it available to everyone for free, and I am doing it, and have made more than 320 videos so far, which you can watch right now at youtube.com/piximperfect\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, resources for making the content, are unfortunately, not free. Currently, I\u0027m pushing my side hustle to cover the expenses, but the side hustle also takes much of my time which I would rather love spending by making more videos. So, to come the the basics, we need some human-fuel. What\u0027s human fuel in 21st century? Stash! I mean, Moolah! Sorry, money.\u00a0(Listening to a lot of rap music lately) That\u0027s where Patreon jumps in. It allows you to pay whatever you want monthly to help support us (ahem, me) with our vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMay I suggest that we (and by \u201cwe\u201d I mean \u201cyou\u201d) take a quick test to see if it is worth for\u00a0you to become a Patreon? Here we go, these questions might help you roll the Moolah!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo you have $1?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre you willing to spend it for something which is already free?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo you have a little Mother Teresa inside of you?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow many fingers am I holding up?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid you read question #1?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you answered \u201cYes\u201d to any or all of these questions, including #4, then you are absolutely, without a doubt, the ideal candidate to become a Patreon! Thanks for bearing all the stream of consciousness.\u003cbr\u003e"
