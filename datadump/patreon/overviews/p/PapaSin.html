Let\u0027s begin with some proper introductions, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Diego, and I\u0027m from Venezuela; nowadays I go by the handle of \"PapaSin\" (might change in the future). I\u0027m just your average internet user who has opinions about video games, movies, anime, and other things that you might be interested in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to create videos and produce quality content but I currently do not have the resources to make them, but perhaps with your help and your much-appreciated patronage that can change. Along with other more important things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason why I\u0027m opening this Patreon\u2014aside from wanting to become an e-celeb that writes and talks about stuff that I care about, is that due to the fact that I\u00b4m a Venezuelan citizen, its near-impossible to start on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the current economic crisis that our country is going through I can barely cover my daily expenditures, let alone be able to afford the software and hardware required to produce videos and other forms of content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really wish to be able to escape this country with my mother so that we can both have a better life and a future. If you deem me worthy of your appreciated patronage I would be immensely thankful that you\u0027ve helped make this dream a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHell, what else can I put here, well, I\u0027m blonde\u2014not full on yellow blonde I\u0027m more of a gold blonde I guess\u2026.think of Link from The Legend Of Zelda, that should give you a pretty good idea. And I\u0027m tall-ish and cool, I mean I will probably become your friend if we talk about cool stuff. I\u0027m also nice and a loser most of the time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like JRPGs but I loathe turn-based combat games\u2026.yeah, I know. I like any game with a story, and if it\u0027s a fantasy-themed game even better, I like fantasy more than sci-fi, with a preference for the former.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not a professional game reviewer, nor I am a game journalist (thankfully). I\u0027m just an opinionated guy looking to share his thoughts and views on stuff whilst getting a lil\u0027 tip on the side so that I don\u0027t starve to death; in that sense, my \"reviews\" will be some sort of brief dissertations and views on a specific subject at hand\u2014perhaps that\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided it name them that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, without further ado, let\u0027s start this story, filled with bumps of happiness, sadness but above all things\u2014hope. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eEpisode I:\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eA New e-celeb\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCAOS! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA, The GALACTIC SOCIALIST EMPIRE rules supreme. With worker-president NICOLAS MADURO in charge as their elected leader. His rule is one that gives crime lords equal power to that of the government itself. Venezuela is now a place where hunger and sadness are the status quo, young Venezuelans who still have access to the internet have banded together in what has been known to be as THE VENEBROS ALLIANCE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the alliance, there are a few people who hold the rank of what is known as E-CELEBS Members of an ancient order who were all about sharing their experiences, niche opinions about video games or just jokes in general. Unfortunately, this order has fallen into decay due to greed and shameless profit, there is only a few of them who still follow the old ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe VENEBROS, inspired by these people who still believe in what it used to be an e-celeb have decided to follow on their footsteps and try to become like them in the hopes of earning peoples patronage and survive the Empire\u0027s attack on the Venezuelan economy. The path to becoming an e-celeb is long and arduous, and not many of the alliance members take it, only the most desperate of them have what it takes to walk the path of e-celebness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the story of an alliance member who has decided to take a journey towards the e-celeb zenith. Will he be crushed by the amount of pressure and creativity that is needed to make new content each week online? Or will he rise to become a well-known content creator that one day is able to escape from his country? The answer is up to him and you dear reader\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eGoals\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, to leave this country. Venezuela grows more dangerous and poor country. Education is going to shit because teachers aren\u2019t getting paid well enough. And the social tension is way higher than what it was before, before being last year. I swear it\u2019s almost tangible now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, entertain you. I\u2019ve always liked that niche world of the e-celebs, talking about animes, playing games, etc etc. I really wanted to become part of that world, but I don\u0027t have the means right now to make videos, so articles and opinions on Twitter shall be enough for now. Until I get a more decent equipment to make videos that is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Venebros\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have to thank my fellow Venebros who have done this for a time now and have helped me understand how all of this works.
