And allowing us to upgrade equipment in the future, such as getting Callum a new microphone since he literally snapped his headset a few weeks ago *stares at Cal judgingly*.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(You can check out the video on this page to get some more in-depth details on why we\u2019ve set this page up and how your support is going to help us grow the podcast.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have 2 tiers (for now), simple stuff really. The first is \"Fan\", which is if you just want to chip in really and you\u0027ll get some behind-the-scenes patron posts if and when we post (no promises aha!). And the second is \"Super Fan\", which is if you want to chip in, but have also wanted to ask a question for us to answer or wanted us to talk about a certain topic on the Podcast. Getting access to the Podcast Discord will allow you to do just that!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that\u2019s this ramble over, I want to say that the support on the Podcasts so far over the last 2 years has been amazing and all three of us thank you for that. And if you do decide to pledge to us on here, then we literally can\u2019t thank you enough and we\u2019re so \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blessed\"\u003e#blessed\u003c/a\u003e to have you supporting us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\n\nAarav!"
