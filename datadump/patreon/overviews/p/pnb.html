    "summary": "For over seven years now, PNB has been an on again off again podcast by a group of friends. Now, we\u0027re getting dangerous. Trav, Dylan, and newcomer Robert ready their mics to branch out into topic-based podcasts with Grind Forever, Level Select, and the soon-to-be-unlocked Fullmetal Optimists. With your help, you can facilitate meaningful and consistent podcasting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot Familiar with the shows? Check them out! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePNB \u003c/strong\u003e- The anchor of the PNB Network. Hosts Trav, Dylan, and Kayla casually divulge the details of their lives that cause them pain or joy and partake in discussions about current (mostly nerdy) events. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrind Forever\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 RPGs (Role Playing Games) can be damn great for being long, repetitive. Good thing talking about them don\u2019t have to be either of those.

We\u2019ll audibly encapsulate why certain levels best represent the game (Don\u2019t forget your Iron Boots at the door, Water Temple), complete with sound clips from the level and developer commentary (if available) about the level/game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the shows, $3 a month is all we ask to fund our ambition. In return, you\u0027ll get quite a few goodies to lessen those working stiff blues. We\u0027ll have a debate episode/bonus\u00a0episode of Level Select where hosts bicker over which of the many levels in iconic games should be enshrined in as the defacto best in the main episodes. In addition, we\u0027ll have an extra crunchy PNB episode each month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf generous, compassionate, and dead sexy describes you, you\u0027ll want in on Ultra Coach Super + EX reward tier. If you know in your heart Frogger: The Great Quest has a great level in it, bring a mic and sit down with us. Think we\u2019re wrong? Want listeners to gaze upon your greatness? Be an executive producer of the PNB Network and sway your weight around by challenging our selection of levels with your own. \u003cbr\u003e"
