I intently\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLISTEN \u003c/strong\u003eto your ideas, struggles,\u00a0feelings, pain, moments of crisis, and dreams. You don\u0027t need to keep your thoughts and emotions bottled up - \u003cstrong\u003eI AM HERE\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eREADY\u003c/strong\u003e to support you along your journey.\u00a0 Let\u0027s get the magic started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have only a few slots available \u003cstrong\u003eBUT\u003c/strong\u003e I will prioritize for anyone facing a moment of panic or crisis.\u00a0Life can be a challenge sometimes. It\u0027s good to have someone that \u003cstrong\u003eYOU CAN OPEN UP TO\u003c/strong\u003e, in \u003cstrong\u003eYOUR \u003c/strong\u003ecorner and respond in a manner that meets the experience you\u0027re facing: I\u0027m\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eHERE \u003c/strong\u003eto help get you back on track and feeling that inner calm, peace and love. For some, you may choose to reach me via email while others prefer skype or facetime, those options are available. Depending on the tier you select we will conclude the session with a meditation. This is where I\u0027m guided to offer words of love and support just for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who join early you become members of the circle of love, and that allows you to \u003cstrong\u003eRECEIVE PRIORITY SCHEDULING\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to ensure that I\u0027m available when you need me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDISCLAIMER\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our sacred time together and I take it \u003cstrong\u003eVERY\u003c/strong\u003e seriously, so there are restrictions I must disclose such as if the listening session becomes too uncomfortable due to a graphic subject that involves harm to others or a topic I deem so extreme that I feel uncomfortable the session will be disconnected and donation is retained. These are very rare cases as I pass no judgement nor offer any \"advice\" rather ideas, tools, and suggestions to bring clarity when our thoughts are clouded with confusion and noise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT OUR MEDITATIONS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePositive Magazine meditations are designed to \u003cstrong\u003emake life easier for YOU\u003c/strong\u003e by connecting tranquil guided meditations with you every step of the way forward; even if that means sitting still. We have been featured in Elle Magazine, Bustle.com, Youtube and hundreds of sites, blogs and media channels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve helped people become happier with who they are, assist them with anxiety, stress, depression, grief / loss, suicide, difficulty sleeping, self love and equally importantly understand that their happiness is the key to unlocking every door before them. \u003cstrong\u003eI TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027d like to continue to help you become more comfortable, stronger, braver and centered with the true person you are and why you are here. You define all that you are and all that you want. Together we work on a clear definition that always flexible and evolving.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that along this journey we are constantly driven by other\u0027s demands of us and it\u0027s OK to stop for a while. That \u003cstrong\u003ethe world will not come to an end because you are taking time for yourself. \u003c/strong\u003eWe need time to care for us, and sometimes we are so steered by others we don\u0027t know where to begin and how to start. \u003cstrong\u003eYOU ARE NOT ALONE. \u003c/strong\u003eThose around you include\u00a0\u00a0artists, caregiver\u0027s, parents, engineers, publishers, entrepreneurs, teachers, students, seasoned professionals, health care professionals, filmmakers, a blacksmith and YOU. These meditations are applicable to anyone who is willing to truly hear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what other\u0027s have said:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You have saved my life\" - Jeff (via youtube)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Words cannot express the gratitude I have for what you do. Your words have been with me during the darkest of times. Thank you.\" Steve (via youtube)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Thank you a million times.
