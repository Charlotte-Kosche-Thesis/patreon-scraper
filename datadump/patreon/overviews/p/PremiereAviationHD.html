The main hurdle to cross when trying to do location shoots is crew transportation costs. With your help, we can bring our crew to YOUR home airport and shoot content that until now has just been a dream. New aircraft, new locations! \u00a0At this goal level, we can film at least one episode per month a different location and put more viewers in on the action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jason.shareaviation.com/staggerwing.jpg\" style=\"width: 179px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

Imagine fully-produced 45 minute episodes featuring the restoration process and build-out of the a vintage Beech 18. This is the rescue project that we\u0027ve officially dubbed \"Share Force One\"! Not only are we rescuing a piece of aviation history, but we\u0027re doing it together. At this funding level, we can finish the project in relatively short order and rescue her from destruction once and for all. Once finished, Patrons will have first access to stick time in the old gal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://jason.shareaviation.com/sf1.jpg\" style=\"width: 179px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
