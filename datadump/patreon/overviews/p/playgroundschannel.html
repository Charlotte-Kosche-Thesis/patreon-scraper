It is\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0a free source of information\u003c/strong\u003e that wasn\u0027t available before in that field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most skills, acting is something that you need to \u003cstrong\u003epractice\u003c/strong\u003e, and learning online is not enough. However, with the limited finances that artists often have, it seems very useful and only fair to first be able to know what the techniques are, which ones are the most useful for each of us right now, and how we can go about setting up free practices, finding work or creating our own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to \u003cstrong\u003emake the work much simpler, \u003c/strong\u003eclarify what the different techniques and approaches really are, where they come from, and how we can use them. We want to work at our craft fully, regularly, to \u003cstrong\u003ereach the organic freedom that is the mark of a true artist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are taking seriously what many people wrongly consider like something that cannot be learnt, or doesn\u0027t need to be worked on. \u003cstrong\u003eWe want to :\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eexplore\u00a0the depth of subtleties of this art, review books about techniques and tools, interview acting coaches and successful actors, create compelling video-essays about the basic notions actors struggle with, publish online courses and workshops, give you exercises that you can practice at home, alone or with a group of people...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe would like to\u003cstrong\u003e thank you so much already for your support and your interest in what we\u2019re doing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy \u003cstrong\u003ewatching our videos and following us\u003c/strong\u003e (on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/playgroundschannel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playgroundschannel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Youtube\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/playgroundschannel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e) you already motivate and inspire us to create more for you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy \u003cstrong\u003esharing our content and engaging\u003c/strong\u003e with our videos and posts, you\u2019re helping us raise awareness. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy \u003cstrong\u003ecommenting and participating\u003c/strong\u003e in this exploration you give us a genuine and diverse feedback on what we\u2019re doing and suggestions on what we can next explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can now \u003cstrong\u003esupport us here on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e, even for a very small and symbolic amount, you help us produce content much faster and much more easily, which gives us time to explore things more in depth and get higher quality content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s only for people who can and want to help us, we don\u0027t want anyone to stretch their budget if they can\u0027t afford it. \u003cstrong\u003ePlayGrounds Channel will always be free on Youtube\u003c/strong\u003e, and the main ideas, principles and pieces of information will be accessible to everyone. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Patrons will receive rewards and additional content\u003c/strong\u003e here in the feed, like other tips or longer videos when we only choose to publish shorter and denser content on Youtube, behind the scenes footages and things we\u0027re experimenting on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eTalent is as common as horseshit in a stable.

Let someone explain to me why the violinist who plays in an orchestra on the 1Oth violin must daily perform hour long exercises or lose his power to play? Why does the dancer work daily over every muscle in his body? Why do the painter, the sculptor, the writer practice their art each day and count that day lost when they do not work? And why may the dramatic artist do nothing, spend his day in coffeehouses and hope for the gift of (inspiration) in the evening?\u003c/em\u003e\"\u00a0Konstantin Stanislavsky\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eI think you should be serious about what you do because this is it.
