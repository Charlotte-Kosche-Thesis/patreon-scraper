    "summary": "Thanks for stopping by! If you\u0027re here, I am guessing that you\u0027ve found my videos to be of value to you in some way. And if you\u0027re here, you\u0027re probably also considering supporting my work so I can keep going and making it better, and for that, I thank you. Here\u0027s a little more info on who I am and what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I make cooking videos on YouTube, and my goal is to make them educational as well as fun to watch. I believe in teaching people not just the recipes, but also a deeper understanding of cooking principles so that on top of learning new dishes, you also become a better cook. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born and raised in Thailand, and I currently live in Vancouver, Canada. I used to work in the restaurant industry as a chef, but I discovered that what actually gave me most fulfilment was the ability to inspire and enable others to experience the joy of cooking. So I started my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/pailinskitchen\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e which currently has 2 shows:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hot-thai-kitchen.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHot Thai Kitchen\u003c/a\u003e, my main show which aims to demystify Thai cuisine, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paiskitchen.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePai\u0027s Kitchen\u003c/a\u003e, my second show where I share recipes from around the world. I post 1 Hot Thai Kitchen video per week, and I post Pai\u0027s Kitchen episodes whenever I have the time, about 1-2 times a month. Frequency will hopefully increase as the support on Patreon grows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe team: \u003c/strong\u003eThe \"team\" is very small! Many of you know Adam who is a long-time friend and my cameraman. He also helps tackle website issues, and is there for general support. I also use Adam\u0027s kitchen to film\u2014he doesn\u0027t cook so the kitchen is pretty empty, lucky me!\u00a0My big brother Art is my \"videography advisor\", and he is usually the cameraman for videos filmed in Thailand :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for me, I do everything else! Test recipes, test them again, and sometimes again and again, to make sure they work and are delicious. I direct the shoot, take the photos, edit the videos, make the website posts, and post on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy promise to my supporters: \u003c/strong\u003eThe \"rewards\" I offer on Patreon is my way to concretely thank you for your kind support. But in addition to that, I can promise you one thing: I will never put out recipes I don\u0027t genuinely think are delicious and worth making. There are many recipes that have been tested but never made it to a video because I don\u0027t think they\u0027re up to my standard. I would never put out a video just to \"fill the week\" or just because it has been requested. I would never put up a recipe I wouldn\u0027t make for my own guests when they come over. Everything I post, including my non-cooking videos, I post because I think it will be of value to you in some way. That is my promise to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinally, thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e Seriously, THANK YOU. On behalf of all content creators who work hard to put their work out there for the world to consume at no charge, people like you mean a lot to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some videos that give you an insight into my work process :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe HTK \"Process\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1wM5RJyiy8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive Tour of the Set!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxUnlTdXv9c\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
