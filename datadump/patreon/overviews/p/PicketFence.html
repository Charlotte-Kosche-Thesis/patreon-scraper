     "about": "Jay Webb, a veteran MC from Dayton, has been involved in Hip\nHop Culture for over 30 years. In the early 80\u0027s he started b-boying (break\ndancing). Later in the 80\u0027s he started doing small tags (graffiti) on abandoned\nbuildings around the city. Along with tagging he found a passion for MC\u0027ing and\nDj\u0027ing. \u003cbr\u003e\nJoining his first rap group at age 12 J.A.M. with lifelong\nFriends Andre Taylor and Marcus McGhee which led the MC to fall deeper in love\nwith hip hop culture. The three once auditioned to be the opening act for the\nfirst rap group to successfully make it out of Dayton; \u201cDoc Ease and The Ease\nTown Posse.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\nIn his teenage years along with his new partner in rhyme;\nPoncho, he joined his Cousin Andrew Smittie\u2019s crew; \u201cTop Choice Posse\u201d. The\ncrew performed in various venues all over the city. After High School, Jay\nStarted working for a Management Corporation called Midwest Management where he\nwas V.P. of Film and Video. Jay was given the name \u201cPicket Fence\u201d by one of the\ngroups on the roster named the \u201cLumber Jacks\u201d. They chose the name because they\nfelt that Jay always had their front just like a picket fence. \u003cbr\u003e\nIt was just a year later when Picket Fence along with high\nschool Class mates Bryant Bonds and Dana Collins formed the Gem City\u2019s legendary\nrap group Eternal Legacy. The group opened up for major recording artists\nOutcast. The group disbanded in late 1995 when band mate Bryant Bonds moved\naway to pursue his education. In 1996, Picket moved to the motor city (Detroit,\nMi.) to work on a solo career with the producers of the Lumber Jacks; BackDoor Productions.\nAlong with Backdoor productions Picket Fence released two compilation albums \u003cem\u003e\u201cSo Tight I\u0027m Sweating\u201d \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e \u201cWhat\u0027s this Guy\u2019s Problem?\u201d.\u003c/em\u003e Picket\nwould go on to release 1l full albums and 3EPs with a member of the Lumber\nJacks\u2019 production team ; Stepheno Austin.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2010, the production team of Dayton\u2019s Trunk Bound Regime\nreached out to an inactive Picket Fence about coming together to revive the\ndead Dayton Hip Hop scene in Dayton. Trunk Bound Regime had been trying to\ncontact some of the Dayton Hip Hop legends including the members of TOOMB and\nanother crew Picket Fence had once been\napart of; \u201cCosmic Souls\u201d. Picket Fence\nand the members of TBR Lodge hit it off instantly. However,because it had been such\na long time since he released any music, Picket was unsure if he still had the\ninterest in making music due to the direction Hip Hop was going in. \u003cbr\u003e\nPicket offered to help out in any way he could to make a change\nin the Dayton Hip Hop scene. Picket decided to join Trunk Bound Regime and Seth\nRock in throwing charity events called \u2018The Gem City Get Down\u2019 to give back to\nthe community. It wasn\u2019t long before Picket decided it was time to record again\nin 2012, he reached out to longtime friend and producer Stepheno and the\ncreated an Ep entitled \u201cNo Hankin\u201d which was recorded at the Trunk Bound\nstudio. \u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2015 Picket released\nhis masterpiece produced entirely by Trunk Bound Regime with the exception of\none song which was produced by a South African producer named Blue Buttonz. Due\nto sophisticated technology and studio equipment, hip hop in the city of Dayton\nhas gone global with this latest release from Picket\nFence; \u201cGUTS A Practice in Space Conscious Theory\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the spring equinox of 2017 picket is slated to release\nnew material with another TBR lodge colleague Cudda Mack. This will be a two\npart series Entitled \u201cFlight from Chicago\u201d part One and Two. This will be\nanother high flying adventure into Afrofutrism. So buckle up!\u003c/p\u003e",
