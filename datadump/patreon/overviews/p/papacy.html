When I decided to develop the History of the Papacy Podcast, my goal was to make Church history accessible for people who were interested in all aspects of Church history. What I was really trying to do is make a show for me. A person who is interested in Church history and wants to see how all the events of the Church fit in with the larger story of history. That is why I enjoy making this podcast, because I\u0027m not alone. There are so many people out there who enjoy Church history as well and want to go on an adventure to learn more!"
