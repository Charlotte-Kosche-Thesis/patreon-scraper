    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://peterandcompany.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Company\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a comic I have been writing since 2005, tells the story of Peter, his invisible Guardian friend Seth, his friend Iggy (who also has a Guardian), and many others who are all a part of his childhood life. Most prominent of which is Whitney, a young purple cat with whom Peter immediately falls in love -- and struggles multiple times over to confess to her how he really feels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Whitney \u003c/em\u003eis a new sequel comic series, launching in Spring 2016. Beginning years after the events of \u003cem\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Company, \u003c/em\u003ePeter and his friends are now all graduating high school. The Guardians are gone, their memories faded completely from the minds of Peter and Iggy, as is what happens to all children who finally grow to no longer need them. Peter is faced with leaving for art school alone, leaving his friends and family back home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Whitney\u003c/em\u003e tells the story of how these two childhood friends manage to once again find each other through serendipitous circumstances. Much like how \u003cem\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Company\u003c/em\u003e is often based on real-life events from my own childhood, \u003cem\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Whitney\u003c/em\u003e will be an adaptation of the story of how I met my real-life wife Whitney. Since the characters are now grown up, the content rating of the comic will be PG-13/R-rated, since that\u0027s pretty much how college and real life works once you get older, y\u0027know? People tend to curse, adult situations tend to happen, and yes, there will be fanservice-y/pinup moments sprinkled throughout the series. It\u0027s the story of two individuals falling in love, after all, and expressing that love is a pretty important part of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe comic will launch soon, exclusively on the Katbox. A link to the site will be added here once the ribbon has been cut! Until then, this Patreon campaign will feature all preliminary work on the comic and \u003cem\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Whitney\u003c/em\u003e-related material, listed below.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to this Patreon campaign will not only support both comic series (P\u0026amp;C and P\u0026amp;W), but will also earn you a number of awesome rewards and bonus content!
