Also sometimes some truly terrible puns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a little bit like Kickstarter, but instead of a one-off crowdfund for one big project, many people pledge smaller recurring amounts. It\u0027s kind of like a subscription - in exchange for various exclusive perks, patrons give creators a consistent and somewhat predictable income. This makes a \u003cem\u003ehuge\u003c/em\u003e difference for an artist. And it\u0027s nice, because you can pledge as little as $1, and it can mean the difference between comics and no comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work here for \u003cem\u003ePoly in Pictures\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Patreon pages have you pledge per month, but my \u003cem\u003ePiP\u003c/em\u003e Patreon page here is a Per Thing set-up. You can choose how much to pledge per comic, and you can also choose a monthly maximum. For example, \"I\u0027ll give $1 per comic, up to $3 per month.\" (That means you don\u0027t have to pay anything if I have a rough month and can\u0027t make any comics.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your pledge you get perks (like behind the scenes photos, the CSP file of the comic, etc.), and you help us to reach overall goals. For example, when we hit $5 per comic I was able to remove the ads from \u003cem\u003ePoly in Pictures\u003c/em\u003e. I really hated having to distract people and use up their attention just to keep the comic online, so that was a big deal for me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I got here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2014 was a real low point in my life. Poverty, housing issues, mental health crisis, it was awful. I made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.polyinpictures.com/archive/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e6 comics\u003c/a\u003e, in the whole year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 I found Patreon. 18 comics! Things were still tough, because it takes a long time to recover from the horrific low that was 2014. But the support of patrons helped so much - the money was a very good incentive, but the knowledge that people were willing to put hard-earned cash down to keep \u003cem\u003ePoly in Pictures\u003c/em\u003e going was just incredible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far, I really appreciate it. Please feel free to keep reading and take a look at the pledge rewards - and let me know if you think there\u0027s anything I\u0027ve missed that would tempt you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd a big thank you to my patrons. I don\u0027t think \u003cem\u003ePoly in Pictures\u003c/em\u003e would still be here without you.\u00a0I don\u0027t have to knit handwarmers for \u00a31.50 per hour to pay for hosting any more, which means more energy and creativity for \u003cem\u003ethe actual comics! \u003c/em\u003eAnd your support means so much to me."
