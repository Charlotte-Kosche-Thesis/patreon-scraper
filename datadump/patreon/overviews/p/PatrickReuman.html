    "summary": "First off, before anything else, I would like to thank anyone that made it here, whether you join the family or not, for being a reader and giving us writers someone to tell our stories to. Without you, we are nothing, and I appreciate your contribution to the writing world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was just a young lad when writing first tore its way into my heart. It started with an English assignment in 10th grade, a simple request by the teacher for her students to write a one-page story about something that we were afraid of as a child, and it dawned into a 25-page novella that earned me a 100% and my story hung on the board. The euphoria that I experienced as I laid those words onto the pages was like nothing I had ever experienced before and I knew right then that creating horror was something that I wanted to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt that point, I didn\u0027t know what I was going to do with this new-found yearning, I just wanted to create. I never even considered that people would read these stories let alone want more. So, I wrote some short stories, and more short stories, then a novella, all of which I kept to myself for years. Then, one day when I was just sitting around watching TV, the idea for a potential novel came barreling into my head. I had to write it down. I kept adding to this timeline before standing back, taking a look, and realizing that this could actually be a full-length novel. Finally, I finished the timeline, it was rough, but it was there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the book, made it maybe halfway through, and stopped. I was stuck. I wasn\u0027t sure where it went, but my ability to turn the timeline into words just seemed to vanish. About six months went by before I was standing around at work, and out of nowhere, ideas for where to go with the book began pouring into my head. I went home that day, started writing, and in a month had the rest of the book completed. That book was SADISTIC. Was it perfect? No. But, what it was, was a completed book. I was where I never expected to be. I was an author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast-forward a few months, hours of editing, a great cover, and lots of frustration, and the book was finally ready to be read by the world. But, would anybody read it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey did. SADISTIC reached approximately #2,700 in Amazon books out of millions. It was at #1 in Hot New Releases in almost all of its categories and I was floored. I began getting messages from people about my book and how much they enjoyed it and it was like the world had just started spinning. Was this really happening? I was counting down the seconds until I woke up and was back to reality, but that time never came.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put out another book, this time a collection of horror stories titled \"The Edge of Madness\" which received similar reviews to Sadistic. I had been working on this collection while I was writing Sadistic and it was paying off, momentum was rolling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, came SIN, my first novella, and here I am just over one year later writing this bio in hopes that you, the reader, will help me continue this pursuit of my dreams. They are quick, and not looking like they\u0027re slowing down anytime soon, but I am hot on their trail and ready to chase them until my heart stops beating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming here and thank you for supporting me. Welcome to my family. Welcome to my future. And, welcome to my writing.\u003cbr\u003e"
