    "summary": "Troubadours are traveling musicians who sing of courtly love. They remind people that love and beauty must fight for their places as the most important things in the world. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories and art, when true and right, are the forces that give men and women strength beyond their imaginations. They free people from the bonds that imprison them. Without stories and art, we are destroyed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Pat Green and I\u0027m a troubadour. My lyre is my camera and my song is my writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, I wrote \u201cNight Moves: An Ex Preacher\u0027s Journey to Hell in a Taxi.\u201d I wrote of the lessons I should have known as a pastor but finally learned when I drove a taxi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI continue to write of those lessons on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://patheos.com/blogs/transparentexpedition\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatheos\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.aquarius-atlanta.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAquarius Magazine\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Flower Of life Gallery, Art Bar, RAW Natural Born Artist Community and libraries and countries around the world have featured my art. I participate in vibrant art communities and my sales have given me the respect of the art community. I tell stories, the stories that give life and offer beauty, and sometimes make people think through my art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt meets a yearning and we create to meet a yearning. The 136,000,000 million homes in the US cry out for good art to grace the billions of square feet available. Businesses, hospitals and other public spaces raise that yearning for real art to display.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWords and art change hearts. It inspires us to create beauty and stand for equality. It soothes us in the midst of the storm. Art matters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy intense study of emotional intelligence convinces me that we need good, really good art, to surround us and speak to us and help us find the courage of our stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am building a brand of quality and passionate art that tells those stories that connect us together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut starving artists don\u2019t actually create much meaningful art. Too much energy is expended on empty stomachs and debilitating worries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking you to invest in me, invest in the time to create, the necessary marketing, equipment, hanging fees, and travel to shows across the country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour investment brings the business of art into the 21st century. We\u2019ll create a community to connect writers and artists to readers and collectors. Together, we can make that dream live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your partnership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
