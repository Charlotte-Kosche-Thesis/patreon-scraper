I\u0027m Ray, I\u0027m an illustrator, and I make DNA!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make other things, but mostly it\u0027s just DNA right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDNA is a sci-fi/mystery/action comic set in the not so distant future on a version of Earth with slightly more advanced genetic technology than this one. It\u0027s about some people who shouldn\u0027t exist, but do, and how they deal with that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDNA is\u00a0intended for people 16 years old and up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read the whole thing for free\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dnathewebcomic.com\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing for a while already, but DNA is the first story I\u0027ve ever written. I\u0027ve been toying with it and writing and rewriting it since I was a teenager, but as of 2015, I\u0027ve decided to start drawing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out, writing a comic is a lot different from actually drawing a comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also turns out, presenting a work to an audience is a lot different from presenting a work to someone who\u0027s already intimately familiar with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, it\u0027s been a learning experience, haha. It\u0027s a good thing I don\u0027t have a problem with trashing something and starting over. It\u0027s also a good thing the people who\u0027ve been reading it so far are patient, because I\u0027ve remade the entire thing once already, and am planning to remake chapter 1 in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m pretty passionate about what I\u0027m doing, and I hope you can see that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also hope you join me on this journey of both \"learning comics\" and \"making comics\" and that you enjoy the story that comes from it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and thank you for your support. I can\u0027t do this without you.\u003cbr\u003e"
