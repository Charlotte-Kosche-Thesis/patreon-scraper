Locking education away in the ivory tower alienates it from its mission in society. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur Program is dedicated to a simple concept: no one in society \nshould be deprived of access to ideas. This has led all of us, through \ndifferent paths, to seek opportunities to teach and learn outside the \nwalls of the academy, built to keep people out on the basis of their \nsocial standing and financial means. And it has ultimately led us to \nbring intellectual discussion inside the walls of the prison, a space \nthat too many people consider radically separate from society. We see \nsociety as a whole riddled with barriers and  locked doors and the prison\u2019s are just one more set that we hope to open.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe JCI Scholars Program\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eis a series of volunteer, non-credit, college-level courses being taught in \u003ca href=\"http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/locations/jci.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJessup Correctional Institution\u003c/a\u003e, a maximum-security men\u0027s prison in central Maryland (note: see our \u003ca href=\"http://www.prisonscholarsprogram.com/?p=362\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edisclaimer\u003c/a\u003e). Students in the program are incarcerated men, who must have a high school education (or equivalent) and write an essay about the importance of education to them to participate. Each semester, we have six to eight instructors providing classes to one hundred and twenty-seven students. You can find out more about the program at \u003ca href=\"http://www.prisonscholarsprogram.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEveryone in the program, incarcerated citizens and outside instructors, is a scholar, and we think of ourselves as on\n equal moral and intellectual footing. We strive to create course \ncontent as a collaboration between teachers and students, and to make \nclasses free-ranging discussions and workshops more than lectures.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile we hope that student partners who leave the prison will find \nwhat they have learned helpful in re-integrating into non-incarcerated \nlife, our program is not specifically focused on re-entry. Rather, we \nare convinced that intellectual discourse, critical engagement, and \nself-reflection are inherent parts of a flourishing human life inside or\n outside prison walls, and valuable for their own sake.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat This Campaign Will Fund\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, our entire operation is funded out of our own pockets, plus whatever small amounts of funding are available from our home institutions (only one of us receives regular support for this work from his University \"day job\" right now; and, we do not receive any financial support from the prison, though they do provide us with rooms and the support of their library staff). We \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e actively seeking more traditional grant funding for our work, but this campaign will help us continue doing what we are doing without asking too much of our instructors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe most fundamental thing that this campaign will do is help us defray the costs associated with running the classes themselves: buying books, making copies of readings, providing writing utensils and writing paper, and the like. This can easily run to the hundreds of dollars per class per \"semester,\" as we are buying books for 20-30 students in each class. Right now, unfortunately, we are sometimes making pedagogical decisions based on which books we can afford to buy! We\u0027d like to not have to worry about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are also a number of incidental expenses that our instructors incur to teach these classes, things like gas money, train tickets, and the like. Should we have enough money to cover our core expenses, we will move on to helping cover some of those as well. If we have a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of money, well, see our milestones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor more information on how we will run the finances of this campaign, see below under \u003cem\u003eQuestions and Answers\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat Patrons are Paying \u003cstrong\u003eto Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach week, we (collectively) teach four to six classes in the prison. You can see what is currently offered by checking out our \u003ca href=\"http://www.prisonscholarsprogram.com/?page_id=68\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecurrent classes page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause this is a pretty high volume, this campaign does not ask you to pay per class, but rather per month that we are running classes (if you really want to feel that you are paying \"per class,\" please back at our \"Carol Hanisch\" level, $20 per month, which works out to a little less than $1 per class session)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMostly, your support goes to us continuing to run these courses, which is something that you will not get to see directly.Our instructors will occasionally post a brief note about their classes\u003ca href=\"http://www.prisonscholarsprogram.com/?page_id=213\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e on our blog\u003c/a\u003e, so you can follow along with what we are doing. This may be the instructor\u0027s own reflections, or writing or art from students. We will, when available, also post other materials that may come out of classes, such as original research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBackers at higher levels will receive some other thank-you gifts and tokens of our appreciation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are Our Go\u003cstrong\u003eals?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the first place, we would like to make our current teaching model more or less sustainable for our instructors. Some of us are lucky enough to have standard academic positions, but we are doing this on top of our work at our home institutions. Others of us have contingent employment as adjuncts and the like, and we are doing this in lieu of taking additional paid work. It would ease the burden of either of those things to at least not have to pay to volunteer in addition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we put our current model on stable footing (through a combination of this campaign and other funding sources), we do have some interests in expanding. Here are some of our ideas for the future:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBetter support for instructors: This is both a logistical and financial goal. Right now, we have one person liaising with the prison authorities and administrators (things like ensuring that all entrance authorizations are up to date and our rooms are arranged). We would love to have the resources to hire someone on a stable basis part-time to do this. And we would love to be able to pay our instructors a wage in addition to costs, and support them in going to conferences to spread the word about our program.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMore teaching: Our instructors are certified to volunteer in any prison in Maryland, and we have discussed the possibility of providing classes at other facilities. Also, prisons are only one part of society that tends to be cut off from traditional modes of higher education. A couple of us have taught with the \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=1\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffreeschool.redemmas.org%2F\u0026amp;ei=Iv7TUpHmJ7WgsASkkYHoCw\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNH66byyEHlzsQJHR2Pq0w2c8w7dkg\u0026amp;sig2=7rqUheYRj30o1_XVPjJJoA\u0026amp;bvm=bv.59026428,d.cWc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBaltimore Free School\u003c/a\u003e in the past, for example, and we would like to explore the possibility of providing more classes to the general community, especially marginalized populations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMore research: The impacts of education on the quality of communities within prisons are poorly understood at this point. In keeping with our focus beyond re-entry and recidivism, we would like to conduct community-based participatory research in the prison to better understand how incarcerated individuals are currently engaged in their communities inside and outside the prison walls, and how we can better support positive engagement. We also hope to track our \"graduates\" once they leave the prison system.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe hope that this has made you at least half as excited about supporting us as we are about what we\u0027re doing! Please consider supporting us, even at $1/month. Or if you don\u0027t feel you can afford it, please spread the word!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQue\u003cstrong\u003estions and Answers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow exactly will funding from this campaign be disbursed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are now a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFunds from this campaign are a fund of \"last resort.\" That is, our instructors will try to cover costs out of other sources of funding before using money from Patreon - grants, faculty funds, negotiated gifts from publishers, and direct support from the students\u0027 family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen we receive funds, our first priority will be materials - books, pens, notebooks, and certificate paper, for instance. We will fund these as evenly as we can. Here\u0027s the basic plan:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n1. Each instructor who was teaching during a month for which we received funding will receive an equal share of the funding, after Patreon\u0027s cut and we make sure that we\u0027ve set aside what we need to cover taxes. A share will also go to covering the cost of maintaining the website, and we may put money toward group goals like (if we start bringing in enough) paying \u00a0a part-time coordinator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n2. If anyone hits a point where all their direct costs for their current course are covered, we\u0027ll just share amongs folks who haven\u0027t had costs covered until everyone is covered. Right now, we don\u0027t have any serious inequities in how much courses cost to run, but if someone proposes a very expensive class (e.g., one that requires lots of A/V materials), we would hold a vote of current instructors on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n3. If we have any money left over after all direct costs are covered, we\u0027ll divide it up among currently teaching instructors. This will let them cover any incidental expenses and, if our patrons are super-generous, maybe even put a little money in their pockets. So long as we have a student volunteer coordinator, she will also get a cut of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we hit certain milestones, we may arrange funding differently (e.g., if we are formally buying out an instructor\u0027s class from her university). If we reach that mark, we will announce it through our Patreon feed, and this part of the description will be updated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy don\u0027t students pay anything?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of our students cannot really afford to pay us anything like tuition. Some of them have jobs in the prison, but these typically pay very, very little (on average in state prisons, \u003ca href=\"http://www.prisonpolicy.org/prisonindex/prisonlabor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eless than a dollar a day\u003c/a\u003e; MD prisoners get a bit better deal, and \u003ca href=\"http://mce.md.gov/mce/PIE/tabid/185/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emust be paid at least the federal minimum wage, but face significant deductions for things like room and board and victim compensation funds\u003c/a\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPrior to 1994, most prison college programs were effectively supported by federal Pell grants to prisoners. However, \u003ca href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/when-congress-cut-pell-grants-for-prisoners/2013/12/03/fedcabb2-5b94-11e3-a49b-90a0e156254b_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe 1994 crime omnibus bill stripped prisoners of their eligibility for Pell grants\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy isn\u0027t the program credit-granting?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWe are currently in partnership with the University of Baltimore to offer credit for some of our courses in the Fall of 2016. However, this will be part of an experimental site waiver for the general Pell Grant ineligibility that will only impact a small group of our students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe larger part of the study body will continue to be eligible to attend volunteer courses without credit, and we hope to audit the for-credit courses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow do you decide what to teach?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSince our instructors are all volunteers, they teach more or less what they would like to teach, with informal input from our students. Starting this semester, we have been having a semesterly session in the prison where each instructor \"pitched\" his or her course, and students were allowed to list their preferences (actual assignments are made primarily on the basis of seniority in our program).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince most of us in the program right now are professionally trained as philosophers, we teach a lot of philosophy classes! But we are actively branching out, and have been able to offer courses in literature, psychology, economics, labor history, and games recently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow do you get teachers?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eMostly, networking by our current teachers. But we\u0027re always looking to bring new people into the fold.

Many people are in prison in the US for things they probably shouldn\u0027t be punished for - non-violent drug crimes, for instance. But the bulk of our students are imprisoned for committing violent crimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s no way to give a satisfying answer to this question in a F.A.Q. but it is an area of active reflection and even research for several of us!
