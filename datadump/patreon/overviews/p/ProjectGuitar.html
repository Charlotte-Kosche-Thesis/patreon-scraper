Over the years many hundreds of guitar builders of all levels of experience have pulled together collective knowledge and trade secrets to help beginning guitar builders approach their first projects safely and confidently, plus find inspiration to do something unique and personal.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tSimply, we want to continue doing this with all the dials turned to eleven; increasing the regularity and depth of our educational articles, publishing week-in week-out reviews and creating tutorials that break down mystical pro-level subjects to such a level that they\u0027re accessible to anybody and everybody.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.projectguitar.com/tutorials/instrument-building/trem-to-hardtail-conversion-r42/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u0027s a simple example of the kind of tutorials we publish\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eWe\u0027re rewriting and updating dozens of old articles, updating them with new photography and more detailed processes, with even more ideas on the boil for everything you need to know to go from zero-knowledge to confident (and safe!) guitar maker. From raw wood to the finished strung instrument. It\u0027s a huge subject, however with almost 14yrs of forum posts, how-to\u0027s and straight out guitar porn (we\u0027re worth the ticket just for that) we have more experience than anything else out there.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.projectguitar.com/patreon/pukko.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eby ProjectGuitar.com member \u003cem\u003epukko\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003evoted as guitar of the year 2014\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tOur high-value tutorials and site articles have always been - and always will be - freely accessible to anybody.

There\u0027s an important reason for that; we don\u0027t want any because you don\u0027t either. That\u0027s exactly what it\u0027s about and why we\u0027re funding exclusively via Patreon. Advertising and reliance on revenue from it have a fundamental effect on the qualitative standard of informative, journalistic or educational websites. Neutrality, integrity and loyalties are questionable once beholden to advertising money. We value our ability to publish objectively, impartially \u00a0and most importantly provide safe harbor for members to do the same without fear of losing revenue by offending a paying advertiser.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\u00a0makes us answerable only to you, our Patrons.\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly this means we have 100% creative freedom to concentrate on what we\u0027re best at; regular publication of information-rich tutorials, product reviews written with a real-world perspective, how-to articles you can actually use plus anything and everything in learning to make guitars. We don\u0027t have a product to sell, we\u0027re not working with commercial interests lighting a fire under us to say how great their stuff is, and we enjoy that you enjoy what we do.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tLike anything, this \"what-we-do\" costs us money, and for the most part that\u0027s always been cool; sharing projects and writing for the community is its own reward when it inspires others or helps people develop their skills; sometimes even going on to become professional luthiers. We want to start growing ProjectGuitar.com and do bigger better things, all under the same remit of being open and freely available. We\u0027re in our fourteenth year and bigger things are ahead....the things that nobody else is (or is able) to do! We hope you\u0027re onboard too.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t-------------------\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tIf \n\t\u003cstrong\u003e1 in 25\u003c/strong\u003e of our current monthly visitors threw a couple of bucks in the hat each month, we\u0027d be hitting\u00a0our top goals out of the park. The vast majority of our site traffic are guests just wanting to find information on building instruments.
