You can find samples of all my writings at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patrickwmarsh.com\"\u003ehomepage\u003c/a\u003e, where I write monthly short stories about monsters, weekly musings, and occasional serialized tales. My name is Patrick W. Marsh and I love monsters. They can be aliens, demons, devils, goblins, cyborgs, faceless phantoms, or that weird sewer thing from the X-Files, which has permanently made me afraid of portable toilets.I have written six books, been published in multiple literary magazines, and have been blogging on and off for ten years. I live solely on my writing (and plasma), a thought which both makes me feel free and terrified. I write a variety of books (with monsters), which include:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/\"\u003eBeware the Ills\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/\"\u003eDOL 39\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/\"\u003eSeven Monsters\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/\"\u003eI Sing Constellations\u003c/a\u003e, and the popular\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/the-greenland-diaries/\"\u003eGreenland Diaries\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, I write about a Northern Pike attacking children in a river. Sometimes, I write about a god-like monster trapped in space counting constellations. Sometimes, I write about giant centipedes stalking survivors near a post-apocalyptic McDonald\u0027s. I believe monsters are not only a good form of entertainment and adrenaline, but also a form of therapy as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal to keep writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/\"\u003eThe Greenland Diaries\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/\"\u003eBeware the Ills\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/novels/\"\u003eDOL 39\u003c/a\u003e, and all the other stories I\u0027ve been hoarding in my soul like a sleeping dragon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect people to contribute more to my nightmares than by simply reading them, but if you feel like supporting me further, all the resources you donate to me will go to domain fees, publication expenses, and to the existence of my four children. You will also in fact be contributing to the fear and the nightmares of others, which can be very satisfying. I am incredibly fortunate to have readers and fans like you to support me. People that can help me live my dream are pretty much the most amazing individuals ever. Thank you for your support.

     "about": "My name is Patrick W. Marsh and I\u0027m a fiction writer. When I was just a wee lad hanging out in the basement playing Super Nintendo and watching Star Wars, I realized I wanted to write short stories that took place in the fictional worlds I was enamored with. I realized that I could write about these fantastical places, and if I made it good enough, I would be able to strike at the emotional core of what it means to be human. I could use fantasy, science fiction, and horror to emotionally relate to people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, for about twenty years I was distracted from this dream for all the many reasons life can provide. Now, two decades later I\u0027m solely writing fiction for sustenance. This is all I do. I have published seven books, been published in multiple literary magazines, and I publish a free and awesome short story on my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patrickwmarshauthor.wordpress.com/\"\u003eWhat the Monster Said\u003c/a\u003e every week. I\u0027m married. I have four children. I spent 12 years at various colleges learning the craft. I love to write and tell stories, and it took me the better part of twenty years to learn how to mesh what I\u0027m good at and what I wanted to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping with Patreon that people can see the value in these stories like I do, and support me a little bit each month so I can continue to live this dream I have postponed so ardently. Thank you everyone for your support. I really couldn\u0027t do it without you. \u00a0",
