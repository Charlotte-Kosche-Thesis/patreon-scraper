We were pregnant with our second child and found out Adam had a tumor. We were told that the chances of him dying before the age of 40 were quite high. At the same time, our son had severe eczema and behavioral difficulties. The answers were to medicate our son, surgically remove Adam\u2019s tumor (and kidney) and cross our fingers that no one got sicker. This was not acceptable for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur research and studies have given us the tools to not just survive, but thrive. The power of proper nutrition and healthy lifestyle choices has cleared our son\u2019s eczema and behavioral issues, shrunken Adam\u2019s tumor and has us thriving so many years later. Not only that, this gift has given us the responsibility to help so many other people, like you, on their journey to health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to help you be the healthiest version of yourself.
