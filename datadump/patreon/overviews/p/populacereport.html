    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report (www.populacereport.com) (www.populacereport.ca) is a conservative news and opinion website.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Situation: We are Populace Report, we want to hold our politicians accountable. We started \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e in October of 2017 on the theory that most mainstream media was tilted to the left and more biased toward Liberals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e has had a great start and we\u0027ve developed an enthusiastic readership. In the last 2 months, \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e has had over 40K readers. We know two things now: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) We want \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e to go on for a long time. \u003c/strong\u003eThe beta test is over. It works. We have readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) We need to make \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e self-sustaining for this to work. \u003c/strong\u003eThe \"fund \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e with savings\" plan was fine for Phase 1, but it\u0027s not sustainable. Our savings are unimpressive. And the other company is trying to grow and needs every dollar it can to invest in itself. If \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e is going to go on for a long time, it has to be able to support itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about the long-term self-sustaining plan, we decided we want eventually don\u0027t want the website to have a lot of ads. Ads are annoying and hurt the user experience, and we can come up with a better way to do it. We have a method:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations. We\u0027ve received donations from generous readers ever since we put up a PayPal button in the Support \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e tab, but a lot of those donors, along with other readers, have suggested that Patreon is a better way for readers to support the site. So we\u0027re trying it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a reader can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1.99/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting. \u003c/strong\u003eWe need a robust enough hosting plan to support the highest spikes in traffic we ever get so we don\u0027t crash during those moments and ruin my happiness.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecurity.\u003c/strong\u003e The service we use to secure our site and our readers. This fee grows as the readers grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing web development.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s a website, so there are always upsetting glitches coming out of nowhere and occasionally, we add a new site feature. Neither of us has any programming skills, so we need to pay someone for this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003epost \"boosts\". \u003c/strong\u003eWhen we announce a new post on Facebook, this makes sure that the announcement gets onto 1/3 or 1/2 of our Facebook followers\u0027 News Feeds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFew employees. \u003c/strong\u003eWe need someone to handle things like translation or redistribution requests, spam comment deletion, customer service, editorials and a bunch of other little jobs. These things end up adding up to hours every day, and without this employee, the site lacks quality independent posts\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThat\u0027s the basics. With those pieces covered, \u003cstrong\u003ePopulace Report\u003c/strong\u003e can support itself.\u003c/strong\u003e"
