    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tI\u0027m Chris Deslauriers, the owner and\nprimary game designer of PickUpGroup Studios. At the start of 2017, I\nfounded PickUpGroup Studios (also affectionately known as PUG) to\nbring new worlds to life and hours of play to your kitchen tables and\nplatforms!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tThough it\u0027s just getting started,\nthere are several projects that I foresee to undertake with PUG, all\nto be completed within a few years, reliant on finding the talent and\nresources to bring these ideas to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tThe very first project to be released\nby PickUpGroup Studios is a new pen and paper Role-Playing Game system and setting. With a\nfocus on describing scenes and situations and a darker\nfantasy/steam-punk setting, this will be a refreshing and accessible\nsystem for both newcomers and old-hands at story-telling games. This project is currently in testing and undergoing some refinement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo accompany the game, there are plans to release several useful apps, visual aids and accessories to help play the game and to create a more hands-on experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nDid I Join Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027m the sole employee of PUG, the going has been slow. I\u0027ve turned to you, Patrons, for a few reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. To raise the capitol necessary to bring the games to market. Legal fees, suppliers, artists and editors are all key people in bringing entertainment to the highest level possible and they deserve to be paid!\u003cbr\u003e2. I\u0027d like to work on PickUpGroup Studios full-time. My priority is to invest in PUG first, but if there is enough so that I do not have to worry about a job then I can bring all these projects up faster!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\nI\u0027m just starting out, I plan on expanding the list of available\nrewards as more becomes available. Free books, free miniatures, free\nmaps and even official artwork printed in the books are all in the\nworks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNovice Level:\u003c/strong\u003e Your name gets placed into the book(s) as a Contributor\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e600$ a month:\u003c/strong\u003e When I reach 600$ a month, I\u0027ll start a monthly Discord session to chat, interact and discuss with Patrons directly"
