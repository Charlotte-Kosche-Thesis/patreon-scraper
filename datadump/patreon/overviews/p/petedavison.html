Nor is it a review site. And nor is it a site that attempts to be all things to all people. It is, quite simply, a site about enjoying, appreciating and celebrating games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is a site designed based on my philosophy that gaming sites serve their audience a whole lot better if they specialise and focus on a particular subject area rather than attempting to take a scattershot approach to covering what has become a sprawling, unimaginably broad business since its birth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou don\u0027t get opera specialists writing about the latest pop albums; you don\u0027t have cricket experts commenting on basketball. So why should people who don\u0027t know their stuff about -- or worse, have no interest in -- Japanese games and visual novels write about the distinctive work our friends in the East produce for us to enjoy?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJapanese games are under-explored and misrepresented by much of the commercial, mainstream press. Which provides an ideal opportunity for someone like me to explore them in depth and potentially introduce a whole new audience to them who may not have otherwise considered them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://moegamer.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/20170311124225_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eNe no Kami: The Two Princess Knights of Kyoto (Kuro Irodoru Yomiji/Sekai Project/Denpasoft)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Someone like you?\"\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve immersed myself in modern Japanese popular culture and interactive entertainment since I first discovered a strong passion for it nearly ten years ago. I\u0027ve taken the effort to research the culture that underpins many of these works, the social context in which they exist and the rich, fascinating history of gaming that has brought us many of today\u0027s titles. I know my stuff, in other words, and with each new article I research and write I am learning more and more new things, too!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMoeGamer is the next step in a journey I began with my weekly\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.usgamer.net/archive?tag=jpgamer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJPgamer\u003c/a\u003e column on USgamer. Since I launched the site three years ago it has developed from an occasional blog into a site with a tight, monthly focus on a specific game or series, and beyond into a continually expanding database and historical record of underappreciated, overlooked games both from Japan and inspired by Japanese work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://moegamer.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/nights-of-azure_20160415225254.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eNights of Azure (Gust/Koei Tecmo)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat doe MoeGamer offer that other sites don\u0027t?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eRather than an attempt to rush out coverage in time to meet an embargo, the core concept around which MoeGamer is designed is the idea of the \"Cover Game\". This is a game or series that I explore in great depth over the course of at least four articles in a month, covering all aspects of the experience. In the case of visual novels, I\u0027ll explore and analyse the various narrative paths and characters. In the case of more conventional games, I\u0027ll explore the historical context, mechanics, narrative and aesthetics of the game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPerhaps most importantly, a \"Cover Game\" isn\u0027t necessarily a current, high-profile game that has just been released. It might be a noteworthy game or visual novel from ten years ago. It might be a game that has received little to no press attention whatsoever. Or, uh, it might be Final Fantasy XV\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e(4)\u003c/span\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlongside this in-depth coverage, I also offer shorter \"one-shot\" and \"essentials\" articles that provide a briefer look at games from various genres and platforms, as well as commentary on gaming and Japanese popular culture at large.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://moegamer.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/20161024203602_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eSupipara (minori/MangaGamer)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI firmly believe that content creators should be paid for their work, but that pay should not be tied to a meaningless and easy to manipulate metric like \"number of clicks\". As such, MoeGamer is not designed with a clickbait model in mind, nor is it in any way ad-supported\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e(5)\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want people to be able to show their support for quality, in-depth writing about gaming -- particularly games that don\u0027t get explored in depth elsewhere -- and to show that there is a better way to do things than the rut mainstream commercial sites have got stuck in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs for why I need the money for this at all... well, as most of you reading this probably know, gaming can be an expensive hobby, particularly when you\u0027re dealing with niche-interest or rare titles. There\u0027s a limit to how much I can fund out of my own pocket, so any help you can offer will allow me to broaden my remit to a wider variety of games and hardware as well as improve the functionality of the website as a whole.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://moegamer.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/2016-06-15-160110.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eDungeon Travelers 2 (Aquaplus/Sting/Atlus)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAre you offering rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t want to gate any of MoeGamer\u0027s content behind a paywall, and since I\u0027m working on the site as a side project alongside a day job, there\u0027s only so much time I can devote to rewards above and beyond\u00a0what I\u0027m already doing each week. I\u0027d rather people support MoeGamer because they want to support my work rather than in order to get their hands on some sort of cool reward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said, I do want to offer at least a token something to say thank you to those who have shown their support. As such, anyone who donates at least $1 will get access to my Patron-only feed on here, which I\u0027ll update two or three times a week with more immediate, personal thoughts about what I\u0027m playing and the current state of gaming culture. And anyone who donates at least $5 will score themselves a monthly wallpaper featuring site mascots Midori, Yumi and Penelope.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are other rewards I\u0027d like to consider offering such as hardcopy magazines/books of each month\u0027s Cover Game articles, but those take time, effort and money to produce so I\u0027m not promising anything in that vein for now. If there\u0027s sufficient interest I\u0027ll definitely consider it though.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://moegamer.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/22-jun-2016-01-11-59-53.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eVA-11 HALL-A (Sukeban Games/Ysbryd Games)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnything to declare?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eMoeGamer is funded almost entirely out of my own pocket and through generous donations here on Patreon or via Ko-Fi.
