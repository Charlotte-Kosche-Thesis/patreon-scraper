    "summary": "I am just a guy trying to get through this thing called life as joyously as possible. Part of that process was recognizing that I wasn\u0027t going to do life perfectly. I think I\u0027m not alone in feeling that I\u0027ve held myself to the unattainable standard of perfection. What I\u0027ve come to realize is that my imperfections are a necessary component of my human experience. Those imperfections foster growth and within that growth I am more capable to help others. As a recovering alcoholic, the importance of service has been a pretty paramount. I have found, through my writing, a better way to process my experiences and through that, something to share with others in hopes that it helps them process their own experiences. I\u0027m starting this to help me in the process of pursuing my passion of writing and spreading a message of hope. If you happen to read anything you like, please feel free contribute to my growth. Thank you all in advance."
