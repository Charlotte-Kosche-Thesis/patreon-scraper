For the last 20 years I\u0027ve been writing, recording and touring as a songwriter and musician, but recently I\u0027ve felt drawn back to my first love: writing. I will be exploring where that takes me over the next few months, and I hope you\u0027ll join me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been interested in playing with different media; playing in bands gave me opportunities to experiment with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ4T67dLD59L2a1AwsXLreA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emusic videos\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.irritain.com/?page_id=254\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003estage plays\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/4761/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e and more, and I love that variety of experience. So while mostly I\u0027ll be focusing here on the written word, I hope to be able to share the breadth of stuff I do: my advice column (\"Ask Abbott\"), songs, videos, podcasts, games, recipes and more! I\u0027m trying out Patreon as a way to keep a running conversation with my audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I\u0027ve gone through creative cycles of hyper-prolific periods and then dry spells. This is probably true of most artists. During those dry spells, at least in the early years, I often wondered if it would ever happen to me again. At a certain point I realized that creativity was not something that \u003cem\u003ehappened\u003c/em\u003e to me, it was something I was \u003cem\u003edoing\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027ve worked intermittently as a journalist, and deadlines are a good motivator for me. That, and the knowledge that people are out there waiting to read/hear the next thing I do, help keep me up and at \u0027em even when I\u0027m being a moody artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also learning to engage with audiences. This part is a little trickier than simply being creative. I love performing, but I can be prickly and solitary at times, and I\u0027m an old-school pen and paper nerd who never really embraced technology the way I ought to. I want to get better at connecting with people, using all these wonderful tools at my disposal. This process will help me get into the habit of reaching out to people and maintaining connections. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you need my money for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the more ambitious writing projects I want to do will require intensive research; interviews, travel and other time-consuming activities. I\u0027ll need better audio and video equipment (and occasionally professional help) so that I can do higher-quality material. Certain projects will be more involved and require hiring visual artists or studio engineers. Some projects will have production costs (printing a written publication or a board game, et al).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on making my art self-sustaining, with the long-term goal of making it my full-time job. I think what I do is worthwhile. If enough people agree I can gradually make it my livelihood. I\u0027ve got lots of ideas burning holes in my notebooks, and lately I\u0027m thinking about short films, podcasts, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is new territory I\u0027m entering. It\u0027s scary and exhilarating and I hope you\u0027ll join me!\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003e-Dan\u003cbr\u003e"

There are dice involved, and usually snacks. It\u0027s fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternately, I will come to you to give a private musical performance twice a year. If you live outside the Bay Area, we\u0027ll have to sort out the best time for that. But yeah, also fun!\u003cbr\u003e",
