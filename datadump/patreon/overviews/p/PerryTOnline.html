I don\u2019t want corporate sponsors using my portal to harass my viewers and subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, as my platform grows I do see the opportunity to monetize my content, and that\u2019s where my vision here comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to set up a private person to person charity supported by my fans and followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been traveling around the world for years now, volunteering when and where I can, and I\u2019ve met a lot of really beautiful people who could use a little extra help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tBy choosing to support you\u2019ll be helping me with financial aid for the people I come into contact with and volunteer for while traveling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome examples of the type of volunteering I\u2019ve done in the past are things like teaching English to kids in Ecuador and Turkey, building houses in Peru and Morocco and helping local organic farmers in Spain and Canada. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution I would be able to buy those kids more school supplies, get more materials to help those families with their homes, and\u00a0\u003cbr\u003egive those farmers new tools to help with their crops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tI\u2019ll be posting here and on my website, Perrytonline.com, periodically with updates, pictures and plans for current and future projects so you can see what your proceeds are going towards. If at anytime you feel like your donation isn\u2019t going to good use, or to a cause you don\u2019t wish to support, feel free to cancel. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tAgain, any amount at any time is greatly appreciated. It\u2019s my hope that by paying it forward and taking a part in my journey, you get motivated and, maybe one day, even find it in yourself to get out in the world and travel, inspire and help other people with your own gifts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u2019t want to make a monthly donation you can go to my paypal page to make a one-time contribution here:\u00a0paypal.me/perrytonline\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU.
