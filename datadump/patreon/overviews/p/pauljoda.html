    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a way to show your support for creators like myself. It is a way to tell us that you love what we do and want to support us. It means so much to have support when you\u0027re providing what you create for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it helps me\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am currently working on my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. This is not cheap at all. On top of that I have to provide for my girlfriend and our dog. Rent is not cheap and neither is life. At the moment, I have had to do freelance work to keep the bills paid do to changes in my life I won\u0027t go into here. I am making it, but it is very difficult. I only mention this so you know that if my work on mods slows, it probably means I\u0027m using my extra time on other projects. By supporting me, I have more time to work on my mods as at least it provides some sort of income and can be valued against working paid. This does not mean I will stop modding, only that I can only mod once the bills are paid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I want you to know\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile the purpose of this site is to show support financially, I have never once expected nor asked anyone to support me unless they truly want to. I will continue to mod as long as I can, but any support along the way makes a huge difference in my life. To all those who have supported me, it means so much to know you do. Thank you\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will try to keep all information updated here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the left you can find things like my Twitter and YouTube channel. There I will keep content updated so you can see what I\u0027m doing. My Twitter is the best place to find new information as I am on it daily. My YouTube is a place for me to talk and demonstrate my mods to you the way I see them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Its been years since I came up with this mod and I want to bring it back using the knowledge I\u0027ve gained since that point. I have some cool ideas in mind and a few people who would also love to help to further the development. If this goal is reached, this mod will be brought back to life with a new core and fun mechanics. I\u0027ve learned alot about rendering so expect fancy effects and powerful tools.",
