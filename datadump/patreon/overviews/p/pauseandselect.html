    "summary": "Hi everybody! First off, I\u0027d like to thank you very much for taking the time to visit this page, and even if you don\u0027t donate, the fact that you took the time to take a look nevertheless means a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePause and Select is a kinda like a lot of other anime and manga channels out there; we\u0027re trying to make content we find interesting. However, given the means of production, an issue that oftentimes comes up in making these sorts of videos is failure. Books and articles purchased or acquired are both time and money sinks, and oftentimes there are moments where ideas just don\u0027t work. For that reason, videos can cost anywhere from 0-150 dollars in material, but we also have to factor in the sunk cost from failed projects. Holistically speaking, every video costs money. In addition to that, as projects change, so do the costs of things such as translations, paying for artists, paying for music, and paying for relevant services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor that reason, my hope is to bulwark some of the costs associated with producing these videos. The system isn\u0027t meant so much as a means of fully funding everything, but it\u0027s to mitigate costs associated with procuring materials. This Patreon is more akin to a grant rather than a means of full-time sustenance or a tip jar; the purpose isn\u0027t to establish a client-company relationship, but rather crowdfunded materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs ideas become more complex and ambitious, it is absolutely essential that I have some way to fund it, and given that Google Adsense is wildly unreliable (and oftentimes materials have considerable stipulations on how or whether I can monetize material - even factoring in Fair Dealings and exemptions), Patreon is really the only reliable method.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think people really need to spend that much money to back project creators, especially for projects with very low costs of entry such as anime videos, so for that reason I have a low tier amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003eWhy a monthly basis?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing a monthly basis because every video published eats up some amount of the pledge. It also allows me to focus on multiple video and projects without needing to feel pressured to release something. This is particularly important because these things take quite a bit of time to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA monthly basis is also important in the context of acquiring funds for content creation. Suppose\u00a0that a piece requires, say, 150\u00a0dollars of material, and my funding is at 50 dollars. To get the necessary funds I need, I would either have to release three (potentially low-quality) videos to\u00a0legitimize charging patrons. At that stage, patrons may feel justifiably angry at low quality work. The monthly donation is so patrons have a clear idea exactly how much of their contribution will occur every single month, but it also gives me considerable scheduling and planning space for future projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll excess money will then go into the community fund or gets put aside for future projects. None of this will go into my own pocket.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the community fund?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community fund is where money in excess of research material costs are put into a pot where other members of the general anime writing or editing community can access them. Giving out funds is determined by my patrons. Therefore, as a patron, you have a direct say in exactly where this money is going. It can range anywhere from helping others buy recording equipment to books to translation services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do retain the right to veto giving out any funds if I find that the person who will receive funds may not necessarily need it. This is not to reward people who already have a means of supporting themselves; this is a way to give back to the community and help those who need money to better their materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003eDiscord\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will be communicating mostly through Discord. The Discord channel is available to patrons only, and all financial statements and projects will be published in the Discord channel. The channel will be an accountability and well as communications tool, and if you are interested in getting in touch with me on numerous project and financial topics, I strongly recommend you do so in the official discord chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me via Twitter!\u003cbr\u003e"
