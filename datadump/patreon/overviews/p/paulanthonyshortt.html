    "summary": "UPDATE: So 2018 hasn\u0027t been as great a year as I\u0027d hoped. A whole host of unexpected expenses kept hitting us and things fell by the wayside. I am so sorry for not delivering on the promise of new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027ve now got a plan for adding content in the form of my promised videos discussing writing and narrative analysis. The standard videos will be published here for early access, before being uploaded to Youtube for general release. I\u0027ll start off simply enough, taking a given film, tv show, etc. and discussing some points about it. We\u0027ll see how things go from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to have the first video uploaded in a couple of weeks, so stay tuned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to become a full-time author. I write science fiction and fantasy, and I love a good underdog story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to say that I write \"rock and roll\"; exciting adventure stories where flawed heroes take on compelling and formidable villains. My tagline, that I write \"stories to show that monsters can be beaten\" really exemplifies why I think stories, regardless of their format, are important. When so much around us is negative, whether it\u0027s war, the economy, trying to make ends meet, or just seeing people suffer, I think it\u0027s important to remind ourselves that good people can make a difference, and if enough people take a little time to do something good for someone else, the world can become better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo-one should be treated differently because of the colour of the skin, their gender, sexual orientation, their faith, or their lack of faith. I try to carry this into my writing, and some of my favourite characters to write are those who break typical gender roles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to commit more time to writing, pursuing both traditional publishing and self-publishing, so the more funds I receive, the more books and bonus content I can release.\u003cbr\u003e"

Their first child, Conor William Henry Shortt, was born on July 11th, 2011.

Their fourth child, Olivia, was born in January, 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaul\u0027s work includes the Lady Raven Series and the Memory Wars Trilogy.
