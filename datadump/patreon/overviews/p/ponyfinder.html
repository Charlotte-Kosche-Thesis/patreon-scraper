    "summary": "Hello Everypony,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s me, David Silver, creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/125583/Ponyfinder--Campaign-Setting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePonyfinder\u003c/a\u003e RPG, the campaign setting for the Pathfinder Roleplaying System and 5th edition of that game with the dungeons and maybe a dragon. Patrons will receive previews of writing before anyone else and sneak peeks of art for the books. You\u0027ll also be supporting the creation of more Ponyfinder content over time, in addition to getting some interesting stories to read for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, those who become patrons get to participate in votes. Will the next story be about a pony druid or a griffon alchemist, or maybe a steelheart cleric? Will it take place in Viljatown or deep in the dwarven underhalls?I\u0027ll try to be consistent with this, with one chapter of at least 3000 words per week (possibly quicker).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn that vein, don\u0027t hesitate to call me out if you think I dropped the ball in a chapter. Think it reads awkwardly? Didn\u0027t like the way it went? Let me know. We grow by being challenged, and the result is better writing for everyone to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome stories will only be a single chapter, while others may go on for many, becoming novelettes or even full on novels if the creative blood keeps pumping and there\u0027s still more to tell. If I feel the need, I may put a story down and do a chapter of something else before coming back. I\u0027ll always keep you all in the loop though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome stories won\u0027t be stories at all. If you all vote on Ponyfinder supplements, then that\u0027s what I work on. Supplements are different beasts than stories, and will typically get done at a rate of about 1 per month, longer if you guys get crazy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading through all this, and I hope you choose to join me on this literary adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/eGcMbJo.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
