    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for coming to my Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e I hope you will feel able to support me, and enable to continue working to resource the church and Christian leaders and disciples through my blog \u003ca href=\"http://www.psephizo.com./\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.psephizo.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI believe my blog is a unique resource\u003c/strong\u003e. Unlike other bloggers, I do not repost material just to gain traffic, or put up short notices. Instead, I am to offer original comment and research in the areas of biblical studies, preaching, ethics, culture, politics and economics which will help readers to live more faithfully by the grace of God made known in Jesus, led by his Spirit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t carry ads or sponsorship, so if you become a patron it will allow me to cover my costs (of buying books, attending conferences) as well as remunerating me for the time I put into work on the blog. This can be as much as one or two days a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe minimum support \u003c/strong\u003eof $2 a month is about \u00a31.20. Since I post on average 12 times a month, that\u0027s around 10p per blog post. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t worry about the dollar signs! \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a site set up in the US, so everything is in dollars, but if you support me, you pay in your own currency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about me:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eOriginally from London, I studied pure maths at St John\u2019s College, Oxford and applied maths (Operational Research) at the University of Southampton before working in industrial business with Mars Confectionery in Slough in planning, manufacturing and personnel. I trained for ordination in the Church of England at St John\u2019s College, Nottingham, where I also did a PhD on metaphor in Paul Ricoeur and the Book of Revelation. I then lived for ten years in Poole, Dorset, working on the staff of \u003ca href=\"http://www.smlpoole.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSt Mary\u2019s, Longfleet\u003c/a\u003e during which I was also involved in diocesan education and a member of the General Synod of the Church of England. In 2004 I returned to St John\u2019s, Nottingham, to teach New Testament and Practical Theology and was Dean of Studies from 2005 to 2012.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the summer of 2011, I sensed a strong call of God to write more, and eventually left St John\u2019s in 2013 in order to write, research and speak in a freelance capacity. For information, check out my \u003ca href=\"http://www.psephizo.com/speaking/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSpeaking\u003c/a\u003e page on my blog, and to find out what others think about me go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.psephizo.com/commendation/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCommendations\u003c/a\u003e."
