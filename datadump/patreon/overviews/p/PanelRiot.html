    "summary": "Hello friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you love comic books? Sure, we all do! I love them so much, I started a show about them. That show is called Panel Riot. It\u0027s a weekly podcast hosted by yours truly, Will. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I? I\u0027m a Pittsburgher who has been appearing on and creating content for podcasts for over 10 years! I decided to focus my talents on one of my great loves, comic books. Panel Riot started in 2014 and has had many great guests since it\u0027s inception. We talk comics, games, movies and anything else related to the medium we love so dearly. But it\u0027s not just a fan cast, I\u0027ve also interviewed creators and artists who are making their unique marks on the industry. It\u0027s been a blast, but I feel that Panel Riot can be so much more. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, just by listening to the show you are making a huge impact. Thank you a million times over for that. And good news, that part is FREE! Well done, you. Production of Panel Riot, however, is not so much free. Aside from the time and energy put in by myself and my great guests, there are also the usual costs of producing a podcast such as website costs, storage, design and the like. However, with your generous donations, these costs can be eliminated fairly quickly and we can move on to the fun stuff: Improvements. Moving to a better webspace, finding more solid distribution and storage for the show and in general making Panel Riot the kind of show I know it can be. The kind of show that I want to produce for you. How can you help? Well, let\u0027s check out the pledge amounts below and see which one works for you.\u003cbr\u003e"
