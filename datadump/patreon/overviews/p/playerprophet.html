It doesn\u0027t count as a webcomic, and is instead more appropriately categorized as an illustrated web novel, if it weren\u0027t for all those gaming sections. To accomplish this, TWS (pronounced \"two\u0027s\") is a labor of love from a team of people. Clark \"plazmataz\" Powell is the composer, Sean Beauchamp is the programmer, and my wife Ella is the graphic designer/monster artist. With their help, I can make something incredible. And I promise you it will be incredible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a professional artist, I have to divide my time between work and play. Your support helps me to more focus my attention on Those Without Shadows, only taking other projects that I am seriously interested in.\u003cbr\u003e"
