    "summary": "Shibui, Found Image Art began in 2011. My goal had been to be creative.\u00a0 I put paper on the floor, threw watercolor at the page and said, \"Now! What is there?\" It turned out a whole lot was there! The first Shibui were called sploshwork. The I discovered the Japanese word Shibui and it seemed the perfect name for what I was doing! I felt from its\u00a0 beginning that Shibui was something others could have fun with. It was creative, but it is also therapeutic. It is unique to the person doing it. I quickly discovered this when teaching Shibui to others. It has required that I develop terminologies and descriptions regarding the techniques I use. I needed to give names to the different types developed simply to\u00a0 have dialogs with those I taught or talked with. My website is anisettestudios.com\u00a0 .\u00a0 Shibui is like finding things in the clouds, or in a stain, once the image is found you build on it. It ranges from simple to complex and you never know what you will find. It is always abstract and fantastical. I have a lot of fun doing it! \u003cbr\u003e"

Each year I have purchased what is needed to have a functional studio space to teach in. Currently there are four drawing tables, a large table and a large drafting table. To be more complete I need ergonomic chairs, and lighting for my students. I also need a business sign so people will find me, and see when I am open for class.\u00a0 The larger plan is to go for grant money through my town to turn my garage into a larger studio. The name of my studio is Anisette Studios. You can see my work at anisettestudios.com.\u00a0 Defined it is found image art. I have an instructional book project in the works as Shibui can help anyone to be creative but also it is very therapeutic! Currently I am getting involved with one or more homeschooling groups to teach Shibui. I need to teach as it will help me understand how Shibui can help others, and with the writing of the instructional book. \u003cbr\u003e",
