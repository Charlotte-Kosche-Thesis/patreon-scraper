I discuss the background, origins, and influences of the most notorious pirates and tell their stories as entertainingly as I can. We talk as well about the impact they have on us today. I\u0027m passionate about the project, proud of it, and humbled by the response I\u0027ve gotten. With your help I can release episodes more frequently, with a greater scope and depth of topics, as well as keep the lights on and buy some of those sources and histories I\u0027ve had my eye on. Thank you so much.\u003cbr\u003e"
