    "summary": "Greetings!  P.C. Haring here!  I write science fiction novels, publish them, and produce them in audio form!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work primarily in the Cyberpunk and Space Opera genres and currently have two full length titles to my name,  Cybrosis: A Codename Ciris Conspiracy and Slipspace: Harbinger.  I\u2019ve also dabbled in a pair of Steampunk short stories and a few other things here and there.  It\u2019s a small reading list, and as you can see in the cover image above, there\u2019s certainly room to grow.  I have two more full length novels drafted and in the editing process, another three on top of that are being brainstormed and developed.  All of these, and more are just waiting for their turn to see the public\u2019s eye.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in!  I need your support!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an independently published author is a mixed bag.  On the one hand I can write and publish what I chose and I don\u2019t bump into the editorial issues that can crop up with a traditional publisher.  But that also means that I have to finance the production of any given book myself.  My cover artists, editors, layout designers, and audio narrators are paid professionals who do phenomenal work for me and their other clients.  But their work does not come free!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, I\u2019m asking you to help me out with a small monthly patronage that will help keep me on track and not have to slow down the pace of releases due to budget gridlock.  I\u2019m starting out small with the reward tiers by choice as I don\u0027t want to ask you to break your budget to help me out.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy interacting with my audience and interacting with you here will be no exception.  As a Patron you\u2019ll have access to free copies of my existing work.  You\u2019ll have early access and future work.  You\u2019ll have exclusive access to certain updates from me which will include insights into my work, unavailable anywhere else.  If we hit our first goal, you\u2019ll have a once monthly audio podcast from me updating you.  If we hit our second goal you\u2019ll get the audio of every book released to you ahead of anyone else.  Beyond that, who knows.  This is a living project so as time passes, my catalogue expands, and new opportunities come available, new extras, bonuses, and rewards will be made available to you.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, consideration, and hopefully for your patronage.  I hope you\u2019ll support my work and I look forward to interacting with you!  If you\u2019d like more information about me and my writing, I encourage you to visit my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.pcharing.net\"\u003ewww.pcharing.net\u003c/a\u003e"
