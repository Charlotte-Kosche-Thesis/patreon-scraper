    "summary": "Hi! My name is Zack Morrison, and I make the webcomic \u003ca href=\"http://paranatural.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eParanatural\u003c/a\u003e, an all-ages story about spectral-powered middle schoolers helping ghosts and fighting evil spirits in the mysterious town of Mayview.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParanatural is my first webcomic project, and I\u0027ve been working on it for more than 5 years now. I love making comics and telling stories, and I want to keep doing these things and to keep on expanding and improving my work. If I could tell the me 6 years ago that was excitedly detailing Paranatural characters and their powers to high school friends at lunch and in long phone calls that today I\u0027d be making this comic full time, he would have been over the moon! I want to keep building on what I have, so that, another 6 years down the line, I can look back at the me of today and know he would be blown away by what I\u0027ve accomplished then, too. Your becoming a patron will help me build that dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make money from ads on Paranatural\u0027s website and from merchandise sales, but I\u0027m hoping Patreon will add a third pillar of support that will push comics into being a Real Job for me. I want to keep making my own comics, written and drawn by me, for you, full time, all the time! Your pledges will literally be allowing me to do what I love, and more of it. I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting Paranatural!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you\u0027ll get to see more of my work and the process behind it! Check out the reward tiers to the right for more information, I am very excited about all of them. Thank you, and thanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e"
