We\u0027re a group of friends that like to sit and chat about Disney topics, technology, food, drinks, music, art, our lives, and well, everything! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re already listening to our podcast we want to extend a special \u0027thank you\u0027 to you. Your support as a listener means SO much to us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows our community to help us out with small monetary contributions that help keep the show going. Our patrons are very special to us so we call them our Podketeers Fairy Godparents because of the help they provide us (or as they have dubbed themselves, the #FGPSquad)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you\u0027re going to start charging for the podcast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. Our weekly podcast will continue to be free and being a Fairy Godparent is voluntary. We are, however, looking into providing special perks to patrons that contribute a specific amount (or more) on a monthly basis. For instance, if you currently sign-up for (at least) a $5 monthly contribution you will get the exclusive Fairy Godparent button!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo if it\u0027s free, why do you want money from us? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the content itself is free, the equipment, monthly fees associated with running a podcast and keeping the website running are not and over a period of time this can get very expensive. Although we have a lot of fun creating each episode and interacting with many of you we still have families and full-time jobs that require a lot of our attention. Becoming a Fairy Godparent not only helps offset monthly costs for us but it\u0027s also another way to say \u0027\u003cem\u003ehey y\u0027all, thanks for the podcast!\u0027\u003c/em\u003e (or whatever variation of that comment you prefer).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope this has been helpful and hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a Podketeers Fairy Godparent through a monthly (or even one-time contribution). Not only has the podcast been fun to make but we\u0027ve met a lot of people that we now consider some of our closest friends. That alone is something we\u0027ll always be thankful for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate you coming by and thanks for considering helping us out with a contribution!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, here\u0027s to beers, cheers and Mickey ears! \u003cbr\u003e"
