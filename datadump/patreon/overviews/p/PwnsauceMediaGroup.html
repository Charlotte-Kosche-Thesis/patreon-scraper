The primary use of this page, for the time being, will be to support the maintenance of our private Teamspeak Server.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePut simply, running a 24/7 server with all the bells and whistles attached does not come free. It isn\u0027t really that pricey though. With just a few dollars a month, we can afford to keep the server running into the foreseeable future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill the server run even without support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruthfully, yes. See, the server has basically become a second home for us in the virtual world. Even if we received no donations, the server would continue to run because, well, it\u0027s that important to us.\u003cbr\u003e"
