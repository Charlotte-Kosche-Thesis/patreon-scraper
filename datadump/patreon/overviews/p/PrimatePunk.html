    "summary": "Hello! My name is Ar\u00f3n Keyser, or most known for going by the name Primate Punk on social media. I am an independent animator who has been making and uploading cartoons for over 5 years on youtube. I started this patreon so that I can hopefully gain the support from people who may share the same interest as I do in animated cartoons. Even though I am the sole animator and have last say on what makes it into my cartoons, I have been fortunate enough to work with many hard working individuals who have lent me their talents over the years for voice acting, writing, sound design, art, etc. Which has helped me grow as an artist and story teller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I want to continue making vibrant and silly cartoons with surreal characters and stories and push myself further to trying to make bigger and better projects that stand out from one another. I also hope to eventually be able to pay back for the generosity my friends have shown me over the years aside from lending my talents back to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will only be giving updates on my progress and also your name in the credits as rewards should you donate. I consider any rewards that take up too much time that could be used to work on my cartoons as counterproductive. I will be striving for a cartoon to be released every few months (Or at least more than once a year haha), so until I get to a point where I can make more than one cartoon per month, I will be sticking to the per project method of payment. This method is the simplest and fairest way to handle my patreon for now. I don\u0027t receive any money until the work is done and I won\u0027t make promises I might not be able to keep in the long run. To put it simply, you give the money and I will use it to make the best cartoons I can!\u003cbr\u003e"
