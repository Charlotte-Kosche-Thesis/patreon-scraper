     "about": "Podbros started as an idea in the spring of 2013 and finally came into fruition in late 2013. This podcast network was made with the goal in mind to bring together a group of podcasts that all listeners could enjoy. Many of our podcasts are not the typical types people will listen to but they all share that same common ground \u2013 a passion about what we love.\u003cbr\u003eWe will be bringing you weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly podcasts to fill those dull days with a bit of excitement. Our podcasts are mostly set up so that you will be able to listen while on your commute to and from work, while you sit and type away at your computer, needing an alternative to music on the radio, at the gym, or even just sitting at home. We plan on bringing entertainment to your ears! You will be able to find our stuff on our home page, iTunes, Stitcher, Tunein, Google Play, and YouTube. You can also subscribe to our RSS feed to either get notifications or choose which ones you wish to subscribe to individually.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re hoping you take a listen and let us know what you like! We\u2019re always looking for new listeners and we gladly interact with those that are looking for a podcast community with regular people talking about what they like; whether it is comic books, sports, professional wrestling, movies or the great outdoors.\u003cbr\u003eFor any questions or concerns, please contact us at thebros@podbros.com.
