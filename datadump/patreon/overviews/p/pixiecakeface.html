    "summary": "Hello my little buns, Pix here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly let me say THANK YOU for caring enough to even visit this page. Just being here alone shows that you\u0027re interested \u0026amp; invested enough in what I do to explore my adventures in the wide world of cosplay (\u0026amp; gaming), even if you don\u0027t sign up today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, for those of you who may have perhaps stumbled across this page by chance - My name\u0027s Pixie (but you can call me Pix) and I am a female cosplayer, born \u0026amp; bred from the North of England (The North Remembers!). I have toyed with the idea of setting up a Patreon for a while but mostly didn\u0027t pursue it as I felt that I didn\u0027t really have any worthwhile additional content to offer in exchange for the support of my followers. However I have finally traversed the Dead Marshes and now stand at the summit of Mount Doom, ready to throw myself into the fiery pit of... Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo again I thank you for visiting this page \u0026amp; even considering to pledge - I am truly honoured.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will my pledge go towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will allow me to invest more into the cosplays I\u0027m creating; enhancing the overall detailing \u0026amp; quality and will even allow me to make more of them! All money accrued from my Patreon will be reinvested back into my cosplay \u0026amp; broadcasting so I can ensure I deliver top-notch content to all of you who support me. It will also allow me to invest time \u0026amp; resources into my new YouTube channel depicting the day to day life of a cosplayer along with vlogs, tutorials \u0026amp; more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat rewards will I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what can you expect from becoming a patron? A good question, and one which I am still trying to think of ways to improve. However so far here\u0027s a collection of things I\u0027ve come up with:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive photo sets available both in print and digital format - patrons choose their character!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePixie\u0027s Picks - Quarterly \u0027sub\u0027 box filled to the brim with nerdy \u0026amp; kawaii paraphanalia\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive tutorials in both text \u0026amp; video format\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonalised handwritten letter of thanks per month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive giveaways for games, custom made armour \u0026amp; cosplays\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI will of course look to add more to this but this is my starting point. I finally feel that I am in a position to start offering some great content on both my pages \u0026amp; my Patreon, as a way to thank you all for supporting me this far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this. Have a fantastic day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and as always... love yourself!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePix x"

     "description": "This tier is a little excessive, but bear with me. In the past I have been asked to cosplay specific characters and while I would love to accommodate every request, due to the costs of the materials used and the time spent on the build, it would just not be possible. So I have decided to add this ridiculously priced pledge on here for those who REALLY would like me to cosplay a certain character. The price of this pledge will cover the costs involved and allow me to make that request a reality :)\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*there is no minimum sub month requirement.\u003c/p\u003e",
