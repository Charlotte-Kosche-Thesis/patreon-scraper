    "summary": "I\u0027m Paul Cosca, and I create...well...all kinds of things? I make music, I write novels, I make games, I even do an occasional video from time to time! But the creations on this Patreon page are all about putting on your headphones and listening to something new and unique. It might be audio books, new music, podcasts, or something neither of us has even thought of yet!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY? \u003c/strong\u003eOh what a good question? Why am I here on Patreon? Well, I\u0027m here because I love to create things. Always have. I grew up intensely poor, and my imagination was pretty much the best thing I had to work with. I created stories for myself, drew terrible pictures, and played in worlds of my own design (have you ever considered that many pieces of junk also resemble spaceships if you look at them the right way? My broken electric typewriter/spaceship was pretty bomb). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve held a lot of different jobs in my life (radio dj, cook, tour guide, driver\u0027s ed instructor...) and for almost three years I\u0027ve been working at an insurance company, of all things. I\u0027m sure you can guess how much that sucks. Answer: a lot. I\u0027ve come to the recent realization that life is just too short to work at a job you hate. Way, way, WAY too short! So I\u0027m doing it. I\u0027m getting in my escape pod, strapping in, and jettisoning myself from the mothership.\u003cem\u003e I\u0027m giving up the day job. \u003c/em\u003eIt\u0027s terrifying, it\u0027s thrilling, and you can help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW? \u003c/strong\u003eHere\u0027s the nuts and bolts: I\u0027m going to make things that you can listen to. Might be music. Might be stories. Might be something we come up with together or something I haven\u0027t thought of yet! But the bottom line is that I\u0027m going to make things that take you to amazing places. Some of these tracks will later be available to everyone. Some of them will be completely exclusive to those who support me through Patreon and appear nowhere else. And either way, you\u0027ll know that \u00a0\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0have helped make it happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge will be based on the audio projects I put out. I will put out at least one thing every week. Sometimes I may put out more things in a week, but you can always adjust your settings in case I go crazy and put out a bunch of things all at once.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means I can devote more time to awesome, purely creative projects. How far can we reach? An album? An original audio-drama? A robot symphony? Our spaceship that looks like a broken electric typewriter can take us anywhere!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
