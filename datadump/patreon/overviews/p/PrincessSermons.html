    "summary": "So, I\u0027m Reverend Becky Elfprincess (totes my real name, I paid for it myself!). I\u0027m a writer. You can find some of my stuff over at Quantum Muse ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.quantummuse.com/bio.php?RecID=Banshee46\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.quantummuse.com/bio.php?RecID=Banshee46\u003c/a\u003e ), though to be frank, a lot of those stories are more or less first drafts that none the less got published (mostly because the site doesn\u0027t pay, but I digress). I\u0027ve also written for several video game sites ( \u003ca href=\"http://geekparty.com/author/alcoholic-luigi/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://geekparty.com/author/alcoholic-luigi/\u003c/a\u003e Geekparty can still be found, but is not currently active. I also worked for GamerTell, but a new company owns the domain, and you can\u0027t find any of my old stuff there.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not going to pretend I can post things up on any kind of schedule. However, I do try really hard to update regularly. I want to ensure people who give me money get stuff in return. There will be a few rewards every month at the very least. I\u0027ll try to get at least one of each type up, but I know better than to make promises at this point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thank you for your support, and hopefully you enjoy what you see!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSickineningly Yours,\u003cbr\u003eRev.

This way, the people who pledge $2 and $5 will get to see a bit more of what they\u0027re missing (and also won\u0027t feel like their $2 doesn\u0027t get them much, which is a feeling I absolutely do not want my customers to have), and hopefully get non-patrons to have a burning desire to see the rest of the $10 (and up) rewards.\u003cbr\u003e",
