    "summary": "I spent ten years on a project to build a free, public, highly advanced search engine for social network data. I obtained special permission from Facebook to index 420 million public profiles. When Facebook reneged on the deal and tried to destroy my business, I spent years of my life and a lot of money on legal costs and eventually obtained a settlement. I have continued to operate Profile engine for several years despite it not making money because it stands between Facebook and a monopoly over social data and because it helps educate people not to trust Facebook. I have not made money from Profile Engine and no longer have time to maintain it, so I have donated the data (plus soon the source code) to the Internet Archive so that anyone can freely set up a search engine for Facebook social network data. If the data is useful to you or you would like to support me in my effort to overturn the Facebook monopoly over social data then please donate, this will help cover the legal costs and the cost of servers which I have incurred keeping the site up and running and preserving the data until now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving never sold any data (despite several offers to do so) and having donated this huge asset for free for the public good, I and my family are now suffering financial hardship. I would welcome your support and donations towards the ten years of my life and countless hours of work I have spent on the Profile Engine. The money will aid me in starting a new venture to support us in future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease also consider donating 10% of your profit from any commercial venture using the data I have made available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for your support. I\u0027d love to be kept updated on what you are able to achieve and build using the resource of public social network data from Profile Engine."
