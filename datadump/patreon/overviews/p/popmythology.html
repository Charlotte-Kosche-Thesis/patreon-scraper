Yet turbulent times, as uncomfortable as they are, can bring out the truly heroic and courageous within people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom its inception in 2012,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePopMythology.com\u003c/strong\u003e has always sought to be a blog that could encourage, inspire, and nurture the inner hero within readers by way of its\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.popmythology.com/category/applied-geekism/hero-wisdom/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHero Wisdom\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0section. This heroic potential is within everyone but it doesn\u0027t always get awakened, particularly when there is much fear, resentment, anger, and aggression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe enormous popularity of pop culture franchises such as \u003cstrong\u003eMarvel\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eDC\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eStar Wars\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/strong\u003e serves as an opportune time to reach fans of these imaginative properties and to help spark their moral imaginations. I draw equally from the disciplines of anthropology, psychology, and philosophy for the wellspring of wisdom they offer. But I use the vocabulary of pop culture as my \"language.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope that by reaching out to those who feel deeply drawn to pop culture, and by helping to awaken their innate heroism and moral imaginations, Pop Mythology can serve as one small contribution towards helping our culture pass through these turbulent times in one piece and to emerge stronger and, hopefully, wiser.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e**The SHORT-TERM goal of this Patreon is to cover basic monthly operating costs of PopMythology, all of which I\u0027ve paid for myself for the past 5 years.**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**The LONG-TERM goal of this Patreon is to someday reach basic income level ($1012) for the creative content that I offer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.
