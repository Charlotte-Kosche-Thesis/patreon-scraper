    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a blogger, essayist, and aspiring voice actor. I started off studying creative writing for four years at a community college when I decided putting out stories and essays about social and political, and philosophical ideas was something I was interested in. In fact, it is one of the few occupations I can only do along with sharing my experiences in the acting field. But that doesn\u0027t mean I never witnessed any detriments along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile attending college, I had to work full time to pay off my student debt and other finance, such as room and board. I eventually dropped out because I needed to worry about my living expenses. Soon, I had got another job, a part-time one, and the only time I could write was late at night for only an hour or less. There were some days were I just couldn\u0027t do it due to exhaustion and spending at least four hours on a day off. And it led me down to being less motivated. However, I want to continue learning the fundamentals of writing literature and the art of acting. I discovered Patreon from various people on Youtube and other websites and thought this would be a great opportunity to share my work with others. This is why I gave this website a shot and even though I stopped for a while to handle professional and personal obstacles, which I\u0027m sure many creators have had, I wanted to continue my interest in sharing my stories and thoughts to others. Not just to please businesses and publishing companies, who have rejected my work numerous times in the past, but I want to show my audience and those who may not be familiar with me some ideas they have never thought of before; to bring them in and enjoy reading all the way to the last page. At the same time, like before, I want to continue learning about other authors and studying language and improve my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to what I want to do with my Patreon page: Since I\u0027ve mentioned literary fiction and essays, I want to write papers on various authors; to describe their language and writing style, themes they explore, why they have written their stories the way they wanted to. Authors include, Tolstoy, Solzhenitsyn, Chandler, Highsmith, McCarthy, and Palahniuk just to name a few. I also want to do a series on the settings, themes, and characters in movies. They are a great piece of entertainment, but sometimes there can be more light if thought thoroughly, especially those that confuse the audience or miss out on something small. I thought about doing voice over narrations, reading aloud my work on mp3 or mp4 formats or on Soundcloud like a podcast. I found that podcasts are a great way to enjoy while out travelling or exercising or working, or simply relaxing at home. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s what I\u0027m offering: You send in your pledge, however much you can afford with no pressure added (believe me I know asking for money or sending money can often make you feel bad, but trust me it is worth it), I\u0027ll give you access to my news feed and other rewards. All suggestions and comments are appreciated. I hope you will consider becoming a patreon and giving me the courage and enthusiasm to do what I love to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Pat Sisson"
