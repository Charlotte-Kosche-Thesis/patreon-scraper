While we are already around for quite some time, we never released any real games and currently shoot for the release of our first full game. We started making games in early 2013 and after finishing a few smaller projects we thought it might be time to release something bigger \u003ca href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/games/surviveon\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e(currently we are working on a game called \u0027SurviveOn!\u0027)\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe making of a video game is a nerve-racking process and though it also is a lot of fun, we realized very early that we aren\u0027t able to make this project happen without any help. Our plan is to release our games for free and that is exactly what we are trying to do with \u0027SurviveOn!\u0027. But while we don\u0027t want our users to charge for our games, we also can\u0027t develop the game without spending money for ourselves and to this day we already spent quite a lot of time and money on Assets, Artwork, Level Design, 3D-Models, Scripting etc. In addition to this we all attend regular jobs to get by, thus nearly always lacking time to work on the project properly (though we do what we can).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you become a patron, you\u0027re pledging a dollar amount of your choice per month.
