I setup this Patreon account for anyone who\u0027d be interested in helping me create the game of my dreams, a\u00a0gritty RPG with a focus on exploration and quality storytelling in a retrofuturistic post-apocalyptic world. Sounds good?

The perspective will still be isometric, but the player can rotate the camera, since the environment will be 3D.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what\u0027s the pitch? In 1949 an alien spacecraft crashed in San Luis Obispo, California. In the following years, the U.S. has made incredible technological progress by reverse engineering the alien technology. But it all goes to hell on October 24th 1962, when the Cuban Missile Crisis ends with a bang. One hundred years later, you play as one of the survivors, holed up in a Duck \u0026amp; Cover Inc. bunker on the New San Andreas isle. It\u0027s time for you to leave the vault and meet the world. Or what\u0027s left of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck out the Rewards to the right side of the screen\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to make a pledge.
