    "summary": "My name is Palle Schultz and I\u0027m a videographer, photographer and musician currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do voluntary work by photographing young and upcoming performance artists, as well as upcoming i.e. MMA fighters to help them further their career. I am a mentor for a few young photographers, to help them be the best they can and I make videos that mostly land on my youtube channel. If you are reading this, you have most likely seen one or a few of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m very passionate about filmmaking and portrait photography and do as much of that as I can afford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs \u00a0stated before, I am a photographer and videographer... and a musician as well. It is quite fortunate to be able to produce videos single handedly, from storyboard to soundtrack, but it also takes a lot of time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a content creator since forever and as most people know, it isn\u0027t the best paid job you can have.\u00a0To be able to do this kind of work and continue to make videos I have to figure out a way to fund it. In all honesty, for me funding is to be able to pay the rent, get food and being able to pay for the stuff I use to create my projects, so I can make time to create more and better videos.\u00a0I\u0027m in a never ending process of improving. There is always something to improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard about patreon through a\u00a0Joe Rogan podcast and thought; Maybe this could be an opening to produce more and better movies, and maybe even be able to pay som participants for their contribution. If all goes well, I will produce more films and support more young talent. It is as simple as that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect anybody to just throw money at me for fun. But if you like what I do, and want to see more of it, please consider supporting my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking your time to read this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely\u003cbr\u003ePalle Schultz\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
