    "summary": "Hello everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*After months of people asking how they can help financially support the PoGo TV server we have decided to start this Patreon page where any of you guys can pledge a designated amount of money to help support the discord.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the Pokemon Go: Treasure Valley Official Patreon page! I would like to start out by thanking each and everyone of you guys that have supported myself (Joe Dorn) along with all the rest of the admins, moderators, scanners, nest spotters and everyone else that have dedicated their time, money, efforts and love into creating the community that we all are a part of. As we all know Pokemon Go is a game that involves social interaction and communication with each other because of that we have seen an incredible Pokemon Go Community that has formed here in Treasure Valley. The discord server now has over 1,500 members and still growing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are here today because you are part of our Pokemon Go: Treasure Valley Official Discord Server and have somehow benefited from it. When the other admins and myself decided to come together and create the discord it blew up and instantly became a second job for many of us. We quickly needed to set up an order to allow stability and structure for the discord so we recruited moderators, scanners, nest spotters and others to help with providing and creating a beneficial aspect for you all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the creator of the discord I have spent 100\u0027s of hours and dollars on the community and discord by setting up, creating, maintaining and fine tuning the discord and all the different channels, roles, settings and permissions within it. On the regular, I research, implement, maintain and fine tune all the bots that make help make the discord function properly. I purchase the majority of hash keys for our scanners and research, set up and recruit new scanners. I have done all of this and continue to do so because I know and consider many of you friends. I know that coming together as a community we can keep having fun playing Pokemon Go and at the same time give back to the community in a beneficial manner. The discord that we\u0027re all a part of gives us the strength in unity to do such things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Discord we have brought to you many things such as:\u003cbr\u003e*Countless Live Rare Pokemon Sighting\u003cbr\u003e*Raid Sightings and the support to defeat the bosses\u003cbr\u003e*Lure Parties\u003cbr\u003e*Events and Prizes\u003cbr\u003e*The most up to date Nest list for Treasure Valley that\u0027s contained in a Google DOC and a google maps nest overlay.\u003cbr\u003e*Access to bots that help to do too many things to list\u003cbr\u003e*Countless enjoyable experiences in Pokemon Go with your loved ones, you kids and friends\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0It brings joy to my heart when I see someone spontaneously burst into happiness because they caught a Pokemon or defeated a raid boss they otherwise would not have been able to do. Many of us have had the enjoyment of meeting cool and positive people by using the discord and some have even made friends! Because of things like that it has made all the time, money and energy invested into creating the discord community worth it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0If you have in any way benefited from the discord and its resources then please consider becoming a Patron for our discord! Becoming a Patron means you will give a designated amount of money to help support our discord and community. We have a pretty good and economically feasible set up for our scanners and other areas that cost money but would help a lot if you could help in any way, even if it\u0027s just a dollar or two a month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again to everyone that has helped make this possible and I look forward to bringing more and better features in the future! I hope you have a beautiful day! Happy Hunting!\u003cbr\u003e"
