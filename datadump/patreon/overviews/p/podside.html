Podside NetworX Internet Talk Radio Station will take full advantage of many sources to get content to our patrons. Twitch.tv and YouTube.com along with podside.net and multiplexgaming.com are examples of some of the those sources out there that our patrons can view or hear our content generators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur content generators (podcasters, videocasters and streamers) will be supported under the umbrella of the Podside NetworX. Our content generators and our Podside NetworX staff will work together to bring content for a variety of genres of all types. All though Podside NetworX will keep its feet firmly planted in the EVE Online Media, the goal is to branch out where ever our content generators want to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodside NetworX will help and teach the new and old content generators how to use the different internet media sources and help provide them the tools to get started. We will also help these content generators with the knowledge of how to use the different social media tools to maximize their potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe here at Podside NetworX will together as a team, both staff and content generators alike, to share knowledge and advice that will bring good content to the internet for our patrons. Our hope is that our patrons will support each content generator individually while the donations to the Podside NetworX its self can help with funding for the website, servers, software and staff."
