    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Tim Colwill. I\u0027ve spent a very long time around games -- I worked for many years studying them at university, then spent several years as a developer, and then later moved again to become a journalist and editor. In that time I have built up a lot of baffled amusement at the various ways in which this industry (like me) is completely full of itself and in desperate need of being deflated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now I\u0027m working on something even better: a dedicated gaming satire site, where I make fun of absolutely everybody involved in games, from the lowest, most racist commenter, to the wankiest games journalist, to the most highly-paid soulless executive. It\u0027s called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pointandclickbait.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePoint \u0026amp; Clickbait\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched Point \u0026amp; Clickbait in November of 2015 and I\u0027ve been running it pretty much 100% for my own personal amusement since then. I certainly have no intention of stopping, but it does take time out of my day and it would be nice to at least be able to buy myself a choc milk every so often as a reward. Thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
