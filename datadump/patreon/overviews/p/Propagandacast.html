    "summary": "Good Afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Or Good Morning, or good evening. Good whatever suits you really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI the Mighty Imperial Dane have for years now been making daily youtube videos and with the advent of Patreon finally gotten around to perhaps organizing support a bit better. Initially not something i\u0027ve considered much, but with more and more people asking for the option. It only makes sense to go here in the hopes of gaining more donations towards the glorious Propaganda Minisitry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what would you be supporting then ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell basically you\u0027d be supporting the continued making of videos on a daily basis and hopefully with enough donations. Well upgrades of equipment, a better microphone for example. Perhaps paying someone to make a more professional intro.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd who knows. If it is something people want. I could do more regular game reviews with sufficient money. And if we\u0027re being really crazy. I could even do book reviews since i know some people like the historical bits and i do like history books and throwing out the occasional review might also be something people might want. But i don\u0027t see that happening right away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about rewards ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupporting the glorious Propagandacast is it\u0027s own reward !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore seriously. I don\u0027t want to do rewards since that would mean gating off content from other people. And the glorious minisitry is about reaching as many as possible. Not as few as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo sadly all i can offer in reward is my eternal thanks and of course down the road. Lots more content for everyone if this turns out reasonably succesfully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClosing words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOverall. I\u0027m new to this Patreon Jig. So if you\u0027ve got comments or questions or anything like that. Feel free to ask. \u00a0Let us all work together to make this something great !!"
