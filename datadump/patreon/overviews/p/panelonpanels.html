Each week John Campbell, Donovan Eilert and Mike Gorgone strive to bring you topical, thoughtful and entertaining conversations revolving around the ever-growing medium which we adore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComic book characters now have a presence within every conceivable media outlet, from movies and television to a certain 1975 Spider-man oriented rock opera (listen to Episode 9, seriously), and we love discussing every facet of it. From reviews and guest interviews to more topic specific discussions, our panelists are here to come at Comic Books from every angle they can. Our hope is to make these conversations fun and engaging, picking apart some of the minutia of our fandom while also making it accessible to those new to the scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur titular Panel is based out of sunny Portland, Oregon which has become a mecca for Comic Book creators from across the industry. This allows us access to a plethora of exciting guests which grace many of our episodes. From industry legends such as Tim Sale and Bob Schreck to up and coming stars (and fan favorites) Dan Schkade and Ibrahim Moustafa, we are always on the lookout to interview those who work in the industry and pick their brains about what they do. Or just have nerdy conversations about the comics we love. Most of the time it\u2019s both!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePanel on Panels is a free podcast, brought to you every week without adds through our love of comic books and sheer willpower (like Green Lantern but without the rings). We definitely want to keep it that way and you can help! This Patreon is all about making sure Panel on Panels stays add free and continues to grow. Your patronage will allow us to travel farther, record more and make sure we are the best podcast we can be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you will have access to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBonus Podcast Episodes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImmediate access to Panel on Panels News and Blog posts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore direct interaction (and possibly influence, mwahahaha!) with our Panelists\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDiscounts on Eventual Merchandise (Trust us, it\u2019s coming)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to our future video content\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd More as we continue to grow\u2026\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we\u2019re hoping to make Panel on Panels not just a podcast about all things Comics and Comics Related but a multi-media center for the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest and your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as always, Keep Reading Comics Everyone!"
