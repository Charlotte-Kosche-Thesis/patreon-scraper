I\u0027ve been cosplaying for a few years now and I really enjoy being a part of such a lively and vibrant community of people and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027m making this is because on multiple occasions I have people coming to me and asking \"Hey \"insert name that people call me\"I love your work, how can I support you?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWELL here\u0027s your answer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplaying is a craft, it takes time and energy to do so many things. You\u0027re your own seamstress, designer, stylist, make-up artist, and even your own photographer and editor at times. (A lot of my photos are edited by myself)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to do things for the people who support me. And that\u0027s where you guys come in! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be providing different rewards for different levels of support, ranging from the generic thank you to more personalized stuff. And the best part is that you guys don\u0027t have to pay until a costume or shoot is ready to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if something breaks or things don\u0027t pan out exactly right, you guys don\u0027t have to waste your money. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso once I get enough of a head start, I\u0027ll be able to afford better equipment for videos and be able to do things on youtube (that aren\u0027t my generic amvs and gmvs) like makeup tutorials and cosplay videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to create more higher quality content for you guys. And every single person who decides to help me out, you all get my sincere thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dPqduRo.jpg\"\u003e"
