There wasn\u0027t a place that felt like home and they wanted to find where they belonged. To do that, they needed to travel, to have new adventures. They not only wanted to travel, they wanted to learn, they wanted to explore and share the stories that weren\u0027t written in their textbooks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn adventure doesn\u0027t always have to take you to a new country. Each of them has their own wishes for the Lost In Texas project, but the goal is the same: Research, Explore, Preserve.
