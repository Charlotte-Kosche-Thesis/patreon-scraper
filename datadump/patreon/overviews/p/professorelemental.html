A \nfour part radio show based in the Professor\u0027s world. This is a radio \nshow with a difference- whether organising the village fete or taking \npart in a mad sky race orbeing captured by geese on a remote Island, we \npromise, adventure, sci-fi, horror, romance and huge great dollops of \ncomedy. We now have studios booked and a brilliant cast on board. Thanks to your pledges so far, we will definitely record this show, but if we get $900, we will be able to master it, promote it make it beautiful and actually pay our cast! Patreons will, of course, be the very first to hear the show.",
