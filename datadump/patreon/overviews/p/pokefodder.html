    "summary": "Like many of you, I found Pokemon Duel via Trainer Tips Nick in early 2017. I found myself enjoying the strategy-based game and was longing for more content but was not really able to find much. I felt like if I was looking for content, then so must other people.\u003cbr\u003eIn late February, I decided to try my hand at creating content and let me tell you, those early videos are difficult to watch. But over time and through trial and error, I was able to start turning out quality content.\u003cbr\u003eViewers of my videos started requesting more information than I could realistically provide in a single upload per day and I started noticing some gaps between the developers of the game and the players. From there, I decided to start up a Discord channel where I could give more of my time and energy to not only my viewers, but fans of the game.\u003cbr\u003eIt is because of the great community, informative information, and custom tournaments that the PokeFodder Discord has grown to become the largest of its kind in less than a year. And it is still growing.\u003cbr\u003eBut running the bots, hosting tournaments, and growing its reach comes as a cost. Myself, along with the MODs, footed the bill for the entire first year of Discord and were happy to do it. But in order for things to continue to grow and improve, it takes more than we can do alone.\u003cbr\u003eThis is where we need your help! By becoming a Patreon, you are contributing directly to the daily upkeep and expansion of the Discord server.\u003cbr\u003eThere are various rewards you can unlock with your monthly pledge, including cash prizes from tournaments and exclusive Discord roles.\u003cbr\u003e"
