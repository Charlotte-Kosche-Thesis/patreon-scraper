    "summary": "Beautiful, fresh, locally grown flowers can be a great everyday luxury: they bring you into contact with the seasons and the climate, they show you what your local landscape is capable of producing, and, because they are fresh from the field, they can provide weeks of brightness and enjoyment. But local flowers do much more than this: they enhance the community by allowing customers to get to know their local flower farmers, and they contrast dramatically with the cut flowers customers are used to in the US, many of which are grown in South and Central America, sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, and shipped-- or even flown!-- to markets all over the US. At Pink House Flower Farm, we are working to bring fresh, local, beautiful flowers to southeastern Ohio. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4523/38570469076_70779b2db0_c.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Lindsey Long, and I am passionate about flowers and plants: I have been growing specialty cut flowers since 2014, landscaping and gardening since 2009, and a lover of flowers and the outdoors for my entire life (and actually, I used to help out at my grandmother\u0027s cut flower farm in Harrod, OH when I was a child). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I am also passionate about southeastern Ohio: while attending Ohio University, I fell in love with the landscape, the people, and the community of southeastern Ohio, and even though I learned environmentally conscious gardening in northern Indiana and flower farming in central Ohio, I have always wanted to return to the Athens area that convinced me that the country was where I wanted to be.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDespite the natural beauty of southeastern Ohio, there have been few farms that specialize in cut flowers. Though some of the area\u0027s great local farmers do grow flowers, there remains a substantial and unmet need for flowers in the area, and many of the cut flowers are shipped (or even flown) in from a great distance away, at considerable cost and environmental impact. This is bad for the environment, but it also deprives the members of the community of the chance to appreciate the beauty which their local land is capable of. Many locally grown garden flowers can make great additions to bouquets, and I am passionate about providing inspiration to other farmers and gardeners by showing alternatives to traditional flower arrangements. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4571/38570469466_8810c490e9_c.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy am I the right person to do this? Under Steve and Gretel Adams of Sunny Meadows Flower Farm, I was able to learn specialty cut flower farming from two talented and skilled leaders of the flower-farmer movement. But more than this, I became skilled at growing flowers and helping to manage the farm, where I eventually played a central role in the production side of their farm. Since moving away from central Ohio, I have advised early-stage farmers on how to manage their farms and maximize their flower production.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut why launch a Patreon? For one, much of what I know about flower farming has been learned from generous teachers, and I want my Patreon to encourage other flower lovers to make flowers a bigger part of their lives, whether by growing a species or variety you\u0027ve never tried before, adding new and surprising kinds of foliage to your arrangements, or even by growing flowers for the first time. But there\u0027s a practical reason to launch a Patreon, too. Although the soils of southeastern Ohio are rich and fertile, it can be a difficult place to launch a small business, and my patrons will help my farm to get through those tricky first few years to become an established part of the landscape. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4520/38570466826_d3529296dd_c.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy ambition is for Pink House Flower Farm to provide sustainable flowers to the Athens-area community. Patrons of all tiers will be able to get a behind-the-scenes look at the effort (and mud) that is involved in producing beautiful flowers. Once flowers are coming up, local patrons of a certain level will be able to receive custom bouquets, while out-of-towners will be able to donate bouquets to local charities, or even receive gardening advice. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4527/38570467306_0922bba28f_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: These flowers were grown with love, care, and the help of the rest of the crew at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sunnymeadowsflowerfarm.com/\"\u003eSunny Meadows Flower Farm\u003c/a\u003e, who have generously allowed me to use pictures of flowers from previous years. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
