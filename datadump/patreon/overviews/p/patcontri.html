    "summary": "Thank you for taking the time to check out my PATreon page (get it?!), whether you decide to pledge to me or not. And thank you for your continued support in watching and sharing my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron, you can have a direct impact on not just the quality of my videos but also which future videos I produce! Your support here helps keep me going, and also makes it easier for me to connect better with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Pat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi everyone! I\u0027m Pat Contri. I\u0027m best known for my \u003cem\u003ePat the NES Punk \u003c/em\u003ecomedic retro game series on YouTube, which I have been producing since 2008. I also produce a series called \u003cem\u003eFlea Market Madness\u003c/em\u003e and am co-host of the \u003cem\u003eCompletely Unnecessary Podcast\u003c/em\u003e - one of the highest rated gaming podcasts on iTunes. There are also other various videos and series I produce as well, including being the co-producer and co-director of \u003cem\u003eThe Video Game Years\u003c/em\u003e - a fun and historical look at gaming history. I also run the NES Charity Marathon, where my friend Ian and I play NES games to raise money for children\u0027s hospitals. If you have contributed to that in the past, I appreciate it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s up with the hair?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dunno, it\u0027s genetics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027ve decided that being a content producer would be a full time profession, I\u0027ve wanted to figure out a way to interact more with those fans who want to support me the most - you! Patreon supplies a platform to do so, with the ability to receive/respond to feedback directly in a better way than what YouTube provides.\u00a0The other fact of life is that between ad revenue being inconsistent from video to video, false copyright claims, and more people blocking ads, it\u0027s a little difficult to predict month-to-month exactly what income will be from producing and releasing videos. I also work and have worked on projects that I receive little to no compensation for, like writing projects, \u003cem\u003eThe Video Game Years\u003c/em\u003e, and keeping my website thepunkeffect.com going.\u00a0With your help, it makes it much easier to produce my current content without having to revert to cheap or dodgy videos that only exist for click-bait, or taking on too many sponsored videos for games/products that I\u0027d rather not. I am offering some rewards in return for your support (early video viewing, Patreon-only rewards, etc.), so please look and see if there\u0027s anything that catches your eye!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for taking the time to check out this page. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
