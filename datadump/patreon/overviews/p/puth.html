    "summary": "Hi friends. I\u0027ve always hated reading HUGE amounts of literature so I\u0027ll keep this brief, assuming that you\u0027re much like me. Or maybe you\u0027re not and you\u0027ve read 1000 page monstrosity novels along with all of the Harry Potter books. Don\u0027t get me wrong, Harry Potter is an OG, but it\u0027s just not for me. That rhymed.\u00a0\u003cp\u003eSo here\u0027s the scoop- I make music videos and put them on YouTube. (Covers, originals, etc...) And I\u0027ve always made them by myself with my little camera in my apartment. But lately, I\u0027ve been sitting by my fancy fireplace in my velvet red robe with Mozart playing softly in the background (sarcasm) thinking to myself that I would REALLY LOVE to make these videos look 100x more professional...for the fans and everyone\u0027s entertainment. That is why I turned to this absolutely sexy and wonderful website.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s basically like Kickstarter, but instead of raising money for one huge project, you can give small reoccurring tips for every music video I put out. I am 576% fine with you giving 1$, 5$, 10$, 20$, 50$, 100$, or 0$. If you feel like you can not pledge right now, please don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m going to egg your house, yell at your dog, and disown you if you don\u0027t. The fact that you are even reading this right now shows that you are one of my biggest fans, and I can\u0027t thank you enough for that. But when you give more than a dollar, you get (drumroll please) ... REWARDS!!! Yes these rewards can range from me following you on twitter, a private skype session with me, a phone call from me, getting my new music before anyone else, articles of my clothing (maybe)...you name it! It will probably be a reward haha!\u00a0And when you donate, you can talk to me privately in the Patron\u0027s only circle, so that\u0027s a thing. We can talk about your day, how the kids are, etc...\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you DO choose to donate, your dollars will be going to a neato production team who will film / edit the Charlie Puth videos, and to a bigger, fancier recording studio where all of the music will be made. It will sound even better.\u00a0I am able to keep on making this music because of YOU, the fans. I choose the\u00a0songs I do because YOU all ask for them on twitter, facebook, instagram etc... I love you all so so much. Thank you for allowing me to do what I love everyday of my life. Write me on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or text me at 707-881-PUTH if you have any questions. #SUPPUTHERS GO IN!!\u003c/p\u003e\n"
