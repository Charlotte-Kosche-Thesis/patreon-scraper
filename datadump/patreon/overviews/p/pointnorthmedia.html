My aim is to make smart podcasts which engage and empower the listener, and to encourage the informed, critical discourse surrounding our favorite books, movies and TV shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the costs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing lots of podcasts isn\u0027t cheap. Right now, it takes at least $300 every month just to keep the lights on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$100 on podcast hosting and backups\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$50 on live video broadcasting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$40 on website hosting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$50 on audio and video editing software\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$40 on other software\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$20-$50 on books, movies and TV show purchases\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe largest investment in Point North Media, though, comes in the form of my time. I\u0027ve been doing this for a long time, and I\u0027m a well-oiled podcast machine, but it still takes time! In an average week, I produce five or six hours of content -- but every hour of the final product takes up to seven hours to create. Per hour of finished content, I spend approximately:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo hours on reading and research\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo hours on show prep, scripts, slides etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne hour on recording\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne hour on editing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne hour on art, show notes, uploading, publishing, website updates etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo to produce five or six hours of content per week, I spend between thirty-five and forty-two hours working directly on podcasts. Some weeks, I produce even more finished content. It adds up, is what I\u0027m saying, and it doesn\u0027t leave much time for other work, which is why your support for Point North Media is absolutely vital!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also passionately believe in Patreon as a platform, and support a number of creators directly, so your support of Point North helps sustain the cycle of creation and artistry on the internet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting my Patreon page; if you like what you see, and you\u0027d like to support independent analysis, criticism and discussion on the internet, then please pledge your support! In return, you\u0027ll get access to bonus episodes, a weekly live Q\u0026amp;A session, access to my Patreon-exclusive Discord server, and more! Thank you!"
