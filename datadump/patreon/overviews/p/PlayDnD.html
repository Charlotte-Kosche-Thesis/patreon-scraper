    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eHow I got started playing D\u0026amp;D\u003c/h3\u003eHello, my name is Andy and I started playing D\u0026amp;D in 1981 with the Basic and then the Expert set. From there I quickly advanced to AD\u0026amp;D. Some of my fondest memories from my teenage years are of playing D\u0026amp;D with a close knit group of friends. We would often stay up late playing on Friday nights and then wake up early Saturday morning to keep playing where we had left off the night before. There were also many epic weekends when we played Friday night, then all day Saturday and Sunday. Of course, we interspersed our play with trips downstairs to eat, play ping-pong or jump in the pool. Even though we sometimes went outside to play football, soccer, ride motorcycles or participate in some other youthful activity, the crux of my preteen and early teenage social life was playing D\u0026amp;D. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eD\u0026amp;D continued to be a central part of my social experience all through High School. I admit that after I turned 16, got a car, and learned how to interact with members of the feminine persuasion, we didn\u0027t play nearly as much. But we did make an effort to keep the game at least on a weekly basis. (There had been times in Junior High and early High School that we played 5 o more times in a week) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe College Years\u003c/h3\u003eAfter High School the friends that I played D\u0026amp;D with all went away to different universities, as did I. Our fellowship had been broken. The summer break after our freshman year of college we were able to continue our original campaign for a few more sessions. But it was different now. We were all drinking while we played for one thing and it just didn\u0027t seem to have the same urgency as it did before. That summer was the last time we all sat down together and played D\u0026amp;D.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo fill the hole that was left after that, I tried running a couple of campaigns in college. But it was difficult to get something going on a regular basis even though I knew a lot of people that had played D\u0026amp;D before.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter Graduation and Marriage I tried again to get a campaign started. I purchased all the 2nd Edition books and the Dark Sun Campaign setting. This was somewhere around 1992-93. Of course this time the group was comprised of my wife and I and two other married couples. I remember being very impressed with how well the all girls role played. (I guess I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised, my wife had been an English major and one of my friends wife\u0027s had done theater) Unfortunately, it didn\u0027t last long. One of the couples got pregnant, followed by us. With the demands of real life and then adding parenthood on top, we found that we simply didn\u0027t have time to play.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Dark Years and New Beginnings\u003c/h3\u003eYears passed without every having a chance to play. I dedicated myself to my career and then to my family. And in that order. Then I found myself in my mid-thirties and I didn\u0027t want to waste the rest of my life in the pursuit of something that is never really attained. I also realized that I had missed a large portion of my children\u0027s childhoods and my marriage wasn\u0027t in the greatest of states either. (This was with my second wife. The English major and I had divorced.) So I did something drastic. I know I couldn\u0027t have done it without the support of my wonderful wife. I sold everything I had and with a very, very small income from some investments I had made, I moved to Mexico. I then dedicated myself to my family first and then to what job or business I had to entertain myself and provide for my family. After that I was very involved in the lives of my two youngest children. We lived on a ranch. They had horses and dirt bikes and cows and goats and sheep. They already knew Spanish and English, but they got the chance to live and study in Spanish. We went on week long trail rides crossing the Mexican deserts. We camped out in the wilderness and drank from mountain streams. They had a wonderful childhood with much more varied experiences than they ever could have in the States and I enjoyed every minute of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo entertain myself professionally and to supplement my meager income, I did many things. I raised and sold horses and cattle and goats. I created a website to sell my horses that became one of the most important equine sites in the country at the time. I worked as a goat herder for a few months in the middle of nowhere, literally hundreds of miles away from civilization. Just me, my mule, rifle and the goats. (Think Brokeback Mountain, but without the gay love affair) I purchased a concession with the National Cellular provider and ran a few locations until I sold the business when it seemed to be taking up all my time. I bought and lived in a haunted \"Hacienda.\" I moved to Central Mexico and brought my brood mares and stud with me to continue breeding horses. I did some spelunking and amateur archaeology. I raised my children in an\u00a0environment where there was no difference between indoors and out. Transitions from indoor to out, yes, but no walls sealing them inside, no air conditioning. They had comfortable, wonderful childhoods with both of their parents at their sides for a fraction of what life costs in the U.S.A. I was freed to do what gave me satisfaction professionally while stile being able to be around my kids nearly 24/7 and integrating my work with their play and education. We moved one more time before they grew up. So they had a chance to live in different environments; mountains, desserts, jungles and coasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my children got older, they wanted more opportunity for social interaction with people their own age and especially for internet. (Which we didn\u0027t have in the jungle or on top of the mountain.) So we moved to a place with a larger population. This gave them what they wanted and gave me a chance to work again. I started teaching English in a local school and I had internet again. (It had been many years for me too.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey are in the U.S. now pursuing their own lives. I have had to adjust to not having them with me after being so very much involved in their lives. (Without a doubt, more involved than I would have been had I stayed in America.) I\u0027ve filled some of that free time I have now learning to be a better teacher. I also, as a result of now having internet, found the Twitch and Youtube program called \u003cstrong\u003e\"Critical Role.\"\u003c/strong\u003e It reminded me of the fun I had as a youth playing D\u0026amp;D. It even inspired me to download the free Basic Rules for fifth edition. It was such a simple, well written and designed game that I decided to incorporate it in my English classes. What stared as a way to motivate my students whose faces would just glaze over when I spoke of grammar and parts of speech, soon turned into two local games that I was DMing. One supposedly to help the students practice English and one purely in Spanish. I translated everything necessary, so they had their characters in both English and Spanish. But we ended up just playing in Spanish for the fun of it. Though they pepper their Spanish with many Mayan words.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I wanted a way to use the projector at school to create a virtual table top, because I didn\u0027t have access to miniatures or even all the dice required, I discovered Roll20. (We had all been using dice apps, except for d6\u0027s and one d12 that I still had for some reason)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCurrently\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eAfter a year of running two local games in Spanish and several months of uploading things to Roll20, I considered running a game online. But then I thought it would be much more fun to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eplay \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ein a game online, especially in English. I thought maybe I could recapture some of that golden magic from my youth. So I applied to play in many, many games that were listed in Roll20. And every time I did, I felt like I was at a job interview. I didn\u0027t like the feeling. Nor did I like the fact that even though I was an experienced player, no one would respond to my applications, so I eventually did post my own campaign and started running a game in English. Some of my players told me they were paying other people to DM for them in other campaigns. That made sense after I thought about it for a while. People have trouble finding a game on Roll20. I know I did. A DM and a group that will stick together for a long term campaign would have been something I would have been willing to pay for when I lived and worked in the U.S. Especially if I was unable to play the more traditional way. Being a good DM requires many hours of preparation and time online uploading and editing and creating, so it seemed fair to me when I considered doing the same as many others do and charging a small fee for my time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what probably has brought you to this page to read this rather long winded explanation. I decided to start a Patreon account so that I could dedicate more of my time to preparing and running D\u0026amp;D. And to give my current and future players a more immersive experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy Goals\u003c/h3\u003eYou might look at my paltry goals and think it unnecessary for me to even start a Patreon account. Compared to many other users of Patreon, you would seem to be right. My first goal is only 10 dollars per month. At this level I will be able to pay for a Pro or Plus account. That will multiply the amount of storage that I have on Roll 20 as well as allow me to offer my players features like Dynamic Lighting and Special Effects. As I rapidly approach the 100 MB limit on my account, this becomes more and more important. Still you might think that 10 dollars a month is nothing and that I should just pay for it. If I still lived in the U.S. I would do just that. But what many people in the States or Europe don\u0027t realize is how limited the economies of developing countries are. Here in Mexico, the average worker would have to work two full days just to gain those 10 dollars. A worker who earns the legal minimum wage here, which many don\u0027t even make that, would require three days to make those 10 dollars. The standard work week is 60 hours here. That\u0027s 10 hours a day, 6 days a week for only 3 or 4 dollars a day. I admit I make more teaching a 3 hour English class than many Mexicans earn in an entire day. But that doesn\u0027t mean I have the disposable income that most workers in 1st world countries enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal would be $200 per month. At that level I would be able to afford to purchase professional tokens and tile sets. Also, digital publications from Wizards of the Coast would be within my reach. A digital Monster Manual would make creating encounters much easier and allow me to provide more interesting and challenging encounters for my players. \u00a0This level basically represents 5 players who are enjoying their campaign and are all willing to support my efforts to provide content for Roll20 and to create opportunities for them to continue playing D\u0026amp;D. This would require the minimum of investment by players. When you consider how much most people are willing to pay for entertainment, this seems a very small sum. Many people enjoy going to the Cinema to watch new movies on the big screen, though this can be somewhat costly. Most would rather enjoy the movie with the company of someone they know, so now one must consider the price of two tickets. Perhaps $15. Perhaps more. Then the cost of gasoline or transport. Add to that a couple of soft drinks and some popcorn, now your up to what? $25 or $30 for a movie that last an hour and a half, maybe two. By becoming a $40 per month patron, you would be guarantied a position in an ongoing campaign that would provide you with many times the entertainment of a single movie for the same cost. At this level Patrons will receive a minimum of 4 hours of entertainment per week. Many times games run long, leading to 6-8 hour sessions. If you add it all up, Patrons can enjoy between 16 and 30 hours of D\u0026amp;D per month for less than the cost of one night out. Patrons at this level have access to any of the Races and Classes in the Players Handbook and the Sword Coast Adventurer\u0027s Guide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal would be $400 per month. This goal represents two groups of players enjoying long term campaigns. At this level I would finish the two campaigns I run in real life. (They will eventually finish on their own anyway, because each is run during class and everyone eventually graduates) I would also be able to give up my two week day classes that I teach and dedicate that time to creating more of my own tokens and maps, as well as preparing for game sessions. I would also be able to purchase better electronic equipment to make the sessions more dynamic and entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next and penultimate goal I have is to reach $600 per month. This level represents 3 permanent campaigns. At this point I would not be concerned about the possibility of the school where I work reducing my hours as has happened to other teachers. I would be able to dedicate 40 hours a week at this point to providing better and more entertaining content for my players, as well as creating and testing more homebrew content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal would be $800 per month. This would represent 4 long term campaigns running at the same time. I could completely dedicate myself to creating content at this point, not having to worry about teaching English.\u00a0"
