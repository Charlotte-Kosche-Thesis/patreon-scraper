    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does Paul Hanson do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0He plays the bassoon in ways not thought possible. Over the last 20 years, Paul has rewritten the rulebook and set new standards for what is possible on this most classical of woodwind instruments. What Paul Hanson does on bassoon is akin to what other innovators like guitarists Charlie Hunter, banjoist Bela Fleck and bassist Jaco Pastorius have done with their respective instruments. Like those musicians, Hanson has created a vibrant new, expansive vocabulary through a combination of virtuosity, vision and soul. Paul\u02bcs repertoire encompasses musical aspects of all modern styles of improvised music. Paul is also a very accomplished sax player with a background in jazz and funk styles: his credits run from Eddie Money (\"Take Me Home Tonight\" sax soloist) to Steve Smith of Journey, Boz Scaggs, The Temptations, Bela Fleck, Omar Sosa, and many more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003ePaul steps outside traditional bassoon boundaries with extensive improvisation, the bending of notes, and the use of amplification, effects processors and looping. Paul has extensive experience playing pop, jazz, funk, rock, classical and world music with artists like Bela Fleck, Cirque Du Soleil, Wayne Shorter, Medeski, Martin \u0026amp; Wood, Oakland EastBay Symphony, DAVKA and many others. Paul is also a teacher with extensive experience teaching bassoon, improvisation, theory. He has taught at Ithaca College School of Music, The Jazzschool and Oakland School For the Arts. Paul tours as a recitalist and clinician for Legere Reeds and Moosmann Bassoons.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Paul will use Patron\u0027s support:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e(Out of the third person now)-I love to compose bassoon-oriented music that is unique. I do this all the time at home. I also post videos that pertain to songs I am working on. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eShort term goals are to create 2 videos a month complete with my newly created music. These videos will feature tunes I have completed in a pre-production phase. There will always be an educational aspect to these videos-whether it be bassoon improvisation, writing techniques, or harmonic concepts. Long-term goals are to record finished albums with multiple personnel in the studio-such as my song-cycle commissioned for the 2015 Berkeley Jewish Music Festival entitled \"Homecoming\". I would like to document the building of this recording through video and audio clips.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eWe will also upload video content from time to time about what we are doing, what music we are working on and related items.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Paul\u00a0Hanson lived in Japan for four years as a performer with Cirque du Soleil. That life-changing experience inspired him to explore his Jewish roots through this new work, one of the first large-scale Jewish pieces ever written for bassoon. \u003cem\u003eCo-presented by the Contemporary Jewish\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eMuseum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eOne of the biggest realizations I made while living in Japan-a very homogeneous culture compared to the USA-was that everyone around me in Japan knew exactly where they came from. As I was of Ashkenaz Jewish bloodline and from a family steeped in leftist politics and socialist background-I felt like many others growing up in Berkeley, CA. But stepping out of that Bay Area culture and going to Japan made me think of my background in completely new ways. As I was in a klezmer band (The Klezmorim) like my dad before me-I did have some experience with Jewish music but being in Japan I really thought more about my roots. The song-cycle \"Homecoming\" is about that realization of my bloodline, the music that always seems to resonate with me and the modern times we live in.",
