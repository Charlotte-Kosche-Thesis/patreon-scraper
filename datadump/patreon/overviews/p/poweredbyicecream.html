    "summary": "Hello you chubby little bastards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Eric and I love food. \u00a0I love looking at it, researching it, talking about it, and most of all - Eating it. \u00a0I share my passion for food with the world through my Instagram, where I review all kinds of stuff - From potato chips to chocolate bars to ice cream to protein bars - I do it all. \u00a0Since I\u0027m limited to Instagram\u0027s 60 second time limit, I decided to deem these little snippets \"Fun Sized Reviews\"!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my following has grown, so has the number of reviews. \u00a0Now, I\u0027d love to say that my social media following is making me the big bucks but that\u0027s not just the case. \u00a0While I get a few free products here and there, the truth is that I spent a LOT of money on food. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why did I start this Patreon? \u00a0Well, I have people ask me all the time if I take donations. \u00a0I used to turn them down back when I was only doing a few reviews per week... \u00a0But now that I produce 3-5 per day, all of that cash spent on junk food adds up. \u00a0My wife and I recently had our first child and we\u0027re trying to budget things to the best of our ability, so we\u0027re trying to be a little bit smarter with our money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll cut to the chase. \u00a0I understand the main reason people like my reviews is so that they know what to spend the money on. \u00a0People are going to scoff at paying me for it, I\u0027m sure. \u00a0But I don\u0027t want to make a living off of this. \u00a0It\u0027s my hope that eventually PBIC will be breaking even and I can continue entertaining my followers without worrying about how much money I\u0027m spending. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I\u0027m asking is this: If you find me entertaining or if I\u0027ve brought a smile to your face, throw me $1. \u00a0$2 if you\u0027re feeling frivolous. \u00a0But it will add up and help me to continue to deliver all the fun stuff that I\u0027ve been providing for years. Don\u0027t want to help me out? \u00a0I\u0027m not mad at it. \u00a0I\u0027ll continue doing reviews because I love to do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e"
