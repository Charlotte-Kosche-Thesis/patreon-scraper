    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Phillip and I have been running a website about single player maps and mods for the Half-Life series of games since 2003.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\nOriginally, it was called PlanetPhillip.com but in 2015 I changed it to RunThinkShootLive.com.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n13 years is a long time to keep working on the same project and my motivation has waxed and waned over that time but it has never been higher than now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently, I teach English as a foreign language to adults and children.  It\u0027s freelance work, which has taken me many years to build up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, it also allows me to be flexible in my daily life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe site runs on donations and very small ads to pay for the few expense it has and I have been very lucky to have had a number of people to support me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Future\u003c/h2\u003e\nI want to take it to the next level and need your support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I just mentioned, I\u0027m freelance and that allows me to allocate my time, but I still need to pay the bills, put bread on the table etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have set multiple financial goals that would allow me to gradually transition from what I do now to spending more time on the site.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo be honest, I don\u0027t believe that I will every be able to make this a full-time gig, but even part-time would be amazing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Goals\u003c/h2\u003eI have set up a few financial goals.  They only tell some of the story though, because they only talk about the time.  It\u0027s what you do with the time that is important.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would spend the time updating the older posts, attempting to get more interviews with modders, especially with in-development mods, streaming more often, interacting more with my readers and of course, adding more content!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would make my new podcast \"What The Headcrab!\" a weekly show and use the items discussed to create more in-depth podcasts, previews or other type of content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would begin to create longer video reviews and create a Minute Mod for each and every new release on the site.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Rewards\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe rewards you get for different amounts pledged offer different things.  I have to admit that I can\u0027t think of many things to offer, so if you have any ideas, please let me know.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eJust Ask\u003c/h2\u003e\nThan you for taking the time to read this and if you have any questions, please don\u0027t hesitate to contact me."
