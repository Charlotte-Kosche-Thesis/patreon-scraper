    "summary": "HOLA!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you know me, you know I love making things. All sorts of things. I make music, paintings, recordings, poems, videos, videos of paintings, videos painting music, music videos painting on walls, friends, myself\u2026well, you get the point. I just love to create, experiment, and share. Sharing is probably my favorite part about creating...cutting all middle men out of the picture and connecting directly with YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Paula Bast. I\u0027m a handful. I\u0027m an artist, traveller, dreamer (big BIG dreamer), lover and  music maker. Family is my number one priority and love is pretty much the most important guiding light in my life. I LOVE getting together with other creative minds, collaborating, having long conversations in front of a fireplace with a hot drink in hand listening to great records, and cuddling with my buddy Netflix and my pillow after a long day of work. Is this relevant? Probably not. But hey, just in case you were curious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re just showing up here for the first time\u2026me too...kinda! So here\u0027s whats up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want you to have more art. But I need your support to be able to create it. I need your help, I need you you youuu...your TRUE patronage if I am going to take the plunge and have enough money to continue to create and share my art work with you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can allocate resources to the creation of quality content that expresses more dimensions of my art with you. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to create appealing videos to share my music and art with! I want to collaborate with other creatives who can inject their beautiful creativity into my own projects.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m already busy writing, recording, and painting. And that is exactly what I want to be doing!\u00a0All day. Every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as an artist, I haven\u0027t found it to be so easy.\u00a0 There\u0027s one tiny -yet humongously annoying- barrier that gets in the way of me doing this full-time, and that is: making enough money to pay the bills (-including them good ol\u0027 student loans-), and still have enough left over to allocate for the creation of my art, everything from buying art supplies - to even scratching the surface of all production costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, how can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy supporting me through Patreon, you are helping me produce more content and allowing me to create and work on my art on a deeper level. \u003cem\u003eYou help me to continue investing in the creation of MORE MUSIC and MORE ART\u003c/em\u003e. I will still be working my day job to pay for all my living expenses, but your patronage will be SOLELY for the creation of new music and their videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also means, you and I are more connected. Which sounds pretty amazing.\u00a0I want you to have access to my art, to share with me the process of creation, to see the final results, and the struggles. To come in this journey with me, to be a part of it in whatever form you wish. I find this platform an ideal one in which we can share just that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your regular support and sponsorship I can devote more energy to creating a truly special experience for those who wish to participate. I have big ideas for future projects; more collabs, a full length album of my original music, and handmade artwork to go with it - but I can\u2019t do it all on my own. A small donation from you would go a long way to helping me gather equipment, materials, hire other creatives, maintain production as high quality as possible, and allow me to create even more art and entertainment for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you click the \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button, you can select how much you want to pledge per CREATION (Song + Official Video). You\u0027ll be charged automatically, and can adjust or cancel your pledge at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, you help me live and create, and in return I will give you good stuff - different stuff depending on your pledge level. Stuff (rewards, goodies, etc.) will get mailed (either via email or the slower way) after credit cards have been processed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA great thing about being a patron is that you get to decide on your pledge level every single creation if you want to change it. Let\u0027s say you pledge $10 for this song+video, but really want other goodies on the next creation - no problem. There is a large \"edit your patronage\" button right at the top left of the screen once you\u0027re one of my Patrons, and you can change your level every single time if you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegardless of you becoming a patron or not my art will ALWAYS be available to you through my website, instagram, youtube, etc. You are very important to me and my art, so I thank you for listening, sharing and supporting me! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMIL GRACIAS!!\u003cbr\u003eBesos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaula Bast\u003cbr\u003e"

I believe that in order for artists to survive and create, their audiences need to step up and directly support them. \u2028My favorite thing about art is how it is never really about us, it is a channel for connection, to oneself and others. It is infinitely inspiring and a universe in its own. If you\u0027d like to support me, this is a wonderful place to do it. Much love!",

     "description": "Production costs when it comes to both, the music and the videos, add up quickly. Musicians, arrangements, studio time, engineers, directors, producers, crew. It all sums up like crazy! And everyone puts in so much work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been lucky. Most of the music I have lined up to share with you in the near future has been through incredible collaborations, with outstanding people! I really can\u0027t wait to share it. But I want to do justice to their work accompanying it with a visual story line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this amount we can be sure to share high quality music and video with you for each of these existing creations! We have many ideas we want to bring to life. And I hope to do so in the near future. Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e",
