    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for supporting Proof of Life! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve been doing this weekly podcast consistently since 17 August 2015. It began under the title \u003cem\u003eKatie in \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eFinland\u003c/em\u003e and focused on our life as expats while Katie went to graduate school. After 88 episodes we changed the title to \u003cem\u003eProof of Life\u003c/em\u003e, partially because the focus wasn\u2019t all-Finland all the time. Starting on 9 April 2017, we consider that 32 episode run Season 2 of the same podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the start of Season 3, the show has evolved into an ongoing conversation about culture, creativity, and critical thinking. That includes references to pop culture, understanding the cultural context required to live abroad, and the influences that culture can have on education and vice-versa. Season 3 officially began on 19 November 2017, to coincide with our jump to Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA new episode every Sunday! Each episode is between 50 and 60 minutes long. All patrons can download the MP3 and participate in the community. Higher levels of patronage allow access to bonus content, including the occasional aftershow (when we run out of time in the regular episode, but keep the conversation going) and at least one monthly bonus episode available exclusively on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll also get our thanks, no matter what amount you pledge! Your patronage lets us know that this is worth doing, above and beyond the fun we have doing it. At higher levels, you\u2019ll get a direct thank you in the show notes, and on the closing title card of the YouTube version of the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often You\u2019re Charged\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage is per month, not per episode.\u00a0Patreon will charge you on the 1st of each calendar month at midnight Pacific time. We will post a reminder when the final episode of the month goes live. It may take up to 72 hours for the payment to process, and Patreon will send you an email to let you know if your payment has been accepted or declined. We (Katie \u0026amp; Berin) never see your payment information \u2014 you pay Patreon, and Patreon pays us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Patronage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe did this show every week, without missing an episode, for over two years without trying to monetize it. There\u2019s no cost associated with doing this, other than our time. If you want to listen for free, you can still subscribe and listen on YouTube. So it\u2019s understandable if the reasons why we\u2019re asking for patronage now aren\u2019t clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we want is to do it better. Doing it for fun has meant that we can be sloppy. When people are making donations, we have a greater sense of obligation. The topics that we discuss often tie directly into Katie\u2019s academic research, and the things Berin writes about in \u003cem\u003eHUBRIS: The Journal of Cultural Horror\u003c/em\u003e. The podcast is not professional-adjacent, so we want to up our game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd honestly, we can always use a little extra money. We\u2019re middle-aged people who live like graduate students because Katie is a grad student and Berin supports the household as a writer. Every bit helps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Katie and Berin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKatie is a graduate student. Berin is a writer. We both have hectic schedules, and finding time to just have a cup of coffee together can be difficult. So once a week with sit down in front of a live mic to talk about what we\u0027re up to, how we\u0027re doing, and what\u0027s on our minds. This isn\u0027t a podcast. It\u2019s proof of life.\u003cbr\u003e"
