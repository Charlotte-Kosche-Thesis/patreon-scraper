Through their own voices and of those close to them,\u00a0the film brings forth the various emotional, psychological, physical and social ups and\u00a0downs our protagonists face in this process. Intimate conversations with our subjects will\u00a0make attempts to glimpse and begin to understand the meanings of being transsexual and\u00a0what it means to belong to any gender. Through their lives, the film will attempt to unravel, what it means to be male, female or transgender beyond the biological sex of a person, in\u00a0modern day India.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://goo.gl/photos/qGG74iquHYVLmvtZ7\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eTransgender is an umbrella term used to define various kinds of gender behaviour that\u00a0goes against the heteronormative male-female binaries prevalent in most patriarchal\u00a0societies like India.\u003cbr\u003eQueer, drag, cross\u00addressing may all be included in this term. The film\u00a0however focuses solely on the experiences of individuals assigned as female on birth but\u00a0who identify and express themselves as male. Several of the subjects of the film have opted\u00a0for sexual reassignment surgery. In a society like India where socially defined gender roles\u00a0and gender rules are culturally defined and enforced at every level, such a transformation\u00a0unravels not merely at an individual level. When one is perceived as one gender in society\u00a0and then decides to switch genders and hence gender roles, it would make for great insight\u00a0into how much of gender is socially constructed and what role biology plays in any kind of\u00a0gender performance. How do these individuals, who biologically and more importantly socially, were once assigned the category of women \u00ad how do they create and express their\u00a0maleness? What does the ideal male body look like to them as they literally construct their\u00a0physical, gendered appearance? There is also an interesting power dynamic at play here, as\u00a0in a patriarchal society, men are privileged over women. How does the power dynamic for these subjects change in their lives and in the way they treat men and women around them,\u00a0as they cross over from one gender to another?\u003cbr\u003e The other insightful and fascinating aspect the documentary will explore is the transgender\u00a0individual negotiating the gender dynamics of their personal and social lives. The process\u00a0of becoming a man doesn\u0027t obviously just involve changing their bodies and outward\u00a0appearance, but redefining how society perceives and accepts their transformation. Their\u00a0families, relatives, friends and colleagues respond to their transformation in various ways.\u003cbr\u003eIn India queer, LGBT and transgenders are stigmatized against greatly as they break away\u00a0from the norm. How do the films subjects then negotiate and deal with the varied reactions\u00a0to their gradual transformations? This will form another major theme in the film.\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, the film will attempt to dispel the myths and break down the stigma that\u00a0exists around female to male transgenders. Through a rare empathetic glimpse into this undeniable part of the broad spectrum of human gender and sexuality, the film will\u00a0attempt to give voice and visibility to the transgender community.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eBesides the protagonists, the film will also meet and interview a psychologist, an endocrinologist, a surgeon, a sociologist and members of Sampoorna \u00ad an organisation working for the rights of female\u00adto\u00admale transgenders in India. It will also feature the subjects\u2019 family members interacting with the subject.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
