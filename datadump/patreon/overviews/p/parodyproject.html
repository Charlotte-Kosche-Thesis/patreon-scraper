I came up with the idea for Parody Project as a way to get through this murky political jungle we find ourselves in - by laughing at it and helping many of you to do the same. Let me warn you though, so you don\u0027t waste your time reading this unnecessarily: If you\u0027re republican and/or conservative you will absolutely hate our posts and it will only aggravate you, so just don\u0027t do that to yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf your\u0027e still reading and if you\u0027ve looked at our posts and watched a few of our videos, you\u0027ll already know that there\u0027s a ton of time that goes into these little productions with the research, the lyric writing, the music arrangements, the practicing, the recording and mixing, the costuming, the lighting, the shooting, the editing and then the real work with all the promotions online. We would love to keep making these for you all, and of course there\u0027s that pesky little issue of being able to eat and pay rent - So join the Parody Project team and help keep these parodies coming! I just takes $1 from you to keep us going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you join the team, you\u0027ll get some awesome rewards and you\u0027ll be in communication with us on what songs and videos we should be producing, which versions you like best and you\u0027ll always be the first to see and share the final product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e____________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I Join the Parody Project Team?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can become a Patron by clicking the BECOME A PATRON button on the right hand side of the page under the banner image. Too easy, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the catch?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcellent question, because we all know there\u0027s always a catch! Well, not this time. You don\u0027t have to do anything. If you want you can make suggestions, post accolades, or even be critical, it\u0027s entirely up to you. You can also do nothing and you\u0027ll still be equally appreciated as a valued patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos do you release a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe release one to three videos per week, and we plan to increase our production as our funding increases and we can, hopefully, hire some help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow hard is it to unsubscribe if I change my mind?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my favorite question because there\u0027s nothing I hate more than sites that make you jump through hoops to get away from them. Not here! On your own page click the three little bars in the far right upper corner of the page and then click on \"Your Pledges.\" From there you can select any of your Patronages (Pledges) and edit them, update them and even delete them very easily.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Questions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can email me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:dcaron@doncaron.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:dcaron@doncaron.com\"\u003eby clicking here\u003c/a\u003e and we\u0027ll get right back to you!\u003cbr\u003e"
