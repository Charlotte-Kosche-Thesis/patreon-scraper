    "summary": "First of all, I just want to say thank you for being here and for your interest on our church family. We are Praise Community Fellowship and we are a small church in Riverside, CA that has been so blessed in mighty ways. Most recently is the idea to create a Facebook Group called\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/791028137726885/\"\u003ePraise Community Fellowship Service\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Each Sunday at 11am we go Live on Facebook and stream our whole church service, the prayers, the music and the message. This allows friends all over the nation to tune in and be a part of our little church service. Some of our friends have mentioned to us that they didn\u0027t have a church home and so now they call our live service their church home. I can\u0027t even begin to tell you how much that humbles and blesses me. Some of our friends have also asked us if there is a way that they could give a donation to the church or a tithe offering to the Lord through our Praise Service. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that is why I feel the Lord has lead me here, to this Patreon page. Your gift to us for any amount will be greatly appreciated and will go to help support our ministry of Praise, our Sunday Live Stream, and \n10% of your tax deductible gift goes towards our Missions. They are: \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.compassion.com/\"\u003eCompassion International\u200e\u003c/a\u003e\" , \"\u003ca href=\"https://www2.gideons.org/\"\u003eGideons International\u003c/a\u003e\", and \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.maf.org/\"\u003eMission Aviation Fellowship\u003c/a\u003e\"  \u00a0 You will receive a statement from us at the end of each year for tax purposes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack when I had Bible Studies in my home for some 7 years, and then a church home for another 7, we used to never ask for an offering because we didn\u0027t want anyone to feel any pressure. And so during the week my wife or I would find money hidden in our dishes, hidden in our sofas, or somewhere in our kitchen. We\u0027d just smile at that. But I realized that sometimes God\u0027s people are going to want to give a gift to Him. So we made a way. That\u0027s what\u0027s at the heart of this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ must always be free. So please know that we love you the same no matter who is moved or not moved to give. We just want to enable those whom the Lord has moved on their hearts to give a gift to Him, to be able to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMay God faithfully bless and keep you.\u003cbr\u003e"

Gaming has been a great way for me to spend time with my two sons who have always consistently been better than me in every game. I\u0027m the little engine that could with them. Some of our favorites have been Halo, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and World of Warcraft. Something I told them I would never play because I\u0027m an adult with a real life, but I broke down two years ago and now I have 13 Level 90\u0027s. I guess I don\u0027t really know how to do things in a small way, that\u0027s why after 3 short months I\u0027ve already found myself sitting amongst you all here at Star Citizen AA. Don\u0027t judge, and where\u0027s the doughnuts?",
