    "summary": "Welcome, Pokebattler.com fans! You are some of the most hardcore Pokemon Go players in the world and I know you appreciate the extreme efforts we put into making this website for you to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePokebattler.com has been a work of love, with hundreds of hours of development work to build the best Pokemon Go gym and raid combat simulator in the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePokebattler.com is currently running an experiment. Removing all ads for users and replacing with links to this page. I see you clicked it! Thanks for that.\u00a0 \u00a0Read on to see why you should support us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFounder and CEO Ryan Barker\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRyan Barker has been\u00a0playing video games and writing software since he was 10 years old.\u00a0 He started on a TI-99/4A and have moved on to building major websites professionally. He started this site as a hobby to learn some new technologies and to have a bit of fun but it has turned into so much more than that for him and my many fans around the world. Ryan loves building this site. He loves knowing he has helped hundreds of thousands of people optimize their Pokemon Go playing with this site he built mostly by himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e CMO\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eShelley Barker\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShelley Barker is married to Ryan Barker. She initially had no idea what he was talking about when he mentioned starting this website. But eventually, she figured it out and has been helping any way she can. With zero programming skills and a background in advertising, she has helped build and manage the research articles section of Pokebattler, create and update countless infographics, create and narrate YouTube videos and manage branding and other social channels. She also recently revamped the help menu so that is (hopefully) makes more sense.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting Pokebattler.com\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo why should you support us? We have some big plans for what we want to do with this site. The costs are creeping up each month as we start to generate more and more traffic. \u00a0The projected costs for the features we want to add is even higher so the more support we have, the more we can give you. We\u0027d\u00a0also love to eventually support some of the article writers and others who have helped out along the way.\u00a0 Ads have been removed from the site and Patreon is our only source of revenue at this time. Your donations are all that keep the site running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you get for your support? So far: more Pokemon in your Pokebox. Higher quality simulations for your custom Pokebox rankings. Access to the beta site. Special advice\u00a0spreadsheets.\u00a0 A warm fuzzy feeling knowing you supported a husband and wife duo who build this site just for people like you. And we plan to continue coming up with more premium features in the future. Have a different idea of what you want to see us offer? Send us a message at admin@pokebattler.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow What?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have 2 options\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDecide it\u0027s worth it to donate to keep Pokebattler ad free. Simply sign up for Patreon using the same email address you signed up for Pokebattler with, and pick your subscription level. You will then be able to log in using Patreon and receive your benefits.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDecide its not worth it. In this case, still create a Patreon account with the same email address as you signed up for Pokebattler. Then log out of Pokebattler and log in with the Patreon log in option.\u00a0 You will receive your extra Pokebox space.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAfter you have logged in one time with Patreon, you may then resume logging in your old way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and enjoy Pokebattler!\u003cbr\u003e"
