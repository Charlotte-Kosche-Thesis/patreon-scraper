Being transgender is tough enough and trying to live and write in a small town is even more difficult.  I don\u0027t cam or do stuff for attention because that is not my style.  Hard work, tenacity, dedication, and repetition is my style.  I succeed where others fail because I will not quit and have long-term goals.\u003cbr\u003eI give to various trans causes but delayed setting up a Patreon account for some time because it is not me.  I am not the person who sets up an account just to have people give me money.  \u003cbr\u003eNext year I have some goals which are releasing a few novels under my non-erotic pen name.  \u003cbr\u003eIn order to do so I need to find a decent and affordable editor.  It is difficult enough dealing with the transphobia and homophobia found in the erotic writing community. \u003cbr\u003eIt is more difficult finding an editor and photos because people do not want to work with you because you are trans.  Real talk people.  Sorry.\u003cbr\u003eRewards will be setup later.  I am testing some things so there may be rewards here or on a different Patreon depending on how things go.\u003cbr\u003eI set the goal high because I have no idea what to set as a goal.  I don\u0027t expect to hit that goal.  I am just happy to be here.\u003cbr\u003eHere is the fun cult author stuff. \u00a0I really want to take some of my favorite characters and go big with them like Vanita the Transsexual Vampire and the Futanari Universe. \u00a0Both are better suited to being mangas or even bigger. \u00a0That will happen with time because they are quite unique ideas. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMost of my best ideas are small niche stuff hence the cult author portion.\u003cbr\u003eOnce I get the blog stuff down I will figure out some sort of reward schedule.\u003cbr\u003eTake this as NSFW because I write erotica but no nudes so don\u0027t ask.\u003cbr\u003eTime to feed my critters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
