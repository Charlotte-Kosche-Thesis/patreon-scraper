In January of 2017, we set sail for Cuba. Early one morning as the high rises of Havana came into view, we knew that we had accomplished the first part of our goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4568/25163156898_cc7fb4544f_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaking Money While We Cruise\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur next goal was to figure out how to make money while cruising so that we could continue to financially support our adventures. After arriving in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in March of 2017, we quickly proved to ourselves (out of necessity) that this goal was within our reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next ten months, we managed to cultivate a reputation for ourselves and worked non-stop. Jordan built five rudders from scratch, a swim deck extension for a 60ft motor yacht, and started writing for Cruising World on the side; Desiree became the go-to seamstress for cruisers and did freelance social-media and photography work. On top of that we were able to pay for our dock rent in exchange for boat maintenance and sewing work. All in all it was a very successful ten months!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4600/38148565585_540969d11e_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTelling Our Story\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re ecstatic and relieved that we\u2019ve proven to ourselves that we can sustainably continue to sail around the world at this pace with our current skill sets, but we also want to tell our story. So, we decided to bust our butts, filming in our free time and editing into the wee hours of the night to bring you Season 2 of Project Atticus! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile making Season 2, we realized three things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are SO much \u003cstrong\u003emore passionate\u003c/strong\u003e about storytelling, sharing our perspective about the places we visit, and highlighting the culture, history, and wildlife of each unique place through our videos than we are about fiberglass and canvas.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFilming, editing, and releasing one feature episode per week is a \u003cstrong\u003eFULL-TIME job\u003c/strong\u003e in an of itself, and often takes more time and energy than many of our boating gigs!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u2019s \u003cstrong\u003eimpossible\u003c/strong\u003e for us to continue to release high quality, consistent videos for our entire journey \u003cstrong\u003ewithout your help\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, we decided to take your advice, and get on Patreon! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE FIVE HUNDO CHALLENGE ($500 per episode)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first goal on Patreon is the FIVE HUNDO challenge.

If we can earn $500 per episode, we can sail our hearts out and continue to make videos on this minimal budget. However, we might have to put Project Atticus on hold along the way to be able to financially tackle major boat maintenance costs associated with circumnavigation or any unforeseen health/boat/or video-gear emergencies. We\u2019d also like to start financially planning for a boat family! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIdeally, we\u2019d like to continue filming through these challenges.\u003c/strong\u003e In fact, we\u2019d love to make Project Atticus our \u003cstrong\u003efull-time, LONG-TERM career.\u003c/strong\u003e We want to do this for the next ten years (or more!)! Therefore, anything we earn on Patreon after $500 per episode will be invested in the following 3 funds: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Boat Fund \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAtticus is fully equipped with brand-new (for the most part) gear necessary for circumnavigation thanks to all of the hard work we put into her refit in Key West. However, subjecting a sailboat to circumnavigation puts a lot of stress on her and will require constant maintenance and repairs, as well as eventually an all-out overhaul once all of her elements start to reach their life-span (sails, rigging, chainplates, etc.). So we\u2019d like to start a boat fund to be able to prepare for and anticipate the financial setbacks associated with maintaining Atticus through circumnavigation and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Video Fund \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as our camera, editing, and data storage capabilities right now, we have a pretty basic, bootstrapped package. However, if any of our current gear gets stolen or damaged along the way, we don\u2019t have any redundancies in our budget. If we can start to earn more than $500/episode, we can not only begin to upgrade some of our camera and editing gear to improve the quality of our videos, we can also add redundancies in our gear so that nothing can stop us from filming in our tracks. We can also begin to streamline our video production process with better tools. This might mean hiring a virtual assistant, or hiring a web developer to help us with our content creation process. Bottom line, we will constantly invest your contribution back into Project Atticus so that we can continue to create awesome content for as long as we possibly can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Lifestyle Fund \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love living on a budget. We probably always will. But, we would love to be able to put a little bit aside to be able to handle any health emergencies we encounter along the way. We also want to have a BOAT BABY sometime in the next couple of years! We\u2019d love to take you with us as we struggle through all of the challenges of raising a kid on a 30 foot boat! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO LET\u2019S DO THIS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWe\u0027ll be releasing 4 episodes per month!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to become your favorite youtube channel, and we\u0027ll do whatever it takes to get there!
