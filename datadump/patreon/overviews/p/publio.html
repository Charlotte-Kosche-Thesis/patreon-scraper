    "summary": "Hi everyone, and thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve been uploading videos weekly on Youtube. I mostly record solo acoustic guitar music, but I love recording different styles of music, and come up with unusual ways of performing them, using objects, a capella arrangements, weird instruments... \u00a0I do it because I love it, and I have so much fun creating it! And the fact that day by day more and more people are watching it/enjoying it/sharing it, really brings me energy to keep fighting to be able to do it. But, being realistic, I don\u0027t even get close to make living from this... it takes a lot of time and effort to take care of a weekly video. I have to compose it, arrange it, practice it hard, learn how to perform it fluently and, finally, record it (it always takes a long while to get a good take).\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003eI joined Patreon because I want to keep creating and sharing music with the world for as long as possible. By becoming my patron through this great platform, you would be helping be improve the quality of my material. I could hire professional video shooters, update my recording gear to improve the sound quality/record in professional studios, and I would definitely have more time to make real all the new ideas that I come up with. You would also gain access to my Patron only stream, where I will upload videos only viewable by patrons!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks everybody who\u0027s been following me, supporting me, sharing me, etc. I\u0027m looking forward to spend more and more time creating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublio\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
