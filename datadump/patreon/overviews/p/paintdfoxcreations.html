    "summary": "Hey there! Thanks for stopping by our Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what we\u0027re all about...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaint\u0027d Fox Creations was founded\n way back on the 14th of May, 2012 (on a Monday, no less) and began with one very simple goal in mind, which was to make \ndesigns that no one had ever seen the likes of before.\u003cbr\u003eDesigns that \nwe\u0027re fun, original, clever and creative. And super awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd we make \u0027em in the only program we know how to use... MSPaint!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nSince that day, we\u0027ve created nearly thirty awesome designs, launched a website, uploaded multiple step-by-step videos and even attended conventions, like Comic-Con and Supanova!\u003cbr\u003eBut why do we keep using MSPaint you ask? \u0027Cos why not!\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s kinda like a tradition now. Trying to get the best possible result out of a program no one would ever think could do it. MSPaint requires real dedication and \ntime and the results completely speak for themselves. Everything you see of ours wherever it may be, from Facebook to YouTube, our website and beyond, was all made pixel by pixel in MSPaint!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where do you come in?\u003cbr\u003eWell, we\u0027ve been active on Facebook for over two years now and our LIKE counter shows over five thousand people like our stuff and follow us. Now we\u0027re hoping, through Patreon, some of those people, like you reading this, would like to go that itty bitty bit further and support our efforts some more.\u003cbr\u003eWith even the simplest of donations, say a single dollar per design (*ahem* not turning away folks who want to donate a few million, of course...) from any number of our thousands of fans, we could put those funds towards restructuring our production model.\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, we have our gear printed through a third party manufacturer and distributed through another. It\u0027s a little costly and not entirely ideal, but it\u0027s worked so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we\u0027re gonna go right out and buy our own printing equipment and handle all distributions, eliminating the middle men. This would allow us to drop the cost on all our products and reach a much larger audience!\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s actually it. We just want to make things cheaper for you and we wanna continue being able to make them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all comes down to you. You have the power to provide whatever amount you want.\u003cbr\u003eJust know that if you do decide to become our Patrons, you\u0027ll be supporting some dedicated, creative, crazy artists and helping to realize the dream they\u0027ve been working SO long and hard for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, there\u0027s a bunch of cool rewards and stuff in it for you too, so y\u0027know... there\u0027s that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what you do, thanks for stopping by, thanks for reading and thanks for taking the time!\u003cbr\u003e"
