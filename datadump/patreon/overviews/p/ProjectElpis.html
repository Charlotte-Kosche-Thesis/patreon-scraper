Everything that is done in the game is player driven from civil wars, bases on planets, manipulation of the economy, etc. You have full control over your characters pathway and history in the game. Can you achieve what you desire or will you crumble and fall? It\u0027s up to you to decide.The only thing that is certain is that it will be up to you to decide your fate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTHE STORY\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe curtain rises and five races take the stage. Choose your species and set your fate in motion. The origins of these races is written, their foundation has been lain, but where they go from here is up to you. As you and your crew develop your ship, negotiate with others, and build your society, the story will follow. Your character will be written into the game and the history of the universe. Follow the doings of your fellow explorers in our professionally written novel and see how the changes play out that you started in our integrated online metagame.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTHE RACES\u003c/h3\u003e\nChoose your race carefully as it will be your primary alliance in space. Will your race reign triumphant, or be beaten into submission? Will your people control the economy or eek by on next to nothing? Each race has its own particular strengths and weaknesses. Will you be a Davul warrior or a swift Zurna? Will you master the sciences as an Udu or organic engineering as a Santoor? Or will you stick with the familiar and be a well-rounded human? Oh, and be on the lookout for the Unknown. More races may still await.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBut wait.. there\u0027s more..\u003c/h3\u003eWe strive to put in systems into the game that encourages role playing over \"winning\". Sometimes, some of the best stories are when characters tragically fail. So to that end, this game will be in constant development with new systems and new ideas (provided by the player base as a whole) to help bring about said role play potential in people. We also have a strict \"Hands Off\" policy to keep staff members from making all powerful characters. Also to make sure that the plotlines created are player made, not staff made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is the \"Hands Off\" policy?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn short, the Hands off policy means that we will not interfere with player run plot lines, but instead make sure that their plans can be realized if they are smart enough. The policy also states that we do not put our biases into the game events (even if we want to).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan you expand on that please?\u003c/h3\u003e\nSure. The policy is how I make sure that the staff here at 5th Wall Gaming (and myself) don\u0027t go ego tripping in the game and make changes to it the players don\u0027t want. We do this by only designing systems in the game and not plot lines. Now, that isn\u0027t to say we don\u0027t have seeds out there for various plot lines we would like to spring up, just that ultimately, it\u0027s up to the players themselves to decide if they want to follow that thread or not. By doing so, the power of where this goes is in the players hands. Us staff are simply along for the ride keeping the motor running in the car. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOk. So what are the details about the policy?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n1. Create a living, breathing history of the game generated by players themselves.\n\u003cbr\u003e2. Keep developing new systems that the players want (and that are fair).\n\u003cbr\u003e3. Do not have any kind of \"Pay to Win\" in the game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNo pay to win?\u003c/h3\u003e\nNope. None at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo how do you make money at this?\u003c/h3\u003e\nThrough the generous \n\u003ca href=\"http://mkt.com/5th-wall-gaming/donation\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edonations\u003c/a\u003e of our players and Patreons. We will be adding in features to the game that people who donate will be able to show off (including a leaderboard of the highest supporters), but we will never, EVER give any kind of in-game advantage to someone who gives us money over someone who doesn\u0027t. The money that comes in\u00a0will help fund the cost of the server and new code that is needed for the game. Also, since we consider ourselves a community, the funds also go towards servers for other games like Starbound, Rust, SS13, etc. (when donations get high enough that is). We also have T-Shirts planned and various other things in the works. So don\u0027t worry about us. We make enough to keep this thing going.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCool. So I have an idea for the game.\u003c/h3\u003e\nFantastic. Without people telling us what they want to do, how can we make sure we are making a game people want to play? Send your idea to us\u00a0and we will get back to you ASAP. No.. Seriously. We will. Even if we don\u0027t like the idea, we will contact you and explain why and perhaps together, we can figure out a way to make it work in the game. That\u0027s the GM \"Hands off\" policy at work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso note that I have LOTS of ideas for this game. If you want to see what I have in store (and when about they are going to come out), then check this out here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1430754\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1430754\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh.. and here is the hashtag.. #ProjectElpisGame because everything needs a hashtag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003c/h3\u003eAfter getting run over by a bus in 2007 (Yes, I\u0027m serious), I have been homebound for most of the time after. I don\u0027t get out much and when I do, it\u0027s very hard to stay standing for long periods of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has made it impossible to get work besides the occasional contract that comes in. Disability covers most of my living expenses and if I limit myself to rice, potatoes and the occasional (once a month or 2) pizza, I can make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis game is an expense for me and while it\u0027s something I can handle (barely), it\u0027s something I love doing. It\u0027s my passion. I highly suspect that this will be what I am remembered for (at least I hope so) when I pass away eventually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the money I put into this game is difficult mentally when I\u0027d really like to get a burger somewhere or take a short trip out of the house, but I can\u0027t afford the transportation. So the money given here helps me pay for the game itself and helps me have a better life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, I\u0027d like to be able to say to someone, \"I make my living running a game\", but for right now, it doesn\u0027t look feasible. Yeah, I could create a Pay to Win or some such, but I despise those types of games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I am asking is for people to donate what they can and help out running this thing. Because it\u0027s really for all the players who play it. Not for me. Most of the goals is just me putting money back into the game and I will be doing that. Just getting perhaps a Jimmy Johns order as well once a month would be nice as well. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t like any of the reward levels?\u003c/h3\u003eTo help update the donation levels, I am giving away a free item in the game if you pledge $10 or more monthly. You will receive the item when your payment clears. This is in levels, so for a $20 donation, you get 2 items. $30 donation, 3 items. However, you do not get 3 items every month for a $30 donation. You just get to keep said items another month. So 5 months down the line, you won\u0027t have 15 items. Just 3.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese items is purely cosmetic and doesn\u0027t influence the gameplay at all. So if you want a named sword, cool, but it will have no real stats (though if you make a sword in the game, I can name that and describe it how you want in the game for your item).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
