You can watch the video to find out all the relevant information about what I do and the awesomeness of becoming one of my Patreons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eI started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.phantom6productions.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhantom6Productions\u003c/a\u003e to create horror films, paranormal documentaries and create videos that mess with your mind. I have always had a big fascination with horror and the history of haunted locations and other paranormal experiences, so, I want to create videos to tell horror stories to my viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGCLHkMybKLCYpWFT9_-qtA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e if you want to see more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I\u0027m creating, then, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here and please consider subscribing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first, when I started this in 2010, I filmed many other projects and events (i.e. weddings, commercials, training videos, music videos, live events, etc) and I never thought that horror could make me money...so, I have been doing it as a hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to now...and I realized that it CAN be my career making horror films and paranormal documentaries. I\u0027m hoping that with your support on this website, I can turn my dreams into a reality and turn my hobby into a full time career and bring you awesome videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho is Rosie??\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy very first short horror film that I directed and edited called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERjU94y8gYA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eContract - Short Horror Film\u003c/a\u003e, starred a little girl who played a little demon girl that claimed souls to fulfill contracts. For whatever reason, I started calling the character Rosie and I decided to base my logo and branding off this little demon girl. She is mischievous and likes to make people suffer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGoals \u0026amp; Projects in Mind...\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first big project I\u0027m starting is a Haunted Places in Austin Documentary. The funding from you awesome patrons will go into funding this project. As it expands, I hope to cover all of Texas and eventually nationwide. Maybe even....THE WORLD!! (insert evil laugh here)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have big plans as well. Between investigating the paranormal and documenting the history of these spooky places, I would also like to fund horror films....whether it be short films or even feature films. This means paying for actors, crew, FOOD (The most important) and other production expenses that always seem to pop up out of nowhere. (I\u0027m only one guy and I realized I can\u0027t run the entire production myself)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to create a Horror Makeup and SFX series to help people get those awesome looks they hope to achieve on Halloween.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I hope to have my own studio and production crew someday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat I will do with your money...\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have my \"Boring adult job\" sitting in an office and I have Phantom6Productions. By supporting me on Patreon, you will give me the opportunity to focus more on horror and paranormal videos and eventually leave the full time office job world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough YouTube pays a little and I get some paid film projects here and there, it is not really close to sustaining myself. So, by pledging to my Patreon, you will help me do better and more work, for free, for you. This money will help buy more equipment, pay other production costs, and reinvest into these videos for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA Final Note...\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, I want to be able to have enough funding to leave my full time job one day\u00a0and to create horror and paranormal videos full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in these projects and would like to support me in this adventure, please consider signing up for a pledge from the selection on the right. The rewards are fun and your help with this is greatly appreciate!\u003cbr\u003e"
