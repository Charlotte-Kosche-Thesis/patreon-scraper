Making it a personal mission to leave my world more informed, more entertained and a lot more beautiful. I have done this free of charge... and will continue to not charge for a great deal of my work and post. The idea of taxing art, (which is not usually made with a monetary value in mind but instead from a need to create) is not one that I honestly know how to embrace. Over the years I have had many people ask \"how can I contribute\", \"can I buy prints\" and when I broke my gear I had people sending me checks and even gear on loan to keep my work from taking a hiatus! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt has paid my rent, and sent me around the world and I am one of the few lucky ones that makes a real living doing what I do... but, that also means that most of the time I am not choosing my clients or projects but they are choosing me. I have many book ideas and galleries in my head, that I want to do, but my main work load always seems to be spent with a clients vision and a lot less of mine. Which (dont get me wrong) is still a blessing... it\u0027s still a fan appreciating my work and paying me to do my art. And, it is still exciting and fun... but it isn\u0027t all I want to be doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon will help me build sets, travel more and work on projects that I want to do and help me get some of these concepts out of my head and into the world for you all to see!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I am moving a lot of work \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eExclusively\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e here.

He has studied photography and the arts since 7th grade (1995), and furthered his education in Tulsa, OK in a Graphic Design Program at Tulsa Technology Center (Lemley Campus). There he studied under Paul King learning how to Illustrate and Edit using Adobe Creative Suites in the pursuit of a job in Comic Book Illustration.\u003cbr\u003eIn November of 2001, he moved to Dallas Texas (where he currently resides) in hopes of finding better options for employment. His first job in Dallas was selling \"Flash Art\" to tattoo shops that he had drawn himself and selling perfume door to door and out of his car at local markets and car washes. In 2005 Phoenix took a job as a General Manager at a local Club called \"Spike\" in Mockingbird Station, in the upscale shopping district of the city. While working this job, he practiced his art on the side as a freelance artist, selling tattoo designs, business logos and doing small shoots here and there. It was through this job that he was able to gain a social status in his community and met many of the people that would support him once he decided to quit his job and become a full-time artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn\u0027t long before the amount of freelancing jobs he was receiving was directly conflicting with his demanding position as a General Manager and he made the decision to leave Spike and rely only on his art and photography for an income.  Phoenix moved into a small apartment with two roommates, sold his car, sent his credit cards back and consolidated his outgoing income to support the uncertainty of moving into a market of being a starving artist! He didn\u0027t have to starve long...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhoenix had gained a huge following through working at Spike as well as by utilizing the Social Networking site MYSPACE.com. It was using these resources that made it possible to make his first month in business his most lucrative (at that point) month of his entire life! He instantly booked up his entire next three months of shooting within the first two weeks of quitting his \"day job\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, Phoenix has received international recognition through his work with such clients as:\u003cbr\u003eVIRGIN RECORDS, JACKSON RATHBONE (TWILIGHT), ROBERT LASARDO (DEATH RACE, NIP-TUCK), TATTOO LIFE MAGAZINE, TATTOO ENERGY, IRONHORSE MAGAZINE, MARZIA PRINCE, ARTISTS ON DEMAND, DALLAS MORNING NEWS... and many more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe now lives out of his studio in Deep Ellum, TX with his partner; the Alt-Model, Ivy Zehring. There he continues to do Photography, Illustration work, Graphic Design and has managed to get a strong foothold in the Wedding Market as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe currently runs 3 companies: Phoenix Taylor Photography, Four Walls Wedding Services and WebPlus Photos. He has also published three books: TOUCH, CLOSER and NO SLEEP: THE JACKSON RATHBONE STORY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the world as his oyster, he looks very much forward to the possibilities ahead as several rather large projects make their way to him! He is a force of creative energy, using his education and experience in illustrating to give his photographs an almost \"painted\" feel to them, cleverly creating images that challenge what is real and what is impossible. He enjoys taking his audience along for a ride inside of his head with each unique creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
