    "summary": "Peace all beings! I started Path \u0026amp; Present because, as an artist, I have the opportunity to travel the world and interact with an array of inspiring people: artists, musicians, scholars, spiritual masters, activists and more. These people have transformed me and expanded the way I see the world. I wished that I could capture these conversations and share them with the world. Then I realized, I could! And Path \u0026amp; Present was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all the negativity that is constantly broadcast about our world 24/7 I wanted to showcase the beautiful and inspiring work that is going on in our communities globally. For one year we have been bringing you an episode a month featuring amazing guests: from leading permaculturists, to teachers from different wisdom traditions, to legendary Hip-Hop artists, to Muhammad Ali\u0027s Imam. I have personally been transformed by these conversations and by the outpouring of love and support from people around the world who have come to tune in every month. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon provides a great opportunity for our supporters to help us grow Path \u0026amp; Present. \u00a0We are now at the point where we have the opportunity to hire a team to increase the quality and frequency of the episodes we release, while keeping it organic and raw as you have come to expect. Your support will allow us to reach a wider audience, connect with a wider range of guests, and continue to showcase the beautiful things that are going on in our communities locally and globally.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have listeners in almost every country in the world! Just to show you how diverse our listenership and how wide our reach, here are the top 20 countries (in order of most listens):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUS, UK, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Singapore, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Malaysia, Indonesia, France, Turkey, UAE, Netherlands, India, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Morocco.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast has always been about community. We are community run and community supported. If you are listening, no matter where you are, we consider you our community. If you have the ability to support with even 5 dollars that would make a huge difference. And we will be eternally grateful. Patrons will not only help to grow the podcast but will stay connected to everything we are doing through the patreon update feed. We will keep you updated and give you exclusive content, including livestreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! Love and Light,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBaraka Blue"
