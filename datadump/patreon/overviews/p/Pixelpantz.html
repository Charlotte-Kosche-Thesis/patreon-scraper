You pay what you want per month and in return receive exclusive content from the artists you follow! I set the rewards and you pick your level of commitment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll let you know what to expect in the upcoming month\u0027s rewards and you can decide if you want those or not! If you do, you will be charged on the 1st of that month! If you have any questions about this PLEASE ASK. I\u0027m here to clear things up for you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m assuming you already know me.. But in case you don\u2019t; I am Katlyn! I\u2019m a 22 year old cosplayer from North Alabama who considers herself a master at pun making, ice cream consuming, and occasionally video games. On the webz I go by Pixelpantz but you can call me Pixel, Kat, \u003cdel\u003eKatwyn\u003c/del\u003e, \u003cdel\u003eThat Chick\u003c/del\u003e, or anything your little heart desires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been cosplaying and attending conventions since 2009 but I wouldn\u2019t say I really started taking my costumes seriously until about 2015. Cosplay is this amazing outlet for me to really express myself, my creativity, and my love for these characters. In recent years, I\u2019ve really found myself becoming engrossed in this hobby and it\u2019s grown into a passion I hold near and dear to my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/2lxa04l.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? I\u2019ll be honest. I toyed with the idea for the longest time and at first I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it. It\u2019s not that it wasn\u2019t a good idea, it was just that I was scared I didn\u2019t have the right content, the right fan-base, or just the time to commit to you guys. I\u2019m not the type of person to ask for donations and this isn\u2019t me begging for handouts. I have a full time job that covers my expenses and my hobby and I will continue to cosplay with or without Patreon. But I will admit that the support from Patreon could allow me to push further and reach more of my long-term goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realized awhile ago that Patreon is more of a partnership between you and me. Through your support I would be able to make more content. That means more videos, more tutorials, and more costumes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf none of that makes sense let me just get one point across. I want to be able to make more content to share with \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e. I want to interact more closely to \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e. I do this because I love it but it\u2019s ultimately you guys that keep pushing me forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2aj2ud3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe specifics of each tier will be fleshed out on the right side of this page but I wanted to at least let you know what \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e donations (no matter what size) will get you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you spend $1, $10, $50, or anything in between, you\u2019ll get access to:\u003cbr\u003e- My Patreon newsfeed where I post my Cosplay plans, WIP photos, Convention line-ups, and more.\u003cbr\u003e- Access to my Patreon-only  Discord server where I can better interact with you guys to answer questions, talk about games, send cute dog pictures, etc.\u003cbr\u003e- Access to Patreon polls! Where you guys get to vote on things like new costumes, what I\u2019m streaming, and what cons I\u2019m going to!\u003cbr\u003e- And of course access to all of Patreon\u2019s default features like the \u201cAll Posts\u201d feed and Direct Messages\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to make sure no matter what you donated, you were receiving \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e from me. Because even the smallest bit helps and the support means more than the money behind it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u2019s the deal! If you made it this far you must be pretty interested. If not, that\u2019s totally cool, I at least appreciate you reading all of this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2665 Thank you for everything. \u2665\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: WHEN YOU SIGN UP YOU WILL BE CHARGED UP FRONT\u00a0FOR THE CURRENT MONTH. THIS MEANS IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A $10 TIER THE LAST DAY OF A MONTH YOU WILL CHARGED $10 THAT DAY AND THEN $10 THE FOLLOWING DAY FOR THE NEXT MONTH.\u003cbr\u003eJust keep this in mind \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e"
