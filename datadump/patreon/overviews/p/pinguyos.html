    "summary": "PinguyOS is a small but very popular distribution. You can often find us listed on the Distrowatch \u0027league tables\u0027. PinguyOS is somewhat of a niche in the Linux world as we focus on \u0027normal users\u0027, not geeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tThe whole point of PinguyOS is to be as simple and straight forward to use as possible. After all, most users don\u0027t want to spend hours tweaking and configuring a machine just to get it to work, most people want it to \u0027just work\u0027 - that\u0027s where PinguyOS comes in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tApart from being easy to use, PinguyOS also looks great. Linux has matured hugely over the last few years and most applications have an extremely polished look to them (long gone are the days of Linux distributions that look like Windows 95). Many of these applications are added to PinguyOS by default in order to give it that extra \u0027bling\u0027. For example, \n\u003cem\u003eDocky\u003c/em\u003e gives users quick and easy access to their most commonly used applications and folders by way of a desktop launcher. \u003cem\u003eGnome Shell\u003c/em\u003e gives users the ability to quickly and easily search for anything on their computer in just one mouse click and \u003cem\u003eGloobus Preview\u003c/em\u003e allows users to see thumbnails of their images and music cover art before they are opened.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith all these extra applications installed you may think that PinguyOS is slow to run and needs a powerhouse computer to run smoothly. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many added system tweaks in order to make PinguyOS run flawlessly - even on low powered machines. All of this means that the recommended system requirements of PinguyOS are exactly the same as Ubuntu.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAll of the above means that PinguyOS is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethe\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003echoice for anyone thinking about wetting their feet in the Linux pond. Simply burn a DVD, run it live to test and then install. That\u0027s it, no extra CODEC\u0027s, applications or tweaks will be needed to get you up and running. If you need help though, you can always visit our \u003ca href=\"http://forum.pinguyos.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eforums\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWe are very proud of PinguyOS and we hope that you enjoy it as much as we do!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
