As of June 2018, after its 100th episode and five seasons of terrific content, I\u0027ll be discontinuing the show. After seeking advice, praying, and running out of stories I could personally vet, I knew it was time to shift my focus.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.marydemuth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/9780736971010_cft_300.jpg\" style=\"width: 102px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January, during my Mastermind retreat and after the release of my daily devotional,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2rOyhVX\"\u003eJesus Every Day\u003c/a\u003e, my writing friends suggested I start a daily podcast where I pray every day for people.

As you can imagine, this daily prayer podcast takes a lot of my time and resources to create. I see this as my service to those who need prayer around the world. The format of the podcast is this:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI read a Scripture. (The first two months, we are going through Philippians, verse by verse.

I have\nbeen very low lately and trying to lift my spirits up by reading and meditating\non the Word. This morning I prayed for God to lead me as I am very confused\nabout my next steps. You prayed for God to resurrect broken relationships. I\nbelieve that is the answer to my prayer as I was asking God whether I should\ngive up and let go or hold on and wait.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJOSEPH in South Sudan:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you Mary for praying for me.
