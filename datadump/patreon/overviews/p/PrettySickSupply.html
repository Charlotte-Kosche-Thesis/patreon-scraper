     "about": "We\u2019re two people with chronic conditions who know what it\u2019s like to walk through a world that would prefer not to see us at all.  We know how difficult it can be to find all of the supplies, equipment and accessories that chronic conditions require in anything that isn\u2019t just the same black, gray and boring that everyone else is issued.  And as Creators, we also know how difficult it can be when you\u2019re making art and equipment and accessories for our community but have to rely on word of mouth or luck to be found by customers- because you can\u2019t afford to advertise.\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e    We started pretty sick supply so that we could try and bridge the gap that exists between disabled/chronically ill consumers and disabled/chronically ill creators.  Medical equipment and accessories ARE being made in fun, funky styles- but it can be frustrating to try and find it.  So we launched prettysicksupply.com in order to be a hub for creators and consumers to find each other.  We do all of the searching and googling and hunting and list all of the shops and websites we can on our site.  So that when you need a purse that will accommodate your diabetes supplies, or decals to make your crutches less boring, or a sarcastic ostomy cover, or an eyepatch that isn\u2019t just... black and blah- instead of spending a week trying to find something you like and then settling for the same old same old- you come to prettysicksupply.com and see at a glance a plethora of style options.  We also include starting price points and shipping limitations right on every shop\u2019s listing so you know at a glance if it\u2019s even worth clicking a link to shop.  (Because how much does it suck to find the perfect product, only to discover it doesn\u2019t ship to where you live!)\u003cbr\u003e",
