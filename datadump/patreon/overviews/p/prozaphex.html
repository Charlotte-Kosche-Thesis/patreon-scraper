Starting in the late 2000\u2019s project lead Kerric Brooks founded the indie label, \u201cBroken Records\u201d which has since been updated to \u201cProzaphex Records | Media\u201d and quickly made a bold statement in the HipHop/Pop SLC scene. After multiple iterations of different sounds and musical inspiration Prozaphex was formed as a new-age contemporary to acts such as Blackmill, Ephixa, Bar9, and Flux Pavillon. With a mix of Melodic Dubstep, Pop infused hooks, and a mix of west coast beats Prozaphex released his first album \u201cD3FECTIVE\u201d in 2013 to high regards in the Melodic Dubstep/Chillstep community. From here Prozaphex is poised to not only dominate the listening populace with his catchy \u201cear worm\u201d songs, but become an major influencer in his own right. Following the release of D3FECTIVE in 2013, Prozaphex has spent some time away from the spotlight working on different life endeavors and challenges, while still releasing occasional songs. In late 2017, Prozaphex made the announcement he would be returning to the scene gearing his focus solely towards chillstep production and get back to releasing new material on a regular basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u201cI look forward to the future  with this new focus on music and hope to see you all join me on this endeavor!\"\u00a0 \u00a0-  Prozaphex\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy help me on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, please know all of my material is available free of cost on my SoundCloud. Any amount paid or donated is completely up to you and please know it means the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has always been a big dream of mine to be able to make a living and provide for my family with my overwhelming passion for music. In all reality, we live in a world where you can\u0027t get by for free, especially with a wife and 2 kids of your own. I spend as much time possible producing and writing, but would love so much more to spend all my time doing so while providing for my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to release constant content based on or around my production and writing as well as tips and tricks I have learned over the years and give back to this wonderful world we live in. It goes without saying I don\u0027t want any one of you to feel\u00a0 obligated or that you must become a patron or give anything, but if you do so choose to do so, I want you to know that I am indescribably grateful because you are contributing to making my dream possible! Even with the smallest amount! I hold myself to the \u0027pay it forward\u0027 lifestyle so please know, if you decide not to, its okay. I make music because I love giving back to this world and love hearing all of your thoughts and opinions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has certainly been an interesting couple of years for me since I started producing mainly electronic music. I have been writting and playing music nearly all my life, and 6-7 years ago started producing electronic music with Fl Studios.
