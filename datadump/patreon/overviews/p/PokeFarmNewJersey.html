    "summary": "Hi New Jersey,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for visiting our Patreon page. It\u0027s been great helping get Team Unity moving forward with some technical tools and capability to make it easier to play the game in our local area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Captain Bunzo. I\u0027ve been helped much to get this going my minion, Ghusl. Additionally, the support, guidance and encouragement from our benevolent leader Captain Discord has been nothing short of extraordinary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve honestly very much enjoyed putting together these geeky tools and learning about this stuff. It\u0027s been great seeing Team Unity members at raids enjoying using our Map as well as the Raid announcements, the Pok\u00e9mon notifications and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://newjersey.poke.farm\"\u003ehttp://newjersey.poke.farm\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://boonton.poke.farm\"\u003ehttp://boonton.poke.farm\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://greatswamp.poke.farm\"\u003ehttp://greatswamp.poke.farm\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://route22.poke.farm\"\u003ehttp://route22.poke.farm\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ramapo.poke.farm\"\u003ehttp://ramapo.poke.farm\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow to the real stuff...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been more then happy to foot the bill to get the started. To be fair, I\u0027ve benefited as well, having finally caught my Lapras and filled in my Pok\u00e9dex with a Lapras and Primeape and Miltank.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I\u0027ve pitched in about $50 to get this off the ground. And as much as I\u0027d love to keep doing that, I really need some help to both keep this going and to grow this to something that is available consistently on a day to day basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs such and at the urging of a number of Team Unity members, I am launching this Patreon page. Contributions to this page will go toward helping keep the existing infrastructure running as well as reinforcing it andmaybe growing our area a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as such and in classic Pok\u00e9mon Go styling, I\u0027ve setup three levels of gifting here. These contributions will directly go toward helping support the running of the Team Unity Map and raid/Pok\u00e9mon alerts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese gifting levels area as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eBronze Patron Badge - $5 to $9 / month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSilver Patron Badge - $10 to $19 / month\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGold Patron Badge - $20+ / month\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eIn appreciation for your support, you will be offered some super-duper exclusive offerings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, actually, we already gave you super-duper stuff with the map and have not come up with much in the day or two that has passed since. So for now, we\u0027ve only got on offer inclusion of a Patron only chat channel, the exlusive super-duper #poke-patrons place to hang out and chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we\u0027ve some time in the next few weeks, we\u0027ll look at ways to enhance this and allow for more rewards for those who can help Team Unity going from a financial perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for great weeks of raiding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eCaptain Bunzo\u003cbr\u003e"
