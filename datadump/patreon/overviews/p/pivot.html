The last piece of the puzzle: I started reaching out to my dream mentors-from-afar, authors who I had long-admired and never quite had the courage to connect with. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDespite my trepidation, and much to my my surprise and delight, when I asked them to be guests on the show many said YES!! From WIRED co-founder Kevin Kelly, to a favorite writer and now friend James Altucher, to former Starbucks President Howard Shultz, to master of intuition and perception Penney Peirce, it has been a great joy to hit record on these conversations with my heroes so that I can share their expertise with all of you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54414faee4b03de3b679d82a/t/59c5a9683e00be8678a3a95f/1506126203032/JennyBlake_JamesAltucher_PivotPodcast.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, as the Pivot Podcast rounds the corner into it\u2019s fourth (!!) year and over 70 episodes across three publishing seasons\u003c/strong\u003e, the show has grown into one of iTunes top podcasts in the Careers category, named by CNBC among \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/6-great-podcasts-to-make-you-smarter-about-your-career.html\"\u003e6 podcasts to make you smarter about your career\u003c/a\u003e, and selected by Entrepreneur as one of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/286965\"\u003etop 20 female-hosted business podcasts\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, producing the show does require a significant amount of work.
