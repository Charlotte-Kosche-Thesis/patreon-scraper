Last year\u0027s Fund Anything campaign allowed us to buy a mixing board, mics, and mobile recording gear. \u00a0Merchandise sales have allowed us to build out a home studio so that we can provide a video feed with guests joining us via satellite as well as in person. Now, as we endeavor to take the show on the road to a town near you, we are launching this very special way for you to support the show for as little as dollar, while enjoying exclusive access to our premium content, as well as getting more content first, before it\u0027s available anywhere else. The more you support us, the more we promise to crank out content to repay the favor.\u00a0"
