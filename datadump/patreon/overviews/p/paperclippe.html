Hell, it was only eighteen months ago, but it feels like a lifetime. In some ways, I guess, it was a lifetime, considering what died that day. Who died that day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey said it was an accident, but can you really call keeping a stockpile of over ten thousand megatons of nuclear weapons an accident at all? Can you call bad practices and poor security and a diminished sense of danger an accident? I guess you can if you\u2019re a bureaucracy, and that\u2019s what we were then, in 2023. That\u2019s all we really were. A system of checks that no one balanced. And now here we are, in this wasteland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I am.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Second Law is a story about Opal, a woman who lives through the worst imaginable future: nuclear war. But she survives, and finds a town of survivors, and with her Cessna she delivers mail and news to the parts of the United States that are still inhabited, still inhabitable. But when she heads to Minnesota, the furthest north she\u0027s ever flown, she finds out that the man she has been living with might have a past darker than the soot-filled clouds that still block out the sun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Paperclippe:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaperclippe writes too much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe writes when she really should be doing work, honestly. She writes when her significant other wishes she were paying more attention to him after dinner when Top Gear is on. She\u0027s been this way since she realized she could string a sentence together, and has been stealing pens from restaurants to write those sentences for just about as long (she is sorry to all the servers whose pens she has nicked. She hopes she left you a good tip. You folks just have really good pens).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Second Law was originally Paperclippe\u0027s 2013 NaNoWriMo project. She wrote it - or at least the first fifty thousand (and eleven) words of it - in twenty-three days, and then promptly forgot about it. She found it on her ten-year-old MacBook whose WiFi card had gone bad in August of 2017 (that\u0027s now) while she was looking for something else entirely, and she realized it was actually pretty good. She sent it to a friend who agreed, and so Paperclippe got pretty hyped, and decided maybe she should do something with it besides let it sit on a plastic white MacBook with a bad WiFi card. So she\u0027s doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe, admittedly, still has to finish writing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe, admittedly, is abandoning another project to work on this one (you might see some of that one as bonus rewards for being a part of this Patreon! Who knows!). She does that a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe hopes you like The Second Law.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaperclippe is from Pittsburgh and is actually called Melissa Beall if you must know. She plays a lot of Dragon Age. She likes cats. A lot.\u003cbr\u003e"
