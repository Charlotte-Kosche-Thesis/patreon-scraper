In 2012 I started making abridged series parodies. Since then I\u0027ve grown a lot and have found myself a decent fan base with people asking how they could support me and my content. Although I cannot monetize on abridged series due to copyright laws I would like to further the creation of not only abridged content, but ORIGINAL content as well.\u00a0\u00a0I have many ideas for live action skits, podcasts, and other ways I can make content to do what I said in the first sentence of this: ENTERTAIN OTHERS! With the support of Patrons, I intend to upgrade the equipment I have to make higher quality videos as well as support my own personal needs i.e bills and other necessities. With everything going on in my life I\u0027m going to find a balance to ensure that my Patrons get the most out of their money! At the end of the day though, it\u0027s all about the entertainment. I LIVE for making others smile. I always say that if I can make at least one person smile, then I\u0027m doing the right thing. Now that I know I\u0027ve made a lot more than one person smile, I want to ensure that I\u0027m around long enough to continue to see those beautiful smiles."
