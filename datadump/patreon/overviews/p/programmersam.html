Over the years however, I had got really ill and could not even get on the computer to stream anymore...let alone play games. Without going into detail, I have got much better and my health is top notch again.\u00a0So this passion for streaming video games and making content for YouTube is in full swing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is designed for individuals that wish to help me succeed as a full-time streamer and content creator. I work currently as a Substitute Teacher but...that barely brings in enough money. Full-time streaming is what I want to accomplish and with help, I know we can make it happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, I currently have to use affiliation links and advertisements on my page to make any money; I would much rather that not be the case because I do not want to clutter my page with ads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/programmersam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVisit my stream and show some support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eLet\u0027s be honest, I will not sugar coat anything but making a career out of streaming is not easy, nor cheap; this is where Patreon is critical to my success. By supporting me, you are allowing me to make this dream career become a reality and in return I can provide higher quality streams along with better edited YouTube videos for highlights. Also, with me just finishing my college degree...my debt really begins, needing all the help I can get to survive. All this will then be turned around when I am partnered and stable, meaning I will be able to give back more to the community that supports me with:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBigger giveaways\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMore interactive streams\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eHigher quality content\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eNew equipment\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMy own house\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eHow to Help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo amount is too small! \u003c/strong\u003eBubba loves belly rubs and that means the world to him :D but joking aside, the way I can succeed is by your support.
