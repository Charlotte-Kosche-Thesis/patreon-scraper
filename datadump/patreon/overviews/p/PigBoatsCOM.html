The WW II and Cold War Submarines are well represented on the Internet by others. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOver the years, (about 18 years now) PigBoats.COM has been bringing you photos of these early Submarines. As our expertise grew over the years with the pages, what is shown and presented has also grown. It became clear early on that though the pictures of the boats was interesting, it was the men who sailed these boats where the real interest lay. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt is important to\n remember that the Submarines were just steel and machinery. \nIt was the men who brought them to life and made them live.

These Submarines were the technological wonders of their time. The current state of the United States Navy Submarine Service rests directly on the shoulders of these boats and men that sailed and perfected these early craft. We hope that by supporting PigBoats.COM you can join us as we strive to present and preserve the memory of these fragile and daring little Submarines and the brave men who went to sea in them and, on occasion, died in them. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBy supporting PigBoats.COM we will do our best to bring these and other histories to you.
