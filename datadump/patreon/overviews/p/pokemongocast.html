From tips and tricks to the latest news, updates and more, this is your weekly fix for all things PokemonGo. We\u0027re dedicated to providing a quality 30-minute show about the Go! version of the Pokemon Franchise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Story...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the Summer of 2016 when the hit mobile game Pokemon Go! was released three friends came together to talk about it. Byron McCoy opened up the podcasting studio and Parker Beckley and Tim Fox sat down and what happened next was history. Our first episodes were fun to record and with a few dedicated fans providing an incentive to keep recording the next few episodes came out shortly afterwards. As our listener base expanded so did our desire to record a quality podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027re Planning\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is great but we think it could be better. Everything that goes into making the show has been provided and supplied by us; your podcast hosts. We\u0027d like to up the ante and invest in some higher quality equipment and expand to offer video content in the future as well. More than anything else, however, we\u0027d like to be able to spend more time working on the show. In order to do any of those things we need some support from you; our listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
