    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027The arts are the wilderness areas of the imagination, \u003cbr\u003esurviving, like national parks, in the midst of civilised minds\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGary Snyder\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Paul, and I\u0027m a writer. Over the last twenty years, I\u0027ve published two novels, three books of non-fiction, one poetry collection (soon to be two), a manifesto and thousands upon thousands of words of journalism. I also co-founded the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dark-mountain.net\"\u003eDark Mountain Project\u003c/a\u003e, an international network of writers and artists searching for new stories for a time of turmoil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to define yourself in a public arena, but if asked I would say that all of my writing circles around one big question: how can the human and non-human worlds co-exist? To put it another way: what does it mean to be a human animal in an over-civilised world; one we are eating alive with our appetites?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to produce work that is unlike anything else around. In my non-fiction - such as my recent essay collection\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paulkingsnorth.net/books/confessions/\"\u003eConfessions of a Recovering Environmentalist\u003c/a\u003e - I ask big questions about the underpinnings of our society in an age of climate change, rising social and cultural tensions, and ecological collapse. What do we mean by \u0027progress\u0027? Is \u0027civilisation\u0027 inherently destructive? How can we belong to a culture, a nation or a place, in a frenetically mobile age? Can a culture with no sense of the sacred ever last?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my fiction - such as my Man Booker-longlisted debut novel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paulkingsnorth.net/books/the-wake/\"\u003eThe Wake\u003c/a\u003e - I bend language and perception in ways that I hope will illuminate darkened areas of the world, the mind and the soul. I write novels in which human characters negotiate with living and mythical landscapes, with no guarantee they will come out on top\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as writing, I run the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wyrdschool.ie\"\u003eWyrd School\u003c/a\u003e, a home for my self-designed courses and events. These are designed to bring creative people into contact with wild places and wild ideas, and to produce art from the resulting sparks. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many writers I\u0027m a fairly reclusive, introspective person. I live on a smallholding in Ireland with my wife, where we grow our own food and fuel, make our own bread and school our own children. I\u0027m not all over social media, I don\u0027t blog and I don\u0027t tweet pictures of my breakfast to the world. I sit in the writing hut you can see at the top of this page, light the fire, eat chocolate bars, listen to the song thrushes, watch the young birches grow, and see what arises.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting and teaching don\u0027t pay much, and it can be precarious trying to support a family this way. Nobody owes me a living, but if you like what I do and would like to help me keep doing it, any support you can provide here will make a big difference. I have a few goodies to offer you in return. Most of all though, I\u0027ll be extremely grateful for any support I receive from my readers. It will all help me to continue my writing, thinking and publishing. Thanks for reading.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
