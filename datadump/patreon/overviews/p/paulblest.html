I also have ideas for a website, a short weekly podcast and some other stuff in the future, and I\u0027m always down to take story ideas and pitches for features and things I should be working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings are terrible right now, and there\u0027s a lot of worthy causes you could spend your money on. But if you like the stuff I\u0027ve done in the past and want to see more of it, it\u0027s much appreciated if you kick a few bucks my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaul\u003cbr\u003e"
