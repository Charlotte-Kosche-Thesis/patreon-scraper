This will help alleviate some anxiety and stress for me, as well as help to cover some of the cost of things like toiletries, medication, vitamins and supplements, arnica for my joint pain, and other common frequently purchased necessities. These items are vital to my daily life, make my pain more manageable, and help immensely toward giving me the strength and stamina to be able to stream at all, record at all, or spend any time with the community!\u00a0",

Patrons would have input on deciding what kinds of multiplayer games, mods, servers, or activities we run each month, and this is not limited to just Minecraft! These events and servers would be Patron-exclusive, I would personally participate in the launch as well as later gaming sessions, and the activities may be streamed on Twitch, recorded for Youtube, or both! If possible I would also like to set aside some of the funds for running a dedicated Life in the Woods Renaissance modded Patron-exclusive survival server, or when necessary, for the upkeep of a creative server specifically allocated for testing, research, development, and design for creating new content for, or the next iteration of, Life in the Woods!",

I\u0027ve made the adjustments I can with what I currently have, rearranged my monitors and desk space multiple times, and purchased some small assitive items to help try to improve my posture and alleviate pain, but it isn\u0027t enough. If I can get a new chair that helps to reduce the amount of pain I experience while trying to sit at the computer, even just for short periods of time, then I might be able to create, record, stream, and participate in Patreon events more often!",

Alternatively if no such upgrade was necessary during a given month, then I could put those funds towards paying off my debts, saving for health or technical emergencies, or put some of it towards going on a small day trip to somewhere interesting and vlog or record it! I could also put more time into vlogging and videos about my daily life, as well as telling certain stories about my life, participating in specific real-life activities, or completing challenges or tags, as decided by Patron voting!",

     "description": "If we can maintain this goal I\u0027ll be able to cover more than just the minimum payments on my debt, and slowly start reducing the debt instead of just accruing more. When I entered the work force after college, with the job market as it was at the time I was only ever able to get minimum wage, entry level, manual labour jobs. Working at those jobs as hard as I did is a large part of the reason why my health is as bad and my symptoms are as advanced as they are today. I started my channel when I was working two jobs in Vancouver to put my abusive boyfriend through college, and after five years when he was supposed to return the favour so I could attend culinary school he bailed, leaving me with all of the mess, stress, and debt. If I can start lifting some of this debt off of my account, and my mind, then I can also invest more time into side projects, secret projects, merchandise ideas, collaborations, and planning more specialized Patreon-exclusive rewards or special events!",
