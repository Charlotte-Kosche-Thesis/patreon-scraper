    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eHi there, and welcome!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for making your way to the Project Sentinel Patreon Page. Please read the description below if you would like to have a better understanding of what I am trying to build. Enjoy your stay and please consider supporting this initiative!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Project Sentinel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been involved in Online Gaming for any period of time I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve been in contact with gaming communities such as clans, guilds, outfits or organisations. Maybe you\u0027ve even been part of some. In fact, I hope you have been, as generally speaking almost any game becomes a far richer experience when sharing your time online with like minded individuals chasing a common goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven so, you\u0027ll be lucky to find a well organized one and even of those eventually fall out. Sometimes because of drama, sometimes because the game simply becomes old, unsupported or repetitive and you or the leading figures of the community lose interest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the time however, \u003cem\u003elife\u003c/em\u003e just gets in the way of leadership! And if not life, then other games will. So, after declining activities, lowered interest and the lack of a common goal to strive for the group just kinda falls apart. You\u0027re lucky if you can stay in touch with some of the awesome people you met and spend so much time with... Most people regret this, but that\u0027s just the way it goes in gameland, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I would love to make a difference! Because interestingly enough, even though Online Gaming is one of the biggest past times in the western world, few other hobbies are less organised than ours. Gaming Communities are like the sports, fitness or health club where no one ever pays any contribution or membership, yet everyone regrets their demise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine in real life not paying for gym membership, and no one paying the trainers, coaches or the facilities. The gym would be open only when the owner can \"spare some time\" to open it and keep it operational. And one day he\u0027s going to get a job, a girlfriend,\u00a0 or another hobby and the gym will be closed for good. Sounds weird like that, right? So of course we pay gym membership, or contribution to the soccer club. This way we know that the gym or club will still be there next week... and the week after, and that they have the finances to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this Patreon Page I hope to raise enough funds to where I can create, build and maintain a healthy and exciting online gaming community that serves as an example of what is possible when a team comes together! One that will be here next week... and the week after. Where we can facilitate all kinds of players and their interests - like an actual sports club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout myself\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMultiplayer games have always had a very strong appeal to me... from secretly trying to download gamespy on a dial up connection in order to play Quake (one!) online, to raiding in Azeroth\u00a0and leading platoons across Auraxis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough these years of online gaming I have been part of and have led gaming communities\u00a0in Counter Strike 1.6, Planetside 1, Everquest 2, World of Warcraft, Aion, Dragon Nest, Planetside 2 and Albion Online.\u00a0Now, with Project Sentinel, I have some really big plans for the future and through this page I\u0027m asking you to be a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I would love to create a lasting gaming community with a bright future, by building a strong foundation, hosting scheduled events and approaching the building of a gaming community somewhat to running a sports club. We call it esports for a reason, right? Let\u0027s actually treat it that way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Nvali\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
