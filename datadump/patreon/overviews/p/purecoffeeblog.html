For over 11 years I have been traveling the country (and occasionally venturing over the US border) to visit first-hand and proclaim the excellent coffee and tea institutions of the land. Due to a couple reasons (mostly a lack of time due to working other jobs to pay my bills), I often come up short on funds to do more with the Pure Coffee Blog and its content. All I am really looking for are some folks to help offset the costs of running the PCB so I don\u0027t have to declare a loss on my taxes."
