    "summary": "Hey! Thank you so much for making your way to my Patreon page. I have exciting and ambitious plans in the works and I really appreciate you jumping in and being a part of my incredible life journey. I am so fortunate to have readers, friends and football fans like you! People who are excited about the sport, or about me and are willing to care and support my efforts. You are a part of who I am and what I do, whether you are a football enthusiast, a friend, family or someone who just likes to see a guy \"make it\". \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you do here means the world to me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Here\u0027s why. \u003cbr\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://www.pass2win.com/about-john-cooney.html\"\u003eFor the long version about who I am and what PASS is, click HERE\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am a throat-cancer survivor.\u003c/strong\u003e That\u0027s a great blessing! But beating cancer has its consequences. I no longer am able to speak clearly and it has become a disability. I don\u0027t accept being disabled as the end, but rather, I see it as an opportunity for a new path of life and a way to inspire others to pick themselves up and LIVE. Those close to me have implored me to go the disability route. I\u0027m not that guy; I just can\u0027t do it. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to contribute to this world, not take from it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e My previous profession involved lots of travel, talking, presentation and verbal networking. Can\u0027t do that anymore so I had to make a career change that didn\u0027t involve speaking much or traveling as extensively. If I can\u0027t talk, I\u0027ll write, so now I am a football writer. I cover pro, college and fantasy football. I\u0027m good at it. I created \u003cstrong\u003ePASS (Player Analysis \u0026amp; Scouting Service)\u003c/strong\u003e as the vehicle to showcase my sharp football eye and writing talent. Over the past few years I\u0027ve been paid (kinda\u0027) for my work contributing to other football related websites, but writing income is quite unstable. Will I make enough to pay the bills? Health insurance is essential for me in my post-cancer care. Will I be able to afford it in my new career? Possibly. Family expenses, son\u0027s tuition, website costs... you know what I\u0027m saying. The challenge is how do I create a new flow of stable, predictable and practical income doing what I do best; what I need to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat answer, quick and to-the-point: \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon and YOU\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou provide an incredible opportunity for me to have the time and resources to dedicate all my energies to my creativity, research, scouting and writing. As a patron of PASS you bring the means and Patreon supplies the platform. \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is dedicated to creative artists like film-makers, writers, musicians, visual artists, and more. \u003c/strong\u003eThe way Patreon works is you, a reader of PASS or anyone interested in me personally, can donate $1, $2, $5, $25 or whatever you want per month. The support is a small monthly pledge from you, recurring each month. Small? Trust me, anything from $1/month and up will make a huge impact on my efforts to work and inspire. It may sound like nothing, but even a buck a month from you opens up golden opportunities for me. Many friends and readers have suggested that it is time for me to create a Patreon campaign, so here it is. Patreon keeps it simple for all of us.\u00a0I am working on a personal video presentation, but that will take some time given my verbal challenges. In the meantime \u003cstrong\u003eplease take 2 minutes and hit the video Patreon provided to get a great perspective of \u003cem\u003ewhy\u003c/em\u003e Patreon and how this is an awesome opportunity for all of us.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, where does the money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite costs\u003c/strong\u003e: Gotta pay for the website itself, the updates and site maintenance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiving expenses:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You all know what they are. I\u0027m married and have a teenage son. I have to do my share to support my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSocial Media/Communications coordinator:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m not social media savvy, and I\u0027m not able to hop on the phone and make things happen due to my speech disability. My goal/wish/hope is that my patrons will rocket through the $1000 per month goal ceiling and I\u0027ll have enough cash to hire a slick social media person to get that Facebook, Twitter and whatever else is out there working for me. That frees my time to do what I do; player analysis, scouting, research and write all kinds of unique football articles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have several suggested donor levels for my patrons and great rewards at each level. Fresh rewards will be available monthly. I\u0027m new at this so there are bound to be a few bumps in the road here, but I\u0027m a fast learner. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main goal here is for me to write, write, write. With the overwhelming encouragement and support received from the football and professional community that I have come to know and so appreciate, I\u0027m already making it happen. Now through Patreon we all can be a part of an inspirational life story and take my work to unbelievable new heights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for believing in me. Cancer didn\u0027t end my story, it created a new and exciting chapter. With you by my side through Patreon, I cannot lose.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
