We have the\narchitectural plans and stock-pilled some of the materials to build the house. Sort\nof like the architect now who shows his plans to the builders, the screenplay\nis being shown to his critics for comments and the art department for\nvisualization. The composer, inspired by the script, and the story, and\ntherefore hard at work creating:  Like varnishing,\nthe script needs rubbing down, and then more lacquer. The music, alive in the\ncomposer\u2019s mind and he is adding more, taking away some, and then composing\nsomething different for an alternate ending to the story. Arranging and\norchestrating, a mammoth undertaking: The process is ongoing on a daily basis\nfor everyone. I\u2019ll \u2018quietly\u2019 let you in on something else: Should you decide to\nbe a Level Five Patron and you wish to comment or make suggestions, our writer\nand producer Mark Darby Slater knows that movie making is a collaborative\nprocess and he listens to his audience, you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

With additional creative partners, financial\npartners, studios, and distributors we will make progress through every step\nover the course ahead. Mark\u2019s goal is to keep all fees, piece-work, and expense\ncosts, to one half and the other half of your pledge will go to production\nfunding. Mark\u2019s business experience, previously serving with a board of\ndirectors, keeping a profile within the community and encouraging\nparticipation, have led him to this worthwhile endeavor. You will be hearing more\nfrom him and his team in the weeks and months ahead. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",
