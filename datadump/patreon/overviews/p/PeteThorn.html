His effortless, dynamic playing has landed him onstage alongside such legendary artists as Don Henley, Chris Cornell and Melissa Etheridge among others \u2014 and his debut solo CD Guitar Nerd garnered critical praise and landed on CD Baby\u2019s top selling albums list.\u003cbr\u003eIn his late teens, the ambitious Edmonton native packed up his guitars and moved South of the (Canadian) border to attend Los Angeles\u2019 famed Musician\u2019s Institute. After graduation, he joined the LA-based band Surreal McCoys who signed with Sony Music Japan. While Surreal McCoys didn\u2019t last, it was Thorn\u2019s experience working with the band\u2019s lead singer Frank Simes (who also worked with Don Henley, Mick Jagger, Warren Zevon and Stevie Nicks among others) that allowed the talented newcomer to make valuable inroads in the Los Angeles music industry that would pay off long-term.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1997, Thorn joined Sparkler (Giant Records) and also worked with Ami, Kevin Gilbert, and Laura Harding. From 1999-2001, he toured extensively throughout the US, Canada and Europe with several different artists including: Adam Cohen (Columbia Records); Blinker the Star (Dreamworks Records) and Evan and Jaron (Columbia Records) before joining Pop/Rock outfit Snapdragon (Straightline/Atlantic) and releasing The Family Jewels.\u003cbr\u003e2001 found Thorn touring with singer/songwriter John Ondrasik\u2019s Five For Fighting (Aware Records) and the following year, he joined Canadian Alternative Rock band Forty Foot Echo whose self-titled debut album featured the singles \u201cBrand New Day\u201d which was featured in the Disney film Freaky Friday and \u201cSave Me\u201d which was a Top 10 Rock Radio hit in Canada.\u003cbr\u003eAdding even more credits to his resume, Thorn toured and recorded with Grammy\u2122-winning, Columbia Records\u2019 artist Robi Draco Rosa and in 2006 he toured with multi-platinum-selling singer/songwriter Jewel. In addition, he wrote and recorded tracks with Punk Rock diva Courtney Love \u2013 of which, several songs ended up on the 2010 Hole album, Nobody\u2019s Daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt;\u0026lt;section\u0026gt;\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2006, Thorn started working regularly with famed producer Linda Perry, in her los Angeles-based Kung Fu Gardens recording studio. He played on tracks from a diverse range of artists, such as James Blunt, Daniel Powter, Alicia Keys, Pink, and many others. In 2007, the ultra-busy axman joined ex-Soundgarden/Audioslave vocalist Chris Cornell\u2019s solo band and toured extensively in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and South America, in support of Carry On and Scream albums. He also contributed guitar tracks to Cornell\u2019s 2008 \u201c Scream\u201d album release. After which, in 2009, he joined Eagles\u2019 founder, Don Henley\u2019s solo touring band. In 2011, Thorn was asked to join Melissa Etheridge on her \u201cFearless Love\u201d world tour. He continued with Etheridge until 2013, at which point he embarked on an extensive European tour with French superstar Mylene Farmer. And in 2014 and 2015, Peter joined Japanese rock icon Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi for multiple tours and an epic career highlight concert at Mt. Fuji, performing for over 100,000 fans on the biggest concert stage ever assembled in Japan!\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011,  Thorn opted to step to the forefront and release his first solo album Guitar Nerd.  it\u2019s an instrumental guitar album with 10 tracks that showcase every sonic arrow in Thorn\u2019s impressive quiver of guitar styles, sounds and techniques.\u003cbr\u003eOn the lead track, \u201cRevenge of the Nerd,\u201d Thorn infuses the Blues/Rock song with a sonic smorgasbord of precise playing, hammering, Wah-wah pedal, distortion, fast-tapping and melodic lines full of shreddy goodness. While on \u201cInto the Ether,\u201d Thorn showcases a clean, straightforward Stratocaster sound that emphasizes his dynamic finger-picking, beautiful arpeggios, David Gilmour-esque glissandos and an atmospheric sound that can only be described as effortless. Thorn\u2019s musical range further extends on tracks like \u201cMonster Movie\u201d which features Punk-tinged, gritty Rock guitar solos and riffs that bring out the air guitar player in all of us.\u003cbr\u003eChanneling his inner gear nerd, Thorn has taken to demonstrating guitar gear and accessories on his wildly popular Youtube channel (at this writing, 90,000 subscribers and growing rapidly). Pete\u2019s videos have so far garnered more than 17 million views \u2013 proving there\u2019s a lot of \u201cguitar nerds\u201d out there. But if a lifelong, unabashed passion for playing guitar in all its styles and permutations with some of the best artists in the world qualifies as \u201cnerd\u201d status\u2026? Then Pete Thorn is, indeed, a fabulous guitar nerd.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt;",
