You probably came to look here after watching one of my videos.If there was only a website dedicated to ensuring that I don\u0027t fall victim to the Youtube pay algorithm that allowed my loyal PigCakes to directly contribute to the creation of more videos...Ohhhh...Patreon? I didn\u0027t see you walk in there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough supporting me here on patreon you\u0027ll be able to directly help me create more videos and have access to exclusive content. Thanks ahead for the support and hopefully I won\u0027t be as big a disappointment as the many fathers who have never returned home after leaving for a pack of smokes. My eventual goal would be to remove monetization on my youtube videos altogether if we can make this patreon thing....a thing."
