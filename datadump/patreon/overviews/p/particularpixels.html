Actually most of it has been out of my pocket, but the supplemental channel income did help a little toward the getting some games to review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Youtube has recently demonetized a large number of my videos. So the little I was able to put towards those things is a likely going to be thing of the past. And honestly I don\u0027t see things improving anytime soon, with YouTube increasing it\u0027s \"censorship\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether or not any\u003cem\u003e Particular (Pixels :) \u00a0\u003c/em\u003e) videos I make will suddenly be marked with the non advertiser friendly tag is entirely up to that RNG bot, I mean the YouTube algorithm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been very fortunate over the last 2 years be able to dedicate as much time as I have to the channel, partially because I\u0027ve put other things on hold and also because of the amazing support I\u0027ve gotten from my wife, but its getting to the point where I will need to get back to \"\u003cem\u003enormal\u003c/em\u003e\" life in order to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this means for the channel is that I will have less time to make content, and a much smaller capacity to purchase titles for review. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really love making videos, and if it where up to me, I\u0027d do this full time. Yes I enjoy it that much :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo like many others, I\u0027ve come to Patreon to ask you guys for your support, so that I can continue to spend as much time as I can making videos and covering video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating as little as 1 Dollar a month, which is more than the ad revenue I\u0027d get from a bunch of views, you can help support the channel and ensure that I can spend more time making the videos that you guys enjoy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that everyone is in a different financial situation, so do this only if you have the means to and are happy in doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\"\u003eI want to emphasize that this is by no means required, but any and all support is appreciated beyond words!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still working on the reward tiers for Patreon, but I have a number of things in mind. It\u0027s all a WIP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1). Patreon only posts \u003cbr\u003e2). Access to the channels discord chat \u003cbr\u003e3). Access to discuss games with me on email\u003cbr\u003e4).\u00a0Patreon only streams \u003cbr\u003e5). The ability to play together once or twice a month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll update this section as I work all of that out. And of course Patreon shoutouts at the end of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for taking the time to read through all of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod bless, and thank you all!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
