     "description": "When I began photography and my enchantment with cameras, I was playing with cameras that were already close to 50 years old, at least. As all things change, I have grown into this technological age along with my camera. Nowadays I find that they do not last like they once did. I was blessed to recently upgrade to a new camera, now with movie capability, but I find that I must also replace my computer (my modern darkroom and portable music studio), so that I may continue creating and growing into this world of movie editing, as well as continue with my photography, music, design and many creative endeavors. For a moment the movie making will have to wait, yet I yearn to reflect and bring to life my many adventures and projects. I am so looking forward to diving into such. A long lost art, finally returned, as soon as I have a new computer to handle working with the programs and footage needed. Your support brings these dreams to fruition. Thank you for all you give!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE:: After being blessed with a few creative tasks for others in need, I was able to get the new computer I needed to begin my movie making! I will leave this goal here, as there are still many parts, attachments, and such needed to better my process. Thanks again, for all you give!\u003cbr\u003e",
