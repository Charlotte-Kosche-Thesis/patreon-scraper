My name is Phil Rossi.  I write stories. I record podcasts. I make songs. I am a storyteller. I joined Patreon in 2017 and considered this campaign my \u201cHail Mary\u201d pass--a fingers-crossed saving throw to get my writing career up and running where I was forced to leave it off so many years back. Patreon and my amazing pledges have made it all possible again. \u00a0My gratitude is endless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started podcasting my stories in 2006 and I found early and unexpected success. I published a few books and a couple of these books made a big enough splash to grace Amazon best-seller lists. But inevitably, life happens and I took (a lot of) time off.  2017 brought Patreon and a new path. I\u2019ve found a way to write and podcast and generate income all at the same time. To me, Patreon is about not just giving but giving back ten-fold.  That\u2019s why each month I put in everything I\u2019ve got to deliver as much content as I can manage.\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51r0i3II49L._UY250_.jpg\" style=\"width: 123px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51S3ekQNZ1L._UY250_.jpg\" style=\"width: 122px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BncGDmdcL._UY250_.jpg\" style=\"width: 135px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Pateron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s simple. It\u0027s about getting the work out there to all of you.  It\u0027s hard to justify making time to write, edit, and publish when it takes times away from activities that help me pay the bills and put food the table, etc...It\u0027s even more difficult to justify hiring an editor, paying web server and domain fees, and file server costs, and generally making any investment to support my writing long-term when it takes away from what I need to do for my family.

I have a passion for creating a sense or (alt)reality surrounding my work. I cut my teeth on the Infocom interactive fiction games and I think that\u0027s where my love of \"extras\" began.

Crescent, Rossi\u0027s debut novel, was originally released as a podcast in 2007 and has since lured 20,000 listeners into a dark, twisted world of nightmares and things that go bump in the night. Phil Rossi\u0027s writing has been paralleled to Stephen King, Philip K. Dick, and HP Lovecraft. He has a flair for vivid and often chilling imagery that lends itself to engrossing narratives and an undertone of inescapable, creeping dread. Phil Rossi is a professional musician in the Washington DC metropolitan area creating and performing music spanning from solo acoustic, to industrial, to techno. His the father of two little storytellers. The job he takes most serious of all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"CRESCENT is the last stop at the intergalactic crossroads of gritty scifi and pucker-inducing horror--Blade Runner as written by H.P.

It\u0027s a wicked blend of the claustrophobia seen in Ridley Scott\u0027s Alien, and the viral demonology of Carpenter\u0027s Prince Of Darkness -- with the hard-drinkin\u0027 bad attitude of Battlestar Galactica added for good measure. The future has never been so frightening. Phil Rossi brings it.\" --J.C.
