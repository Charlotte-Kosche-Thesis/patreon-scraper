    "summary": "Welcome fellow PlayStation fans and video game enthusiasts to PS Best Friends! First off, we\u0027d like to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to check out our small, but growing, podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Jeffrey Mizrahi, Miguel Alvarez, and Anthony Palm, and we are PS Best Friends! Inspired by the best PlayStation podcasts around, we bring forth a new episode of grade \"A\" PlayStation news, reviews, and just general industry commentary EVERY Tuesday. What makes us who we are is our focus on YOU, the average gamer. We are a podcast brought to you BY the community, FOR the community.  What this means is that between all three of us, we have a broad knowledge of the different and diverse gaming communities across the internet.  From Jeffrey\u0027s obsession with Destiny, to Anthony\u0027s love for Final Fantasy, all the way to Miguel\u0027s passion for NBA Live, we keep you up to date on what the players are thinking and saying!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are here on Patreon for a couple reasons. First, the bigger and bigger this show has grown over the past year means that it is becoming harder to sustain our out-of-pocket model (especially since we all still work our day jobs.) With your support, the monetary burden and pressures of the show will be lifted and we will be able to deliver the best possible show we can! Second, we know we have some dedicated and loyal fans, and we\u0027d like to offer more content for them. Having different reward tiers means we can put more effort, and money, into greater content specifically for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo join this awesome community, won\u0027t you? Let\u0027s party up, play some games, and become a part of PS Best Friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eOur Content:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003ePS Best Friends- \u003c/strong\u003eThe best PlayStation Community Podcast on the internet! Here\u0027s the format (which may seem a little familiar to longtime PlayStation Podcast fans):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- \"Whatcha Been Playing\" where we talk about... uh... what we have been playing. \u003cbr\u003e- \"Islander Report\" is an in-depth look at the weeks news.\u003cbr\u003e- \"The List of PlayStation Games coming to Every Possible PlayStation Platform as Read by your Best Friends\" where we talk about the weeks new releases. \u003cbr\u003e- \"TOTE\" Topic Of The Episode, where we talk about a topic that\u0027s hot that week, or something provided by you, the Patron!\u003cbr\u003e- \"Game Time\" which can be anything from 20 questions to Guess The Metascore!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCocktail Hour\u003c/strong\u003e- This is our more gaming-adjacent show. What that means is while we won\u0027t be talking about video games per se, we will be chatting up about anything nerd culture related. The conversation may go off the rails so tune in to find out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e^Both of these shows can be found on the same podcast feed under \"PS Best Friends\" on iTunes, Google Play, and pretty much any other podcast app.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eiTunes: \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ps-best-friends/id1236619917?mt=2\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ps-best-friends/id1236619917?mt=2\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoogle Play: \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Iliqpv6fr5txajqpizn7djz3v7q?t=PS_Best_Friends\"\u003ehttps://play.google.com/music/m/Iliqpv6fr5txajqpizn7djz3v7q?t=PS_Best_Friends\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/psbestfriends/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/psbestfriends/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PSBFpodcast\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/PSBFpodcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmail: psbestfriendspod@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003eYouTube: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC260w1IQJmcS9DplCqaeEGA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC260w1IQJmcS9DplCqaeEGA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiscord: \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/k6jsxZS\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/k6jsxZS\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
