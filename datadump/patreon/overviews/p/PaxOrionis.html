    "summary": "History is replete with turning points. This of course means that history is replete with directions it could have gone, but didn\u0027t. One direction it could have gone but didn\u0027t was Project Orion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject Orion was a concept that arose in the early post-Sputnik days of 1957 and lasted to 1964. The idea was simple: chuck an atom bomb out the back of your spaceship. The bomb goes off, the shockwave pushes your ship forward. Repeat a few hundred times, and you have an amazing space propulsion system. General Atomic devoted considerable effort to this program and showed that it was entirely practical; but politics - in particular the Test Ban Treaty - put an end to it. The plan of those who worked on Orion was to send a spacecraft with a crew of 150 to Saturn by the end of the decade.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://up-ship.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the end of Orion, the hope of manned deep-space exploration ended. But what if Orion *wasn\u0027t* cancelled? What if Orion came to pass? That is the world of \u003cem\u003ePax Orionis\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1962, the USAF was in\u00a0the position to go forward on Orion in a big way.\u00a0Instead, they essentially passed on the effort. But what if events in the world had gone slightly differently, so that the USAF decided to fully develop Orion? That is the point of divergence. If you want to read the history\u00a0of that point of divergence, it is available in two formats, \u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/mbf4ofcpy3v4odi/The%20Cuban%20War%20rev%201.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePDF\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/wpxhcta7ure9gq8/The%20Cuban%20War%20rev%201.epub?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEPUB\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePax Orionis\u003c/em\u003e will be a book that tells the history of Orion from the beginning to about 2014, with primary emphasis on the Great War of 1984. It won\u0027t be a conventional narrative novel, but instead a collection of magazine articles, official histories, technical reports, personal reminiscences and so on. One small tale tells the story (through a screenplay or transcript format) of events that occur in the late 1990\u0027s/ early 2000\u0027s (available in \u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/or7205ofrdvurg7/Things%20Blow%20Up.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePDF\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3yd5n4a2mn0ac7o/Things%20Blow%20Up.epub?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEPUB\u003c/a\u003e). In general, pieces will be around 3,000 words in length or so. This works out to about ten novel-pages. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am an aerospace engineer\u00a0by training, the spacecraft and their operations will be hard science, not fuzzy handwaving. The designs - which have been worked out in 2D and 3D CAD models and diagrams, are based on the original General Atomic designs, updated with later technologies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon patrons will get to see the creation of \u003cem\u003ePax Orionis\u003c/em\u003e a piece at a time. This will include creations that almost certainly won\u0027t appear in the final book, such as design diagrams, maps and other technical details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://up-ship.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PAX-0002-Model.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eExamples of technical illustrations being created for Pax Orionis\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePax Orionis\u003c/em\u003e is an outgrowth of another book I\u0027ve been working on for two decades now... \"Nuclear Pulse Propulsion.\" NPP is the non-fictional history of Project Orion and other propulsion systems based on nuclear explosions."
