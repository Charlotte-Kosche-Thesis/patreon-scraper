For now, I am starting off with lieder in a song cycle called \u003cem\u003eBecoming Hyde\u003c/em\u003e, in which we follow Dr. Jekyll\u0027s transformation into his darker half and all the repercussions that follow (based on \u003cem\u003eThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\u003c/em\u003e by Robert Louis Stevenson).
