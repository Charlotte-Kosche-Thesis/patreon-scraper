I\u0027m Paul, and I am a one man production company. I have wanted to make films for as long as I can remember and thanks to YouTube, Patreon, and patrons like you I have an opportunity to live out that desire which has actually \u00a0evolved into a need. I strive to produce videos with imagination, vision, and truth in order to entertain and inspire individuals, and, dare I dream, even promote social change.\u00a0I am grateful to anyone who takes the time to watch my work and I\u00a0am truly humbled that anyone would view me as a creator that deserves their support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Mission in film\u003c/strong\u003e is to find that string of truth that connects all of us, and to provide a catalyst for my audience to take a deeper look at their own lives in transformative ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very excited to be a part of a Patreon community. I look forward to embracing my community of patrons and celebrating film and the wonderful process of creation with them. I am very active on FaceBook and Twitter, with the intention of keeping my followers informed on news and trends throughout the film industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks For Stopping By\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jcx723f8m20\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love film.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI fell in love with film as a child. It was the only thing, in my environment, that examined human behavior and strove to drive people to be better. As soon as I saw this aspect of fiIm I knew I wanted to create in its medium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a filmmaker was viewed as an absurd fantasy for the majority of my life - until I turned 36 and realized anyone could do anything they wanted with enough time and effort. I knew being a creator was something many people would like to do but, like me, just couldn\u0027t figure out how. Knowing this I wanted to do something to help ensure I would succeed at being a filmmaker, something that would push me to figure out a way to be a successful creator no matter what. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I did\u003c/strong\u003e was refuse to focus on anything else, including another job. I quit my full-time job at a Community College determined to make a living as a filmmaker. From that point on filmmaking would never be thought of as a dream or even as a second job; filmmaking would be my only option. It was a long road. When I first started to film myself I would do it in the dark because I was so nervous about being in front of the camera. 7 years later I can proudly say I am a legit filmmaker. I write, act, and direct and I love it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrailer: The Cemetery Siren Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wdkt96jK3I\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor the first time\u003c/strong\u003e in my life I feel at peace in the world, I feel like I belong in the world. I am an INTJ personality type, this means that I am introverted and I work best alone. I have always been uncomfortable while at my previous jobs and I lived with a constant anxiety inside me for the majority of my life. It was so constant I didn\u0027t even realize it was there, I just assumed it was me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, over the past year, as I have started to see myself as a filmmaker and have spent the majority of my time producing my work, that anxiety has disappeared. I realized this anxiety always existed within me only after noticing its absence. This pushed me to a whole new level of determination. I see now that I don\u0027t just desire to be a filmmaker, I need to be a filmmaker in order to be at peace with myself and feel like I actually fit somewhere in this world.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started posting \u003c/strong\u003eto my YouTube channel in November 2015. I have produced two web serials; \u003cem\u003eWords From K\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eP\u0026amp;J Talk\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eWords From K\u003c/em\u003e is a poetry reading presentation. \u003cem\u003eP\u0026amp;J\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eTalk\u003c/em\u003e covers hidden meanings and themes in popular movies. I post a daily vlog that centers on my work and film, but also involves social commentary. I have also produced two short films and have completed the script for my third, which I will begin filming at the end of December 2016. Each of my short films has grown in length. My first, \u003cem\u003eOrigins,\u003c/em\u003e is 3 minutes, my second, \u003cem\u003eThe Cemetery Siren Project,\u003c/em\u003e is 8 minutes and my third, \u003cem\u003eClone Stories,\u003c/em\u003e is looking around 15 minutes. I will make my way up to a feature length film as I begin to reach my goals on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e am a single father\u003c/strong\u003e of two and I work about 120 hours per week, which includes odd jobs that I have to do to make ends meat. I do anything from construction to film production and editing for others, but the majority of my time is spent on PJG. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are entering\u003c/strong\u003e a whole new era of entertainment.

     "description": "A studio space is great, but this production company is my life. I want it intertwined into my daily life and what I need to do that is a big beautiful home. A home that can double as a studio. Providing interior and exterior sets. I live in central New York and there are a lot of old remodeled farm houses in my area. These homes could provide countless scenes for my productions with all of their character, land, and structures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this setting PJG Productions will explode! I have many ideas ready to implement, such as a cooking show. \u00a0I love to cook and enjoying sharing the joy of food with others. Once I have a kitchen that is fully stocked and can accommodate a recording I will show you simple delicious healthy meals that will be as entertaining as they are nutritious.",
