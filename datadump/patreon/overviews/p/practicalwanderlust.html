We\u2019re \u003cstrong\u003eLia \u0026amp; Jeremy, \u003c/strong\u003ethe accident-prone married couple behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://practicalwanderlust.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePractical Wanderlust\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. We\u0027re thrilled that you clicked all the way onto our Patreon page to read about us! We won\u2019t let you down:\u003cstrong\u003e we absolutely love talking about ourselves.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust over a year ago, we got married, quit our jobs, and took off on an absolutely incredible year-long honeymoon. We backpacked through South America, Europe, and the USA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... Well, we tried, to anyway. Mostly we had ridiculous adventures. Like the time Lia had to get\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://practicalwanderlust.com/2016/08/waterfall-rappelling-san-gil-colombia.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erescued off of a waterfall\u003c/a\u003e. Or the time we\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://practicalwanderlust.com/2017/11/road-trip-through-france-what-not-to-do.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eran a BMW into a castle in France.\u003c/a\u003e Or the time we took a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://practicalwanderlust.com/2016/09/mud-baths-in-a-volcano-cartagenas-most-ridiculous-day-trip.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emud bath in a volcano\u003c/a\u003e. Or the time we attempted to hike the Inca Trail only to turn around and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://practicalwanderlust.com/2016/10/machu-picchu-failure-on-the-inca-trail.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehike right back\u003c/a\u003e (\u003cem\u003ebut at least we got to make some llama friends)\u003c/em\u003e. ... You get the idea.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomewhere along the way, we created a blog that grew ... and grew ... and grew. Practical Wanderlust now receives 80,000 views monthly, and our fun part-time hobby has turned into a 60-hour-per-week behemoth. Like, a fun behemoth, but a behemoth nonetheless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve finished our year long adventure, and we\u0027re faced with the prospect of Real Life again, where there are things like jobs and rent and bills and oh god I\u0027m getting anxiety just typing this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we LOVE travel blogging. Writing, being authentic, giving overly detailed advice, cracking bad jokes, inspiring others to be confident in their own imperfections and embrace themselves for who they are, to stop holding themselves back and say f*** it, I\u2019m going on an adventure! We love it, and we\u0027re not giving it up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, Lia is embracing travel blogging as her full time job. And we\u0027d love for you to help support us on this very exciting and also terrifying journey. \u003cem\u003eReal talk: we are now a teacher and a blogger living in San Francisco, the most expensive area in the country, with a raging travel addiction. Whoops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lia-Jeremy-Christmas-Yosemite-National-Park.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf we\u0027ve ever made you laugh, if we\u0027ve ever improved your travels by giving you helpful advice, or if we\u0027ve ever inspired you to feel more confident and jet off on a flawed, fabulous adventure ... please consider supporting us on Patreon. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps us continue to do what we love, and what we do best: go to pretty places, screw EVERYTHING up, and then give you advice on what NOT to do so you can avoid making the same mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e"
