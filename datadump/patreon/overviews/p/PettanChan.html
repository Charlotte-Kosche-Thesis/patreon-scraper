    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eNyahhh!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is Pettan\u0027s house! Stop by here after work or just to hang out if you\u0027re bored. I myself have insomnia and stay up until 6 am sometimes. I\u0027m seeking professional help for it, and someone has recommended that I make some new bonds and friends. Being an introvert, I prefer to stay home and watch Netflix, or lay in bed with a good book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quick list of my hobbies include: anime, games, cooking, reading, drawing (very poorly), nutrition, and Netflix. My dream job would be to become a certified mental health counselor or a social worker. I currently go to a local church that does outreach to the underserved community here volunteer my time when I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter my gaming streams, I\u0027ve noticed that I tend to be very sleepy. I sleep pretty well after a good chat with my viewers. There\u0027s just something to making that human connection with other gamers insomniacs like myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy schedule is a bit hectic, I do work a job (as a waitress!) to pay my bills. I live with a friendly necromancer who also works in the restaurant business. I do like the occasional RP, but I\u0027m no expert in DnD (though my necromancer is a DM and wants me to start playing regularly...).\u00a0 Donations are appreciated; I am a Twitch affiliate so that is a small source of income. However Twitch takes a good 60-75% of the money from subscriptions, so that leaves me with a dollar or two I think?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing to people. Reading is a pleasure and love, though I am slightly dyslexic as you\u0027ll see if you write to me. I also love FOOD! I snack constantly on stream (I\u0027m sorry if it\u0027s bothersome!!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ibb.co/dgaEHm\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ibb.co/dgaEHm\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I sign up as a Patreon for you Pettan?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell for starters, I\u0027ll send you a handmade thank-you postcard! I might even spritz a bit of my favorite perfume on it. I do not do lewds or nudes, so if you are looking for that sort of company, you\u0027re out of luck... There are a lot of other wonderful ladies out there waiting for you love and adoration though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also get access to a private discord channel. I\u0027ll be able to talk 1 on 1 and hang out more often.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy package deliveries will only be domestic Partreons. I will be able to expand to international care packages when I have more funds!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk well, how much should I give?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s completely up to you. I would recommend the snack tier, as you would be getting a yummy package in the mail. I love unboxing things and I don\u0027t think there is a single person out there that doesn\u0027t. Unless they don\u0027t have hands, then they might not be fond of opening packages with their feet, I don\u0027t know... I used to keep in touch with my guild mates by sending care packages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlaying games together is also something else we can do. Imagine a league of legend game with me..actually no that\u0027s terrible. I\u0027m a very new player and an embarrassment to\u00a0Asian gamers worldwide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow quickly will I receive my package?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePackages will be sent the same week as payment is processed. You will receive a tracking number when it is sent ! Generally packages are received within 1 to 2 weeks as it is send via USPS First class mail.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can I help if I\u0027m broke?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all of my followers equally, I just don\u0027t have enough time to share my love and affections to everyone! Just a quick follow on\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/pettanchan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Twitch\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PettanStreams?lang=en\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e will be more than enough support. I\u0027ll be sure to stop by your stream at least once if you are a streamer and check out your own tweets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do you stream?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work Monday to Wednesday all day for sure, the other days change weekly. I will usually be around Thursday to Sunday between the hours of 2 pm to 1 am PST. I tend to tweet a bit before I stream. I\u0027m currently working out the technical problems and on care packages right now, as well as going to personal family holiday related events so I will not be streaming as much as I would like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for reading ! I hope to see you soon !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePettan \u0026lt;3\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
