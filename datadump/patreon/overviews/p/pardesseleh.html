    "summary": "Hi there! If you are reading this, you are already ahead of the updates. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer based in Washington, D.C. I love to cover news, politics, entertainment, and pretty much anything that stirs me in the moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeeling connected with the world around me has been my secret pleasure since my religious teenage years. I knew it ever since I began sneaking a copy of Newsweek along with me into my high school classrooms, where secular reading was not allowed. Newsweek was my first secular magazine obsession, and I absolutely loved it. I read every single column and counted the days until the next weekly issue would arrive in the mail. I had a favorite author\u2014Niall Ferguson\u2014whose columns I\u2019d skip to reading first every time he was featured. Some of my classmates, who knew about my secret hobby, jokingly predicted in our school\u2019s yearbook that in ten years I\u2019d be writing for Newsweek. The most thrilling part of it was none of my teachers got the joke.\u00a0The surge of excitement I felt knowing I had a window into the world right at my fingertips\u2014and it could take me anywhere\u2014was one I will never forget and I still carry with me to the newsroom to this day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat kind of excitement drives me to wake up every morning and connect with you, the reader, on social media, in an article, on my blog\u2014and soon, with my daily podcast. And it makes me want to tell you everything I know and hear everything you think about everything I know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I am building a media company\u2014a tech media company, in fact. I do not want to give much detail right now, other than that I plan to use the best aspects of modern technology in order to create in you what those Newsweek issues created in me years ago: the sweet taste of forbidden knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast month, I finally decided that it was time to say goodbye to my day job and embark on this adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs smug and independent as I\u0027d like to be, I can\u0027t do it all without your help. The smallest donation can make the largest effect sometimes, and I plan to allocate every penny that you donate to making this a success.\u003cbr\u003e"
