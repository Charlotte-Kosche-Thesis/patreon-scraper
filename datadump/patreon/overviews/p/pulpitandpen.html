We also promote true and wholesome Christian doctrine including the fields of soteriology, ecclesiology, and epistemology.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePulpit \u0026amp; Pen also produces the Polemics Report podcast, a bi-weekly podcast giving the latest information, news and commentary on matters of polemics theology. It is hosted by Pulpit \u0026amp; Pen founder, Jordan D. Hall, who is pastor of Fellowship Baptist Church in Sidney, Montana.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe rely on patrons from across the world the help support this ministry endeavor. Polemics is not a popular field of theology because it critiques bad doctrine in an age of ecumenism. Therefore, we rely on a few committed individuals who can help support our work. Without you, Pulpit \u0026amp; Pen and Polemics Report couldn\u0027t exist.\u00a0"
