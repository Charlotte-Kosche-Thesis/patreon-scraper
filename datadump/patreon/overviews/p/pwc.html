    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.prowrestling.cool/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eProWrestling.Cool\u003c/a\u003e is a professional wrestling editorial site that looks at the industry with the amount of silliness that it deserves. We produce weekly articles, reviews, live shows, and podcasts that cover WWE and NXT. We also track win/loss statistics for wrestlers on the televised shows as an experiment to see how their success in the wrong correlates to how they\u0027re placed on the card. We want to offer a unique take on wrestling coverage that combines actual analysis with sarcasm and humor that you can\u0027t find anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePW.C is based out of Philadelphia and New York, two of the biggest hot beds for professional wrestling in the United States. They\u0027re also cities known for northeastern snark and attitude, which blends perfectly with the wrestling community. We bring that voice into our coverage, with John Gawarecki-Maxwell and Owen Douglass as the lead editors and hosts of Heel Turn, a weekly talk show that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mixlr.com/zonecasts\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estreams live weekly\u003c/a\u003e on Wednesdays and goes up as a podcast the following day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the worst part of most wrestling websites is the amount of advertisements and pop-ups that you get bombarded with. This is why we want to remain completely ad-free and use Patreon to allow our fans to help us continue to operate the site, podcasts, and live shows. We love what we do, and we hope you love it too. So we want to work directly with you to help us to continue to cover wrestling in our irreverent way distraction-free and do even more. With proper funding we can do multiple live shows a week, bring in more writers who share our weird sense of humor to add their voice to the site, and even branch out to cover more promotions such as New Japan Pro Wrestling and Ring of Honor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the biggest factor is \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e. We can\u0027t do it without your help! Even a monthly dollar can go a long way to letting us know that you\u0027re enjoying what we\u0027re doing and you want to see more. So please consider joining our team, because having you on board won\u0027t just make us cool, it\u0027ll make us \u003cem\u003edot\u003c/em\u003e cool."
