    "summary": "First, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being here. Thank you for reading my stuff. Thank you for contributing to my efforts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing since I was in sixth grade when I started reading comic books and wanted to tell those kinds of stories. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to write stories about the characters I read, so I created characters of my own and wrote stories about them. Bad stories. Terrible stories. While I occasionally wrote, I read everything. Everything. High minded science fiction? Check. Bodice rippers with ghastly metaphors for the penis? Yep. Almanacs, instruction manuals, and backs of cereal boxes? Oh, yeah. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing was never intended to be published. I wrote it for myself and for a few friends. My younger brother and I got in the habit of dissecting what we watched and what we read, and at some point, I came across a quote of C.S. Lewis\u2019s: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cI wrote the books I should have liked to read. That\u0027s always been my reason for writing. People won\u0027t write the books I want, so I have to do it for myself.\u201d\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow. This isn\u2019t to say there are no stories out there that I love. I have thousands of them that I reread when I get the chance, and I\u2019m always looking for more. Yet, no one writes the way I do (or the way \u003cem\u003ehe\u003c/em\u003e does, or the way \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e do), and I write the kind of stories I want to read. Stories with adventure, friendship, and - oh, yeah - sex. Stories that reflect my wonder at and frustration with the world at large. Stories that recognize the humanity of others and the otherness of humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote and wrote and wrote through my twenties, but it wasn\u2019t until a friend mentioned the particular field of fan fiction that I began to write and put my stories in front of others. I have posted as phouka at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.tthfanfic.org/authors.php?no=4739\u0026amp;list=profile#mm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwisting the Hellmouth\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/phouka/pseuds/phouka\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArchive Of Our Own\u003c/a\u003e and as\u00a0runaway.scrape at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/515680/runaway-scrape\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFanfiction.net\u003c/a\u003e. Since then, I\u2019ve hit the often prescribed \u2018one million words\u2019, and I believe I can truthfully say that I am a writer. I won\u2019t go so far as to say that I\u2019m a good writer, though I believe I\u2019ve written some good things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, again, thank you for being here, thank you for reading my stuff, and thank you for contributing."
