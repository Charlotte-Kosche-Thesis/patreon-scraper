I always had a mind full of ideas and I\u0027ve always kind of known I would like to live on that. Why do anything else then what you love?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of you know me, I\u0027m guessing you know me for being the mod behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ask-caesar-clown.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCaesar on his askblog I\u0027m running\u003c/a\u003e and right now there is also where I pour my creativity and soul into. So although I will make sure to draw other stuff as well you can expect A LOT of Caesar Clown fan content here~.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who are unsure, this completely insane but very precious muse of mine is from the manga/anime One Piece, created by (and all copyright reserved by) Eiichiro Oda and you can find more\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Caesar_Clown\"\u003eabout him here\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/ebe67f253eccfe40e18b95baf73931ef/tumblr_inline_oobgcb0ayK1u0ni1e_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother goof has entered my heart as much as CC has done. It doesn\u0027t happen often but as it has happened I need to mention him here as my content will include a lot about him too now. Namely this asshole:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/3b5b720347acd5f31993920494398212/tumblr_p4tv28wdgK1x7okj4o1_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thearcanagame.wikia.com/wiki/Lucio\"\u003eCount Lucio\u003c/a\u003e from the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thearcanagame.tumblr.com/\"\u003eArcana Game\u003c/a\u003e made by Nix Hydra.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m mostly drawing but cosplay has also become a great interest of mine. I\u0027ve not done a whole lot and I\u0027m probably not good at it yet, but I\u0027ll be damned if I won\u0027t get better! I\u0027ve mostly completed my Caesar Clown cosplay\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent as said above. Expect a lot of CC and Lucio stuff. I\u0027m doing digital art and cosplay shots. Most of my art normally goes into what I do on the ask blog but with help from Patreon I\u0027ll make sure to draw some other things as well. Art pieces that don\u0027t have to do anything with any ask. Eventually they might find their way onto my tumblr but you will have first access here as my patron! I\u0027m in the loop of thoughts how to do with ask blog answers. If I should set them up for first access here or offer full-size instead. I think I might go with full-size actually but please let me know what you think. Any suggestions are welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings might also change as times goes on. Not that I will stop drawing this goofy madman but I might start include other things as well. I\u0027m also planning to take on a new education or at least courses. That will widen my skills and I\u0027ll be able to get better and do more things. This might lead to some changes in how and what I upload and also the rewards. But worry not, firstly this is still far away and secondly I won\u0027t do any sudden changes. You shall receive what you pay for. If there will be bigger changes it will be discussed with you first!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you read to here and decide to become my patreon and help me with my goals I will be ever so grateful to you. Thank you~!"
