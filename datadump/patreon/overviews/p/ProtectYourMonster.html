     "about": "I created Protect Your Monster as an icebreaker into having conversations about HIV/STD prevention and awareness. With the Monster and Woo-Woo, I\u0027ve enjoyed making comics that go a little deeper into sexual topics and striving to promote conversations about taking care of ourselves and the ones we\u0027re with. My Monster has expanded over the years, now trying to tackle several aspects of sexual health, but also fighting stigmas and biases.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the several years that I\u0027ve been playing with my Monster I\u0027ve been able to make a few videos (with many thanks to Fooksie for animating my crazy ideas) and get my comics out in several different arenas. With great help from amazing friends I\u0027ve been able to expose my Monster in several countries, and I hope that one day my Monster will explode all over the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m lucky to have amazing relationships with amazing organizations in my home base of Atlanta, and have even managed to get a little attention from the CDC, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals for this Patreon account is to help me devote a little more time to making more Protect Your Monster comics, expand my message into more animation and create a series to visit topics with more depth while retaining the humor and open-mindedness that I\u0027ve always strived to maintain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt it\u0027s core, PYM is all about promoting education and utilizing resources to make the best informed decision for YOU (and I hope you enjoy the approach that I take with my Monster, I know a lot of people like it). Regardless of who you are, who you\u0027re with, or what you do: Protect Your Monster!",
