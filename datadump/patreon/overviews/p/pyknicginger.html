    "summary": "Storytelling has always been a passion of mine, and I would love your support in helping me achieve my dream of becoming a full-time novelist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eHello, hello!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of you already know me as pyknicGinger, the tiny, redheaded author of \n\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/930034/chapters/1809274\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFreight\u003c/a\u003e and a host of other short stories the popular fanfiction website Archive of our Own. I\u0027m currently trying to find several new jobs after living out of my car for half of 2016, but over the last decade I have dedicated all of my free time to pursuing a love of writing. In addition to publishing several poems and short stories in a small-time Washington, DC literary magazine, I have written hundreds of fanfictions and original works, only a few of which have been seen by the public. Most were stepping stones to improving my skills, but now I am at a point in my life where I would like to share my work with others and really make magic (and zombies, of course!) happen. That\u0027s where you guys come in!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eBut why Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll give it to you guys straight: financially, I\u0027m struggling. In late July/early August 2016, I ended up in a situation that culminated in me living out of my car. Because of this, I had to leave the two minimum wage jobs I was working at the time, and without a permanent address I was unable to find another. I spent almost half a year living off my savings, trying to get my life back together, and now that I\u0027ve found a new place to live I\u0027m struggling to get my feet on the ground again without any backup. Any help and support would be appreciated!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eSomething to consider:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I have only published one novel-length story so far, this is only the beginning. If you enjoy my work, I can only hope you want to see more of it. Even at 250,000 words, \"Freight\" is far from over, and when it does end I would like to hit the ground running with another epic-length tale, along with a series of side stories set in the Freightstuck universe. Are you invested in the world I\u0027ve built, the characters I\u0027ve created, and the story I am telling? Do you want more? Do you want something even better? Helping out, even just a little, is a way to make that happen!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eWhat happens if I donate?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy lending a hand, you will ensure frequent, consistent updates of \"Freight\" until the story\u0027s conclusion, as well as early access to chapters and exclusive story content. You will also have a private window into the characters\u0027 lives outside the main story, with early access to the series of short stories promised above, as well as a few patron-only tales. After \"Freight\", if you choose to continue contributing, you will have the same benefits for my next fan story. Keep in mind that every chapter of \"Freight\" (and every long story I write, really) is an average of 11,500 words and that\u0027s a standard I hold myself to, so that\u0027s a lot of content!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eNew!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn an effort to expand my horizons and help inspire both future and current writers, patrons who pledge $3 or more a month will have early access to videos and vlogs where I talk about my experience with writing, give advice, and answer questions! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eNew!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s a well-known fact among followers of my blog that I write every day. Whenever I sit down to work, I start with warm-ups and writing exercises before I start on whatever project I\u0027ve got on schedule. That means there are hundreds of short stories, drabbles, poems, word lists, experiments, etc, sitting on my computer hard drive that have never seen the light of day--until now! By pledging $7 or more, you\u0027ll receive a weekly document filled with my warm-ups. To put what this means in perspective, the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/series/411747\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eaddiction series\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/6229813\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eouroboros\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003ewere both warm-ups I liked enough to publish. Cool, right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eBut you want to be a novelist, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight! Although I put all of my heart and soul into the fanfiction I write, the reality is that I can\u0027t publish any of my fan works beyond the depths of the internet. All of my writing combined is one collective buildup practice-wise to an original novel I can publish beyond fandom-specific communities. I have tried my hand and novel-writing before, but chose to take a step back and focus on improvement before I dove in again, and once I have \"Freight\" under my belt I will be ready to take the next step. This will be a challenge, but I know I can do it, and with your help I can continue to have the free time that is imperative to making this a reality.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you very much for reading!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #6d8ab6;\"\u003eEm\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
