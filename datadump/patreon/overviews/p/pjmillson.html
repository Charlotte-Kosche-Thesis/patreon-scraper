The early demos I\u0027d recorded in this fashion to show to Boo had a real affecting elegance and not losing that was an idea that was there in the room with us as we listened. I set about simplifying the structure of all ten songs and experimented with phone position in relation to me and the guitar/piano/voice. We then picked the most beautiful of all the (straight, live) takes and spent a long time on the mastering (Chris Pepper) and the running order.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe result is a very moving and affecting record. We\u0027ve all been blown away by it, actually.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI asked my friend, the illustrator, Paul Blow to listen to it and see what came to him in terms of imagery. The cover you see, of the girl and the arrow and the bird, is the result. It left me speechless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife came up with the brilliant title: Mobile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want everyone to hear this and so would like you to help us by contributing to the costs of getting an initial run of CDs pressed and of getting someone to do us a press campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this record sounds like your sort of record. Songs of love, life and, of course, hope.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePJM\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
