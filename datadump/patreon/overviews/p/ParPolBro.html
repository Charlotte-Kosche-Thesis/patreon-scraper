I\u0027m a stand-up comedian, writer, professional sitter downer and as of last year, a podcast creator.\u00a0This is a Patreon page for the Partly Political Broadcast podcast, which yes, on reflection, is far too long a title for anything. The show is a mostly weekly satirical view of the past week\u0027s mostly UK politics and some global ones. It also features serious interviews with experts who can actually explain things and aims to give a different, hopefully more fact based view of situations compared to those shouted out in headlines. Ideally I hope to make politics understandable and fun, despite it being complicated and often more unappealing than a game of Doctors and Nurses with Jeremy Hunt. Ha! A gag!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a Patreon means that if I can get funding and support for the show I\u0027ll be able to take more time out in creating it, in travelling to actually interview people in person, do special shows for big events or elections and maybe even do a few live ones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you enjoy having me in your ears being angry about the state of the world on a regular basis, and can spare a a few dollars (or comparatively now, post Brexit, several thousand pounds) then it\u0027d be appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanking you in advance!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTiernan\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
