Killer songwriting, delivered with emotional power and guts\u2014and endlessly inventive musicality. The kind of songs I\u2019ve been waiting to hear.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n~Ben Deily\u003cbr\u003e\nCo-founder of  The Lemonheads\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year we made friends with Ben Deily, who has helped us out (check our video he co-directed), and who has been gracious to extend himself to us in ways we never could have dreamed. Knowing him these past twelve months has blown us away because he helped us realize that can achieve our dreams musically, creatively, and still be true to ourselves -- to our sound and vision.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the past twelve months we also met Brett Cookingham, an Emmy Award-winning songwriter and composer. With Brett\u2019s help we cut our first LP \u201cGIRASOL\u201d at his studio, The S\u00e9ance Room\u2026which led to us getting a music publishing deal with Heavy Hitters Music Group on the strength of our singles \u201cModern 80\u201d and \u201cDead Possum.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nAll that happened last year. But this year we\u2019re even more excited because we\u2019ve been busy writing and tracking a bunch of new songs, and after much discussion among these guys, they suggested we stick with a core group of five new tracks for our upcoming EP.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where we need your help, your generosity, your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have five new tracks to record and are hoping to raise $5,700.00 to help fund the recording, at The S\u00e9ance Room in Sherman Oaks, California.  Additionally, we will be producing accompanying music videos for at least three of those tracks with these funds.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor patrons who choose the $15 Reward they will receive one Pet t-shirt and early downloads for 2 songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $25 Reward level, patrons can get one Pet t-shirt, early downloads for 3 songs, and a digital copy of our last album, \u201cGirasol.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease help us make this year even more magical than the last. With your help, going forward, anything is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn closing, please know: we are not profiting off this.  All proceeds will go directly to the audio and video production of our five new tracks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo keep you in the loop, here are some things we\u2019d like to share with you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are some of the cool things that happened in 2017: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe released our first full-length bilingual album, Girasol. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe got to work with EMMY awarded producer/recording engineer Brett Cookingham. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe collaborated on a music video with Ben Deily, (The Lemonheads) \u003cbr\u003e\nWe signed two songs with music publisher Heavy Hitters Music Group. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis year we intend to:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRelease a total of 10 new singles. \u003cbr\u003e\nRelease 10 music videos. \u003cbr\u003e\nGet a recording contract. \u003cbr\u003e\nGo on tour. \u003cbr\u003e\nMake new Patreon friends.\u003cbr\u003e"
