Feel free to wade through my\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.mattpetrak.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eportfolio\u003c/a\u003e to get an idea of the kind of work you would be supporting. I\u0027d love to use this as a building block to support experimentation in different visual styles and concepts that only indie games typically dive into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarlier this year, I quit the job that I\u0027ve loathed for 3 years that was eating me from the inside both mentally and physically. While I have a healthy amount of freelance work coming in, it eats up an awful lot of time, so I don\u0027t get much of an opportunity to focus on my own projects. This is where Patreon comes in. Every dollar that comes my way will go into creating games, paying for gorgeous music commissions for the games, and countless hours of me sitting in Photoshop animating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, most of any money raised will be going into the creation of Tala, my hand animated adventure game, as you can see in the splash image. You can also follow the progress on Twitter at \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/talathegame\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/talathegame\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat will you get for supporting me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEarly access to anything that I create, exclusive discounts (maybe even 100% off in some cases), \u0026amp; access to any and all prototypes I create that are worth sharing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I hit certain milestones, I\u0027ll also do small print runs of postcards and stickers featuring my art, and send those out to anybody who wants them."
