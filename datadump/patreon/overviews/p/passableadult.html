    "summary": "Once upon a time there was a beautiful grownup Princess who lived in a castle surrounded by money and adult things like blenders, a car, and a sense of purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not that Princess.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://thepassableadult.wordpress.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon account! I am Gwyneth, and I spend a good portion of my life worrying about how to be a grownup and then writing or drawing about it. Whilst I work very hard at this and put a great deal of effort into the content I produce, I currently do this for free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs regular readers of my blog or viewers of my bad comics will know, I am not very good at being an adult and currently have lots of debts, earn very little money working in a retail job part time, and have moved back in with my parents. My friends are busy buying houses, getting married and having babies, but because I\u0027m busy trying to make a success of The Passable Adult I can\u0027t even afford to buy them congratulations cards for those things, let alone afford to do anything like that myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now the sob story is done, here\u0027s where you come in. By becoming a patron you help support and validate the work that I put into content and help me grow this project into something that might make my parents proud enough to write about in their Christmas letter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why should you?! UM COS IM GREAT...But also, because patrons get rewards! Whether it\u0027s exclusive content, your name at the bottom of every blog, or sneak peeks of content that\u0027s coming your way soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating content, and knowing that people like you love reading or viewing it. Your support to help me do the thing I love (and probably the only thing I\u0027m good at) means the absolute world to me. So really, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
