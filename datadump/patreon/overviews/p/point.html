    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi, it has been a while since you heard from us \u0026#8211; the creators of your favorite link sharing app.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, the three of us stopped development on Point and got jobs elsewhere as the company ran out of funding. We maintained the current codebase (server, chrome extension, and iPhone app), and paid for Point\u0027s costs out of pocket (and with the help of super user  Jonathon Triest).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you continue to use Point daily, and several of you have written us encouraging words about how useful Point has become to you and your friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re proud of what we built. We\u0027re proud that we didn\u0027t pivot Point into something unrecognizable in the name of scale or revenue. We\u0027re proud that we didn\u0027t sell the product only to have it shut down by a larger company. Above all, we are proud Point users too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to keep Point running! We need your help paying for Point\u0027s recurring costs. In the name of transparency, they are:\u003cbr\u003eServer costs: $200/mo\u003cbr\u003eDatabase costs: $200/mo\u003cbr\u003eSearch functionality: $200/mo\u003cbr\u003eCompany taxes: $35.00/mo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour feedback, encouragement, and criticism have made the last few years a blast for us, and we owe you a debt of gratitude for that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us prove that software in 2017 doesn\u0027t have to be about selling customer data or ad spots. Help us prove that a product, vigorously used by a small group of users, is still worth sustaining and improving. We thank you in advance for your support of Point for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappy 2017,\u003cbr\u003eThe Point Team - Ashwinn, Aneesh and Phil\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat\u0027s the suggested donation?\u003cbr\u003e$2.99/month, though we would love anything more :).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you continue to work on Point?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhile we won\u0027t be able to work on Point full-time, we will make tweaks and improvements as time allows. We\u0027d even like to develop an Android app.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill all the existing features and functionality continue to work? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYes! If you notice any bugs or issues please email us at support@getpoint.co, or tweet us at @getpointapp.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan I help Point grow? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYes! If you\u0027re a developer or have ideas for how we can get more traction, please email me at ashwinn@getpoint.co.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
