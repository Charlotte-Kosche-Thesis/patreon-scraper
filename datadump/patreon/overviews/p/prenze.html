    "summary": "Prenze (Pre-nce), an artist that grew up in Toronto\u0027s east side (Scarborough) has quietly been dropping mixtapes and visuals for quite some time. In a music genre that has become more and more commercial and beat/hook driven,  with an OVO sound that dominates \u0027the 6\u0027,  Prenze,  has found a way to balance staying true to himself but keeping an open mind and using elements that are popular in today\u0027s music. A lyricist that prides himself on having his own unique flow and style, he has found a way to carve out his own niche among Toronto\u0027s rare emcees. His circumstantial raps,  that paint pictures of his day to day life, and clever concepts connect with people going through similar things. This college graduate started as a poet, and has evolved into a rapper-producer. Last year he made a trip to Los Angeles,  where he shot a video for his song,  titled, \u0027Ice Cube\u0027 in the Crenshaw neighbourhood of South Central.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will help me continue to focus on delivering quality music and visuals, and also focus on growth. This will allow me to dedicate my time strictly to my music, and take steps to become much more brave in my decisions. When you have to maintain 2-3 jobs just to pay for bills, engineering (mixing and mastering) , videos and promo you enter a safe place, where you decide to spend either more time on growing as an artist and less time on releasing more music (audio and videos) -- or vice versa. But when you have more freedom you are not limited -- art is freedom, I want to be free! Furthermore, building a fan base that is invested in your art, you get feedback from a sincere place, genuine-organic support and opinions from all walks of life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
