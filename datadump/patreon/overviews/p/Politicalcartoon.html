I collect todays best ones also, and I comment on them. Also famous political cartoons, good ones in history. We can look at together.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Maria GRASMICK, ( Female German Paraguayan American)\u00a0 and my dream is to help restore the lost art of the political cartoon. I support DONALD TRUMP. Whats good to me is what helps him and whats evil is what hurts him.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy grandfather, who was elite special forces, as a 11 year old, I would visit him and he had shoeboxes of political cartoons all cut out for me. Year after year, every summer, he would hand the box to me and say THIS, is what you are going to do. I never did it. I grew up, he passed. Yet when DONALD TRUMP ran for office, I had been a CELEBRITY APPRENTICE FANATIC for decades, Everyone in my family, had to watch with me. These are not tv people. I got everyone hooked on Trump in my house before he ever ran. They saw what I saw. I read the ART OF DEAL at 14 years old.\u00a0 I followed him all my childhood. Writing imaginary letters in notebooks, cutting out pictures in magazines. I wanted to follow the Trump lifestyle as a teenager. But things happen. Full Circle, Trump runs for office and I was listening to Roger Stone one night, he said POLITICS is INCLUSIVE. Basically there is a place for everyone. Its about addition. That moment. I decided I would be a political cartooonist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts the most beautiful thing I can do. I consider my political cartoons to be weaponized. I want to help Trumps friends and support them, and I also want to attack his enemies and expose their crimes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started by Candlelight at first, we were so poor. I didnt have a cell phone for 6 months. I drew these on paper. I got books. I learned, fast. I studied about gags and jokes. I copied out famous political cartoonists, OF ALL COUNTRIES. I studied history. I bought CIVIL WAR cartoons. I bought American, French Revolution, Russian, British Political Cartoon books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI order cartooning books every month. I do exercises. I post them here in \"PATRON ONLY POSTS\" I also do NSFW Political Cartons for Patreons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALL MY POLITICAL CARTOONS are yours to share as my Patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I love to\nentertain people and give them something to think about at the same time.\nI produce new political cartoons every day, and I would like to invite you to join my readership. My Political Cartoons are all free and all online. I do this for free. Its a work of love for me. If you want to donate and GET ACCESS, it would go towards my political cartoons. For example. I designed my website with donations from Patreon here. Anonymously.\u00a0 I set\nup this campaign so I can build towards a full-time career in political cartooning eventually.. for Donald Trump. I have to be good enough. I am taking courses and classes, online. I got to library and copy out cartooning books. You can see if you are a patreon, everything I do. Plus, with your\ngenerous contributions I will be able to reward you with some of the most thought-provoking, funny\nand inspirational works you\u2019ve seen.\nI read news sites like\nBreitbart, Cernovich, Laura Loomer, Jerome Corsi, Lionel, Mark Dice, ALEX JONES of course, Roger Stone and April La June, and the Drudge Report. While I build a portfolio, I also plan to package my best\ncartoons, including a line of exclusives, for my contributors. I will make a book for you.\u00a0 The\npolitical cartoon has a rich and storied history in the Republic. You can help me produce top quality\ndesigns for a top quality audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn SHORT. I draw Political Cartoons. But I would like some Patrons, donations etc.., so I can draw more political cartoons for free.\u00a0 You will get perks. I will send free gifts in the mail each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I am just an American who is proud of our President!! I am not alt right, or deplorable... I am an American. I am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBE A PART OF HISTORY WITH ME PLEASE\u003cbr\u003e 2nd American Revolution!\u00a0 Know all about it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI do a Political Cartoon, a day,\u00a0 and I also make a video explaining it with screenshots.
