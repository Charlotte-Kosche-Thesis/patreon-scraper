These tutorial videos were viewed by thousands of people, millions of times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people didn\u0027t know this, but the opportunity for me to film tutorials came not just from PAPA, but from a long-term contract in my work with schools. Living near Boston, I traveled to work with the Pittsburgh Public Schools for six years, filming tutorials after work for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat contract ended in February 2016. In May 2016 I began asking for the support of pinball fans. The hope was to be able to travel to film more tutorials, with the money provided through Patreon paying for travel, for the time taken away from work, and for the Replay Foundation\u0027s time and effort in game setup and video editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the support of the community, the first two new tutorials (X-Men and KISS) were filmed, then released in September 2016. This would not happen without support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney pledged through Patreon, along with direct backer support for Replay Foundation, pays for the setup, filming, editing, and publication of new tutorials, and for additional goals discussed and established by backers. Backers pick the games, have their sponsorship visible within the videos, and even get their initials on the games at PAPA HQ. New tutorials are free for all to see, while backers get early access. Backers also get custom voiceovers and other goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help we can continue to film these videos and to move toward other interesting projects involving pinball. It\u0027s been an honor to share my passion for pinball with you, and thanks for all the kind words about the tutorials. If you\u0027ve enjoyed them, please consider helping me make more.\u003cbr\u003e"
