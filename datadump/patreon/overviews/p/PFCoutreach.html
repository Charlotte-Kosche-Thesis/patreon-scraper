I grew up in Southern California where I spent a great part of my youth and early adulthood as part of the 1980\u2019s BMX Freestyle movement, where I rode and became friends with many of the legends of BMX Freestyle. I have also been an avid gamer since the 1970\u2019s beginning with Pinball machines, video arcades and then moving on to home consoles and PC gaming. In 2015 my wife and I formed BikingForAutism.org a charitable outreach effort focused on Autism awareness (our son DJ has autism), Gaming4Autism and BMX4AUTISM are part of that effort.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eOur Story:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\tWe started our mission after our son DJ was diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (Autism). Unlike other Autistic children we knew of, DJ was always outgoing, friendly and receptive of others so we never even considered he could be autistic. At first we just thought that since his mother \u201cNamolisa\u201d has ADHD and ADD/ADHD runs on her father\u2019s side of the family that some of that trait was passed along to him. It wasn\u2019t until we started to notice certain quirks, like some OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), hand/arm waving (although Namolisa said she did the same hand/arm waving when she was a child) and certain other signs that we began to realize it was more than just ADHD. But we still did not consider Autism because what we had always seen of Autistic children was not what we were seeing in our son. Not until we started doing some research did we realize that there is a whole Autistic Spectrum Disorder category and not just one specific sign or trait or group of traits that is common to all that suffer from Autism. His mother Namolisa has also since been diagnosed as Autistic as well as the classification has changed over the years.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eWhat we do:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\tOne of our primary missions with BMX4AUTISM, BMX4Charity and Gaming4Autism will be attending events and shows to help raise awareness and funds for local children\u2019s causes and/or charities. We do not charge any fees for our services nor do we take a percentage of any proceeds generated in the name of the local cause and/or charity we are representing. Our efforts are to be solely funded by our sponsors, the charitable donations of our supporters and the selling our own charitable items at our display booth and online. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAs part of our goal we would like to be able to gift bicycles and gaming consoles to needy families dealing with obstacles in life including but not limited to Autism.\u00a0As a long time cyclist I understand the joy and freedom that a bicycle can bring\u00a0to a child and as a gamer I realize that many gamers are on the spectrum and that gaming can actually be both therapeutic and educational.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003ch4\u003eAbout Our Son:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tOur son DJ is considered a high functioning Autistic child, but many others face challenges and obstacles we will never know, so our efforts are dedicated to all of them.
