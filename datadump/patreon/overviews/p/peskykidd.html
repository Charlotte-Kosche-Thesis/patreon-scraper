You are almost as awesome as my boy Shia LaBeouf (above.) He expresses how I feel about chasing dreams AND about getting you to pledge your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy become a Patron? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me the\u00a0crucial point of\u00a0patronage is that it\u00a0is a personal and interactive experience. To whatever extent you want it to be.\u00a0By becoming a Patron\u00a0you are becoming\u00a0part of the process itself. This\u00a0is a\u00a0joint project. You can influence the product if you want to, give feedback, leave song ideas, ask me to experiment with certain styles\u00a0and know your voice will be heard. Equally\u00a0your enjoyment\u00a0may come from seeing\u00a0how each project turns out and\u00a0watching my progression as an artist over time, knowing that your are responsible for helping nurture that growth. Perhaps it is as simple as knowing that you are helping turn someone\u0027s dreams into reality. (Quite literally...I often dream music I go on to make!) Who knows, it may even inspire you to write that book you\u0027ve always wanted to write. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind you own reason and you will see that it is that very personal element which makes patronage\u00a0so worthwhile for both of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you agree, then don\u0027t just think it, join me! Tell your friends!\u00a0Pledge now! Just do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith gratitude,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePesky Kidd xxx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
