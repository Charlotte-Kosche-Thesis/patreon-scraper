At the age of 33 I decided I needed something new in my life. As a business owner, a majority of my life was overwhelmed with work. When I wasn\u0027t in client meetings, networking, or at the office, I was still checking email, talking about work, or brainstorming. I needed a way to turn it off - an activity or hobby that was just for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had never danced (not even as a kid), except for some Zumba at the gym, but I had always been fascinated by ballet. When a friend told me about an adult beginner ballet class she was teaching, I gave it a try! I was hooked after my first class. I KNEW ballet would play a large role in my life from then on out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I\u0027ve increased the number of classes I take, I performed my first solo last year, and this year I\u0027m trying my hand at choreography.
