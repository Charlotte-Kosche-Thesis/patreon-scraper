I grew up in a constantly busy family where I was the only one who had a passion for art, while others focused on general life or in terms of my mother\u0027s side, music. I first got into drawing comics and others from the influence of anime and the fear of most cartoons during my childhood, and this still follows me to this day. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI came back to Hong Kong with my mother and younger brother in 2004. I stayed at the place for 8 years and graduated from \n\u003cem\u003eJockey Club Ti-I College\u003c/em\u003e in Sha Tin. I also worked\u00a0part-time as an art worker in an indie company for 3 months before going back to Australia to pursue a university degree. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently in my second year of university as an animation major. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eVISION \u0026amp; PRACTICE:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nMy vision is to allow my work to make people react, and not just that, I want them to be taken into my process of thought, my imagination and how I think of things -- to feel, to think, to love, to hate but most of all, to inspire.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Though I try not to be biased in my storytelling, there are just some principles I just won\u0027t go over and there are things I will not promote, the first owing to my own faith as a Christian and second is that growing up in a rather conservative Chinese family, there are subjects I am not comfortable with dealing and I hope as a patron you can respect that. \u003cem\u003eI also don\u0027t do NSFW\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Practice-wise, I started out by practicing illustrations and have done quite a fair bit of them back in my high school days, and now I am practicing animation and learning the processes within it. I may put up some experiments for my patrons in the near future, but right now my main guns are concept art. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSUPPORT:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nYou can support me by naming your price on the top left\u00a0hand corner of my page\u00a0then click a\u00a0button and fund me per work, since I have university in the way and I\u0027m not going to have much time to do anything personal.
