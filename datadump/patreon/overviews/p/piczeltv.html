    "summary": "Hello everyone -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Garrett, and I\u0027m the owner of Piczel.tv, my live streaming site. I\u0027ve been working on Piczel.tv more or less all the time I haven\u0027t been either finishing up my university degree or working at my day job. In this I\u0027ve hired a few developers to assist with the heavy lifting of programming a streaming site that pushes the limits of available tech. Some of the things we\u0027ve developed and implemented before anyone else that we are aware of include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigh performance, mobile compatible HTML5 video streaming players\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e100% natively mobile compatible streaming site, no app required!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4x Multistreams, followed shortly by up to 9x Multistreams\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMultiviews - showing multiple streams on the same page, making it easy to watch all your favorite streamers at once, rather than cycling through multiple tabs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUltralight low bandwidth \"Streamshots\" - screenshots that update automatically every 10 seconds, which makes it easy for older computers and mobile devices to watch multiple streams at once, without lagging or burning through data or battery power.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"HD\" custom emotes - up to 200x200 custom emoticons for streamers and their viewers to use (sure, this one wasn\u0027t particularly difficult, but everyone else limits users to a small amount of tiny emoticons, which isn\u0027t what people want!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003ePiczel.tv does not currently, nor do we plan to ever run ads. Ads are frustrating for users, waste valuable screen space (especially on mobile devices!), are annoying to manage on my end, and in pretty much every way are just bad. What sort of terrible site would put ads over someone\u0027s art that they\u0027ve worked hard on, or make you wait to watch your favorite streams? That\u0027s not Piczel.tv.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo continue development, we must raise funds. As ads are unacceptable, our best option is Patreon and the continued support of our fantastic community. Currently Piczel.tv is composed of myself (Garrett, aka twots or two-ts), my wonderful girlfriend Pomutop who frequently streams, and our (current) two talented developers working on Piczel.tv part time from Venezuela and Germany.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to hire more developers, or pay our existing developers to work more hours, which would allow us to finish up our backlog of bug fixes, feature requests, and performance improvements. Up until now, I have been effectively unpaid - I am paying our developers out of pocket, with previous premium payments coming in somewhat above server and software costs, but less than R\u0026amp;D costs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur priorities with Patreon funds will be\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. Paying for server hardware and software\u003cbr\u003e2. Paying for current development costs\u003cbr\u003e3. Paying for \"accelerated\" development (ie more dev hours, with possible new devs)\u003cbr\u003e4. Paying myself for all the time spent researching, doing PR, providing support, etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider supporting us here on Patreon if you enjoy Piczel.tv, and would like to see it continue to grow and prosper, and hopefully fully support myself and my programmers. Piczel.tv wouldn\u0027t be possible to run without the community we have and the generous support you give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUsers who pledge at a tier that receives a gift code will receive a premium gift code that covers to the end of the month, and when pledges are processed the full codes are sent out as appropriate.\u003c/strong\u003e"
