    "summary": "I\u0027m a writer. People have gotten gifts for me based on this part of my identity. People have gotten mad enough at something I have written to unfriend on Facebook. (That may not seem like a hard thing to do, but this was before politics got out of hand.) But I\u0027m not just a writer. I am also a Disney fan, a movie enthusiast, a comic con lover and a whole lot more. However, in my work life, I write things. Up until recently, it has been just enough to cover the bills as long as I was in school or had someone\u0027s (figurative) couch to stay on. (Thanks, mom and Sherm!) What changed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a husband. My wife is a doctor in Russia. They don\u0027t make the same salary as doctors in the U.S. Plus, her identity as a doctor of pharmacology is only a part of who she is. She is also an awesome penguin maker. Seriously, check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.penguinate.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html\"\u003ethese stuffed penguins\u003c/a\u003e. They are soft, cuddly and unique. Everyone of the penguins has his or her own name and personality. The problem is that even if she weren\u0027t working 3 jobs(!), she wouldn\u0027t be able to create and sell enough penguins in a month to make ends meet. At a penguin a day, it just isn\u0027t mathematically feasible for us to rely on stuffed penguins alone for income, no matter how much she loves to make them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. As a patron, you will be allowing me to write things other than SEO articles about roofs, and you will be allowing my wife to expand her penguin making empire. Both of us will be able to work together to develop and implement new ideas, and you will be at the forefront of the frontier. Our ability to make games, animations and books while exploring other creative endeavors will dramatically increase, and you will be the cause of that increase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWarm Fuzzies! You get to say you\u0027re a patron of the arts! But seriously, it depends on what you pledge. For $1, you get to join a community of people who are interested in becoming more creative, and despite everything else written here, the idea behind this Patreon is to help everyone become more creative. There will be tips for you to get more creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month, patrons will get access to the penguinate newsletter that shows all of the things we have published over the last month. When we hit our goals, you will get to vote on the category of exclusive content you want to see. Then, of course, it depends on your chosen funding level. Check out the side panel to see what you get at your desired option.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are in control of your patronage. Patreon charges you at the beginning of each month, and you choose how long you would like to continue supporting us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you for taking the time to consider our Patreon campaign. We hope you read something you like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know that we aren\u0027t the only artists out there who would be more effective at creating if it weren\u0027t for the realities of money. When you become a patron of any artist, you support work that could be on the level of Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo or Raphael (not the Ninja Turtles). If we aren\u0027t the right style of artists for you to support or if you aren\u0027t in a position to contribute, please consider following @shadexaminer on Twitter and subscribing to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/sascreator\"\u003emy YouTube page\u003c/a\u003e. That will help tremendously, especially if you watch the videos and read what I have written thus far at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.penguinate.com/\"\u003epenguinate.com\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.penguin8.com/\"\u003epenguin8.com\u003c/a\u003e. Then check out the other artists here who could use some help. Your funding can make a huge difference in making the world a better, more creative place.\u003cbr\u003e"
