Ever since I was a kid, these three hobbies were what kept me entertained, alongside watching cartoons, anime, etc. (One of which you may recognize from my art style).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to get a job that at least involved one, two, or all three hobbies. I even went to Music College in an attempt to get into Video Game Music Composition. (A failure, yes, but that hasn\u0027t deterred me from trying!) During the past 10 years or so, I\u0027ve received support and help towards my art skills, and I\u0027m slowly getting better and better at it! As for video games, I just love playing them. So much in fact, that I want to share my ability to play my favourite (and some new) games with all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, this here is a tip-jar to help support me in my future\u00a0endeavours!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e= = = What will I be supporting? = = =\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will not only be supporting my hobbies, but help towards my living expenses and buying essential equipment for my computer (recording, drawing, parts, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e= = = Why is this a tip-jar? = = =\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first opened my Patreon page, I thought I would\u0027ve been able to support the workload I had. Unfortunately, this proved to be false. I was getting exhausted from my job, and trying to draw so many pictures in the same month. As a result, I lost quite a few Patreon supporters, as I just couldn\u0027t keep up with their demands. Thus, I decided (with the help of a few people) to change the page around a bit to a more suitable type of support page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e= = = Can we guarantee your rewards? = = =\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a high chance that I may be late with art-based rewards, as my job has a tendency to tire me out, but yes! All videos uploaded will have your names credited in there, unless I\u0027ve already uploaded them in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, everyone, for taking the time to view my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- PHLiM2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Several years later, and here I am, still drawing the same thing, and enjoying it. I\u0027m still amateurish at best, but I\u0027m pushing myself to get better at what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also taken a liking to playing video games and recording them, so that you can watch me play them. As of January 2017, I turned this page into both an art \u003cstrong\u003eand \u003c/strong\u003egaming page. That way, people can get the best of both worlds!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made this Patreon account in the hopes that I will eventually turn my hobbies into a full time job. Being a cleaner can only become tolerable for so long, after all! xD\u003cbr\u003e",
