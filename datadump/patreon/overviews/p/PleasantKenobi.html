I make Magic: The Gathering videos designed to inform, arouse and entertain. These videos vary in format and my creative energies often manifest in differing ways - but by far my most popular series is my hyper-kinetic and slightly eccentric MTGO gameplay in which I shout, swear and rek scrubs. Or get rekt. Whatever. GG.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my finest works can be found below. But be warned, the memes are contagious!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/k6ZT8vH5IRs\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6ZT8vH5IRs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is being put together with the intention of helping to grow my channel beyond its humble beginnings, and into a formidable force within the community. I want to bring Bees to the masses, and have SCG commentators far and wide get really mad at me when they have to discuss Hornet\u0027s Nest live on stream. The meme must live!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am proud of the silliness that I make, and the growth of my channel thus far. In the last month I have doubled from 2.5k subs to over 5k subscribers. I want to keep this momentum up. I want to invest in new sound recording hardware, to bring to life more silly fever-dreams and to create more varied and experimental content that is unique when compared to the rest of YouTube\u0027s Magic related offerings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this takes time, and for the most part, money. Magic: The Gathering is an expensive and time consuming hobby at the best of time. Creating new and exciting content around the game is no different, with content often taking upwards of 10 hours to write, record and edit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is where you, my adoring public (or apprehensive viewer) come in. With your backing and support, I can invest money back into the channel to help improve the quality and quantity of content. The end goal, or pip-dream as it were, would be that this Patreon generates enough income for me to be able to reduce my hours in my worklife in order to spend more time creating YouTube content and streaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI keep getting asked if I can make a video of X, or play some Y on stream - but the long and short of it is that I just don\u0027t have enough time to realize all of my own ideas let alone start on those of other at this point in time. Patreon could help to change that. So let\u0027s do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
