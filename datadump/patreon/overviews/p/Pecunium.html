In Rome one\u0027s \"Patronus\" was the person you went to see to take of things you needed. A really important person, with lots of pull, would have dozens of people calling them \"patron\". Little things, to big things. The same basic system was how art was funded almost to the present. Take a look at dedications for things, e.g. Shakespeare\u0027s Sonnets; most of those were done as work for hire. He had a patron.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could get a part-time job again, but if I do that, the time I need (and a lot of the energy required) gets sucked up. Spinning a skein takes a couple of hours. Weaving a thing takes a couple of hours: a single photo, from start to finish, takes several hours; some of them take days. Writing takes a couple of hours for every couple of thousand words. I could use a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I intend to blog about something roughly once a week. I can do that. I\u0027ve been a columnist. I don\u0027t promise any specific subject, though fiber, and food, and photos will be prominent. Right now I\u0027ve got about a terabyte of RAW files to work my way through, which includes a lot of stuff from when I was traveling for the US Army (and a trip to Galapagos). As I work my way through those I\u0027ll talk about where I was, and how/why I took whatever shots I put up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$400 a month is about what I averaged doing retail part time. \u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "I\u0027d like a new camera. It\u0027s not that I need more megapixels, it\u0027s that \nthe body I have is a Nikon D2H and it\u0027s 12 years old and showing its \nage a bit. The body I\u0027d like is a D3. The big change it gets me is a \n\"full frame\" (i.e. 24x36mm) and all my \"old\" lenses will work as they do\n on a film camera. That would give me back my wide angle views, and make my macro work easier to manage. The hard part is that the\n camera body, which was released 12 years ago, is still priced at $4,999.  Like\n the Nikon F3 it\u0027s a workhorse and shows no real sign of coming off the\n market. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that Nikon designed it to be the follow-on \nfor the D2 series, so all the (expensive) widgets, e.g. cable release, \nbatteries, etc., all work with it, and don\u0027t need replacing. Getting a less expensive full-frame would mean replacing a moderate amount of my present infrastructure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther things, such as framing for shows and working with film; esp. the larger format cameras (my 2 /4 and 4x5) are all things which require a greater level of cash flow for things like film, developing, printing, mounting, framing, etc. \u003cbr\u003e",
