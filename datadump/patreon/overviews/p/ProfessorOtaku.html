    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is This Goofball?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWay back when in 2009, I started doing this review show with the computing equivalent of a can and a piece of string. I was going along fine until about 2012 when the D2brigade, which I had headed, disbanded and have been muddling along ever since. Since my tastes run towards the more retro, there\u0027s plenty of shows out there ripe for the slapping around, and I\u0027d love to keep making content so long as its cost effective. Granted, cost-effective to me means \u0027any profit at all\u0027, but if it takes off like I hope, I\u0027ll be able to keep doing it for a long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m hunting for funding for my two shows, Anime Dissection and Free Play. That\u0027s essentially it, and if people are interested in supporting me, then I have the impetus to keep producing to a consistent schedule. I love doing these shows, and I\u0027d like to keep at it, but if no one is that into it, I won\u0027t fret too much about tossing them up at random. Basically what I\u0027m asking for is that you fine folks light a fire under my butt to create some structure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Else are You Hoping to Do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn addition to the usual shows, I\u0027m intending to start doing a new crop of shows, more focused on the history of anime. The three shows I currently have in mind are called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Greatest Characters You\u0027ve Never Heard Of, The Gundam Retrospective\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eA Brief History of Mecha\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0. Greatest Character is going to be focused on older anime and how they\u0027ve influenced the current anime world, in a sort of \u0027Did-You-Know\u0027 style. A Brief History of Mecha is precisely that, starting all the way back in the black-and-white days. Gundam Retrospective looks back over the monolithic franchise that is Gundam, and plots the ups and downs as it went along\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Now What?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, you made it this far. I\u0027m always listening for suggestions of other goals and rewards, and if nothin\u0027 else, I\u0027d love to get a bigger audience. Thanks for taking the time to look!\u003cbr\u003e"
