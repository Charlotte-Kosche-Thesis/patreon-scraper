As I type this there are currently 10,000+ entries ranging from the 1930s to the present. That\u0027s a lot of small press publications but, believe me, it\u0027s only a drop in the bucket.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is something I work on nearly every day but I need to devote more hours per day to make it an amazing resource for you, the readers, fans, creators, historians and collectors of these publications. My goal is to work full-time on the database for a month or two (maybe more, if necessary) just to finish uploading the cover scans and data that I have on hand. I have a nice backlog of historical documents to add as well. There will be plenty more work to do after that but this initial groundwork is what\u0027s important at the moment. The speed at which this can be accomplished depends entirely on patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/h4\u003ePledge amounts are per month. They can be any amount you choose and can be deleted at any time. For example, if you wanted to essentially make a one-time donation you could pledge x-amount and then delete it after the first of the month (when pledges are processed).
