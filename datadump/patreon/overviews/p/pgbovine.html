So far, over 3.5 million people from over 180 countries have used it to debug their code and to tutor one another in real time. In parallel, over the past 20+ years, I\u0027ve grown\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pgbovine.net/overview.htm\"\u003epgbovine.net\u003c/a\u003e into one of the most popular websites for science and engineering students, with over 500 \u003ca href=\"http://pgbovine.net/writings.htm\"\u003earticles\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://pgbovine.net/PG-Vlog-summary.htm\"\u003evlogs\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pgbovine.net/PG-Podcast-summary.htm\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/a\u003e that are viewed nearly a million times each year. I love getting emails from people around the world who use these resources to excel in their classes, get into their dream schools, and get jobs that have changed their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, these websites cost significant amounts of money to run, and their fast-growing traffic makes it hard for me to keep paying for them by myself. Throughout the years, I\u0027ve received many offers for custom advertising and sponsor deals, along with good opportunities to commercialize Python Tutor into a paid product. But I\u0027ve always stubbornly held onto the conviction that \u003cstrong\u003eeducational resources like mine should be 100% free and not beholden to advertisers, sponsors, or investors.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the end, the only funding model I\u0027m comfortable with is one where generous people make donations to keep things free for everyone else. That\u0027s why I\u0027m turning to Patreon to ask for your help in making a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly pledge\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also\u00a0make a \u003cstrong\u003eone-time\u003c/strong\u003e donation with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pgbovine.net/support.htm\"\u003ePayPal or credit/debit card\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping to keep these websites up and running!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ePhilip Guo, December 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhat will my donation be used for?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMost importantly, paying the web registration and hosting fees to keep\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pythontutor.com/\"\u003ePython Tutor\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pgbovine.net/\"\u003epgbovine.net\u003c/a\u003e running so that millions of people each year can continue to benefit from them ($1,000\u2013$2,500 per year).\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eHiring transcription services to add captions and transcripts to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/pgbovine\"\u003ehundreds of educational videos\u003c/a\u003e that I produce ($25\u2013$75 per video, 350+ videos to transcribe).\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eUpgrading my audio/video recording equipment as necessary.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will I get for donating?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ll get the gratitude of millions of current and \u003cem\u003efuture\u003c/em\u003e users of Python Tutor and pgbovine.net, many of whom come from backgrounds where they cannot afford expensive universities or private tutors.
