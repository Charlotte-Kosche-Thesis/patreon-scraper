Since then I have added \u201cMother\u201d to the top of the list of the roles that describe who I am. Making playful, utilitarian objects of clay enriches me. It is how I respond to the world. But India left me wondering, \u201cHow do I respond?\u201d India has motivated me to move beyond observer. PondiWalk directs my creative efforts in such a way as to actively express my commitment as a mother, as a teacher on behalf of the young women of the potters\u2019 caste.  \u2013Tammy Marinuzzi\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndia has a reputation for leaving an indelible mark on many foreign visitors. To walk down the streets of India is an opportunity to choose between feeling assaulted by it or consciously giving in to the submersion, feeling oneself folded in and compressed with her colors, smells, and sounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost ten years ago Tammy Marinuzzi chose submersion while she was a visiting artist at Goldenbridge Pottery in Pondicherry, located in the Tamil Nadu region of Southern India. It\u2019s not surprising she chose to submerge herself, when one considers the mission of Tammy\u2019s studio practice, which is foundationaly about absorbing and reflecting the nuances and absurdities of humanity. Her empathetic sensibilities were set off when she observed the polarities of life at play in India. Nowhere more so than when she visited the Pottery Village of Duvaradimanai where select, devout craftsmen are granted the authority to make life sized terra cotta horses intended to transport the god Ayannar\u2019s spirit soldiers in the night as they watch over the villages and fields.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe global story of loss of habitat may be familiar to our ears, but the loss of economies in developing nations where individuals struggle to adapt is a quieter call to arms. It wasn\u2019t quiet for Tammy, and it isn\u2019t for anyone who stands toe-to-toe with a craftsman fighting to maintain relevancy in the face of the growing plastics and cement industries. Once commissioned to create several horses per year, along with storage jars for rice, water, or spices the village potter of India has been faced with redefining their purpose as the need for their product has slowly dwindled over the decades. Some craftsmen from Duvaradimanai have been successfully carving out a niche market, turning ceremonial objects into object d\u2019art for exhibition throughout India and Europe. The alternative economic evolution is for craftsmen to leave the traditions of the past behind for more secure positions in urban centers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Pondi WalkProject, is a response to these changes. The ramifications of Tammy\u2019s observations did not percolate in her mind all at once. When one is submerged in India, it takes time to sift through the layers of wonderment. Like many who have stood in awe of this culture, she wants to be a steward for its evolution. She has pledged to walk the distance between her home in Panama City, Florida and Pondicherry, India, some 9,000 miles. So far she has walked about 3,000 miles and, in that time, in those footsteps, she has determined the first step toward stewardship, is to go back to the village and build bridges with the members of that community. Her vision is not one set on preserving the traditional societal structures, rather she has asked herself questions about the trickle down effect when a community has to redefine not only their revenue streams, but also their purpose. Specifically, she is concerned about what happens to the young girls, who run the hazard of becoming the least of the least in these scenarios. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe knows now, she needs to know more. She needs to go back and listen with intent, with the question, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d at the forefront of her mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/div\u003e",
