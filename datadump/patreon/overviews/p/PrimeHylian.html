I\u0027ve been creating a large variety of YouTube videos for a large majority of my life, but over the last year I\u0027ve really found my niche and what I enjoy. My content primarily revolves around Game Design discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn example of my work is my analysis of \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1C2-LBuuPU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Challenge and Progression\u003c/a\u003e\", which is a discussion about the difficulty of the latest 3D Zelda game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos take a long time and a lot of effort to produce. Some of the steps include; brainstorming \u0026amp; research, script writing, proof reading, graphic design, video editing, and more. All of these steps can take upwards of 50 hours to produce one video, but that\u0027s how I like it.\u003cbr\u003e I prefer to strive for quality over quantity, but being able to dedicate more time would mean more videos more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created this Patreon page because I want this channel to be a bigger part of my life. I\u0027d like to dedicate more of my time towards this channel and be able to financially invest more into it, more than I currently am. \u003cbr\u003eMy content isn\u0027t monetized, and is entirely produced through passion, so this Patreon works as a means of investment into the channels quality, whether that be for new equipment or resources or just being able to dedicate time to it instead of other areas for finances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who donates will have access to everything this page has to offer.
