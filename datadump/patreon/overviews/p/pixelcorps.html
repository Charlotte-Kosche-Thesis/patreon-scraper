    "summary": "Hey everyone, this is Alex Lindsay... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I learned to do graphics and video... there was no web, no real schools and only one or two books on the subject. I learned by just banging my head on the wall until I broke through. Through the years, I was fortunate enough to get to work in Radio, TV, Games, Interactive and Film. For the last 18 years, I\u0027ve been working in video production and live broadcasting to the internet. Almost all of my learning has been in the \"School of Hard Knocks\". Almost every lesson is a scar. And every scar holds a story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would save you the trouble if I could. That\u0027s what this is all about. We, at the Pixel Corps, will share what we\u0027ve learned about production over the last 25 years. Hopefully, we\u0027ll give you a glimpse of what you might need in the next 5 years. And, of course, we\u0027ll help you with what you need today as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are we going to cover? The wide world of Media production. We see this as a holistic approach. We\u0027ll talk 360 Video, AR (Augmented Reality) VR (Virtual Reality), MR (Mixed Reality), Internet Broadcasting and even 3D, Motion Capture, Drones and LIDAR. If you want to explore this wide world of media with us, we\u0027ll see you on the other side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we doing this? We already have a full time job (production). The answer is simple... we need more of us. We need you. But we need you to know what we\u0027ve already learned. Some of it will be technical, some of it will be logistical and some of it may even be a little philosophical. All of it will be what we think you need to know to be successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for playing. We look forward to seeing you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Alex\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
