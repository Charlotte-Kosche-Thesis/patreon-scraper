    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the Playable Characters Podcast Patreon Page! (PCPPPPPCPPP, give or take),\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are NYC comedians Brian McGuinness, Calvin Cato, and Aalap Patel. And we like video games. Way back in 2017 we were discussing that we all wanted to do some type of video game podcast together, but we wanted it to be different. You can get reviews and previews and opinions pretty much everywhere nowadays, so how could we stand out? Well, I think we did it with our idea: the Playable Characters Podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have funny interviews with real video game characters. That\u0027s it. We have our other comedian/actor/improviser funny friends \u0027play\u0027 pretend to be a video game character and we interview them like they\u0027re an everyday, normal, real person. It\u0027s 100% ad-libbed and improvised and always funny.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve interviewed some of the greats like King Bowser, Glass Joe, the Super Smash TV host, Ms. Pac-Man, and Paperboy. We also get some of the not-so-well-known characters, like a house cleaner from Resident Evil or a fighting game location scout.\u00a0And 40+ episodes later, it\u0027s better than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve all been \u0027in the biz\u0027 for years now and this is one of the funnest and most passionate projects we\u0027ve ever worked on. And that\u0027s where Patreon comes in. We get great feedback from fans and we have a lot of ideas that we want to do down the road, and that costs money. So we\u0027re humbly reaching out to our loyal fans to give them exclusive access to some of our goodies that we have planned. If you like it, give a little. If you can\u0027t, that\u0027s ok too. We hope you enjoy listening and spreading the word about what we do here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs members of this silly community of ours, we\u0027ll have some fun reward tiers for our supporters and new and innovative ideas and merchandise for you as well."
