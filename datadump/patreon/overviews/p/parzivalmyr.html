    "summary": "My name is Parzival Myr. \u00a0I am a solo and collaborative musical artist, singer/songwriter for Seattle rock trio Radical Hearts, and community builder.  Thank you for visiting my Patreon page.  I have been writing songs for nearly 20 years. Over the years I have written in pop, rock, blues, punk, folk, and improvisational forms.  All the while, the sustaining goal has been to reach listeners with an honest and heartfelt look at life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy join this Patreon page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is an ongoing collaboration between artist, listener, and community as a whole. I believe people need music to thrive, and music needs people to inspire it.  This music is designed to help my communities thrive, but it needs you, our community members, to be help it be written in the first place.  I hope that this page will help me, you, and this music develop a closer, ongoing connection, and that we all will be made a little more whole. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will be released on this site?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDemos of unreleased original songs. This may include brand new ones or old songs. (About 2 times/month)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCovers of other artists\u0027 songs. (Occasionally)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWritings connected to the music - blog posts, stories, essays. (Once in a while)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMusic Videos, both \"official\" videos and off-the-cuff. \u00a0(Once in a while)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou decide what amount you\u0027d like to pay per song, and per month. For example, you can pay $5 per song, but set a \"monthly cap\" so you only pay $10/month total. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you pledge $5 or more per song, you\u0027ll also get cool rewards like access to a monthly video update, a postcard or inspiring tidbit in the mail, or even a personalized song written about a topic or story from your life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe content I release will generally not be exclusive, so think of it less like a commercial transaction (\u201cmusic for money\u201d) and more like you\u0027re joining in a great musical venture sailing us towards greater connection and community.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you have questions or suggestions, feel free to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:parzivalmyr@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esend me an email.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
