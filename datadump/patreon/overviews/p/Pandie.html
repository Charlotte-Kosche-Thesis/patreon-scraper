    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eHi! I\u0027m Pandie Suicide, also known as Pandie James. I\u0027m a writer, actress, producer and model originally from New Zealand, but now based in Los Angeles, CA. You may know me from Suicide Girls, from appearing in/ on the cover of magazines like Total Tattoo, Tattoo Flash, Tattoo, Inked Magazine, in music videos by artists such as Taylor Swift, Aerosmith, Pantera and David Lynch through to films I\u0027ve written/ produced myself such as Blood Bath, Massacre, or the upcoming Night Terrorizer, and my short story \u0027Vampire Summer\u0027 and novel \u0027Seraphim Song\u0027 (the last two of which are both available on Amazon, and now as a reward to my patrons!!!)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/fl_progressive:semi,q_auto,f_auto,c_limit,w_695/v1452383921/jklavydwtadpsufojees.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my next project however, I\u0027m doing something a little different! I\u0027m writing a graphic novel! Right now I have a few working titles, the main one I\u0027m thinking of going with being \u0027Light Blood,\u0027 because of course almost anything I make is going to have the word \u0027blood\u0027 in the title! Light Blood is the story of the true origin of the vampire. It\u0027s a tale that involves not only vampires, but what came before them. There\u0027s multiple worlds and dimensions, different timelines and the ultimate war across worlds - it\u0027s the blood of the light versus the blood of the night. Who will win? The only way to find out is to help me get this graphic novel made! And that\u0027s where YOU, my lovely patron, come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pCq8EvwIL.jpg\" style=\"width: 270px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the writing, i\u0027m doing myself and the first draft of the script is about 70% complete. I just need to be able to hire an amazing artist to draw the first 6 pages and a cover in order to pitch the concept to publishers and then be able to pay the artist for the rest of the work! I have been researching and seeking out artists and finding out costs and timeframes. In order to do this I need to have several thousand dollars on hand to spend on pencils/ inks/ colours/ lettering etc (possibly all by the one person). Any and every amount you pledge will go completely to this. If for some amazing reason i should greatly exceed this, leftover funds would be use to finance more of the art being created than just the first 6 pages, and beyond that should the project be completed or picked up by a publisher, funds will go toward getting my new feature film (yep you guess it, it\u0027s a vampire flick!) \u0027Of Bloody Dreams\u0027, a modern day rock n roll vampire flick with a strong female lead, off the ground! In fact as a reward to my patrons, I might just post some exclusive behind the scenes/ first look content for that film here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511cBgYCFgL.jpg\" style=\"width: 231px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the things that I do, and I would love to have you be a part of my exclusive club here, not only getting to see things FIRST, but getting to go behind the scenes with me, and see exclusive photos, videos and blog posts and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to also use this as an opportunity to say a big thank you to everyone that has followed me on social media, everyone who has checked out my work, everyone who has helped me to create my own projects like Blood Bath - I could not have done this without you guys, but especially I want to say a big thank you to you who is reading this page and thinking about becoming my patron, you are all amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dHqXFHan2aU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Pandie\u003cbr\u003e"
