The game wasn\u2019t a big hit at the time, but is now considered a bit of a cult classic.  We don\u2019t have the resources to make a new Plok game so we decided to do something different and revive Plok in the form of a comic strip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.zee-3.com/plok/patreon/plok_character_image.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly we wanted to make something that we could finish and publish on regular basis.  Game development takes a long time, and many projects get cancelled before completion, which means we often go for years without releasing anything at all.  It\u2019s hard to work for so long on creative projects without any feedback from an audience, so we started the comic strip to keep us sane, and give us the satisfaction of releasing something new every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally we wanted to do something a bit different from our day job, something that had a chance to be topical, funny, or even comment on the real world (or at least the world of video games).  All things that we aren\u2019t easily able to do in games themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHow we make the comic strip\u003c/h1\u003eCurrently the comic strip is an evening and weekend job that we try to squeeze in between our regular gamedev work, which we both do from home. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe use online chat to work out ideas for storylines and gags, trying to balance an over-arching plot (that we\u2019re making up as we go along) with more spontaneous, topical gags.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.zee-3.com/plok/patreon/desk_photo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic strip is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned in and lettered and coloured in Photoshop. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEach finished comic strip is then\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.zee-3.com/plok\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublished in the Plok section\u003c/a\u003e of our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.zee-3.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZee-3 website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe plan to release ebook editions of each volume of the comic strip (around 25 comic strips per volume) as we complete them, but we\u2019ll always keep the whole series available for free on our website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat\u2019s the funding for?\u003c/h1\u003eWe don\u0027t earn very much from gamedev (being an indie is hard!) but it\u2019s work that at least has the potential to make money, so the day job always takes priority. \u00a0This means that some weeks can\u2019t find time to work on the comic strip at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a small trickle of income will help to justify spending some time on the comic strip, and might eventually lead to us being able to spend a whole day a week working exclusively on Plok, which will improve the quality and ensure that there\u0027s a new comic strip each week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllocating more time to the comic strip means we\u2019ll be able to arrange regular meet ups to plan future stories in more depth, and we hope to eventually be able to do some longer \u2018Sunday\u2019 strips, with more than four panels, letting us try more complex stories that are less gag based.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding will also help pay the server costs for hosting the comic (Plok generates almost all of the traffic to our server), keep Ste in art supplies, and eventually buy a decent quality Wacom pad and a copy of Manga Studio!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHow the funding will work\u003c/h1\u003eWe\u2019re asking for fans and well-wishers to support us with small contributions on a per-comic strip basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmall, because each comic is only short (they probably only take 10 seconds to read), and per-comic rather than per month so that you\u2019re not funding us if we don\u2019t publish any new comics in a particular month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe aim to publish one new comic strip each week, so that should be four or five new strips per month (we\u2019ve averaged about three per month over the first nine months), although on occasion there might be an extra one if something topical comes up that suggests a new strip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.zee-3.com/plok/patreon/work_comic_strip.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach comic strip will still be published free for everyone on our website, although we plan to offer supporters additional updates for patrons, including layout sketches, pencils, and other background info, before the publication of each strip. \u003cbr\u003e"
