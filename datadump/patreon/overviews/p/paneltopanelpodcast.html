    "summary": "Hello Listeners,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Panel to Panel with your hosts: Alfonso, Diana, Alex and Jeanette. This podcast is a group of friends in Northern California that have come together to talk about conventions, cosplay, comics, geek culture and our interests. \u00a0We hope to bring engaging content and conversations to fans new and old that are into comics and are attending conventions. \u00a0We try to cover a variety of California conventions and chat about our experiences, so everyone can learn more about what it\u0027s like to attend a convention. \u00a0In addition to conventions, we also have a team book club to encourage one another to read unfamiliar comics in order to expand our own reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur podcast episodes are completely free to our listeners. So why do we need your help? Although our episodes are all free, there are a lot of little things that go on behind the scene that slowly add up. \u003cstrong\u003eYour patronage would help in one of the following areas:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudio Hosting fees\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- It costs us $20/month to keep our episodes uploaded and online for your enjoyment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConvention Costs\u003c/strong\u003e - Covering conventions is definitely something we enjoy. \u00a0We always try to apply for panels or press badges to help alleviate costs, but we don\u0027t always get approved. \u00a0As attendees we believe in supporting our conventions by purchasing tickets, but they do get pricey.(Not to mention any travel or hotel costs we\u0027d accrue along the way). Your contributions could help us get to an extra event and give us more to discuss on our program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel Fees\u003c/strong\u003e - When we are recording an episode we have to travel 2 hours round trip to podcast in the same room, so it takes quite a bit of gas and time. We currently don\u0027t have the equipment to provide high quality audio when recording remotely, so recording together is a must right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSound Equipment\u003c/strong\u003e - We\u0027re always looking for ways to improve our sound quality.  Whether it\u0027s a equalizer service per episode or upgrades to our microphones and sound set ups, we want to make sure we get it right. \u00a0If we can upgrade our equipment, we can also produce more episodes remotely and open up to interviewing special guest as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupplementary Material: \u003c/strong\u003eOur podcast is weighted more toward the convention experience, however, we also do a bit of reading, watching, and cosplaying as a group. While we\u0027re not running out of material anytime soon, continued patronage could allow us to exhaust our library, and help encourage us to find new comics, manga, anime or film to talk about or maker materials to try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is a labor of love, but to continue podcasting and growing we would be ecstatic to have support from our awesome listeners. \u00a0We want to continue to provide everyone with great sound quality and amazing content for years to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re unable to make a monthly commitment to our Patreon, you could also support us by buying us some \"coffee\" www.ko-fi.com/paneltopanel. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
