    "summary": "This book wants to be both a collection of tools needed to design an eDemocracy, as well as a set of problems where the reader is invited to apply those tools to try to solve some real world problems, as well as my personal solutions to those problems.\n\nRight now several people are trying to redesign and redefine what democracy is. We now have many new tools that can help the interaction between people. Inevitably most realise how the old way of deciding is not efficient any more. We can do much better. But how to achieve it, is not trivial. This books wants to help in this regard.\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs such several person, from all walks of life, from all positions are facing the challenge of redesigning the decision systems. Those decisions systems can appear anywhere. It could be a nation trying to decide who should sit in the Parliament. It could be a community deciding who their next leader should be. Or it could be a community that have a decision itself\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis book is designed with the intention to be used as a textbook. As such I will present a number of challenges, and invite the reader to present a solution to them. Then I will present my solution. I do not intend to rewrite what has been written before. So generally to start off I shall present a summary about a topic, and then offer the bibliography where the reader can deepen his understanding. Some topics I will present in greater details, others will be mostly a list of books or papers. Usually the topics I will present in greater details will be the topics I know more of, or I am more unsatisfied with how it is presented elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn this book I intend to follow pretty much the following index:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHistory of Democracy:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDemocracy in Bees\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDirect Democracy, from Athens\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eElecting a Dictator\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRepresentative Democracy\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Division of Power\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUniversal Suffrage\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eParticipatory Democracy\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSociocracy \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHolocracy\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Basic Principles:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChecks and Balances and the Division of Power\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne man one vote\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeciding What and How are different\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Basic Tools:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWiki\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVoting Theory\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Median Voter Theorem\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHysteresis\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Blockchain\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStoring a Document forever on The Blockchain\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Pareto Front\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Voting Triangle\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMajority versus Consensus versus Consent\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBanzhaf Power Index\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandling the Information, what, when, how\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnonymity (partial, pseudo, temporary, permitted, forbidden)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Limited Strength \u0026amp; The Decaying Strength\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDecidying who are the experts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eElectoral Colleges\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGits\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChaos vs order vs evolutions.
