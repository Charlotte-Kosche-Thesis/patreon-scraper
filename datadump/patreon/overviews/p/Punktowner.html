    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi. I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eJeffrey Thomas\u003c/strong\u003e, an author\nof...well, you tell me, because I\u0027m not good at classification. I\u0027ve had\nstories reprinted in books with titles like THE YEAR\u0027S BEST HORROR STORIES (DAW\nBooks), THE YEAR\u0027S BEST FANTASY AND HORROR (St. Martin\u0027s Press), and THE YEAR\u0027S\nBEST WEIRD FICTION (Undertow Publications). I\u0027ve been in anthologies with\nsuch themes as New Weird, Cyberpunk, and the Cthulhu Mythos. If I\u0027m diverse, it\u0027s\nbecause I\u0027m restless...I like to explore, and I like to believe I attract the\nexplorative, open-minded reader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here on this site,\nhuckstering for your hard-earned money? Well, if I told you I\u0027m a struggling writer, you\u0027d probably think, \"Only you, huh?\" But it\u0027s like that. I have a fairly demeaning day job that sucks the energy (and maybe the soul) from me, without coming close to covering my bills, and I\u0027m a devoted father to a young daughter and an autistic adult son. Through all this, I still do my best to write fiction (it\u0027s harder to do these days than in the past, when I was quite prolific, but I haven\u0027t thrown in the towel yet).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what am I proposing, here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly I\u0027m just asking\nif people who might like to support my work would be willing to spend at least $1 a\nmonth in order to view currently exclusive content. (For instance, every month\nI myself donate $5 to the \u003cem\u003eLovecraft eZine\u003c/em\u003e,\nplus I support a number of creators here at Patreon.) You need only participate for as long as you want, and can increase or decrease the monthly pledge if desired. But yup, minimum pledge is just $1. Hey, if I shambled my pitiful ass up to\nyou in Starbucks, just as you were about 3/4 of the way through your venti\nCaffe Latte, and asked you if I could finish that dollar\u0027s worth of coffee in order to give myself\nenough energy to complete the story I\u0027m writing, would you say no? WOULD YOU DENY\nME YOUR ONE QUARTER OF A VENTI CAFFE LATTE WITH BACKWASH IN IT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSorry, got carried away. My mind takes\nthese wild flights...see, that\u0027s I mean. But where was I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m proposing for the minimum $1\nmonthly pledge is this: you will have access to the library of short stories archived here on my page...presently 90,000 words worth of stories that as of this writing have not been seen by anyone but my patrons. I will also pop in here to share news, excerpts from works in progress, insights into my work process, videos, maybe some of my artwork, and other goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor pledges of $5 and up, you will also have access to a bunch of my novels and short story collections in e-book format. These are books for which the rights have reverted to me from the original publishers. (In recent years I\u0027ve made these available at Amazon for the Kindle; if you don\u0027t already own them, now you will.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise you this: whatever\nyou read here in my little domain, it will be weird. It will be fantastical, maybe dreamlike, and very\nlikely horrific. It might be set in my dark future milieu of Punktown. It might\ntake place down the road from you. It could be tragic, or humorous. It could be any number of these things combined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this, if you\u0027ll just share that quarter cup of latte with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
