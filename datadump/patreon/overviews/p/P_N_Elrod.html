    "summary": "Gonna let you know up front, I am here because I need the money!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have a chronic condition (Rheumatoid arthritis) that is not going to get better. Because of it, I had to stop working my day job. It\u0027s physically impossible for me to do anything else now but write and edit. Those are my only sources of income and they aren\u0027t enough to cover rent and ordinary bills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, Patreon allows me to have a new day job! I write stuff, put it up, and hope that lots of people will want to read it. While I have contracts with publishers to write more novels, those are slow in coming and don\u0027t pay well. If you\u0027ve followed me on Facebook you\u0027ll have heard all about it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the cold facts, but they don\u0027t mean I won\u0027t put my heart and soul into the writing that goes up here. I am hardwired to deliver my best work. I\u0027ve got nothing but respect for those who take the time to read my words. I will not waste it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon also allows me to explore many different kinds of writing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e TV, film, comic book, and play scripts will turn up here, along with new stories featuring Jack Fleming, Vampire P.I. and Jonathan Barrett, Gentleman Vampire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Facebook I have mentioned a few outside-the-box projects, such as writing \u003cem\u003eThe Worst Novel, Ever\u003c/em\u003e, with Patreon members getting a vote on where the plot goes, depending on their reward level. I will be going for loony. I like loony!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a learning curve involved on this venue, so I hope you\u0027ll be patient if I mess up on technical stuff or if new writing is held up because of my health issues. I have more bad days than good at present, but will do my best on the good days to produce new things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening, and please stop by my Facebook page and follow my posts. That\u0027s where I\u0027ll let everyone know when something new is up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/p.n.elrod\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElrod\u0027s FaceBook Page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
