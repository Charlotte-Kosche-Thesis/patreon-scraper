    "summary": "For those of you that are new, Pokethon is a charity marathon where fans of the Pokemon series of games gather together to have fun, celebrate the franchise, and most importantly, raise money for charity. All funds raised during Pokethon go straight to the charity. We do not take a cent of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are quickly growing, and we hope to raise more and more with every marathon. Our next marathon, Pokethon Revive, aims to be the biggest one yet, not only in attendees, but in development hours, location, and scope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is for those who are interested in supporting the marathon\u0027s upkeep costs. From the cost of cables and lights, to larger expenses like hotel ballrooms, this is for those who want to help the extra mile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, the marathon has become a larger and larger financial burden, so much so, that for me to support it solely alone has become irresponsible. If I were to obtain a job in the future that paid significantly more, I will shut down this patreon, as I would have no need for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, this is my marathon, and as director, I am still responsible to shoulder some of the financial burden. Please, as we say during the marathon, if you cannot give anything due to financial stressors, DON\u0027T. Make sure you, as a person, can eat, commute, and live your life. All we ask, is that if you have some extra savings, it would be deeply valued by everyone in the community for you to offer some back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, these are not donations. Donations is a term I use for giving to those who desperately need something. What this is, is essentially an outlet for those willing to tip me a small portion. I have a Job, but I also pay bills, this helps me pay for Pokethon expenses while allowing me to save my job earned cash for my personal future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere will your money go? Honestly I have a few ideas on larger projects between now and next marathon, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~Upgrading the primary stream computer from a cheaper ATI chipset to an Intel chipset. This will improve the power of the machine, allowing faster renders on large video files, clearer and larger resolution streams, and more room to capture inputs.~~\u00a0-Achieved Thanks to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~Purchasing a second Gameboy Player unit and CD for racing Gen 1,2,3 games.~~ -Achieved Thanks to the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Purchasing a digital video output cable for the Gamecube for pixel perfect capture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Purchasing hotel space, couch for stream, food, and various necessities for attendees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Purchasing lighting equipment for the stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~More props, gags, silly donation incentives, and extra.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note, if something were to happen to me to put myself in a critical financial situation, I might dip into these funds. If I were to do so, I would ask you all prior, unless it was an emergency. This wouldn\u0027t be for buying a burger. I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are giving me your hard earned money. I promise I will always be responsible with it, and transparent with where every cent goes. Its my duty, and I owe it to every one of you all. \u00a0Everyone month, around the 1st, I will send out \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UdZS6BxwdFbuccgCqQ2-KKqI5WMU9utL6xJQ8s53-sA/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis form\u003c/a\u003e to all Patreons, updated with month expenses, as well as a write up as to what I have planned for the coming months. Barring secrets, of coarse. That\u0027s saved for the $5 tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFinally, once again, thank you. I will continue to update this and try to add more tiers and goals for us to hit. You are all wonderful lovely people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
