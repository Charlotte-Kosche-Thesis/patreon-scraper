We are committed to elevating the quality of life and expression for LGBTQ people in Cambodia, in a manner that is local in character and global in significance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe take a simple, symbiotic approach in our work\u2014give LGBTQ people a place within the art of Khmer classical dance and the society it represents and, therefore, give a cherished tradition once nearly annihilated new caretakers and life. We are doing this in a tough environment, in a country still grappling with the effects of genocide, and one with little funding resources for independent, artist-led endeavors like our own. This is why we are asking for our family, friends, and kindred-spirits all across the world to join us in empowering the next generation of LGBTQ artists with the skills to question, explore, and shape the world around them. Help us show gay beauty, strength, and resilience, transform a legacy of loss, war, and trauma into wholesome rebuilding that pushes for new heights!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e47ae6_ab5ff2ab735345b5b49fae679d494601~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_955,h_638,al_c,q_85/e47ae6_ab5ff2ab735345b5b49fae679d494601~mv2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAny amount that you can give will be accepted with utmost gratitude.

Our artistic director firmly believes that nurturing an artist is to nurture the entirety of someone\u2019s being, and artists who dance with dignity, freedom, and independence can only do so when they have the means to live with dignity, freedom, and independence as well.
