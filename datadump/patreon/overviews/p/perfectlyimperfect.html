    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! I\u0027m Gavin from the south east of England, and I like to make things! Most of my projects use cheap and easy to get hold of materials and very simple tools and techniques, meaning you can build along with me and make something that looks awesome but doesn\u0027t cost the earth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo share my knowledge with the world of makers! I am doing this in the way of video tutorials, so be sure to head over to YouTube to check out my channel (don\u0027t forget to subscribe!) Now I\u0027m not pretending that I\u0027m some sort of grand master in all things makey, but I am proficient enough in many different skills that come in handy for all sorts of projects. This combined with my knack of always finding the simplest, no nonsense solution to any given problem results in some pretty awesome accomplishments. \u003cbr\u003e- Wireless open/close Iron Man face-plate using less than $30 of electronics you can get anywhere\u003cbr\u003e- Mechanical (not electrical) articulated jaw on a Venom costume\u003cbr\u003e- Cheap, bright and robust lightsaber that is perfect for duelling\u003cbr\u003e- EVA foam replica of Batman\u0027s tumbler in FULL SCALE\u003cbr\u003eTo name but a few! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Perfectly Imperfect\", what the hell does that even mean?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are two sides to this. The first is where I see myself as a maker. There are other makers that make high end props/costumes over a period of many months, and costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Then at the other end of the spectrum there are others making things out of old recycled materials for a few dollars that result in a not so great finished product. So you have perfect and imperfect, I see myself as most of the good points of both, projects that don\u0027t cost a fortune, utilise simple techniques, and everyday tools to achieve an awesomely finished item.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second side of this is more of a way of thinking. There is no such thing as perfection, it is an unobtainable goal, a goal that as we learn and grow, and move closer towards, it moves further away, always just out of reach. But that\u0027s ok, because that means you are always striving to be better, learning new things, to equip yourself to take on bigger challenges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCough up some dough! No seriously, even if its just $1 per month, this combined with the generous contributions of others will allow me to take on bigger and better builds, and more frequently too, all the while taking you guys along for the ride so that you can have a go yourself. If you can\u0027t donate then that\u0027s cool too, you can still help! Likes and shares are a great way to support me, and it only costs you the time it takes to to click a button!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to visit my Patreon page, please also consider checking out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PerfectlyImperfectCosumesAndProps/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e page and Subscribing to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8LjT_KMMr1puSdGfK25kA/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e channel, and remember, \"You don\u0027t have to be great at making, to make something great!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
