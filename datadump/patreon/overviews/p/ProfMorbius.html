I watched the classic movie \u003cem\u003eForbidden Planet\u003c/em\u003e at a young age, instilling me with a lifelong love of science fiction and providing me with my pen name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing, and dream of one day becoming talented enough to be published. I might not be skilled enough yet, but I haven\u0027t given up working for it. Practice makes perfect, as they say, so I\u0027m currently sharpening my writing skills by producing fanfiction, which is available to read at \u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/~profmorbius.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.fanfiction.net/~profmorbius\u003c/a\u003e. Go ahead and check out my stories \"Nanoha Genesis Evangelion\", a \u003cem\u003eNanoha/Evangelion\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0crossover; and \"Fate/Parallel Fantasia\", a \u003cem\u003eFate/Stay Night\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0mega-crossover with a number of other anime series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever,\u00a0like my namesake, I am under assaulted by a monster born of my innermost dark thoughts. Withering doubt about my skill, crushing shame over what I\u0027ve published, all-consuming despair over my ability to make something of myself. My monster assails me with thoughts that my writing will never be good enough for me to support myself financially, and I should give it up for a real job to make real money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I asking for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear: you are not paying for my writing. My stories will continue to be published on Fanfiction.net, free for everyone to read, for so long as I am able to continue writing them. If you choose to pledge, you are sponsoring me as an artist, giving me the financial reassurance I need to decide to invest my time in writing fanfiction (and, hopefully, eventually my own original fiction). It\u0027s a vote of support for my viability as an author, a heartening cry of \"Don\u0027t give up!\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is set up for per-chapter payment, meaning your donation will be made each time I post a finished chapter. Under normal circumstances, I will aim to post one to two chapters per month. Life being what it is, though, I can\u0027t guarantee that there won\u0027t be setbacks, delays, or other assorted difficulties. You only donate when a chapter is completed: if I don\u0027t post anything, you don\u0027t pay anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is possible that the miraculous fortune might allow me to post more often than anticipated. If you don\u0027t want to worry about unexpected charges, you can set a cap for your maximum contribution per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get for donating?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery time I post a new chapter of fanfiction, it will be accompanied by an exclusive Patreon post for backers. In these posts, I\u0027ll talk about how my writing is progressing, what\u0027s coming up next chapter, exclusive behind-the-scenes extras related to my current story, and maybe even some discussion about future projects down the pipeline -- fanfiction and original fiction that I hope to write once my current project\u0027s done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I asking for just one dollar? Because this isn\u0027t my end goal. I\u0027m not looking to retire off of the dividends from my fanfiction. All I\u0027m looking for is motivation. A way to silence the inner demons that tell me I\u0027m pouring out my soul and getting nothing in return. A token of validation that my writing is not worthless. Just enough of a push to convince me that I can actually do this for real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQuestions? Comments?\u00a0\u003ca\u003eContact me\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0I promise I\u0027ll do my best to respond to every e-mail.\u003cbr\u003e"
