So, why should you consider pledging a monthly dollar to sponsor PinkAppleJam?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working on my \"\u003ca href=\"http://ukcomics.wikia.com/wiki/Biomecha\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBiomecha\u003c/a\u003e\" story for many years now. It was one of the earliest UK indie comics that was influenced by Japanese comics and game artwork. I have published 400 pages since starting, and 200 pages of the entire story remain. So I\u0027ve been working on a relaunch with the consistent aim to finish it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/516dba5be4b048c970495bee/58a8b34f44024386af6759b8/58a98432b3db2bfa5dee9964/1487504539794/3_Biomecha.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe edited version of the original comic has\u00a0new dialogue developed for it with my editor-friend, and I am working on reprinting Book 1, plus getting the individual issues for Book 2 polished, ready for book format publishing. After that, all that remains is Book 3 - for the story to be completed. With a little editorial assistance from my good friend, I\u0027m continuing to work on it independently - and that means compiling a budget to get the product printed and completed in it\u0027s entirety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.squarespace.com/static/516dba5be4b048c970495bee/516f127be4b06eef917f57b7/516f128ee4b035dc80eda280/1366233744428/BM8.jpg?format=1000w\" style=\"width: 553px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBiomecha \u003c/em\u003eis an intermittently-published comic by myself (Laura Watton-Davies). It\u00a0combines science fiction with romantic comedy/tragedy. Launched in 1995, it was one of the earliest British comics to be inspired by Japanese comics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an indie storyteller I want to do the whole \"beginning, middle and end\" thing... to finish what I started, but to use it to explain to others why starting your own thing is extremely awesome, fun and rewarding. \u00a0It also stylistically represents what the older UK anime and manga scene was experiencing at the time, so it has that extra added \u0027bonus\u0027 of being a bit of old UK manga fandom \u0027history\u0027. It predates the culture of webcomics... but this is something that Patreon sponsorship is currently exploring.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://BiomechaComic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBiomechaComic.com\u003c/a\u003e and .co.uk host the story in it\u0027s current form. Biomecha will be available to read online at one point in it\u0027s entirety, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways this is a mini documentary-video about me and why I do what I do by another awesome friend.

Well, I want to get my stories out there and to encourage other readers (especially younger ones) to go for broke with their own - to develop their own stories and draw them, get them out there too, and importantly, get them FINISHED! I\u0027m extremely enthusiastic about comics and visual forms of narrative. Even though company-publishing avenues are narrow in the UK, the bountiful exploration of small print indie publishing is forever growing. Be your own boss!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/516dba5be4b048c970495bee/58a8b34f44024386af6759b8/5a11d3489140b7281e1e0f3a/1511117677344/4_Patreon.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eWhen I was at school, like many other kids, I retreated into my own world. That world has stayed by my side since the mid-90\u0027s (it\u0027s a very loyal universe!). Along my path through education and young adulthood I always found time to draw my comic - even when life decided to go on \u0027hard mode\u0027, even with all it\u0027s distractions I was always grounded when I was able to find time to concentrate on doing my own work. It is a process that has helped \u0027recalibrate\u0027 me and help me maintain focus - even when doing different comic stories, this one has always maintained it\u0027s presence in my life and is always a focal point for conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//static.squarespace.com/static/516dba5be4b048c970495bee/516f127be4b06eef917f57b7/516f128ee4b09cc422db41d9/1366233743734/BM7.jpg?format=1000w\" style=\"width: 550px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBiomecha It is a project that maintains it\u0027s presence close to my heart and is worked on whenever I get chance.\u00a0This Patreon account started in mid-2014. I\u0027ve never done a pledge account, Kickstarter funder or anything like this. I\u0027m really interested in the service that Patreon offers, the support of a consistent $1 (approx. 60p) - it\u0027s not a massive donation, so to me it totally feels better than the pressure for both sides to contribute/provide immediately for that lump sum though of course I would not complain if anyone wanted to go for the bigger sums and cancel after a while! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers this; donations are taken at the end of each month so after it has left your account via PayPal, you can cancel. The idea of \"being a patron\", you\u0027re totally supporting the creator, helping them out so they can do that work, a total investment :) So far it is working out brilliantly, and I am grateful for everyone\u0027s time and sponsorship. In return for the sponsorship I email small statements of progress and what\u0027s happening in my world of comics, stories about what was happening at the time of original Biomecha publication, and cat pics! :3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBiomecha is a story has taken a while to unfold and I know it needs to end. It must end! And like most self-published pieces, it would not be possible without fellow readers, artists, friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your patience while I roll with these new ways of tech-progression which enables my stories to get out there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA monthly Patreon subscription donation is a contribution to the PinkAppleJam comics tip jar. Every little bit helps.\u00a0I am sincerely grateful for your continued sponsorship and support!"
