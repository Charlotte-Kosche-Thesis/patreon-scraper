It feels good to voluntarily support something you find value in.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePastor With No Answers Podcast! \u00a0So many questions. \u00a0So many perspectives. \u00a0So many doubts. \u00a0So much reevaluating, about so many things. \u00a0The conversations are too important to ignore. \u00a0Other voices are too imperative to be viewed as lesser. The church needs to figure out how to include more voices and refrain from scorning/alienating those within the church who are sincerely doubting while searching for truth. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin and support this community of people from all walks of life. \u00a0People who want these discussions unfiltered, with an agenda of seeking truth, and delivered without the pretense."
