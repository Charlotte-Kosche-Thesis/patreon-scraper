I still want to showcase more games on my channel. \u00a0The gaming community is a great and have enjoyed being a small part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank each and everyone who has supported me so far simply by subscribing and watching the 1000s of videos I have produced. \u00a0My goal here is to simple. \u00a0I want to showcase and play more games. \u00a0To showcase and review more action figures (Power Rangers \u0026amp; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). \u00a0Be able to produce better quality content and upgrade the equipment I use. \u00a0I look forward to the future beyond today. \u00a0To feature the many great games publishers are releasing and share the experience with my fans!! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you in advance for becoming patrons and supporting my channel. \u00a0It\u0027s going to be a fun ride!!"
