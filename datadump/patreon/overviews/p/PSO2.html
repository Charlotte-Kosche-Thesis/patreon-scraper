At first, we were a small group (it used to be just me and the original story translator!), but over time we\u0027ve grown expontentially, and have been able to accomplish things that seemed impossible at the time (translating items, titles, story, tutorials, etc). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of now, PSO2 JP is largely translated into English, with new patches/items being translated and worked on the same day (sometimes before the servers even come back up!). We\u0027re continuing to work towards our goal of a \u003cstrong\u003e100% english translation, with translations up-to-date as new content comes out. \u003c/strong\u003eKeeping this in mind, we also strive to make the installation/patching/playing process as simple and straightforward as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA lot of people in our group don\u0027t play PSO2 anymore, but continue to work on it because of our love for the game and its fans - \u003cem\u003ePeople like you!\u003c/em\u003e We grew up with Phantasy Star, and want to continue to allow everyone to experience the joy and wonder of this series. We aim to provide high-quality, easy to install translations, so anyone can enjoy this game without worrying about the technical aspects of it. Just install, click a button, and play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money earned from this Patreon will help cover server bills, equipment costs, living expenses, and more! The less I have to stress about trying to make sure bills are paid, the more time I can put into working on the game. \\o/ If you appreciate what we do, please consider becoming a patron and supporting our work - Any amount is very helpful, no matter how small or large.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, and thank you for your continued support over the years.
