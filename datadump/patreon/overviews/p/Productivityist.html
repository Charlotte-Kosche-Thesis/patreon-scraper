    "summary": "I have pledged to take Productivityist to a whole new level, and one of the things I did to make that happen is develop my latest podcast offering dubbed\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivityist Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week you\u0027ll get a fresh episode of The Productivityist Podcast. The podcast will often feature a discussion with a guest (or guests) who is doing something really cool and impactful in the world of personal productivity, and as a Patreon supporters you\u0027ll receive the discussion in its entirety. I\u0027m also delivering 4 bonus episodes per month to every Patreon supporter and these episodes will feature additional exclusive content from the weekly episodes that you can\u0027t hear anywhere else. Each weekly episode will last no longer than 60 minutes and the bonus episodes will last no longer than 20 minutes each.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I\u0027m going to creating additional bonus downloads for patrons to enjoy every month.I look at this community as a tremendous place to test out new ideas and help others. Delivering content that goes beyond the podcast is\u00a0another way for me to add value and build a better community in one fell swoop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created, produced, and hosted many podcasts over the last several years, like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/work-awesome/id404684869?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorkAwesome\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/workflowing/id498796697?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorkflowing\u003c/a\u003e. I consistently receive requests to test out new apps, and I can\u0027t write about all of them. This podcast gives me an outlet to do that. I have interviewed the best of the best in the productivity and business realm: Stever Robbins, Seth Godin, Jason Womack, Jonathan Fields, and David Allen. This podcast gives me an outlet to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to apply my expertise to talk about apps, books, and chat with guests (and more), and this venture gives me the outlet to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eSo...\u003cem\u003ewhy Patreon\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really like the idea of what Patreon offers to both creators and patrons. It\u0027s like an ongoing Kickstarter.\u00a0By using Patreon I can provide those who want to receive more from me an option that allows them to choose how much to contribute. There\u0027s real value in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Productivityist Podcast is a free content addition to the Productivityist platform, but with your help I can make it even better. You get to help shape this podcast, both through your generosity of your monetary support - no matter the amount - and by sharing your thoughts in the Patreon activity area.\u00a0If you offer $1 a month, you\u2019re getting each weekly episode for about 25 cents. If you decide to donate $10 a month, you\u2019ll be getting each weekly episode for $2.50...that\u0027s less than the cost of a latte.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd if you just want to listen to the show, that\u0027s cool too.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://productivityist.simplecast.fm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s where you can do that directly.\u003c/a\u003e Who knows? After a few listens you may decide to come back here and pitch in what you can, right?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for taking the time to visit my Patreon page and thank you for your support. I hope my work at Productivityist is helping you in your quest to stop guessing and start going.\u003cbr\u003e"
