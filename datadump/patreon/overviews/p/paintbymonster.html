I am committed that Paint By Monster be high quality, family-friendly entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaint By Monster is the first Art I\u0027ve ever made that uses everything I know and love how to do. I hope to grow the show into a successful cottage business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have 4 goals in mind for each show:\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 to INSPIRE others to create things.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 to PERSUADE that excellence is worth pursuing.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 to INSTRUCT how to think and see like an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 to ENTERTAIN with humor and the display/discussion of the creative process\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdults and children have both told me they wake up with some of the songs in their heads, which fills me with joy (and mischief).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far, please watch a few of my episodes and consider supporting me. My goal is one new episode every week, something that lasts between 6 to 10 minutes. I would like to work toward making shorter daily episodes, but will not charge Patrons for those. Think of my show as a street performance. YouTube is the street I perform on, and Patreon is the hat that gets passed around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo Make Some ART!\u003cbr\u003e"
