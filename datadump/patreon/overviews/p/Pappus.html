So improving on your own you might need have to read 3-4 guides covering the same topic just to confirm the information and pray to the gods that you didn\u0027t join a game late or almost all guides will be invalidated by patches anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe games I cover will be kept up-to-date in case of major patches for several iterations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Game: Friday 13: The Game\u003cbr\u003e-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eB2B for developers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust privately message me under manuel.nilsson@web.de\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is many reasons to have your game adequately tested not for critical bugs, but for critical flaws and oversights. I do offer various services just talk to me about what you have in mind and you will have a gaming veteran at your side.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think you can just release a game and balance it with the \ncommunity feedback it also means that you will lose players until at \nleast satisfactory balance has been struck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no second-chances for most games and to re-balance something already in circulation costs a lot more than balancing something as it is developed.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
