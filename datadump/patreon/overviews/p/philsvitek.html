    "summary": "Hello patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, let me thank you for visiting this page. Secondly, I appreciate you taking the time to read this section. It already means more than you can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow please allow me to highlight my vision/goal. I am an big advocate of education and learning. I believe our value in life never should be valued by what we now, but rather by what we do when we don\u0027t know. I also uphold the notion that ideas are meant to be shared so they can benefit everyone. As such, I\u0027m creating a weekly series that showcases the many nuggets I\u0027ve been fortunate to pick up along the way from amazing mentors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more support there is, the greater resources I can allocate to this project. To begin with, I will publish one episode a week in video and audio form. It\u0027ll mainly be me talking directly to camera, but who knows where we can go from there in time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, your generosity will help fuel my passion to create other content as well. I\u0027m already in the midst of a few passion projects (such as writing a novel). As this grows, I\u0027d love to take input from you as to what you\u0027d like to see me put my efforts into. Such projects will be awarded for the various levels of support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esincerely,\u003cbr\u003ePhil Svitek\u003cbr\u003e"

He was All State in track \nand captain of the varsity soccer team. The \u003ca href=\"http://www.theday.com/article/20111219/SPORT03/312229726\"\u003ePhil Svitek Heart and Hustle Award\u003c/a\u003e was created in Phil\u2019s honor and is awarded annually to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\nHe biked 180 miles in one day and one summer averaged 50 miles per day.\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom age 16, he worked at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.hospice.com/\"\u003eConnecticut Hospice\u003c/a\u003e,\n the first hospice in America, for four years. There, in addition for \ncaring for the terminally ill, he filmed and edited the hospice\u2019s 30 \nyear anniversary documentary. The doc aired on ABC and was #1 in it\u2019s \ntime slot..\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCollege:\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn college he edited a documentary on New Hampshire\u2019s back-country skiing at Mt. Washington called \u003ca href=\"http://firstrunfeatures.com/intrepiddescentdvd.html\"\u003eIntrepid Descent.\u003c/a\u003e And he produced over 500 videos for \u003ca href=\"http://www.gardengirltv.com/\"\u003eGarden Girl TV\u003c/a\u003e which highlights gardening and urban sustainable living.\u003cbr\u003e\nSvitek\u2019s teacher \u003ca href=\"http://www.emerson.edu/news-events/emerson-college-today/emerson-says-goodbye-two-longtime-colleagues#.WJuv3RBX3AA\"\u003ePete Chvany\u003c/a\u003e recommended him to past student and \u003ca href=\"http://www.emerson.edu/\"\u003eEmerson College\u003c/a\u003e alum \u003ca href=\"http://mariamenounos.com/\"\u003eMaria Menounos\u003c/a\u003e who was making a movie in the area. The movie was \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Serial-Buddies-Artie-Lange/dp/B00DIR2OEC\"\u003eAdventures of Serial Buddies\u003c/a\u003e and Svitek did more than prove his worth to Menounos and partner \u003ca href=\"http://kevenundergaro.com\"\u003eKeven Undergaro\u003c/a\u003e. Svitek edited and co-produced the successful indy comedy.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen the movie wrapped, Undergaro felt a debt to Svitek and was \ndetermined to keep him employed. It was one of the driving forces that \nhelped inspire the creation of \u003ca href=\"http://afterbuzztv.com\"\u003eAfterBuzz TV\u003c/a\u003e. Currently the network is the world\u2019s largest online broadcast network and is dedicated to producing TV discussion shows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLaunching AfterBuzz:\u003c/h3\u003e\nUndergaro introduced Svitek to \u003ca href=\"http://adamcarolla.com\"\u003eAdam Carolla\u003c/a\u003e\n and the world of podcasting. Svitek was hooked. Next, Undergaro \noutlined the plan to build studios and to create a bonafide worldwide, \nonline broadcast network solely dedicated to producing TV after-shows. \nNo such outlet existed at the time. As Undergaro often told Svitek in \nhis usual odd cryptic manner, \u201cThere is no Coke to our Pepsi, no \nCadillac to our Lexus. We have to start from scratch.\u201d And start from \nscratch they did.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe technology was in its infancy and so they read tech manual after \ntech manual and drafted plans after plans. There was very little sleep \nand much trial and error but the duo got the network up and \nbroadcasting. They created a innovative platform and technology that was\n the first of its kind. In a matter of months, the \u003ca href=\"http://afterbuzztv.com\"\u003eAfterBuzz TV\u003c/a\u003e network was broadcast in over 70 countries to 100\u2019s of thousands of fans.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDigital Networks:\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn 2015, the network received 1 billion downloads. AfterBuzz TV \nproduced over 100 hours of original content weekly, had over 200 hosts \nand was viewed/listened in over 150 countries. 53% of the network\u2019s \naudience is international. After the first few years, Svitek took the \nreigns of AfterBuzz, overseeing operations of the entire network.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe success of AfterBuzz spawned the creation of a sister network, \u003ca href=\"http://blackhollywoodlive.com\"\u003eBlack Hollywood Live\u003c/a\u003e, the world\u2019s first urban online broadcast network. Heralded by \u003ca href=\"http://oprah.com\"\u003eOprah\u003c/a\u003e\n as \u201cthe next big thing in Hollywood\u201d, Black Hollywood Live programming \nfeatures shows in entertainment news, legal affairs, lifestyle, fashion,\n celebrity interviews, politics and sports. Svitek works closely with \nBHL President of Programming \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DerrialChriston?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"\u003eDerrial Christon\u003c/a\u003e overseeing operations.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen AfterBuzz TV fans demanded movie discussion, the \u003ca href=\"http://popcorntalknetwork.com\"\u003ePopcorn Talk Network\u003c/a\u003e was formed. PTN produces 16 original shows and achieved 10 million downloads in its first year alone. \u003ca href=\"http://bookcircleonline.com\"\u003eBook Circle Online\u003c/a\u003e\n was created next, featuring author interviews and book discussion. \nSvitek manages all four networks, and thus was named Chief Operating \nOfficer for each of them. A prodigy who continues to marvel influencers \nand celebrities alike, Svitek believes he has far more to learn and \nachieve. In what little time he has, he enjoys movies, TV, reading, \nplaying soccer and caring for his two rescue dogs, Sparky and Chloe.",
