    "summary": "\u003cem\u003ePeter and Company\u003c/em\u003e is a comic that I have published online since 2005. Several years later in 2012, I partnered with Spark-Flow Studios to pitch the concept of an animated series based on the comic and fund a pilot episode via Kickstarter. The campaign was successful and the pilot episode was funded, which is now in production. Since then we have come up with some fantastic ideas for how to make the pilot even greater.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging as a patron to \u003cem\u003ePeter and Company\u003c/em\u003e, you will be contributing to both the comic and the future animated series. The more funds we can raise for the series\u0027 budget, the better quality we will be able to make the pilot episode and the greater chance we have of delivering a successful pitch. Individual comic updates will continue even after the animated series is launched, and will be posted to the official site regularly every other Monday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will not only fund regular updates to the comic and increase the potential of the pilot, but will also assist with the completion/publishing of future book collections and other P\u0026amp;C-related projects! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead the entire comic online for free at \u003ca href=\"http://www.peterandcompany.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.peterandcompany.com\u003c/a\u003e or on the Katbox at \u003ca href=\"http://peterandcompany.katbox.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://peterandcompany.katbox.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://peterandcompany.com/random/title.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a pledge of just $5 a month, you gain access to a TON of additional content to supplement the online comic, all of which is listed below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll comics posted several days early before they are posted to the \nwebsite!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n WIP Sketch scans for each comic page as well! \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive artwork, sketches, and colored images of the Peter \u0026amp; Company cast.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive access to hi-resolution desktop wallpapers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Ask the Characters\" Feature on Tumblr\u003c/strong\u003e - Questions are asked directly of the cast via Tumblr messages, and full-color responses will be posted.\u003cem\u003e Responses will be posted here exclusively for Patreon members with each new comic update, and then uploaded to the Tumblr for the general public with the following update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive previews of the animated pilot episode and upcoming animated series.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMember-exclusive discount prices/bundles on future book collection releases.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Ancient Archives of Peter \u0026amp; Company -\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Everyone starts somewhere. As a young cartoonist, I had produced a good 6 years\u0027 worth of comics and artwork between 1998 and 2004 for what was intended to be the original version of \u003cem\u003ePeter \u0026amp; Company\u003c/em\u003e, prior to the Guardian reboot in 2005. Throughout each month I will be sharing pieces of the original series, giving glimpses into how I got my start in cartooning and how each character came to be. Some of this material is extremely rough and isn\u0027t typically something a professional artist would want to share with the general public, BUT I\u0027M GONNA DO IT ANYWAY!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive access to all book-exclusive comics.
