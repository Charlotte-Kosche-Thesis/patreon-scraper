I\u0027ve been drawing as long as I could hold a pencil and it\u0027s been something I\u0027ve been very passionate about for a long time! I\u0027ve always been interested in telling stories with fun characters, and in my high school years I filled notebooks with random comics.\u003cbr\u003eI also have a deep love for monsters and horror movies, which is something I like to incorporate into my art.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? Where does the money go?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to make a living off of creativity. As of late, I\u0027m getting fewer and fewer hours at my retail job and would like to do my best to work my way to doing art full time. I wholeheartedly love what I do and I want to be able to live, breathe and bleed art without worrying about how I\u0027m going to pay my bills. With your support on Patreon, I can do art full time, and put out updates for my webcomic more frequently!\u003cbr\u003eThe earnings from Patreon go towards bills, eating food, paying for upgrades on my equipment, and back into materials for making products!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, rewards include things like works in progresses, discord roles, first looks at new projects and even reading the new comic pages in high resolution before they\u0027re released. In the future I would love to be able to send out prints and accessories in the mail for your patronage!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat work do you have in store?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m working on my webcomic Nothing Ordinary. It\u0027s a story about an orderly at a mental facility coming to terms with the bizarre and supernatural elements of the world around him. It\u0027s a project I\u0027ve been working on for a few years, but I\u0027ve only recently picked up steam on releasing comics for.\u003cbr\u003eNothing Ordinary isn\u0027t the only webcomic I\u0027m working on though! Currently I have a backlog of projects that I would love to do in the future, and possibly work on multiple projects at once if money and scheduling works out well. I think with your help on Patreon, I could be working on multiple stories at once!\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I\u0027ve conceptualized original pieces for clothing, accessories and collectibles that I would love to bring to life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
