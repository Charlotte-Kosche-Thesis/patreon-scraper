My name\u0027s Alex, but you may know me from the internet as \u003cstrong\u003epicopepin\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003ebere\u003c/strong\u003e (or \"king\" by a long stretch)! I am a freelance illustrator with a couple years of industry experience on projects like Heroes of Newerth and Skylanders Battlecast. I graduated from RMCAD in 2013 and recently curated a Mettaton Fanzine (\u003ca href=\"http://mtt-fanzine.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epsstt over here\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year and a half I\u0027ve come to discover that the more love you dedicate to a piece the better it looks. When you pair your love for something, be it a show, a game, a comic, or even your own original content, with the love that others foster for it, the results are INCREDIBLE. There is a staggering difference between pieces made with sharing in mind and the work you have to keep hidden for either personal or legal reasons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue to set aside time for pieces that my patreons can enjoy but I cant do it without your help. But I dont want this to be a one way street either! In addition to illustrating for your viewing pleasure I want to lend my experience and methodology to other content creators so that they may find a comfortable way of seeing their concepts from start to finish!"
