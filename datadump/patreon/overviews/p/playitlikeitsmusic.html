Start \u003ca href=\"http://playitlikeitsmusic.com\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst off: Thank you so much for listening!  It was a risk to start making the show and we are so happy that you like it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a podcast where professional musicians talk shop and craft.  Since we have yet to find the show we really want to hear, this is our attempt at making one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we making it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor people who play,\u00a0produce or even just fantasize about music, the question persists long into our careers: how do I become the best \u003cem\u003emusician\u003c/em\u003e possible?  Since professionals and fans are equally mystified by the mechanisms and spirits at play in music, they should have a channel where active players from different scenes share thoughts and experiences with each other.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cPlay It Like It\u2019s Music\u201d is one such channel made by, for, and about working players. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e We know we need it.  Maybe you do as well.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s not centered around one genre.  It\u2019s not about gear.  It\u2019s not trying to sell you anything.  We are only here to connect around our daily pursuit of musical excellence, which means something different to everybody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe host is just one guy and he does his thing: makes records, plays a few weddings, subs a little on Broadway, does the occasional jingle session, plays on the road sometimes.  It\u2019s all great and he meets all these great people while doing it.  Stars and non-stars alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a way to preserve some of the fun on tape and share it with the community.  Because musicians meeting each other is \u003cem\u003efun\u003c/em\u003e.  So is working together, swapping stories about how we got here, survival tales, inspiration, sorrows, trade secrets, lessons learned and a few laughs.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re all out here.  Eventually we\u2019d like to talk to you too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou may have some questions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What is Patreon?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the place where you show your financial support for this project.  It is safe and it is exciting.  It will make you feel good and keep the show going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why should I support the show?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should only support the show if you feel it is worth supporting.  As with most musical experiences, you get to be the judge.  But since it takes considerable resources to produce it, your contributions are the best way to acknowledge that it benefits you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"How much money do you need from the listeners?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn one sense, you can treat our Patreon like the tip jar at the local club.  The host will buy himself a sandwich on the way back from each interview.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you \u003cem\u003ereally like\u003c/em\u003e the show, then please give us a bit more so that it can grow.  Here are some of the ways we want to expand:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease episodes more frequently. \u003c/strong\u003e How about twice a week?  3x?  There are plenty of players out there, but to do this will take substantial listener support.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHire a professional producer and editor\u003c/strong\u003e to improve the quality of the show.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel to visit musicians in other places. \u003c/strong\u003e You know you\u2019re everywhere.  We want to talk to you on your own turf.\u00a0 Philly, NoLa, Chicago, Prague, LA, Rio, Nashville, London, Trenton... there\u0027s no end.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive events.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 How about recording an interview with a great local player, on stage in your town?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther things.\u003c/strong\u003e Lots of other potential things, but let\u0027s start with the above.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Can\u2019t you run ads to get this money?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe maybe could.  But do you want to deal with ads?  Do you enjoy listening to them? We\u0027re not against having ads on the show, but if we start taking ads then we\u2019ll have to tailor the content in order to please the advertisers. For now we\u2019d rather keep our focus on serving hardworking musicians\u2019 interests, many of which have been sidelined (to say the least) by the prevalence of the ad model.  If you agree with us on this, then you must chip in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"How much time goes into producing each episode?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than you think, and more than might seem reasonable.  We want to make it as good as possible, so we spend the time.  It\u2019s not like making a record, but it\u2019s pretty intense to put a new one up every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What are you gonna give me in return?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly just the satisfaction of being involved.\u00a0 But also VIP treatment at live events, special access and bonus content.\u00a0 You can\u0027t buy your way onto the show, but you can get closer to the action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you SO MUCH for your participation and support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love you,\u003cbr\u003eTrevor (and all the guests)\u003cbr\u003e"
