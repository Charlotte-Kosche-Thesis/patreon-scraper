    "summary": "Hello! Welcome to POET IN BANGKOK! Or at least our Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn every episode of our podcast, we speak with artists living and working in Bangkok. We hear their stories, and try to piece together a larger narrative about making art and self-expression despite the Martian invasion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s that? Oh yes: there\u2019s a twist! While our exploration of the arts in Thailand is non-fictional, the podcast is set against a fictional backdrop. That\u0027s right. In the world of POET IN BANGKOK, humans have traveled to Mars: a planet that we\u2019ve been terraforming since the early 1990s! We know! Crazy!\u00a0\u003cem\u003eHarbinger 1,\u003c/em\u003e the first manned mission to Mars has lost contact with Earth, and the second mission landed in early 2016 -- and much drama ensued!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, as our podcast unfolds into its second season listeners will hear lively conversations about art and censorship in Bangkok (and the USA...), and get carried deeper into a serialized story about what\u2019s happening on Mars and how it impacts us here on Earth!   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you\u0027re reading this you probably know all that already--and have been listening to us on Soundcloud, iTunes, or Stitcher. Or reading our musings on Bangkok, art, and Mars on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.poetinbangkok.com \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour website.\u003c/a\u003e Thanks for listening--you\u0027re awesome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePOET IN BANGKOK is a labor of love by two independent artists. If you like what we\u0027re up to, and would enjoy hearing more of our project (like in a second season!), we\u0027d love your support! A few bucks an episode would mean the world to us! So thanks!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re unfamiliar with Patreon, here\u0027s how it works. Basically it\u0027s a way to directly support artists by pledging a certain amount for each piece of art they create. For example, you might decide to pledge $3 for each episode of the podcast. So each time we create an episode of POET IN BANGKOK, $3 is charged to your credit card. (You can also set up a maximum donation amount too, if you like). For each pledge level, there are different rewards as a way of saying thanks! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for any support you can provide--and no worries if you can\u0027t! We appreciate you listening! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:poetinbangkok@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eplease drop us a note\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
