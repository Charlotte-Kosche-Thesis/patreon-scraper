    "summary": "Hello, there! I go by Princess Pottypants, and I create AB/DL content for the internet, largely captions, but also some regular stories. You can find examples of my work \u003ca href=\"https://princesspottypants.wordpress.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I haven\u0027t had as much time to work on my writing as I used to, which is what has brought me here... I appreciate the support that has been given to my ebooks, and I don\u0027t want to seem like I\u0027m just trying to leech more money out of the community, but creating content takes time, and I don\u0027t have a lot of that free anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe content that is already posted on my blog is available for free, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. I\u0027ll try to continue to post some things there, and I may wind up posting some of my creations from here over there after a few months have passed, but I haven\u0027t decided for sure, or what timing exactly to use. Commissions will be staying here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to make custom content available for those who want it, so the upper tiers of my rewards allow for commissions of captions and stories... The story tier is limited to try to make sure I have enough time to get everything done every month, and I may need to do the same with the caption tiers, but I\u0027ll have to see how much interest I get before figuring out what those limits should be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor both story and caption commissions, the main subject should be AB/DL... I can dip into some other, related fetishes if necessary, but your pictures and ideas need to involve diapers in some, hopefully major, way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
