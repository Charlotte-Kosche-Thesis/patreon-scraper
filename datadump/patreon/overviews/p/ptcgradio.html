Patreon supporter or not you found this and that\nmakes you ok in my book!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLong story\nshort, for 5 years I have been making a weekly Pokemon Trading Card Game\nPodcast and for the last 3 years I have been making Pokemon YouTube videos with\nvarying regularity. I now make daily videos, often more than one per day. Obviously\nthis takes a fair amount of time and money. I have no interest in charging for\nPodcasts, Videos or Streams and although I do get some revenue from ads on\nYouTube it is proportionately very low compared to the time taken to make all\nmy content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you guys\nfeel so inclined you can help me out and this will mean I can spend more time\nand energy making videos and less time and energy not making videos. I could\nalso upgrade equipment to bring better videos in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m not\ngoing to appear outside your window demanding help but if you wish to support\nwhat I\u2019m doing then clearly I will love you forever. I\u2019ll also try and make\nsure it\u2019s worth your while. If you have any ideas for rewards I\u2019m not offering\nthen you hit me up on twitter @thewossy .\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so\nmuch for all your continued support. I still find it odd that people watch my\nsilly Pokemon videos but it makes me happier than anything. Except my wife. She\u2019s\nnot reading this is she\u2026?\u003cbr\u003e"
