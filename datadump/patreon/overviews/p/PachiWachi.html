I have untreated depression, and a learning and speaking disability, which makes work rare and unstable, but I\u0027m trying my best!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t uploaded much, but check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/pachiwachi\"\u003esoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e if you have time!\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~~~\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still taking commissions but they\u0027re gonna have to be put on hold very briefly while i get things set up!!

My learning disability kept me from reading for extended periods of time.\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, I\u0027ve had a really hard time finding employment, but hopefully with your help I\u0027ll be able to save enough to pay for a HiSET or GED test and enroll in my local community college!
