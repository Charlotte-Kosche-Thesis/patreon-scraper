In my eagerness to continue teaching by developing pickleball drills via animation or video recording, Patreon will make it that much easier to get videos to you and assist me in developing more of the same. Patreon rewards will help to\u00a0 invest in equipment, software for improved animations, podcasting, improving pickleballCPR\u0027s social media presence and so much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eHow Does It Work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e The reward levels allow you to choose what you get for your subscription as a patron to PickleballCPR Drills. For example by choosing just the Bronze Patron level at a $1 month subscription, you get unlimited access to the videos as well as sneak peak of future videos and more. Reliability to get notified when a new release is available is a Patreon priority. The higher level of reward you choose the more you will receive for your patronage. How about receiving an autographed PickleballCPR Drills book for yourself or as a gift in addition to receiving a one time video skills analysis. The higher the reward that is chosen the more extensive the payoff is for you. By becoming a patron you\u0027ll have access to ALL the videos posted.

It takes time, effort and a lot of love to create these videos as I\u0027m sure you would understand. I want to continue sharing, creating and developing drills not only online but in real time. To do that I need your help and appreciate you choosing the reward level that fits you and that helps to assist me in my goal to teach pickleball and reach out to those who not only wanting to improve their own game but want to help others learn how to play as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e for your pledge of support of my PickleballCPR.com videos and informational pickleball teachings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessings, paddle UP and play more pickleball.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely\u003cbr\u003eCoach Claudia\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
