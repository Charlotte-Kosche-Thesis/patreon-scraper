It\u0027s been a remarkably long hiatus, but I think it\u0027s high time to get back into the swing of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be setting my sights low for now. One new short story or one new chapter to a full sized story per month, to be updated on the first. If I write more than that, which I very well may, I will post more than that. I won\u0027t be holding more than a buffer of one post at any given time. Supporters will only ever be charged once per month, not per update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll works created under this pseudonym are free to read, and even free to redistribute 30 days after posting so long as it\u0027s attributed. Everything posted \u003cem\u003ehere\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0will be posted by me to my site, \u003ca href=\"http://www.pgfalcon.com\"\u003ehttp://www.pgfalcon.com\u003c/a\u003e after being held for 30 days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may also, at my own discretion, take on paid commission. I will post paid commissions here as well, with the accompanying 30 day waiting period for public dissemination, but I will always have at least one non-commissioned story or update at the beginning of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who read and enjoy what I write, I would like to offer a very heart-felt thank you. It is the support of the community that made it possible for me to do what I do in the past, and I would like to continue creating new things for us all to enjoy well into the future."
