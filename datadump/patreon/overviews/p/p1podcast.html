    "summary": "The \u003cstrong\u003ePlayer One Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e is one of the longest-running independent video game podcasts on the Internet. Since we began in October 2006, we\u0027ve recorded over 500 episodes, rarely missing a week (even on holidays). It began on a whim after an Xbox Live conversation between ex-video game journalists Chris Johnston and Greg Sewart, and has grown into a continually running show with four hosts (+ Phil Theobald and Ethan Einhorn) and the ambient sounds of toddlers in the background. Never listened to the show?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.playeronepodcast.com/2012/07/22/episode-300-072312-300/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEpisode 300 will give you a pretty good primer on the show in general.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe bring a unique perspective as previous journalists/reviewers/interviewers who now play video games for fun (sometimes also as a job, but for this show\u2014for fun). We\u0027ll often tackle topics including the state of games journalism, PR, news, etc. but also spend a healthy amount of time just talking about the games we played this week or in the past. We hope that the show comes off as a conversation between friends, and we encourage listener participation either via asking us questions for the show\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/p1podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evia Twitter\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.playeronepodcast.com/forum/index.php?act=idx\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eon our message boards.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years, the show has changed a bit\u2014new fourth-chair hosts have jumped on and off this train. But we\u0027ve been incredibly consistent with new episodes. As our schedules and lives have become more complicated with kids and families and all that, it\u0027s become more difficult to produce the type of show we want to do each week. With your help and support, we can keep things going* and elevate the quality!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat means taking time to edit out coughs and background noise where we can, remove obvious Internet lag or talking overlap, and make the show sound more professional - this part is already happening, no goal needed. But we\u0027d also like to do more special episodes - Interviews, spoilercasts, theme shows on topics from the past. We think we can bring a unique perspective to this and provide you with many more hours of entertaining audio all for the love of video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Note that even if you decide not to support us via Patreon, the podcast will continue and will remain free every week. Your financial love is optional and appreciated.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
