Your hour has come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon! Under my filmmaking umbrella of Pinwheel Arts, I have been adapting the original story of Valve\u0027s \u003cem\u003eHalf-Life\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in Source Filmmaker, and the first episode\u0027s success has absolutely blown me away. I hadn\u0027t expected anything to come of it at all, and here I am being flooded with comments of support, constructive criticism and eagerness to see the next instalment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch Episode One here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/rnX3JwNoNgA\"\u003eHalf-Life: Anomalous Materials [SFM]\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HmcIciz.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough Source Filmmaker is an incredibly user-friendly programme, creating animations is still a time-consuming procedure. So far in the creation of episode one and the near-completion of episode two, I have accumulated over eleven-hundred hours of work.\u003cbr\u003eAs animations become more elaborate and my knowledge of digital puppeteering improves, so will the production time. Outside of those hours in SFM, many more hours are spent:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEditing the video files\u003cbr\u003eAssembling and mixing the audio (adding every footstep is more tedious than you could possibly imagine)\u003cbr\u003eComposing original music\u003cbr\u003eCreating custom textures and characters\u003cbr\u003e...Amongst other things\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help would enable me to dedicate more time and effort to my animation, and could potentially allow me to buy motion capture equipment and software. This would provide limitless potential to improve the quality of the episodes no end - motion capture would at times be quicker than animating everything by hand, so would result in faster release turnovers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xVfSTlW.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit of support from you is greatly appreciated, and will be rewarded. Each tier will also receive all previous rewards!
