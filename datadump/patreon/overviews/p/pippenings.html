I\u0027m passionate about living in my RV as well as keeping it road-ready. I love to share the DIY knowledge I accumulate in this adventure and hope you gain the insight you\u0027re looking for from the videos as well as entertainment. I also am really happy to share my journey down the road, in my RV with you and bring you along for the ride, even if it\u0027s just to the next stop. Thank you for coming along on this adventure with me as I try to maintain this alternative lifestyle, living in my RV and traveling around the US while bringing you along by filming it."
