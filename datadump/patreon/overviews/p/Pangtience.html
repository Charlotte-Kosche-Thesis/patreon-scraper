    "summary": "A couple new things coming: I\u0027m going to create a soundcould from this point onwards, so all of my covers will have audio free to download. Also, as a tribute, I\u0027m going to try my best to include sheet music whenever I can, for free as well. Finally, I\u0027m going to spread to a couple new platforms and try to use them as best as possible, so I strongly recommend you check all of them out!\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for all these new things is that I\u0027ve been advised to upgrade to a condenser mic, but that costs $300, which is not something I can afford at the moment. I\u0027m probably going to set up a Patreon and/or start streaming similarly to Kyle Landry in the near future, assuming that I get enough people who are interested in something like this, in order to get enough to afford the mic. I don\u0027t have a set date, nor do I expect any money from any of you guys; you just give whatever you think I deserve. =)\u003cbr\u003eShoutout to all YouTubers, big and small, for your help, support, and role-modeling, and to all my subs and fans!\u003cbr\u003e"
