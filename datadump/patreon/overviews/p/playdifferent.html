I already have quite a few videos up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, onto the project description!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBack in the 80s and 90s, the Macintosh had a reputation of having no games. With this video series I hope to show that this was not the case at all. In fact, for me, it was a gaming wonderland that helped shape who I am as a person, and designer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot only that, but the Macintosh was host to a few gaming firsts and revolutionary ideas, not to mention classic games in general.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I don\u0027t want to just cover those. I also want to cover the more obscure, weird games. Some of them may not even be good, but are still interesting to talk about or mean something to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also want to cover oddball software, and other oddities I find in my travels through Mac history. Oh, and I also plan to share as much stuff I find as I can on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://macintoshgarden.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMacintosh Garden\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.macintoshrepository.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMacintosh Repository\u003c/a\u003e. After all, this is primarily a project to help preserve Macintosh gaming history!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I? I\u0027m a former games journalist and total MacAddict. I wrote a large Mac gaming special for the internationally distributed Retro Gamer magazine which was met with positive feedback. And I loooovvvvvveeeeee Mac games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting this Patreon is completely optional. All content is public, and I don\u0027t need money as much as other people. The money that I do receive will go towards tracking down and interviewing former Mac game developers, and also tracking down old software to archive. People who donate can also request games which will shoot the titles to the top of my to do list."
