It has also been created to give back to people who enjoy and support my work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making youtube videos for a few years now but in the last few months, I\u0027ve been really trying to push myself to really give animating and designing a go as a career. It is something I love and I\u0027m very passionate about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently left my job of 16 years to go back to school and finally get a degree in graphic design. While I\u0027m completely happy with my decision, it\u0027s left me a little light in the money department. I\u0027m using my savings right now to pay for everything but I\u0027m hoping this Patreon page will help offset the burden a bit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I\u0027m not expecting to make a living off of this, I hope to one day do so and every little bit helps!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really going to try and make rewards that people can really enjoy and use as well! I\u0027m very thankful to anyone and everyone that watches my videos and I will continue to make them for free so don\u0027t worry! My rewards will have artwork and assets that will help you with your animations. I\u0027ll be providing backgrounds, props, and characters for may Patreons as a way of saying thank you for your support!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
