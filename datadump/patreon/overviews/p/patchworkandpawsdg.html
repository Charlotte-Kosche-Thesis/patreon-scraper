    "summary": "First and foremost, thank you! If you stumbled across this page by accident, thank you for clicking! If you come from one of my many incredible social media communities, thank you for checking out this amazing way to support both me and the community, and get fun new goodies out of it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: My patreon is only for legal service animal handlers. Rewards are service animal oriented and are not available to the general public. If it is discovered that people are using my patreon to receive gear for fake service animals, that patron will be removed, permanently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons get all sorts of bonuses, including access to voting for the next month\u0027s box theme, special discounts on additional orders, and more! Just select your tier (and size if you\u0027re going vest tier) and you are good to go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll theme voting will take place the month prior, with voting beginning between the 5th and 10th of the month (except for special exceptions). Once voting has closed, designs will be completed prior to the end of the month. All Patreon payments process at the beginning of the month (I have no control of these dates, I\u0027m sorry!) and once processed orders will begin. Ideally all Patreon orders will be shipped the end of the month, barring any set-backs. This means you will get your box the beginning of the month AFTER you pay. Example: April boxes bill April 1, and are shipped April 30, to arrive May 5-10th approximately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE: If you sign up for any reward level after the 1st of the month, I CANNOT send out your tier reward for that month as you will not be charged until the first of the following month.\u00a0 Your rewards will begin the next month! For example, if you sign up on the 5th of January, you will NOT be charged right away, and will not receive January\u0027s items. Your charges will begin the beginning of February and you will receive your full reward for February! However, you will get access to the general bonuses like discounts, live streams, and voting. I will attempt to send out extras for anyone who signs up later in the month with the following month\u0027s rewards but I cannot promise it will be your full tier\u0027s rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow let\u0027s talk tiers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost are pretty self explanatory, but a few notes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll tier rewards are the same designs. Meaning every patron gets the same patch sets if they get the patch set tier. The only customization will be pronouns and possibly colors for certain themes (for example, a Stranger Things theme would stick to black, red, and white; but a New Years set could be color coordinated)! Otherwise, all rewards will follow the same designs."
