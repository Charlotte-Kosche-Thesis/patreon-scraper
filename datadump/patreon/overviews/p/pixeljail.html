This extremity of this varies based on image, theme or story, but it\u0027s generally all adult-natured and usually kinky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m PixelJail, an indie game developer and Masters student in my office hours, and an adult illustrator in my free hours. I tend to focus on BDSM for drawings as I feel that it\u0027s what regular life drawing misses out on: the more interesting poses, contortions and fascinating ways the body can bend...being kinky and erotic certainly helps, though :)\u003cbr\u003e\nMuch of my work can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pixeljail.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI can also be found chatting about my work, stream schedules and upcoming plans on a wee discord server. If you\u0027d like to join it\u0027s an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/jyCR9ws\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOpen Invite\u003c/a\u003e :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI take commissions and upload art fairly regularly, such as on DeviantArt and make an effort to try a lot of different kinds of kinks or intrigues, but typically focusing on BDSM, predicament bondage or pin-ups.\u003cbr\u003e\nI tend to create static illustrations, but also create hand drawn animations and create multi-layer art for animated slider images.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThe Patreon is mainly a tip jar. I have never been fond of the idea of restricting access to content or holding back work or art in the name of having a massive selection of \"exclusive\" content to make money from. I\u0027m a bit of a terrible businessperson and believe that everyone should have all the fun! I love doing this and I endlessly appreciate the support from all my watchers, commissioners, fans and stream-watchers, however I only have so much spare time to create this content when I\u0027m not working, so any support or funding I get through this allows me to dedicate more time to the community I love being a part of!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I thought this was a good alternative, to allow people to support me however much they wish, and for me to continue to produce the vast majority of my work to the public however I have kept one slot available for a cheeky Patreon-exclusive version of an image. Just one, though! :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo then what\u0027s the Second Tier?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust something extra, for if anyone wishes to donate a bit more and get something more from it. As I said above, I don\u0027t much like the idea of holding lots of content back, so instead of just having a large library of Patreon exclusive content, I thought a good addition would be an X-Ray version of an image that will be uploaded on DeviantArt. The trick is that Patrons will get a slider version of the image, allowing you to see another version of this character: perhaps to add binds to them, or undress them! O:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis tier is flexible as well, and if anyone feels there would be better/more interesting rewards that are still appropriate, I\u0027ll consider adding them in :)"
