By the time this goal has been reached, those \u201cother three\u201d have already been receiving money for each video they\u2019re in, but now they can use channel wages for more than just nothing! What this means for you is that Chaz and Fiona can spend more time travelling to Mal\u0027s and my place to record, so we get more combinations of cohosts than just me in every video. -Tony",
