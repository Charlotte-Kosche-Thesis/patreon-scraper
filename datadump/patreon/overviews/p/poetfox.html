    "summary": "Hi! My name is Alexis Long, and I write fun fiction! I\u0027d like to write you a short story every month! Some will be little things, off in their own world. Some will be stand-alone stories connected to the larger writing projects I have. Some will be steamy and sexy! But I hope you\u0027ll find all of them entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the plan?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, this is a \"Short Story of the Month\" Club! Every month, you throw in a buck (or more, I suppose, if you really want to!) and I\u0027ll write a short story, and post it here. These short stories are going to be \"short story\" length, which is unhelpful, but accurate. A normal short story is something like 8-20 pages of typed text, as far as I\u0027ve always read, and my short stories tend to be around 15, though less if the focus is more arousing in nature. Basically, the stories will be as long as they need to be, but that\u0027s the general goal. If I end up writing some really short stuff, I\u0027ll probably post more than one!\u003cbr\u003eEventually I\u0027ll probably collect some of these stories into ebook collections, and if so, I\u0027ll make sure you get a copy, if you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of fun fiction do you write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I tend to stretch myself and not stick to any one thing, but there are some clear themes to all my work that I hope you\u0027ll enjoy! Allow me to place them into a bulleted list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrong Queer Themes and Representation\u003c/strong\u003e: I\u0027m a translady, and pansexual, and I care a lot about queer issues. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m trying to be particularly \"political,\" perse, but I feel like it\u0027s important to have representation for all kinds of queer people in my works, and the problems we face often comes into a story along with that. I know I can point to several books that I felt included me as being extremely important works that changed my life. I dream that someday something I write can be like that for other people. So when I ask myself \"Why is this person gay/trans/whatever?\" I always try to respond, \"Why not?\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRomance, In All Things\u003c/strong\u003e: I like it when characters smooch. I especially like it when it\u0027s organic, and reflects a long relationship and a strong closeness. Sometimes my stories are very explicit: sex, right in front of you, perhaps in an erotica context, or just as a natural part of the story and as a result of a narrator who would kiss and tell. Sometimes my stories are very chaste, covering all the emotional bits of romance, and leaving the physical up to you. Either way, I love exploring everything romantic connection can be.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdventure!\u003c/strong\u003e: There was a time when I was all \"Grr, gotta be super important and deep and whatever with my writing.\" That was all very silly. I love reading adventure stories with fun characters and fun fights and fun outcomes, and once I actually let myself write what I loved and wanted to see more of, well, I could no longer stop myself from writing things! I love mysteries and procedurals and Young Adult adventure fiction, and even when not the core goal of what I\u0027m working on, these often sneak into what I\u0027m doing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eOther than that, anything goes! My stories usually have some sort of fantastical element to them, and some take place in fantasy or sci-fi worlds, but I would not call myself a fantasy or sci-fi author, perse, as that\u0027s not really my goal. My worlds come from my characters, and where they would thrive, so rarely if ever am I going \"Let\u0027s write a fantasy story today!\" Not that fantasy or sci-fi stories don\u0027t rule, but it\u0027s just not where I start my process, if that makes sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat have you written that I can take a look at?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I have a sample story out now, called \"\u003ca href=\"http://poetfox.getmeoutofthis.net/?p=27\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlague Ward\u003c/a\u003e\", a stand-alone tale that ties into the adventures of the Nichol Coven and the world they live in.\u003cbr\u003eOther than that, I have several super neat books and things out that you could take a look at right now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/A-Shuffled-Pack-Alexis-Long-ebook/dp/B00JTZFM0A/ref=pd_sim_sbs_351_3?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;refRID=0ADK0ZRS6FM1MTHE9RKP\u0026amp;dpID=41u5lxhUSgL\u0026amp;dpSrc=sims\u0026amp;preST=_UX300_PJku-sticker-v3%2CTopRight%2C0%2C-44_AC_UL160_SR100%2C160_\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Shuffled Pack\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a novella about a lesbian dogmonster detective trying to solve a murder that\u0027s shaking her family to it\u0027s core.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKWEZNM?*Version*=1\u0026amp;*entries*=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Showroom: Relationships and Robotics\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a short story collection about a city of people, a sex robot factory, and the relationships that come from that.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://poetfox.itch.io/the-many-roots-of-desire\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Many Roots of Desire\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, the first novel in a series of YA novels about the previously-mentioned Nichol Coven, a group of witches trying to find themselves and, maybe, save the world at the same time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/535978\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTongue in Cheek\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, an erotica collection that features a story of mine, called \"Adventure,\" front and center, and contains lots of other real hot stories!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd there\u0027s lots more to come, if I can use that clich\u00e9!

That\u0027s what I\u0027m going to be bringing to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy day job is teaching! I teach writing courses at several local universities, and I love every second of it. However, it\u0027s a tough life. I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027re aware of the plight of adjunct faculty in the US, but trust me, it\u0027s very hard to make ends meet, especially with all the medical bills I regularly have from trans and other issues. I teach more classes than a \"full time\" instructor, and I work retail on the side to try to get by. And I do! But barely, which makes it impossible to save for things like, say, very important surgeries, or having a buffer for when one of life\u0027s disasters hit. Patreon money would help for that, and maybe stop me from having to relentlessly pester people into opening credit cards as often as I have to. I certainly don\u0027t want anyone to do anything they can\u0027t afford, but if you like my stuff, a little bit would help me out a lot, and I\u0027d really appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
