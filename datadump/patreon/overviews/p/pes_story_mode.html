Uh, no thanks mate.\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\nWoah there...I can see how you might think that, but that isn\u0027t the case. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have created every one of the 180+ videos over the last year and a half out of the pure love of creation and a pure love of PES - spurred on through the early days and the hard times by the interaction and response from you the viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have certainly not been doing this in the pursuit of financial gain - trust me, I\u0027ve barely made enough in YT ad revenue to break even on getting a microphone and buying PES each year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe channel and my reasons for making videos will not change and I promise the following:-\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will never \u003c/strong\u003eput any of my videos behind a Patreon paywall. Every video I create and every live stream I run will be free for everyone, forever, on YouTube as it always has been.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will never\u003c/strong\u003e stop responding to your YouTube comments, taking your suggestions, laughing with you, crying with you...whether you are a patron or not. I consider a lot of the amazing PSM commenters to be good friends of mine. In fact, I talk to them a lot more than some of my IRL friends. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will never\u003c/strong\u003e judge anyone for not wanting to become a patron, or not having the money, or having an intrinsic belief that no one should make money from making videos. That\u0027s totally cool, and we can still be mates.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFair enough - what do I get out of this then?\u003c/h3\u003e\nGlad you asked! This is not a one-way transaction, in fact, by becoming a patron you are simply investing in becoming a bigger part of PSM.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are two main reasons for you to become a patron of PSM, both of them excellent for everyone...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e1.) You can become an official PES Story Mode Co-Author, or Producer!\u003c/h4\u003e\nAll the great subscribers and commenters that PES Story Mode attracts have always been a massive part of what makes the channel what it is. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis won\u0027t be ending and I will still be responding to all the great comments I receive and taking on board their advice and suggestions...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n...however, by becoming a co-author you get a chance to become an even more integral part of PES Story Mode - and get to shape the story as it unfolds by voting on key decisions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCo-authors\u00a0get the following rewards:-\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe ability to vote on key channel decisions - for example, which player will we use for the series, which club, what style of series and potentially, what direction would like to see a completely new series take! This will also include goal of the season and player of the season type votes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAccess to at least one weekly\u00a0vote on a specific story arc decision for both series. This could be tactical, new signings, or about the videos in general (e.g. should I increase the game length?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour name in the credits in description of each video, recognised as Co-author of the story\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eProducers get all of the above plus:-\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAccess to the exclusive Co-author Discord channel. This is were the real decision get made amongst the elite of the PESM community\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to videos, sometimes up to 24 hours before official release\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA Twitter follow\u00a0from the main PESM account - if you like that sort of thing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e2.) You will get more PESM content\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom watching my videos it might not seem it, but a lot of time and effort goes into each one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt takes roughly three hours in total to record, edit and create the thumbnails for each 20-30 minute episode.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith a full-time job and new baby, finding the necessary 6 hours for the current two episodes per week is difficult enough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut with your support to hit the channels Patreon goals, I can reduce my working hours to allow more time to create content for you and book in a guaranteed time to live stream each week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
