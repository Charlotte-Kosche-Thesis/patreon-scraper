My name is Robert Sogomonian and I\u0027m a private pilot who transitioned from twenty years of armchair piloting in early 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content creation\u00a0endeavors started a few years earlier in 2013 with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB_U6g70AVu0Kpv03pgyHOWp4_nAOPdwJ\"\u003every well received tutorial series\u003c/a\u003e for the Su25T Frogfoot,\u00a0a free aircraft available with the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dcs-world.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDCS World\u003c/a\u003e flight simulator. I produced ten detailed tutorials covering all aspects of employing the aircraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn August of 2015 I started my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/vZ-6ewAAqow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eflight training\u003c/a\u003e and by\u00a0May of 2016 I was officially a certificated private pilot! I\u00a0filmed my training with a GoPro as a way to debrief and analyze my progress to better understand where I could improve. The videos were incredibly useful to me and I decided to start a vlog for the benefit other pilots as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy pledging to this campaign you are directly supporting the creation of informative, entertaining videos geared towards private pilots, armchair pilots, and aviation enthusiasts alike with the purpose of improving\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eskills and\u003c/strong\u003e understanding of various aviation concepts utilizing all of the tools and information at my disposal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn aviation, this is referred to as s\u003cem\u003eingle-pilot resource management\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eOn YouTube, this is referred to as \u003cem\u003econtent\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eproduction\u003c/em\u003e. \ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe flight simulator tutorials are instructional in nature within the context of a simulator, but the aviation adventures are meant to be relatable videos that show real world flights made by an average private pilot. From time to time I will reference the differences that I notice between real world aviation and flying a simulator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s very rewarding to be able to share how a real world interest in aviation and pursuing that interest through video games turned into something directly applicable to the real world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour patronage confirms to me that the effort I put into this content creates value and at the same time challenges me to improve my creative skill to produce the best aviation videos I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe amount pledged isn\u0027t that important to me\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ewhich is why I don\u0027t show the total amount of contributions on this page.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e important to me\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eis that you find the content valuable enough to want to contribute in the first place.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe simulator tutorials have evolved from simple off-the-top-of-my-head instructional narration and now take a few days of research and practice to make sure all of the information I am presenting is accurate and correct. Then throw in a day of filming and frequent re-shoots because things often aren\u0027t perfect on the first take and another day of editing it all together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVlogging takes a similar amount of time for flight planning, coming up with an interesting, entertaining, and informative narrative, filming the actual material, and then often a few days to edit the video from multiple action cameras together into a self contained episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put a lot of\u003cstrong\u003e research, care, and attention to detail\u003c/strong\u003e into creating content that I think is entertaining and will inspire fellow aviation enthusiasts to maybe take that step they\u0027ve been meaning to for years. Often times even someone who isn\u0027t necessarily interested in something can become interested if they see something that draws them into it. Bringing more people into general aviation can\u0027t be a bad thing and that\u0027s where the value of all of this exists for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a patron today to show your support for my content and challenge me to continue to create compelling, engaging, and informative aviation adventures and flight simulator tutorials.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so very much for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
