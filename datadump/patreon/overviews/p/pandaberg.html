    "summary": "HOW DOES PATREON WORK?\u003cbr\u003eHere on patreon you can create a page where you can offer fitting rewards for your audience and fans in return for either monthly support or on a per creation basis. My page is on a per creation basis and the only creations that I ask support for, are the short films that I create. The wonderful thing about Patreon is that they want to do what is best for both the creator and the supporters. So they gave you the option to choose how many paid posts (shortfilms) you are willing to support.\u00a0You will see this option when you become a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You pledged for $5 with no cap on your support and I posted 2 short films on Patreon that month, you would be charged $10. If you set your support to 1 paid post per month you would be charged only $5.\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry though we\u0027ll keep it simple as I am only making 1 short film per month right now. And when I get to make more this will be well announced and updated so you never have to pay more than you can spare. So please keep in mind this means that unlike Kickstarter the support is not a one time thing but a monthly contribution. But a contribution that is completely under your control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO AM I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1347.photobucket.com/albums/p714/pandaberg/cav_zps66rvnflq.jpg\" style=\"width: 773px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Who Am I?\" is one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies which coincidently was filmed in the land that I hail from, The Netherlands. Residing happily near Amsterdam I\u0027m a Dutch Christian dude that goes by the name of Stefan Danenberg. And it was the unique blend of action and comedy in J.C\u0027s movies that got me started on my journey to become a filmmaker myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO I HAVE TO GIVE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1347.photobucket.com/albums/p714/pandaberg/What%20can%20I%20give_zpsubefpnmf.jpg\" style=\"width: 772px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make monthly short films that are easy to watch and bring a smile\nwhen people need one. When school bums you out or life is just not all that\nawesome right now my videos are here to give you some clean comic relief in a quality jacket. You\ncan check them all out on my channel: \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2niOSkX\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/2niOSkX\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWHY I DO THIS, AND WHY I NEED YOUR HELP\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1347.photobucket.com/albums/p714/pandaberg/a5331637e02b549408e68806e95ab34b_zpsxslmzq3l.jpg\" style=\"width: 145px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eMy dream is to make videos full time and provide more and better content as I grow in my journey, and that is a difficult thing to do through YouTube alone.\u00a0And thus I arrived at Patreon where I can provide more for those who support me. And where I have a better platform to ask you for your support. I truly love what I get to do because it helps me bring a smile to people\u0027s faces through creative self expression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY BECOME A PATRON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1347.photobucket.com/albums/p714/pandaberg/p02lm556_zpssnhy5obx.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI upload a brand new short film every month accompanied by a behind the scenes video when available. But that\u0027s free for everyone :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Panda Patron you will get early access and additional exclusive content such as: deleted scenes, blooper reels, a monthly AmA, detailed updates and much more. As a Panda patron you can be part of my journey, giving feedback and suggestions to help me create what you wish to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s the sales pitch out of the way, which I do stand behind completely. But really the reason to become a Panda Patron should be that you believe in what I\u0027m trying to do and enjoy what I make. So if you believe in my dream, join the family and become a Panda Patron today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1347.photobucket.com/albums/p714/pandaberg/pandas-climbing-trees_75897_600x450_zpsasxaxesd.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings with a panda paw\u003cbr\u003eStefan Danenberg,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
