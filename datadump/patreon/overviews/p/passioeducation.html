If you want, you can support us with a small amount each month.\nWe can then spend more time producing really great surgical education videos\nthat train surgeons and help patients around the world. Even the smallest\namount can really help us. We appreciate your support as this helps to ensure the\nvideos will continue to come and stay free on PASSIO. If we get enough funding\nthrough Patreon, we (Andrew) can invest more time in PASSIO and really produce\nmore high-quality surgical video education. You\u0027ll find out more about our\nmission and history below. We hope you continue to enjoy learning from the\nsurgical masters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePASSIO Education Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePASSIO represents our sheer passion for delivering master video\neducation to surgeons with the core principle of improving patient outcomes at\na global level. The PASSIO program evolved over 30 years of our own clinical\nand translational efforts to improve recovery for patients. We realized that\npracticing surgeons tremendously value continuous training to provide the\ntopmost level of care for patients, especially when surgical innovations evolve\nat an exponential rate. Our program targets practicing surgeons by providing a\nreal and genuine experience of continued medical education through the visual\nmedium of video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough our educational and translational program, we provide\nadvanced continuing education from master surgeons, who reveal their \u201crecipes\u201d\nfor achieving success in providing the best standards of patient care. Our\nmaster surgeons are carefully vetted and internationally recognized as\noutstanding in their academics for translational laboratory experience, but\nalso for their clinical and technical excellence in surgery. We believe that\nthese surgeons deserve the best content production and educational program for\ndisseminating their expertise to improve healthcare around the world. This is\nPASSIO Education and we inspire to deliver the best possible surgical\neducation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePASSIO Education History\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eWe started developing our video and educational program in 2011\nthrough a grant from the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for advancing military\nmedicine and deployment of an educational resource called Nerve Surgery\n(nervesurgery.wustl.edu) at Washington University. We began filming and\nproducing surgical videos as part of this project and overtime, received\noutstanding feedback from the nerve community. From this feedback, we took time\nto reassess our videos to develop an education program and launched our new\ninitiative called PASSIO Education. Because of you, our viewer, as well as your\nfeedback, our educational program has progressed into PASSIO Education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting Our Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, our content is continually improving based on your\ninvaluable feedback on our videos and curriculum. This is where we are\ndeveloping new and interesting ways for you to interact with our content. At\nthe moment, our content is free. However, in order to ensure that we can provide\nreal continued medical education, we need your help and support. Our team has\ngrown so that we can continue generating new and great content. Below are\nsupport links and we hope you join us on our mission to create a fantastic\neducational experience.
