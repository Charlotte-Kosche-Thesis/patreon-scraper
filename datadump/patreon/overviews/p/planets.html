ELF is formed from a circular array of 5-8m subapertures. It uses the thin \"printed-mirror\" technology the Colossus telescope depends on, and image-domain phasing of each off-axis parabolic segment to create a single diffraction-limited image. ELF has a total diameter of about 40m and is large enough to begin a dedicated program of Rotational ExoPlanet Imaging.

The primary consists of 60x8m off-axis parabolic primaries. The secondary structure is less than 5m in diameter with 60 independent 0.5m optics. Thus, every primary is served by its own secondary which bring light into one Gregorian focus. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach secondary mirror is illuminated by one primary mirror segment and becomes its steering and phasing element. In this way each beam is combined coherently at the Gregorian focus of the larger, two-axis tracking, primary parent optics without interferometer delay-lines.

This new phase is all about imagining, developing, and using new technologies that have the reach to find biomarkers and even civilization biomarkers on the stars in our neighborhood of the galaxy. This is a several year effort, but we have an international team of scientists, engineers, and energetic volunteers that are committing their personal resources to this vision.",
