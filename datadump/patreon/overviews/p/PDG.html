    "summary": "Purple Duck Games is known for producing quality \nproducts to support the Porphyra Campaign Setting (using the Pathfinder \nSRD) and the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role-Playing Game. We build \nsupplements to support both gamesmasters and players by providing a \nlarge range of character and campaign options.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently close to 90% of our income goes directly \nback into to funding new products. This means that larger projects may \nget held up because the finances cannot be put into place to secure the \nnecessary writing and art. Examples of these sorts of projects are the \u003cem\u003eMonsters of Porphyra\u003c/em\u003e line or the \u003cem\u003eHeroes of\u003c/em\u003e\u2026 line that continue to expand our Campaign Setting. We would also like to pay our writers at a better rate for their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn order to free up capital for larger projects \nwhat we would like to do is partner with a number of patreons through \nthis format to seek sustainable funding for some of our smaller releases\n so that we can devote more of our working capital toward the larger \nprojects we create that help broaden our word more substantially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur primary focus right now is the development of the \u003cstrong\u003ePorphyra Roleplaying Game\u003c/strong\u003e. The Porphyra will be based off the base Pathfinder Reference Document but we will be making some changes along the way. The RPG will remain as an evergreen document that is supported by the Porphyra wiki. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of the development, discussion, and playtesting of this revised system will take place here with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePorphyra Roleplaying Game Releases:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- Animal Lords of Porphyra\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaytest Documents:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- Porphyra Roleplaying Game Work-In-Progress\u003cbr\u003e- Favored Class Bonuses - Discussion\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
