I can only REALLY be happy whilst doing art , art is my life. It gets me up in the morning, it stops me from sleeping, its there when i\u0027m happy and when I\u0027m sad so if you give even just a little to help with me I can promise you your donation will be helping this young women get on her feet and finally finding a little happiness in life. \u003cbr\u003e"

I swore if I failed at my a-level exams I\u0027d attempt to sign up to an art course. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can guess that I failed, it was\u00a0 the best thing ever to happen to me if i\u0027m honest, I found like minded people, a drive to push myself to be better and something I never knew before, passion. I am a seriously enthusiastic person - just ask my roommates from uni how excited I got going into a paper specialist shop, or over the fact the uni shop was just restocked. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love seeing progress within myself and am constantly trying to push myself to do better, be better I guess that\u0027s why I class myself as an illustrator above all else, because I like to experiment with styles and medium what\u0027s the saying; Jack of all trades master of none? \u003cbr\u003e",
