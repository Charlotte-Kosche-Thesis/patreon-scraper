    "summary": "\u003cimg\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For those unfamiliar with Dos Padres, they are identical twin \nbrothers. Identical, even down to their fingerprints! Both characters are award \nwinning, ordained ministers. They have been involved with The Iowa Irish\n Fest, DemiCon, MantiCon, TeslaCon, Northeast South Dakota Celtic Faire \n\u0026amp; Games, and many other events throughout seven states. They have \nfour costume contest wins, two each. Including an Honorable mention at \nWizard World ComiCon cosplay contest.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, we\u0027d like to thank you for following us, and bless you for supporting us as well. We have attended Celtic festivals, parades, conventions, and concerts throughout the Midwest and, will be adding Renaissance festivals soon. For those of unfamiliar with us, and what we do, it\u0027s quite simple... We make people smile and we make people laugh. But, in reality there is so much more, children\u0027s storytelling, weddings, vow renewals, posing for photos, lots of photos, and spending time visiting with folks. We tell Irish jokes (nothing more than maybe PG-13) but, DO NOT make fun of any religion or person. We help make your experience at the festival, convention, or concert just a little more memorable. With Sister Shamrock\u0027s assistance, we have put a lot of time, effort, and expense into Pope Malarkey I and Brother Barnabas. As you can see from the photos, our wardrobe is an ongoing, and rather expensive effort. And while a few festivals help with our expenses to attend, there is little, if any profit for our efforts. You know, that vow of poverty thing... That helps but, these resources fall far short of making ends meet, not to mention all the traveling and related costs required.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over and over we\u0027ve been told to charge for photos but, that\u0027s not something we\u0027re willing to do. If not for you, our fans and followers, we\u0027d just be some goofy folks dressed in expensive costumes. So when someone wants to take their photo with us, we don\u0027t want to charge because, it\u0027s our way of thanking you for making this grand adventure possible. Of course, we won\u0027t refuse any offerings freely given. So this is where Patreon comes into play, to help overcome that \"vow of poverty\" thing. We want to expand, to travel and attend more festivals, more conventions, and to maintain a level of quality in our Papal appearance so as not to embarrass. And while a few festivals do help, most don\u0027t, won\u0027t, or can\u0027t afford our meager fees. However, they are happy to allow us to attend, and allow us a patch of grass to erect the Pope\u0027s Papal Pavilion. That leaves us to deal with these expenses as best we can. And sleeping in the back of a van after 10 hours or more at a festival is something our aging bones can no longer endure.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, we\u0027re appealing to you, the true HOOLEYGANS and Steamies, to come to our aid. Become one of our Patrons, help us expand our outreach to spread even more smiles and laughter, heaven knows the world needs a LOT more of both. We\u0027re not asking for much, our goal is 200 Patrons pledging $1 a month (only $12 a year). That alone will make an enormous impact! Then, you can say with great pride, \"I\u0027M A HOOLEYGAN!\" or member of \"The Mystical Order of the AEthernaught Brotherhood\", and can point to The First Irish Pope, His Hooleyness, Malarkey I and Sister Shamrock, or The Steampunk Pope, His Radiance, Brother Barnabas Brass-Boilerplate, and say with pride, \"I help make their work possible, I\u0027m also spreading smiles and laughter.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, bless y\u0027all, go forth and spread happiness...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

In 2013 I created the character The First Irish Pope, His Hooleyness, Malarkey I, a year later came The Steampunk Pope, His Radiance, Brother Barnabas Brass-Boilerplate. Reports are that the two popes are identical twins, right down to their fingerprints. Since their creation, their popularity has grown and, requests for them to attend events range far and wide. Now, remembering that I am retired, the cost to support their demand and maintenance has also grown. So much so that, I finally relented and have come before the fans to ask for their support.\u00a0",
