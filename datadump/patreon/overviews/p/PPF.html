    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ppenxtF.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, I\u2019m\nPoopPoopFart (or you can just call me Gabe if you want), and I\u2019ve\nbeen making music videos for YouTube for about eight years now.  I\nmostly cover video game compositions, but I\u2019ve been known to record\na few pop tunes and anime tracks here and there as well.  I love\nacoustic instruments, so most of my videos feature guitars, cajons,\nmelodicas, recorders, hair brushes, and the like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/15cdGoi.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the past\nseveral years, as the quality of my videos has improved and I\u2019ve\namassed more and more equipment, I\u2019ve found that my videos have\ngotten increasingly expensive to produce.  Maintaining the current\nquality of my videos has become a bit of a financial chore, so I\u2019ve\ndecided to turn to Patreon for help.  If you decide to make a\ncontribution, you\u2019ll be helping me pay for things like strings,\nreeds, new instruments, lights, and assorted props.  Your\ncontributions will also allow me to upgrade/repair old or failing\nequipment, and will allow me to further improve the quality of my\nvideos.  I might also be able to tackle some arrangements that were\npreviously financially unfeasable.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lzYXHU6.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to only be able to produce one video per month, but now that I have some extra money coming in from my Patrons, I\u0027m able to produce videos a little more frequently than that.\u00a0 So for the purpose of figuring out your pledge amount, you can assume that I\u0027m going to be uploading two videos per month.\u00a0 I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be physically able to upload any more frequently than that, but you also have the option putting a limit on how much you contribute per month, so feel free to do that just in case I\u0027m somehow able to squeeze in another video or two into the month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IktgYjP.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n[Update 02/10/17 - I noticed some people were pledging in between tiers, so I decided to add an official $3 tier to make sure that people were gettin\u0027 something for their money]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel weird about\naccepting money from strangers on the internet, so I\u2019m trying to\ndiscourage individual people from contributing large sums of money. \nI was originally just going to have a $1 tier, but if someone\nvoluntarily wanted to contribute more than that, I woulda felt bad if\nthey didn\u2019t get something in return, which is why I added a $5\ntier.  I might add a few more tiers though depending on viewer\nfeedback.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s about all,\nI think.  Thanks for taking the time to visit my Patreon page!  And\nthank you for your support and your viewership!\u003cbr\u003e"
