One day we could be doing a classical piano arrangement of the Legend of Zelda theme, the next we could have an orchestra performing Snoop Dogg! The sky is the limit, and we strive to make our arrangements and videos anything but typical.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eA Quick Patreon Explanation:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIt\u0027s simple...every time we post a new video (a main music vid, not an update vid or teaser but a full fledged video) our Patrons are charged their contribution level. We post main videos about once or twice a month. So if you contribute $1....then once or twice a month you will be charged $1 and your contribution will help us keep making more videos. That\u0027s far less than you might spend on a cup of coffee every day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhere your contribution goes:\u003c/h3\u003eWe\u0027ve got an amazing and dedicated production team that works hard to create the very best music and videos we can. Your contribution will help us keep the ball moving forward and focus on making the arrangements and videos we all want to hear and see. We\u0027ll use your contribution to create custom designed pianos, film in exotic locations like a neo-tokyo bar in our Akira video or at the top of a cloud like in our upcoming Doctor Who video. More contributions mean more song arrangements, more musicians, bigger videos, and more resources for live performances!
