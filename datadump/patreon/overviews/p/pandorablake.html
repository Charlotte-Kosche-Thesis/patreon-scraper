The Digital Economy Bill is currently going through Parliament, and I\u0027m working tirelessly with government working groups, industry trade associations, civil servants and legislators to limit the threat this bill poses to our privacy and personal liberty. I\u0027m raising awareness of why sex education is a more effective harm reduction measure than restricting access to porn, how current obscenity law is out of touch with social standards, and why this law threatens our freedoms. I\u0027m already doing this work unpaid, but it\u0027s a struggle to find the time and I\u0027m at risk of burning out. This goal would pay me for two full days a month of political lobbying - whether \nthat\u0027s writing to or meeting with parliamentarians, submitting evidence and briefings to legislators, producing public resources on relevant topics, or making sure people are\n fully informed about what\u0027s coming.\u003c/div\u003e",

The Bill has received the support of MPs so far, despite outcry from civil liberties organisations and the public. At committee stage MPs added new amendments that will vastly increase the harms of the Bill, bringing in ISP blocking for overseas sites that publish \"unconventional\" sex acts or don\u0027t have sufficient age verification.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis bill is based on woolly assumptions and false statistics about the alleged \"harms\" of porn - the idea that age verification will \"protect children\" is not evidence-based, but an emotive justification for new powers of state control and censorship. Alongside Backlash and the Open Rights Group, I am working as hard as I can to challenge this legislation at every stage. My Patreon funding to date empowers me to take two days a month away from paid work to fight this law (thank you, it\u0027s been an enormous help so far!), but $1000 would double that. Meeting this goal would allow me to do a lot more; from preparing evidence, writing briefing papers and lobbying peers and parliamentarians, to creating public resources to help all of us join the challenge.",
