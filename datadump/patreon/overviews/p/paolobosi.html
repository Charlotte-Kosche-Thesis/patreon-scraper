    "summary": "Hi, my name is Paolo and I\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat can I find here?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI write mostly science fiction and\nfantasy. I like to work with tropes: explore, subvert, deconstruct,\ncelebrate and exalt them.\u003cbr\u003e\nI also like to question myself about\nprivilege and society norms, especially when I can come up with my\nown society based on unusual natural and magical laws.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon page is my safe haven.\nHere I post everything I write without fear of judgment: stories,\nessays, reviews (books, series, movies). You can follow me (and get\nnotified when I post something) and have access to everything. A\nPatreon account is free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Patreon? (aka what\u0027s this?)\u003c/h3\u003e\nPatreon is a platform that lets you\nsupport creators. In my specific case, you can follow me for free\n(and, as I said, get access to all my content), or you can pledge a\nmonthly amount, from 1$ up to what you can \u0026amp; want to afford. All\nthe money I collect here go directly to my writing, meaning hardware,\ntime off from my freelance job, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons get all my thanks and some\nspecial gifts of course. For now it\u0027s early access to my stories, in\nthe future, as the numbers hopefully grow, I\u0027ll add more rewards. I\ntry to engage with as many people as I can, because the first step in\nwriting is finding a good story, and reality is my favorite hunting\npost.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do you publish? (aka when will you\nrelease the next chapter?)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI plan on releasing AT LEAST one story\nevery month. This means I won\u0027t  publish less than one, but I give\nmyself leeway if a month is especially productive, with a limit: I\nwon\u0027t publish more than one story a week.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis has a slightly different effect if\nyou are a patron or not. I release an \"early bird\" story\nfor my patrons first, and then I make it public the day after I\nrelease my next \"early bird\" story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI.e.: let\u0027s say I have two stories, one\nabout Vikings and the other about Martians. This Monday\u0027s story\nrelease is \"early bird Vikings\". Next Monday I\u0027ll release\n\"early bird Martians\", and Tuesday the Viking story will\nbecome public (or, more precisely, will be released again in a public\npost).\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAgain, I have a rule: I\u0027ll not leave an\n\"early bird\" story unpublished to the public for more than\na month. In the unlikely case I do not release a new story for a\nmonth, the last one will become public in a month no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWAIT A MOMENT, in the second paragraph\nyou said you don\u0027t fear judgment, does it mean I\u0027ll get banned if I\ncriticize your work?\u003c/h3\u003e\nNo. You won\u0027t get banned for\ncriticizing my stories. I actually look forward to any feedback\nyou\u0027ll provide me! You are in fact my alpha and beta readers!\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, be polite. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can get banned if: you act like an\nasshole, you are mean to others, you write racist/sexist/*ist stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\nI like to write about sensitive topics,\nand I try to do it in the best way I\u0027m capable of. I do think that\neveryone has room for improvement, especially someone like me who\ncomes from a position of privilege.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n--\u003cbr\u003eFor now, that\u0027s all!
