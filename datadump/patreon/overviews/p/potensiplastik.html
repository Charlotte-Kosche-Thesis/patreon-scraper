    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003ePotensi Plastik\u003c/strong\u003e addresses a number of really important problems we currently face here in Malaysia. One of the most significant of these problems being the \u003cstrong\u003emanagement of plastic waste\u003c/strong\u003e. Malaysians generate about 30,000 metric tonnes of rubbish each day. Plastic makes up about 13% of our solid waste stream, which means about 4,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste are generated in Malaysia each day. These figures are based on the amount of rubbish that is disposed of correctly. However without the necessary infrastructure for collecting and recycling waste, the correct figures are likely to be much greater! Possibly hundreds of thousands of metric tonnes. So how will Potensi Plastik create a viable solution to this problem? And just as importantly, how will it do so in a way that can generate sufficient profit and create job opportunities?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPotensi Plastik will create a workspace with custom designed machines where people can bring in their waste plastic. The plastic will then be shredded into raw material where it can me recycled and remoulded into useful everyday items to be resold back into the market.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe acknowledge it can be a challenge to get people to recycle properly. Whether it to be placing materials into the right bin or even finding a bin to throw your things. It can be a challenge to motivate people to change.However what we\u0027re proposing is a private service that will encourage people to bring us their clean, recycled plastic which we will purchase from them per kilo. Now why would they want to do this? We believe it\u2019s an incentive that already works locally for aluminium tins. Once people understand that there is a value to it they will be less inclined to dispose of it incorrectly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are millions of possibilities with what we can create from this recycled plastic, such as housing and construction materials like light-weight plastic bricks which can be easily assembled like Lego or plastic roofing and tiles. We will also focus on creating useful day-to-day household items that will have more demand and be likely to sell. We will also become heavily involved in educating school children to change the current cycle and live cleaner, zero waste lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of this will be solving major problems such as unemployment, poverty, affordable housing and keeping plastic wastes out of landfills. So just imagine how big of an impact we can make throughout Malaysia if we are given your support and donations! Thanks in advance and we love you all!\u003cbr\u003e"
