    "summary": "I\u0027ve been blogging regularly since 2003. First, I wrote as \"NoMoreWageSlave\" on Blogspot. That site was all about quitting my miserable day job and trying to work from home. It didn\u0027t work as well as I had hoped (there\u0027s a lot of scams out there!), but I learned a lot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was then that\u00a0I realized my herbalism hobby had become a full lifestyle, and I launched \"Swamp Pixie Herbal\" to share my herbal recipes; both my successes and my grand failures! A few years later, I made a small business out of herb-infused honeys under \"Pixie\u0027s Pocket.\"\u003cbr\u003eI quit that business a year or two later and since then, I have been consistently blogging as Pixie\u0027s Pocket. All of my old Swamp Pixie Herbal archives and all of my new content under that one name.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThis is it...my passion, my calling, and my love.\u003c/strong\u003e I have found my voice and an audience who enjoys what I have to say! (Thank you! I can\u0027t thank you enough!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pixiespocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/11950299_1144305845598690_9138398473500684476_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePixie\u0027s Pocket is a work of love. Knowing that you are out there listening to my rambles about my hands in the soil and my head in the clouds inspires me to keep it going! In turn, Pixie\u0027s Pocket and each of you keep ME going. I am honored and humbled each time I hear from readers who are using the experiences that I share to empower themselves, even if it is just to make their first gallon of mead, nibble dandelions, or blend a tea for their stuffy nose!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I have used ads on Pixie\u0027s Pocket to help defray the costs of running a blog: hosting fees, domain cost, Wordpress themes, premium plugins, apps that help me post regularly and effectively, image editing software, camera purchases...a lot goes into a nice website! \u003cstrong\u003eBUT I HATE ADS. \u003c/strong\u003eSeriously. They make me grind my jaw and pull out my hair. You all are my friends, not just consumers that I market to. I am a writer, not just a shill for fancy brand names.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel dirty with Google and Amazon ads all over my site.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m starting this Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m tired of hiding my shame of asking for help. I\u0027m tired of making everyone endure flashing ads in my sidebar. I\u0027m ready to branch out Pixie\u0027s Pocket into a community experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you like what I do? Even only $1 a month will help me head towards an ad-free site that I can continue to improve on. I want your input. I want your questions, your involvement, and I want to know what I can do for you in return! \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eKick Amazon off of Pixie\u0027s Pocket! \u003c/strong\u003eI have SUCH mixed feelings about Amazon, y\u0027all. I try to buy all my books from independent booksellers on Biblio.com or my local shops. Amazon is terribly convenient, but they are so big and corporationy and they treat their employees like crap and they want to deliver stuff with drones and I just don\u0027t like it. *waves cane in the air angrily, old lady style*",
