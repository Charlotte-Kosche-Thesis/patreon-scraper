I will happily offer writing advice too, and will probably write one or two blogs on craft and publishing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon is so important to aliens like me:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I last published my writing in a literary magazine I had to keep going back to the website to look at the comments, and since everyone commenting didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d ever see their comment, they didn\u0027t usually say anything besides \"Good story\" and \"My eyes hurt please don\u0027t subject me to this torture again\". Patreon improves on the current model of online publishing by allowing me to reach a dedicated and active readership. I can get to know you and you can get to know me. I\u0027ll be able to respond to advice and even give my own. I may even write sequels to things if you want them, if you are dying to know what happened on that dark and lonely planet once the humans retreated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat patrons get:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatrons get exclusive access to new finished stories, drafts and poems. You also become a beta reader for my novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Stephanie Glitch\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ll be posting some excerpts over the next few months to see how people feel about them before sending it off to an agent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am and why I landed on earth:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a published poet, freelance editor and cat enthusiast. I run Mothmaw Press and spend my life sat at my laptop and writing. I\u0027d really like to build an audience that I can talk to here. I think this is the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for landing here, I hope you enjoy your stay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
