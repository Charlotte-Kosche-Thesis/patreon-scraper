As an actress, I\u0027ve\u00a0worked in television and theater. As a writer, I\u0027ve won awards for my pre-published novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fiction since 2008. My writing journey has been a long one, filled with twists and turns, highs and lows. When I first started writing, I was unfocused in the stories I wanted to tell. As I progressed, I\u0027ve honed in on writing novels which center women of color (WOC) and which show WOC living the full gamut of the human experience. I\u0027ve written three full-length novels with plans to write more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to writing full-length novels, I\u0027m currently pursuing my Master of Fine Arts in Writing Popular Fiction at Seton Hill University as a Jackie Robinson Foundation Extra Innings Fellow. (Oh yeah, and I homeschool my two kids. I\u0027m a busy woman!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Instagram, I post sayings and poetry that speak to the soul. People have responded positively to my social media posts, and so I wanted to them a step further on Patreon. Mainly, I will write more in-depth on the inspiration behind each post, and I\u0027ll give you practical writing exercises to help you connect to your highest purpose and unpack things that have held you back in the past. In other words, I\u0027ll be your mini-coach!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eEvery dollar you spend in support of my work goes towards helping me create more stories that center women of color, more writing exercises that help you grow, and more inspirational social media posts, articles, and blogs. It also helps provide for my expenses as I pursue my Masters in Fine Arts and homeschool my children.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m focusing mainly on my writing, my reward levels will be mainly writing-centric. (Although, I will include some acting related goodies here and there, like an autographed photo of yours\u00a0truly.) Subscribers at higher levels will get their writing critiqued by me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my essays and journaling prompts are exclusive to Patreon subscibers. You won\u0027t find them anywhere else. However, the article drafts you receive at the $10 subscription level will be distributed elsewhere later, but you\u0027ll receive them first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for subscribing. It means so much to me as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
