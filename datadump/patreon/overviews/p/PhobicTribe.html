I started the Phobic Tribe, a YouTube channel where I upload videos of me playing games as well as some other mischief I get into. I have been running my YouTube channel for about five years now. This is my Patreon page! Patreon is an incredible opportunity to help create higher quality videos more often. If you want to join the Tribe\u0027s Patreon, here are some of the ways you will be helping improve my channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u27bcGame Purchases\u27bc\u003c/h3\u003eBuying games costs money and even though Steam has some pretty awesome sales now and then, it still costs me an arm and a leg to continually buy new games to play after I beat old ones. By supporting me on Patreon it will ensure I have more money to continue buying games, and it will also help make sure I can buy those really expensive AAA title games when they first come out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGames purchases made possible by Patreon:\u003cbr\u003eResident Evil 7 with Season Pass\u003cbr\u003eDishonored 2\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u27bcSoftware and Equipment\u27bc\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eSoftware and equipment costs more than anything else. My life operates by Murphy\u0027s Law (everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.) I have had editing softwares stop working altogether so I have to buy new ones. I have had Shadow of Mordor destroy my computer where I had to buy three new parts for my computer because it took so much to run it fried parts of my computer. Over the years I\u0027ve bought new cameras, microphones, headsets... Whew, it really does take a lot of money to keep up with a YouTube channel. Any support on Patreon also goes towards keeping up with equipment and updating new software.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u27bcArt and Thumbnails\u27bc\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eI wish I was artistic. No, really, I wish I could make incredible works of art with a pen and pencil. But, alas, I cannot. For this reason, I have to pay my friends to make art for me. It isn\u0027t fair for me to ask them to make art for me for free. It takes hours to make some of the really cool art they make, and they deserve to be financially compensated for it. Right now I can only afford to pay them for a new banner occasionally and every once in a while pay them for a really beautiful thumbnail. I know you guys are all about the thumbnails, so I want you to know by supporting me on Patreon it also directly supports the artists that help make up this Tribe.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u27bcInvest More In My Channel\u27bc\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eI am a sophomore in college with a major in Neuroscience who tends to have a lot of health problems. Between going to the doctor, studying for school, working another job, and trying to maintain a social life, it gets difficult to squeeze YouTube in as well. If I could make enough money from YouTube to quit my job it would do wonders for the channel and ensuring I can spend more time making videos, not to mention help with the costs of college.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eRight now most of the purchases I make for the channel such as the heartbeat monitor, webcam, continually updated computer hardware, etc... comes out of my own pocket. With the recent ad crisis on YouTube, the little amount of money I was making has decreased substantially, and it\u0027s harder than ever to continue doing YouTube. I would really appreciate it if you could help support me and my channel and try to help our Tribe grow. I plan on continuing to invest my time, money, and love in my channel as long as I possibly can, so any support you can offer me means a lot.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSincerely,\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eJackson\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eChief of the Phobic Tribe\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
