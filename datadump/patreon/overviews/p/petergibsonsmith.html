    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there potential patron...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Peter Gibson Smith and I\u2019m an\nartist living and working in Auckland, New Zealand/Aotearoa. I\u2019ve been an artist\nfor as long as I can remember and a professional since graduating art school in\nthe mid 1980\u2019s. Although machines are intimately involved in the making of my\nwork, it is still very labour intensive, requiring long hours in the studio\n(which I would never complain about), leaving little time for generating income\nother than selling artwork. As anyone who knows an artist will be aware,\nsurviving on sales of artwork is a perilous business so I\u2019m seeking patrons who\nare willing to support my practice so it can continue developing on a fulltime\nbasis. You can see more of my work here: \u003ca href=\"https://petergibsonsmith.com/\"\u003ehttps://petergibsonsmith.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in becoming a patron,\nyou have my eternal gratitude and thanks but I\u2019d also like to reward you in\nsome small way for that support. To this end, for a \u003cstrong\u003e$5* pledge\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u2019ll provide a monthly behind the scenes, \u201cwhat\u2019s\nhappening in the studio\u201d, kind of visual newsletter that will evolve into a\nrecord of how things progress over time. I might even reveal a few secrets\n(inadvertently). You\u0027ll be able to see the build up towards exhibitions, complete with breakthroughs and disasters, because there are always both in this line of work. Your name will also appear in a  list of supporters for any public exhibitions of my work, publications etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor a \u003cstrong\u003e$10* pledge, \u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019ll also throw in a monthly, A4 printable thing. Eg: a file\nthat can be made in to a folded paper object. This will be determined by what\u2019s\ngoing on in the studio at the time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re able to stretch as far as a \u003cstrong\u003e$50* pledge\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u2019ll also send you a signed\nhard copy of the aforementioned printable thing. Eg: a printed or drawn file,\ncomplete with score lines for folding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor a pledge of \u003cstrong\u003e$100*\u003c/strong\u003e you will also get a seasonal (4 times per year), original paper\nand wax object. You\u2019ll also receive an open invitation to visit the studio when\nyou\u2019re in Auckland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is all very new and exciting for me but it\u0027s just the beginning... I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll invent other ways of rewarding my patrons as I get to grips with this new model for supporting artists. I hope you\u0027ll join me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e*Please\nnote: Patreon is an American site so the figures are in US dollars. On current\n(April 2017) exchange rates, a $5 pledge would be around, NZ$7.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
