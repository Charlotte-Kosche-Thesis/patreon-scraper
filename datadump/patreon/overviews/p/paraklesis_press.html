We are hoping to acquire six titles in 2018, but so far we have only one title out. If you would like a free e-book, so you can read it and evaluate us, send an email to publisher at paraklesispress dot com and let me know what format you\u0027d like. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother way for you to evaluate us, is for us to tell you a bit about ourselves. So . . .\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWe are publishing books that lean a bit to the right of center\u003c/h3\u003e\nAccording to Verdant Labs, an \noverwhelming number of book publishers and editors are Democrats (\u003ca href=\"http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_professions/index.html\"\u003eover 97%\u003c/a\u003e).\nThat\u0027s all well and good. I have many friends who are Democrats. My own father was a Democrat. So I\u0027m not kidding when I say that some of my favorite people are Democrats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut critical thinking is healthy and children need to read many different views in order to learn to think critically. It\u0027s hard to get those \"many different views\" that are needed, when 97% of editors, and arguably 97% of books being published, are bending one direction on social and religious and political issues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I wanted to see some publishing companies that leaned to the right side of center. And the more I considered this need, the more it seemed that I ought to be willing to publish books I love instead of complaining about the lack of such books. I felt that I ought to be willing to labor, in love, for the books I wanted our young people to read.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSo here we are--launching a new small press.\u003c/h3\u003e\nAnd maybe it won\u0027t just be a labor of love. Maybe we\u0027ll \u00a0make some money at it. Maybe if we fit into a niche, our roots will go down deep and our authors will push up like tender shoots pushing through the pavement.\u00a0 After all, God delights in using the weak things and the poor things and the foolish things to shame the strong and the rich and the wise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://christianchildrenswriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sprout-1147803_640.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo our goal is to plant a few books in a hostile environment. To supply some parents with a few books that NY publishing houses don\u0027t want. Books that\u003cstrong\u003e lean a little to the right of center\u003c/strong\u003e.

We believe the workman is worthy of his wages and we believe that writers need to eat, so we will pay as much as we are able to pay to our authors now, and we hope to one day be able to give them good advances and to be able to sell their books well so they can earn a living wage.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWe want to give others the opportunity to partner with us because we see the children in our country as a mission field and we see service to them as a privilege.

One day we hope you can put your money and time energies to use on other good causes. Because we think our books will sell.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWe think the NY publishers are wrong\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe think they are living in a bubble.

     "description": "Picture books are quite a bit more expensive to publish than novels. And that\u0027s why publishers don\u0027t do a lot of them any more. They have to be priced high to cover the cost of production and parents just don\u0027t buy them as much as they once did. Many parents think nothing of paying 29 dollars for a video game, but they are not willing to shell out 16.99 for a picture book.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut children need picture books. They are such an important part of their development. If you feel, as I do, that picture books need to be made, you may want to adopt a picture book. If you do, you will get ten percent (10%) of the retail price for every unit sold. You may keep that money or donate it back to Paraklesis Press or to some other worthy cause.\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince PBs are not print on demand, you will also be given 300 to 500 books that you can sell or give away.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
