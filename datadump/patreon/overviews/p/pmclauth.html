    "summary": "I spent decades as a loyal Leftist, until the blinkers fell from my eyes. \u00a0Since then I\u0027ve been researching, campaigning and writing about the most important issues facing Western civilization for centuries. \u00a0We are in the final stages of an assault which began a long, long time ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Easy-Meat-Britains-Grooming-Scandal/dp/1943003068/\"\u003eEasy Meat - Inside Britain\u0027s Grooming Gang Scandal\u003c/a\u003e was given away for free in 2014 (long before Rotherham became a household word). I gave the book away as I wanted there to be no impediment to the public knowing the scale of this crisis. After complaints that the book needed to be a physical book, I spent another six months re-writing it for a publisher. \u00a0It was published two years later, and even though it was ignored by the media, it has been the publisher\u0027s best-selling book (although the royalties for one year do not come close to a job paying minimum wage).\u00a0In 2014 my book predicted that members of the public would take the law into their own hand over the 40 year cover-up of this scandal. \u00a0Four years later this prediction was confirmed, as a man was found guilty of terrorist violence against Muslims, brought about by his anger at the state\u0027s complicity with Muslim criminality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy research for that book showed me many other areas where the public in Western democracies have been systematically deceived. My second book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mohammeds-koran.com/store\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMohammed\u0027s Koran - Why Muslims Kill For Islam\u003c/a\u003e, proves that terrorism has been the fundamental component of Islam\u0027s success, that this is sanctioned in the Koran, and that this was know to the educated elites in the West for 150 years before 9/11.\u00a0The subject is so controversial, no publisher would even take it for fear of an attack on their staff, like the way Charlie Hebdo were silenced. \u00a0Getting this book out has been like climbing another mountain. Nevertheless, over 700 five star reviews in just six months show that the public get what the book attempts, making it the only book to clearly decode Islam for non-Muslims.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporters of my work suggested I open a donations page, so I am going to try this and see if people understand the seriousness of the threat facing the West. \u00a0If we do not solve this problem through civilized means (an informed electorate, putting democratically elected laws into place) then the crisis will eventually result in violence. \u00a0And there is no guarantee that the native people will win such a civil war when it erupts in years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce articles on my website related to my publications. \u00a0I am the only person to maintain a list of those men (mostly Muslims) convicted for the organised rape of English schoolgirls (charities, police, media would rather the public had not record of the scale of this problem). I have a website which makes the Koran browsable, and shows across five different translations, that for any verse there is virtually no disagreement about the Koran\u0027s hatred of non-Muslims and Islam\u0027s desire to conquer us all, using shocking levels of violence to scare us into submission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve now started to make videos deconstructing the media lies. \u00a0This is a very time-consuming process (a three minute video might take 5 to 8 hours to produce). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
