    "summary": "What\u0027s up, and welcome to Pete\u0027s Basement! The best, most authentic, and hilarious comic book show anywhere since 2008! It\u2019s tough to find like minded friends to geek-out with. That\u2019s why Pete and his buddies get together every week in Pete\u2019s Brooklyn basement to talk about comics, and YOU\u2019RE INVITED TOO! Tune in and discuss everything from NEW COMIC BOOK DAY, to GOLDEN and SILVER-AGE COLLECTING, to TOYS, CARTOONS, MOVIES, TV, Classical Literature, WHISKEY, and everything in between! We\u2019re just a bunch of grown-ups with jobs and kids, who never gave up our love of comics, toys, and sci-fi. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND did we mention we\u2019re FUCKING HILARIOUS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst we\u2019d like to say thanks to the thousands of you who do tune in each and every week, email us, comment on social media, and join in live. YOU ARE THE BEST! You are the reason we\u2019ve been doing this for so long. And special recognition to the ones who have supported us with your money in the past by buying t-shirts and merchandise, or on Indiegogo, or subscribing to our premium show. Your support has meant a great deal to us, and in a very real way has kept us on the air. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU and Cheers (klink)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ve allowed us to not do the things we don\u2019t want to, like prostitu-- er, I mean advertisements or sponsored messages. To be good, we\u2019ve got to be as authentic and uninterrupted as possible, like something you\u2019d find on a premium channel. We\u2019re opinionated, raw, not pandering, and we are intend to keep it that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where Patreon comes in. Now YOU can be a PATRON of PETE\u2019S BASEMENT. So what exactly is a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the North Haven Community School:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the Renaissance, being a \"patron\" meant much more than being a wealthy person who sponsored an artist for their work. It signified a way of life, a ranking, a prestige that members of the upper classes strived for and the lower class aspired to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are like the Pope, and Pete\u2019s Basement is like Michelangelo. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou want to fulfill your vision of a Golden Era of Geekdom, and so you sponsor our creation of Pete\u2019s Basement-- the Sistine Chapel of comic book podcasts. A work so fantastic in it\u2019s enormity and rich with innovation and impact that society will be forever altered by it. Grown men will openly weep and embrace their enemies bringinging an end to all war and economic disparity. Scholars will study its depths for thousands of years until a quantum harmony causes a glorious unification of love and understanding due to the indescribable beauty of the many lessons taught to humankind by Pete\u2019s Basement, and the heavens and all matter will be brought together in a new level of consciousness THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR PATRONAGE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND did we mention we\u2019re FUCKING HILARIOUS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically you use this website (Patreon.com) to pledge continued monetary support to us. However much you choose and can afford. From a dollar a month, up to billions of dollars in gold bullion. And aside from our undying gratitude, you\u2019ll get exclusive rewards like membership to the official Pete\u2019s Basement fan club, exclusive merchandise only available to patrons, exclusive hangouts with THE Pete and Basement crew! And the rewards just keep getting more exclusive as your patronage grows. For instance, at the two million dollar a month level, you get to MARRY PETE! Don\u2019t like him that much? No problem, you get to marry him to a third party of your choosing! Wait-- oh no? What? We\u2019re not doing the \u2018Marry Pete\u2019 thing. Sorry. I guess not that one. But lots of other very exclusive perks come with your patronage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we really want to hear from YOU, what types of rewards you\u2019d like to see. Feel free to drop your ideas on us, and we\u2019ll try our best to make your wishes come true. And we have a lot of cool milestones in mind that will kick in once we reach certain levels. Merchandise, special show, and cool contests to unlock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s no risk, you\u2019re free to cancel your pledge at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis allows us to be way more flexible with what we offer. From now on the ENTIRE VIDEO SHOW will be available free of charge to everyone. That means the live Periscope show is here to stay! And you can look forward to more ways to hang out and geek out with your favorite subterranean comic book buds as we grow our patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePete\u0027s Basement Trailer\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHh9O-sYFl4\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
