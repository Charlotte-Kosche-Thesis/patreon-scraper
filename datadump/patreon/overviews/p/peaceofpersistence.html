    "summary": "You know that idea that we become more like the people with whom we spend our time? That\u0027s why I created \u003cem\u003eThe Peace of Persistence\u003c/em\u003e, where we seek to uncover the keys to happiness and success one honest conversation at a time. To surround myself, and my audience with the best people I could find, people who are extremely happy, satisfied with life, and have had some success. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo inspire each of us by highlighting positive examples of good, everyday people living joyfully and doing extraordinary things\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite fan of the show so far is a sweet older woman who sings with me at St. Patrick\u0027s Cathedral. One day, she stumbled upon\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n_7KfT_qk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy interview with actress Jen Ponton\u003c/a\u003e. She had been feeling lonely, and she said that \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003espending part of her afternoon with us lifted her mood and made her feel less alone\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. In our current climate of selfies, the facades we sometimes share to on social media, and all of the negative and hateful news in our world, I believe uplifting and positive media deserves to be celebrated and shared. So, we sit together each week and talk about how to thrive and how to make ourselves and our world better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I have lots of goals for the show. With the exception of my amazing interviewees, I basically produce, create, host, and edit every show completely on my own.  Because of time restraints while I hustle to make a living in Manhattan, it\u0027s been incredibly difficult to keep the show consistent and even to take the time to meet and interview new guests. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll have the freedom to be more creative and keep the show going with great, helpful and positive content\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Ultimately, I\u0027d also love to be able to upgrade equipment and even hire team members to bring you the highest quality content we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll still offer a free version to the public, but those will have ads and be only about 1/3 of the total interview. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eFor $2 per episode, you\u0027ll have access to the extended version of each audio podcast we produce. You\u0027ll also have access to each video episode we produce at no added cost\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cem\u003eOh, and don\u0027t worry. You can set a monthly max so you \u003cstrong\u003enever\u003c/strong\u003e go over budget.\u003c/em\u003e For $3 per episode, you\u0027ll also be contributing to help us create more videos, including the half hour versions that air on NYC\u0027s public access channel, for people like my sweet older fan who can get public access tv but not the Internet. Your Patreon videos are still completely extended and never get cut off at the 28 minute mark - you just get to say you did a good deed for viewers in need. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m so grateful to everyone who tunes in, but especially you, my supporters.
