    "summary": "I\u2019m Paddy Valdyr, the founder of the Valdyr Consortium. I\nstarted playing video games online when I was around fourteen years old (so\nthat I don\u2019t have to feel old, we don\u2019t discuss how long ago that was) and\nright away I saw the key element of online gaming was community; That\nintangible feeling of being surrounded (even virtually) by people that share\nyour passion, while doing what you love. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs the years progressed I picked up pen and paper gaming\nwith the Star Wars Saga Edition rulebook and was forever engrossed in the\nversatility and mysticism of tabletop roleplay. Thanks to my coworkers at the\ntime, I was transported into an uncountable number of worlds.  As time moved on though, many of my friends\nchanged jobs and schedules and I realized that the online communities out there\njust didn\u2019t offer the same sense of camaraderie that I desired.  Having experience in a number of video game\nclans in the past, I decided it was time to revamp an old website and provide a\nsense of fellowship to a group of fellow roleplayers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I don\u0027t have a dedicated artist yet, I am currently seeking one. Thus, for now the graphics may seem lacking and for that I apologize. Keep in mind this is a brand-new venture and some of the pieces are still coming together. Your support allows me to gather these pieces much faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiversity and Good Times\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nThe Consortium is designed to allow gamers, mainly of the\ntabletop variety but some involved in select video games as well, have a place\nto congregate and run their games in peace away from the heavy regulations and\nwatchful eye of other websites currently available. This group is much more\nselective in membership and allows for a plethora of material. Whether they\u2019re\nlooking for a one-night game or a three year campaign, gamers should have a\nplace to find it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nIn addition to the website and forum, we will offer voice\ncommunication with moderation available to assist with keeping the chat free of\n\u201cunwanted guests\u201d and uncomfortable distractions. The communication will be\nprofessionally-hosted and maintained, ensuring the stability modern gamers have\ncome to expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcasts and Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nIn the works, is a podcast for our tabletop adventures,\nsupporting several Game Masters and their stories. This will include a blog\nwith summaries of the sessions, recordings of the podcasts and other\ninformation about characters, settings, etc.\u003cbr\u003e"
