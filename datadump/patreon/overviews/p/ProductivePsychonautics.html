I\u0027ve been a writer for nearly ten years, and have recently decided to combine my experienced writing skills with hypnosis. Productive Psychonautics, stylized as 2P, is devoted to creating hypnosis visualization, personality, and experience files. I\u0027ve been convinced by friends to open a patreon, allowing me to have some spare money to fund these passion projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I am using a completely new, formerly undeveloped way of producing hypnosis files. With this method, it is possible to produce personalized, custom files. This is done through the use of a modular method that is unique to the way I write and create hypnosis. Before I can use this method to help you however, I have to make sure your safety and privacy are secure. There is a one dollar Patreon option, and by choosing that tier, I assure you client-adviser confidentiality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that\u0027s not your speed however, then you can still expect to see a steady stream of files created and edited for public release.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA list of content you can expect from me:\u003cbr\u003eProductive Psychonautics\u003cbr\u003e-- Hypnosis Personality files\u003cbr\u003e-- Hypnosis Experience Files\u003cbr\u003eStories on Fimfiction\u003cbr\u003e-- MLP smut of course\u003cbr\u003e-- MLP adveture fics\u003cbr\u003e"
