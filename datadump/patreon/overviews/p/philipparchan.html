What I mean by truth is: I get more and more of a feeling that I need to do what I REALLY want to do in this world, in this life, instead of never really having the courage to actually start doing that. Writing, producing and sharing \u003cstrong\u003emusic\u003c/strong\u003e around the world, \u003cstrong\u003einspiring\u003c/strong\u003e myself and others while sharing my personal evolution, growth, conquering diminishing beliefs \u003cstrong\u003eand supporting others\u003c/strong\u003e in evolving in a self-loving way. Yes I\u0027ve walked many different paths so far and there\u0027s fear about moving into this more kind of uncertain life but I can\u0027t help, it keeps coming back to me and also there\u0027s excitement in all of this. And if I feel fear and excitement about something, that\u0027s usually a sign to take a breath and then go for it. So finally I feel ready enough to go one step further towards living my truth and focusing on the things that I REALLY want to bring to this world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat I do - Living truth\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMusic has always been a big part of my life and it always will be. I want to continue writing songs and recording them, making videos for some of them, teaming up with other musicians for collaborations, and share them with the world via video and also playing them live. The music industry (as a lot of industries) has been changing a lot and the ways for musicians to be supported by their music (to be able to keep on making music) are changing with it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://philipparchan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/onstage-patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a musician you need lots of equipment, you have to juggle other areas such as audio and video production and editing, marketing your own creations on several social platforms, provide graphic material and keep your fans updated, plan and organize your concerts and tours etc. I love the wide range of activities but it is challenging and even harder if you have to do it all on your own, pay for all of it yourself and doing it next to all of the other work that you are doing for money. So I am using Patreon to be supported in doing more music and doing it more consistently, bringing in other creatives to make awesome projects and ideas happen (and be able to pay them, finally) and share it all with the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLUc1ioa8FM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eVideos\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the past few years I\u0027ve learned so much in watching videos from people sharing what\u0027s going on in their life, what revelations and realizations they had, how their story unfolded, what\u0027s become true for them recently and what insights they had when going their own way of living their truth, connecting with themselves, falling in love with themselves and life, surrendering and letting go. I also want to create more videos of what\u0027s been helping me, what kind of tools and mindsets have been working for me, things I realized, learned and adopted along the way and mostly INSPIRED me. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to be inspired and at the same time be an inspiration to the world by living my truth.\u003c/strong\u003e And I see it as a real gift, having learned so much already and grown a lot and having the possibility to do so at all, so that sharing my own learnings in my unique way is \u003cstrong\u003eone way of giving back. \u003c/strong\u003eAlso I know making videos like this is a personal comfort zone challenge for me and I will have to push myself to get comfortable with it, but I like growing and challenging myself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSupport\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith all of this I want to support other people who are on the way of \u003cstrong\u003ediscovering their own truth and deciding to live it.\u003c/strong\u003e I am so glad having received a lot of guidance from different people, and I learned to prioritize asking for support if I feel like I need to. Sometimes in life the fog seems to be so dense, we need somebody else to either help us move forward a little or remind us that above the clouds the sun is always shining. \u003cstrong\u003ePassing on my knowledge\u003c/strong\u003e and years of delving into self-development and personal evolution through courses, certifications, books (lots of books), videos, conversations and retreats has always been a great passion of mine.

The money will be used for producing music and music videos, \u0027vlogging-style\u0027 videos, maintaining all my online platforms including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://philipparchan.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, music equipment, technical equipment, travel costs, living costs and once I can cover all of this by my Patreon-income I will think of some beautiful ways to spend the excess income.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Are you offering coaching outside of Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA: Yes, please just get in contact with me via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://philipparchan.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ephilipparchan.com/contact\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why are you doing all of this in english when your mother tongue is german?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA: First of all, because I really enjoy doing so. I love the english language, talking to people who are native english speakers and obviously I am writing songs in english. Also my vision is to be playing music, inspiring and supporting people all over the world so I am aligning my actions to my vision (yes, I\u0027m a fan of Dr. Joe Dispenza but let\u0027s talk about this soon.) In doing so, I am not at all neglecting my german mother tongue or my amazing home country Austria, I love both of them. I just enjoy not being tied to a certain area on our beautiful planet.\u003cbr\u003e"
