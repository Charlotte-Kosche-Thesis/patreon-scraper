I chose to create my Patreon because it is an amazing platform that allows users to support their favorite artists so they can continue doing what they love, while getting exclusive rewards in return! Your support on Patreon will help me create, commission and buy new costumes as well as create tons of new content for you all! By pledging you can get many rewards like digital pic sets, prints, videos, access to my private snapchat, stickers, and so much more! I hope that with help and inspiration from you all I can create some amazing cosplays and content along the way! For more cosplay content follow me on Instagram @poetic_steam_hippie and check out my page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/poeticsteamhippie\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePoetic Steam Hippie\u003c/a\u003e on Facebook!\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/poeticsteamhippiecosplay/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eREWARD INFO:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I will do one or more photo shoots to create exclusive pic sets. . This includes a monthly selfie set and a pro set. All $5 and up tiers get the full selfie set. Each tier $5 and up will get a set of pro pics. The $5 tier will get a mini set of pro pics that are sexy but absolutely no implied nudity or nudity. The $15 and $25 tiers will get a medium size set of pro pics with some implied nudity. The $50 and up tiers will get the full exclusive pro set including all NSFW pics. *Full nudity is never guaranteed, most NSFW sets include topless and implied nudity!* Birthday packages are only eligible to $5 and up Patrons who are pledging during their birthday month. Physical rewards, birthday packages and giveaway packages are mailed at the beginning of each month for the previous month. Digital rewards go out depending on when shoots are done and when the pics are ready, so it could be any time during the month. Digital rewards are in the form of a Google Drive link and they are sent to you by message to your Patreon inbox. Occassionally some digital reward links will be posted on the Patreon feed for all Patrons to enjoy! If you pledge to a tier with physical rewards but do not wish to receive them you can remove your address from your pledge or let me know in a message. You may opt out of any rewards you don\u0027t want, just let me know. Giveaways take place at the beginning of the month for the previous month to assure everyone who pledged during the month is included. The $1 and up tiers will get a Selfie Drop folder, a Google Drive folder full of selfies, videos, gifs, bts pics and much more, so check it often as I will adding to it throughout the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay List for the Knight Tier (Cosplay Sponsorship):\u003cbr\u003eAlex (Totally Spies)\u003cbr\u003eButtercup - Sailor Scout, Wasteland or Punk (Power Puff Girls)\u003cbr\u003eCatwoman (DC Comics)\u003cbr\u003eDeku (My Hero Academia)\u003cbr\u003eD.Va - Casual Cosplay (Overwatch)\u003cbr\u003eElma (Miss Kobayashi\u0027s Dragon Maid)\u003cbr\u003eJubilee (X-Men)\u003cbr\u003eJuvia (Fairy Tail)\u003cbr\u003eKoneko (Highschool DxD)\u003cbr\u003eLevy (Fairy Tail)\u003cbr\u003eLola Bunny (Space Jam)\u003cbr\u003eMei - Casual/Boudoir (Overwatch)\u003cbr\u003eNeko Harley Quinn (Suicide Squad Version)\u003cbr\u003eRainbow Dash (My Little Pony)\u003cbr\u003eRaven (DC Comics/Teen Titans)\u003cbr\u003e*You may make a suggestion outside of this list, but I have the right to decline any suggestions.
