    "summary": "Hey guys, name\u0027s Jeremy, but everyone on the great wide nettertubes calls me \u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/user/PaulAsaran\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePaulAsaran\u003c/a\u003e. You may know me for having written such stories as \u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/195493/tyrant\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTyrant\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/250429/of-angels\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOf Angels\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/213853/the-gentle-nights-audience-of-one\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Gentle Nights: Audience of One\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m also known for my weekly review blog, in which I cast as fair a judgement as I possibly can upon the works of others. I have decided to use Patreon to pad my meager funding, and I thank all of you who elect to help me! Your contributions allow me to keep working on what I love, and in return I hope to continue providing everyone with strong reviews and the best literature I can offer. Now, to the rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eReview Vote\u003c/h2\u003eAs some of you may have noticed, my reviews are set in multiple types: RiLs (Read It Later), Requests, Recommendations, Sequels/Completions, and Re-Reads. These lists get extremely crowded, and I always review from each list in the order stories were added. This means stories can wait for months before being read (or, in the case of the RiL, years). Have a story that you really want to see reviewed, but don\u0027t want to wait the eternity it\u0027ll take for me to get to it? Here\u0027s your chance to do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e$2 Review Vote\u003c/h3\u003eAny patron donating $2 or more will be given the opportunity to vote on any story in my current schedule \u2013 \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e story. The story with the most votes will be immediately bumped to the top of its respective list, allowing it to skip months of potential waiting. Is your story at the bottom of the RiL list? Move it forward! Even if it doesn\u0027t receive the majority of votes, I may still bump it forward some based upon the number of votes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e$6 and $14 Review Votes\u003c/h3\u003eIf you\u0027re even more eager than the average Joe to see a particular story reviews, there are options. Anyone donating between \u003cstrong\u003e$6 and $13\u003c/strong\u003e will have their vote counted as two. No, you\u0027re not voting twice, and you can\u0027t vote on two different stories. Instead, whatever you choose to vote on for the current session will be given two votes instead of just one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the same token, anyone donating \u003cstrong\u003e$14 or more\u003c/strong\u003e will have their vote in the current session counted as three. Get your chosen story to the top of the list with your superior voting power!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRules\u003c/h3\u003eReview votes occur every two weeks via GDocs. A message and link will be sent out to all claimants a week before polling is due. In the event of a tie, I will act as the tie-breaker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll stories that receive votes will permanently retain half their votes for the next session. This means that even with only one vote per session, eventually a story is guaranteed to garner more votes than the opposition, so don\u0027t stop trying to get that story out there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePatreon Accelerated Review (PAR)\u003c/h2\u003ePatrons donating \u003cstrong\u003e$4 or more\u003c/strong\u003e have the option of requesting a Patreon Accelerated Review, or PAR. Unlike regular review requests, which must wait their turn regardless of how long that wait is, PARs are immediately bumped to the front of my Requests list. Since my Requests list can get very crowded very quickly, this can save the requester weeks or even \u003cem\u003emonths\u003c/em\u003e of waiting time. A perfect option for writers who want to see their story reviewed as soon as possible! Only one PAR can be requested per patron at any given time. However, once your PAr has been read/reviewed, you are free to request another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s not all: any patron donating \u003cstrong\u003e$10 or more\u003c/strong\u003e per month may request \u003cem\u003etwo\u003c/em\u003e PARs at once. While the normal PAR can only be requested one at a time per patron, these patrons get to choose two stories at once to not only be bumped up in the Requests list, but also be reviewed in the same blog. That\u0027s a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of saved time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRules\u003c/h3\u003eAs stated above, only one PAR may be requested per patron at any given time, unless you\u0027re paying $10 or more, then you may request two. PARs are delivered on a first-come-first-serve basis. Pars are released bi-weekly so that regular requesters don\u0027t languish forever behind a steady stream of PARS. If five or more PARS are in my queue at any given time, I will do a PAR-only blog to hasten the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDominant Story Vote\u003c/h2\u003eAt any given time, I am working on three different stories. These stories are given priority levels, which in turn determines how much attention I give them and their rate of updating. The Dominant Story is the top priority and is meant to be updated at a rate of roughly once a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons donating \u003cstrong\u003e$18 or more\u003c/strong\u003e will be sent a poll every two months listing my three ongoing stories at that time. The story that garners the most votes will become the new Dominant Story, updating faster than the others. If there is a particular story you want to see updating faster, this is your chance to influence that! In the instance of ties, I will be the deciding vote.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that this vote will only determine the top priority. I retain the right to determine the priority level of the remaining two stories, regardless of how they fared in voting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePre-Reader\u003c/h3\u003eWant my opinion \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e your story gets reviewed... or even published? Patrons donating \u003cstrong\u003e$25 or more\u003c/strong\u003e may call upon my services as a pre-reader. I\u0027ll look over your story (GDocs preferred) and let you know anything I found fault with or particularly liked, proofing included.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven that this kind of reward could take up a lot of my time, I\u0027m only allowing \u003cstrong\u003eone of these at any given time\u003c/strong\u003e. For the same reason, I will only read through your story once, after which I will allow other patrons a week to request my services. If none do, you may ask for a second read-through of your story, if you think it\u0027s necessary.\u003cbr\u003e"
