Erm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing and making music since before I could play the keyboard (which is my main instrument), plonking along at the keys until I found something that would work. I also spent wayyy more time writing lyrics than I did on school work (oops), which means I know how to put two words together and make them sound good!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy songs are a study of the human condition, so to speak. I write about depression, abuse, anxiety, longings and yearnings for something else, but also lighter things when I\u0027m feeling silly. I think I have a fairly broad range as far as themes go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music, specifically, generally goes under the \"left field pop/rock\" category. I spend a lot of time creating melodies and harmonies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank anyone who comes by my page, and especially all three of you who made it through this entire blob of text! If you decide to support me, I will be forever and ever and ever grateful. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind some of my music on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/proteansol\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e."
