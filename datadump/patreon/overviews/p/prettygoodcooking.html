It\u0027s easy if you try.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn and Phil created Pretty Good Cooking in late 2014. It all started one evening at Phil\u0027s when he jokingly suggested to John that they start filming the dinners they made every week and throwing them up on YouTube. John really likes filming and editing so he took Phil\u0027s jest seriously and the rest is history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASMCxPgsBMw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty Good Cooking is filled with fun and laughs, but also food education. We make stuff that we\u0027d normally make for ourselves so everything on the show could easily be made with a little work and a belief in yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut sometimes the ingredients can be a little expensive and John\u0027s filming and editing equipment needs some upgrades. Also Phil\u0027s blender is broken and his knives need sharpening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fx-xEK60nfw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to contribute to the Pretty Good Cooking cause by donating anything here on Patreon we\u0027d be both very surprised and appreciative. Even if you don\u0027t donate, we\u0027re still going to be putting out the best new videos every week that we can. But if you\u0027d like to thank us for our hard work with some money, that would be awesome and we\u0027ll use it to make the show even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you ever want to see a normal blender on the show again, watch us mess with more expensive ingredients, or see what could happen with an increased special effects budget - you know what to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERy9txg2iME\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about the rewards or anything to do with us or the show, feel free to ask away! Also if you have any suggestions for patron rewards or additional goals we should set, we\u0027d love to hear it. We plan to include our purchases in our videos and show you what your donations are going towards as well as thanking you all in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all your support! We really appreciate each and every one of you. We love making the show and hearing from you all. You guys make it worth it.
