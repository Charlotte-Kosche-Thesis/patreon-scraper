Now, a few years later a number of people are pushing me to take this project to the next level.  In order to do that, I\u2019m going to need more than just some video advice and external prodding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have moved on from Archeage, although all the Archeage 101 content will remain up at YouTube.\u00a0 \u00a0I will now be looking towards Bless from May until Q4 2018 when I transition into Ashes of Creation Alpha 1.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I decided to do a Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to become the voice of 50,000 gamers.\u00a0 I want to be able to have such a presence in the MMO community that when a company does something silly, I can show up, poke my head in and say \"What do we have going on in here?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHas Jahlon sold out?
