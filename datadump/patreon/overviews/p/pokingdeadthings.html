We all lead busy and chaotic lives, allow yourself the time to slow down and enjoy the beauty and complexity of nature.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eJoin me on adventures through the woods and lakes to scavenge natural art supplies while taking in the beauty of the natural world.  Learn about some of the flora and fauna I encounter, as well as great places to hike in Southeast Michigan.  View occasional interviews with rangers from the Michigan Department of Resources, Border Control, other scavengers and more.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003eTake a peek into my studio where I create my wearable works of art, the Bone Garden where I process the gooey stuff, my storefront to see how the retail end works and vending events to see how I sell my art on the road.  You will also have first access to purchase new creations before they hit my website or storefront.  If you would like to craft with me you can choose to receive mini project kits with video instructions (Continental US only, sorry).\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003eThis journey involves more than just artistic embellishments of nature\u0027s architecture, it\u2019s a balance of conservation, science and a grass-roots white knuckle ride into small business.  Get access to classes and discussion groups all about grass-roots (no or minimal capital) business for crafters and artists.  Enjoy some of my business rants, best practices and tricks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage I will have the ability to become more involved in wildlife conservation, business education, enhancing my creative process and to bring you more content to enjoy.  \u003cbr\u003eThank you! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
