Led by immense love, they decide to start their life together living\ntemporarily in Fred\u0027s (Nick\u0027s father\u0027s) house. Their plan seems simple at first\nsight. All the money they would spend on the rent, they will save up for the\ndream they\u0027ve had since the moment they met, and that is to buy their own\nplace. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, just as in real life, things are not as perfect as we plan them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat makes us\ndifferent than the others?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eA real life story!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e To be more precise, since the very beginning we\nhave been working on the plot that could (easily) happen to anyone in real\nlife. We offered Lily various paths. Nonlinear paths where you, the players,\ncan choose the way their lives will go on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe characters.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003eEach character has its own\nlife story. We create them with a lot of attention and we try to make each of\nthem act and think differently. Some are serious, some are strict or cunning,\nwhereas some are funny or too clumsy. What they all have in common is the fact\nthat none of them is unchangeable, but very flexible, depending on the path the\ngame goes. That,\nof course, counts for our main character-Lily, too. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eChoices.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/span\u003eIn this one, choices actually matter. So far,\nevery choice in the game has had its meaning. You should know that even the\nlittle ones, you might think won\u0027t matter much, get recorded and that they can\ngreatly influence the rest of the game. We pay a lot of respect to\nnonlinearity, and that is why you need to be aware that, in some days, not\nnecessarily in all of them, you won\u0027t be able to go through all the scenes in just one day.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eBody, Stamina, Intelligence.\u003c/span\u003e Lily is designed\nto be changeable in every single way. The system changes her body depending on\nthe number of trainings, her intelligence increases depending on how much she\nreads, and her stamina limits the number of quests she can do per day. It\u0027s\nimportant to mention that training or studying every day doesn\u0027t have to bring\nchange. A certain time span is necessary for her to upgrade.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eAnimations, renders and game\nmechanics.\n\u003c/span\u003e Every\nrender starts with a \"T\" pose. What does that mean? Simply said, that\nmeans that we don\u0027t use default poses, but, we load in every\ncharacter from scratch and we shape every single joint of theirs. For example,\njust one hand has fifteen joints. Same goes for even more complicated\nanimations, some of which contain more than thirty renders. Everything is\nmanually set up, including every prop in every scene. As for the code, it is\npretty unique, too. This is one of the first games where animations are\nconnected to and cooperating with texts. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eOverall\u003c/span\u003e, our goal is, to leave the impression of an authentic\ngame experience we are certain is different than any other, through the highest\nquality and ever more realistic content. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow much content have we created so far?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHonestly, it is very hard to determine the number of hours\nneeded to\ngo through the created content. We roughly calculated that there is\nenough content for eight hours of playing without loading a specific day to see\nall the scenes. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, I can precisely say that, so far, the game contains 1287 Cg-s and 77 (1543 Renders) animations, which makes a total of 2830 renders.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eScreenshots:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4KQj197.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0C4U8ie.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1j6EAVZ.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XarJCRu.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u0026amp;\nA\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eMy name is P.\u003c/span\u003e I don\u0027t know if I could give myself so much\nright as to call myself a writer, but, basically, I am responsible for every\nsingle word in the game. Together with my partner P, I create characters, and\nI make sure each of them is different and unique. I\u0027ve been in the adult world\nfor more than eight years, and with my experience I try to make usual and\ncommon things\ninteresting in this game. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eHis name is P.\u003c/span\u003e He is pretty much responsible for everything\nelse.

However, we both have families, which is\nwhy we spend most of our time by the phone when we work on this project. But,\nrecently, we\u0027ve come up with the idea to rent a place where both of us could\nwork together. We\u0027ve also agreed to have that as our next patreon goal because\nwe think that will significantly improve the updating process. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s\nthe dream?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis\none\u0027s easy.
