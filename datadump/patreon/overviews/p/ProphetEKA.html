I\u0027m Erik Amill (ProphetEKA) - graphic artist and creator of the comic \u0027Biff the Vampire\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are reading this, I\u0027m probably d-- Wait... wrong document. o.O\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve come to ask you, my fellow \u0027Net going peoples, to help me keep doing the voodoo that I do every so often. What is that, you ask? Simple! It\u0027s drawing stuff!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.SillyVamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sillyvamp.com/images/150220-Patreon%28Biff%29.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 175px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u2020 Background \u2020\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince February 2006, I have been putting out the online comic \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sillyvamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBiff the Vampire\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. This light-hearted strip has helped me accomplish things I had never dreamed of (and some I had but never thought would happen). I got a lot of stories in me still and Biff and the crew have been the vehicle through which I can bring most of them to you folks out in the aether.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said, Biff isn\u0027t the only idea I have going. A recent creation has been a series of monster girl pics - \n\u003cstrong\u003eGhouls\u0027R Gals\u003c/strong\u003e. What started as a way to warm-up/wind down from working on Biff by drawing cute monster girls for the strip has become a fun project all its own, even spawning a collected edition with others on the way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://propheteka.deviantart.com/gallery/33710269/Monster-Girls\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/1326112ea4e2dd58dd9e540344e02e30/tumblr_mxw9m2369I1qafzi2o1_500.jpg\" style=\"float: right; width: 175px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eBoth of these are labors of love. I don\u0027t ask for cash to view this stuff but I have had a number of awesome folks donate, buy ad space and even buy my ebooks. This, along with various side jobs, helps me keep the lights on. This leaves little time to work on other things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a \n\u003cem\u003eGhouls\u003c/em\u003e story idea revolving around a few girls I\u0027ve created that I would love to work on but had to be placed on the back burner due to time and financial constraints. Other such projects are the more horror-based anthro story \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://propheteka.deviantart.com/gallery/6811216/24hr-Comic-2008-Night-of-the-Lepus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNight of the Lepus\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and a reboot of a pre-Biff comic idea called \u003cstrong\u003eProject: Alice\u003c/strong\u003e. These ideas sit waiting in the wings while I do what I gotta\u0027 do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t put the time I need into those projects without dropping a paying side job. Thanks to Patreon, I can lessen the blow a bit and not worry too terribly about making those projects because \n\u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e would become my side job.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u2020 Goals \u2020\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon has two very simple goals:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e- To help me keep Biff and Ghouls\u0027R Gals going and...\u003cbr\u003e\n- To allow me the option, should I so choose, to expand out into other back-burnered properties.\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u2020 Why Patreon? \u2020\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, you\u0027re probably wondering why go this route? Know that this is not an option I chose without \n\u003cem\u003eA Lot\u003c/em\u003e of thought.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI currently have a few ways for folks to help me keep things going - eBooks, physical doodads like shirts and playing cards, a Donate button - and those are all quite awesome. They\u0027ve helped me in a pinch more times than I can count. Unfortunately, they have their limits. With Patreon, folks have that extra option to support the strip and my work in a completely different way - on their own terms and on a monthly basis.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u2020 Will This Change Things? \u2020\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those worried that this is a dreaded \"Paywall\": Not going to happen. I\u0027ve never been one to hide my stuff from the world or the \u0027Net. This is what it is, yet another way to help me keep the lights on and possibly get more content I couldn\u0027t justify doing otherwise. A Win-Win, really.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d love to help but can\u0027t, fear not! What lands here will eventually go out to the world later. = )\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, please consider supporting me in my artistic endeavors.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e~ EKA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
