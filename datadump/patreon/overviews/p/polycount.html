    "summary": "I\u0027m setting this page up to help fund Polycount. As we\u0027ve grown over the years, so have our operating costs. We\u0027re now spending between 1500 to 2000 USD per month on keeping the lights on. Our growth has also given us monthly expenses that we never had in the past like accountants, lawyers, and business taxes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of our funding comes from being a service provider on the Steam Workshop. This has been an amazing gift to us and helped us get the site to it\u0027s current incarnation. It helped me to concentrate on running the site as a job rather than balance it as a second job as I had for well over a decade. Unfortunately the Workshop revenue is inconsistent and best and has fallen off dramatically over the past year. We\u0027ve long offered ads which while they can help keep the lights on they are unable to sustain full time employment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t start the site to make any money. That wasn\u0027t even a consideration until years after we had become a community. As I\u0027ve told many people over the years, Polycount has been my own personal karma machine. It was a happy accident that I was able to nurture into an unbelievable community for almost 20 years now. We are always looking for new ways to grow in a way that still keeps us true to ourselves and our community. I embrace this as a challenge for us to overcome and do not want to take a heavy hand to monetize the site. All of us that work behind the scenes at Polycount hope that you can understand appreciate the balance we try to keep as we continue to nurture the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current focus is looking for a new full time job. It\u0027s the number one thing I personally can do to help make Polycount more financially secure over the long run. Once I am supporting myself with an outside income, Polycount will be able to move forward as we\u0027ll have more funding to pay designers and programmers for the sorts of things we want to bring to the community. I will continue to do the same things I always have, I\u0027m just hoping to go back to being paid with karma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndrew \"rogue13\" Risch\u003cbr\u003eFounder @ Polycount\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
