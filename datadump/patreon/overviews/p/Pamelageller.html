She is the author of \u003cem\u003eThe Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration\u0027s War on America \u003c/em\u003e(foreword by Ambassador John Bolton) (Simon \u0026amp; Schuster) and \u003cem\u003eStop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance\u003c/em\u003e (WND Books). She is also a regular columnist for numerous publications.\u003cbr\u003eGeller\u0027s activism on behalf of human rights has won international notice. She is a foremost defender of the freedom of speech against attempts to force the West to accept Sharia blasphemy laws, and against Sharia self-censorship by Western media outlets. Her First Amendment lawsuits filed nationwide have rolled back attempts to limit Americans\u0027 free speech rights and limit speech to only one political perspective, and exposed attempts to make an end-run around the First Amendment by illegitimately restricting access to public fora. Her free speech event in Garland, Texas led to the capture or killing of several murderous jihadists, smoking out terror cells, leading to an increase in the threat level to BRAVO and to the consequent arrests of jihadists in several states.\u003cbr\u003ePamela Geller has been the subject of a profile on 60 Minutes, and of cover stories in the Sunday New York Times Metro section and the UK\u0027s Independent. The Times also published an in-depth interview with her. She has made appearances on NBC Nightly News, ABC, CNN, AP, Reuters, the Sean Hannity Show, the Bill O\u2019Reilly Show, Red Eye, Geraldo, the Mike Huckabee show, and other shows on the Fox News channel. She has been featured in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Village Voice, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph.\u003cbr\u003eGeller\u2019s articles and op-eds have been published in Time Magazine, the Guardian, Commentary Magazine, Fox News, The Washington Times, Breitbart News, The Hill, Human Events, The American Thinker, Newsmax, Pajamas Media, Israel National News, World Net Daily, FrontPage magazine, New Media Journal, and Canada Free Press, among other publications.\u003cbr\u003eGeller has also led awareness campaigns in U.S., Europe, and Israel on behalf of the victims and potential victims of honor killing, for the human rights of apostates from Islam, for the freedom of speech, and more. She has placed ads nationwide on buses, taxicabs, billboards, and in subway stations, calling attention to the plight of victims of Sharia and countering the deceptive and misleading ad campaigns of the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and other Islamic supremacist groups.\u003cbr\u003eIn May 2013, she was awarded the Guardian of Freedom award by the Nassau County Federation of Republican Women. The Queens Village Republican Club, the oldest Republican club in America, honored Pamela Geller as the \u201cAmerican Patriot of the Year\u201d in February 2013. That same month, the Creative Zionist Coalition gave her the Queen Esther Award for Jewish Heroism. Pamela Geller also received the Annie Taylor Award for Courage in 2010 from the David Horowitz Freedom Center. In October 2011, the United States Marine Corps presented her with the flag flown on September 11, 2011 over Camp Leatherneck, \"amid the battlefields of Afghanistan during decisive operations against enemy forces in Helmand Province.\"\u003cbr\u003eGeller is a frequent guest on talk radio and has regular segments on two radio shows, The Jaz McKay Show and Jamie Allman In the Morning. Geller has been a featured speaker at the David Horowitz Freedom Center\u0027s Restoration Weekend and at numerous Tea Party and pro-freedom events across the nation.\u003cbr\u003ePamela Geller has broken numerous important stories -- notably the questionable and illegal foreign sources of some of the financing of the Obama campaign , the anti-Semitic posts on Obama\u0027s website, Obama\u0027s political organizing in public school classrooms, ACORN\u0027s destruction of Republican voter registrations, and many more, but perhaps she is best known for her leadership of the nationwide campaign against the Ground Zero mosque and her groundbreaking ad campaigns challenging jihad and sharia in the marketplace of ideas.\u003cbr\u003ePamela Geller began her publishing career at The New York Daily News and subsequently took over operation of The New York Observer as Associate Publisher.\u003cbr\u003e",
