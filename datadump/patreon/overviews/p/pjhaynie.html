Often. I have 6 blogs, a fully written musical album, hundreds of unrecorded tracks, 6 short stories and novels in progress, and a podcast in the works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGet a taste here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.writersoftherain.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.wattpad.com/user/PjHaynie\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAnd here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/jayniey\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.soundcloud.com/jayniey\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to write stuff!!! F-ed up stuff mostly. The topics and storylines can vary, but I want to share them with fans who \"get\" me and have thirst for fallen characters set to great music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary goal is to begin producing short stories and novels that are released with an accompanying soundtrack (title track with lyrics, and a few instrumental pieces depending on the length of the story). I love to dive into the world of my storybook characters and they don\u0027t quite come alive for me until I create music to define and reveal the secrets of their world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine this: sitting on your couch in winter, curled up with a good book, listening to tracks of moving music written specifically to fit that storyline. What greater way to spark your imagination?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also do a ton of other things depending on where my muse takes me: painting, abstract digital art, blogging, poetry, cover song recording, silly videos with short skits I write, podcasting (coming soon), and lots of random poetic and humorous lines I come up with and then jot down in my iPhone \"notes\" app. I want to share it all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut since I don\u0027t know how often I\u0027ll be posting these things - and therefore, you don\u0027t know how often you\u0027ll be required to contribute - I prefer to work on a monthly basis and provide access according to your pledge level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound cool? Sweet! It\u0027s crazy to me to imagine this might work - maybe it won\u0027t - but I know I\u0027ve got some serious talent scraping to get out and I\u0027ve tried everything else to share my work. If Patreon can\u0027t do it, perhaps I am doomed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support in advance, and please interact with me on here: I love to talk and chat with other creators and those who appreciate beauty in all it\u0027s forms. Everything I\u0027ve ever written, posted, or published is available for free, with a few extra perks for those who contribute at higher levels. I just ask that if you like it, you support me in my endeavor to make awesome stuff for a living!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you don\u0027t like it, I\u0027m totally cool with ramen, kool-aid, and a thankless day job. Sort of."
