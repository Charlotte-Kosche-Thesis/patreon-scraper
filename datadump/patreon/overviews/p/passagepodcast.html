    "summary": "A lifeboat was recently discovered floating in the middle of Puget Sound\u0027s Marrow Passage. Inside were four skeletons and a gun. But that\u0027s not the really interesting part. The really interesting part is the ship that this lifeboat belonged to: The S.S. Cumberland, a passenger vessel that disappeared off the Pacific Northwest coast almost 150 years ago to the day. Where did the lifeboat come from? Who were the people inside? And why did it appear now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaisy Bonham is an investigative journalist who wants to find the answers to all of these questions. She is planning to document her search for the truth in the \u003cem\u003ePassage\u003c/em\u003e podcast. Her investigation will take her to Port Possession, the Olympic Peninsula port town where the Cumberland last docked.

That means renting time at a recording studio with top-of-the-line equipment. That means hiring great actors who should be compensated for their efforts and time. That means investing in the creation of a website and artwork that help enrich the story as listeners follow us down the rabbit hole. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can I Help?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAwesome question, thank you for asking. By pledging to help us create episodes and tell the story we want to tell. The podcast will be free to everyone but Patreon supporters will receive special benefits other listeners won\u0027t get. That includes episode scripts, early-listens to upcoming episodes, and bonus information to help enhance the mystery. Depending on the level of support, we might even create a bonus episode or two exclusive to Patreon supporters. No matter what, we won\u0027t ever stop appreciating your support and the risk you\u0027ve taken on us. We take it seriously and we firmly believe we\u0027ll make your investment worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e"
