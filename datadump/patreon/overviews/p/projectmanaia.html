One of the main problems for Marine Biologists is to actually get out there and get a chance t do what they trained to do! Now since we started we managed to create a base out in the Remote Mergui Archipelago in Myanmar and build a Coral Farm and Nursery there - a unique testing ground for new methods and also Training Area for the local universities, that simply lack the funnding for projects like this. With YOUR support we could run the first Workshop for the Marine Biology students of Myeik University!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L61-SMBiWKk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we are aiming for a new goal. We sourced a 43 foot Sailboat soon to be used for Research in the Mediterranean. Lots of Marine Biologists have great ideas on their mind and simply lack the chance to turn in into a reality. With Research ships costing more than 10k a day we are the cheaper option.\u003cbr\u003eThe idea is that people with a project on hand but no funding can join us on board SV Independence and run their projects from there. We supply the home, the equipment and resources (with YOUR help) and they can do what they trained to do: SCIENCE - and as a bonus for you, our Patrons we will take the fancy science and put it into easy to understand videos for the whole world to see (and you will be among the first to do so!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZEkIFS5NKc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support we can help Biologists and researchers run the projects they are passionate about at sea!
