    "summary": "I\u0027m going to start this introductory section with a little introspection. Why? Because my life has taken more than its fair share of crazy and unexpected turns. At the time those turns were pretty impulsive, based on shiny objects and intriguing adventures. Looking back, however, I\u0027ve glimpsed a very different perspective. Much like footsteps in the snow, my path has been surprisingly straightforward and direct. Towards writing. Towards storytelling. Towards stylish ankle boots, too, but that\u0027s another story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy point is that in the past handful of years, I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to work on \u003cem\u003eBreaking Bad\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBetter Call Saul\u003c/em\u003e, granted in some extraordinarily minor capacity. Won a Silver Telly for a short film I wrote. Did a podcast that became almost popular across the pond. And now I\u0027m dipping my toes into webcomics, with plans to dip other limbs into other bodies of water.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut let\u0027s stick to my toes for now, or in this case,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003edpk431\u003c/strong\u003e. This is a story that\u0027s been rattling around in my brain for an embarrassingly long amount of time. I first conceived of it as an indie comic, then finally as a webcomic. Sadly, I discovered I have neither the patience nor the skill to actually draw what I had majestically envisioned in my head. So after several false starts and six-packs of adult beverages, I decided to embrace my weakness and launch a webcomic... without art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could describe the whole thing in excruciating detail, but it might just be faster and easier all around if you just checked the damn thing out, for good or for ill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://possiblegirl.com/dpk431\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edpk431: a webcomic without art\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it\u0027s for good then I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me on Patreon. I mean, I know this is a labor of love and all, but let\u0027s face it, wouldn\u0027t it be cooler for something like this (and the other undipped limbs) to be self supporting? Who knows, maybe I could even up my pace to two pages a week. Or do another podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, that\u0027s my pitch. I hope you enjoy the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
