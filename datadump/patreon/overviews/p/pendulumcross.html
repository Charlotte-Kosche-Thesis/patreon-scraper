(Also known as Burmuss!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work as a tech support agent for the VA in a neighboring city during the graveyard hours and I am an illustrator/comicbook artist as a passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor quite some time I have been spending about 11+ hours a day dedicated to work and commuting back and forward to the VA. It has been taking it\u0027s toll on me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut one of the things that has kept me going was drawing things that bring a smile to my face. \u003cbr\u003eIn this case, Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts (along side my original works).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with my main job eating away so much time, I decided to come to Patreon for help.\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I will be working on a giant crossover world based off of the fanfiction I have been working on known as Pendulum. It\u0027s a lovely excuse for me to draw the beautiful characters from the world of Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts! (smut included LOL)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe World of Pendulum Cross\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSo it all started with an image of my favorite Final Fantasy XV character.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.theshatteredworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/prompto_sm.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrompto Argentum worked his way into my heart so fast that I just didn\u0027t stand a chance. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, I always wondered what he would be like if I had the chance to make him a little edgier, sprinkle a little more fun into his character and just draw him in situations that would be rather entertaining to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out I wasn\u0027t alone in this. As soon as I started posting an AU version of Prompto (or as fellow fans call it: BAMF!Prompto) I knew that I had stepped into a new world with this character.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen the fanfiction was born and everything went nuts (in a good way!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe Fanfiction: \u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/12313350%E2%80%8B/chapters/27993081%C2%A0\"\u003ePendulum Fanfiction\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tumblr Page: \u003ca href=\"http://pendulumcross.tumblr.com/\"\u003ePendulum Cross\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram: \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theworldofpendulumcross/\"\u003eThe World of Pendulum Cross on Instagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it became a fun place that was darker, sensual and full of adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen one after another, more and more characters from the Final Fantasy (and just Square-Enix in general) began showing up and I knew I had a fun idea for a fan comic to these guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"902\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GAX7Ox84LH3nOxmDDwHg87UY0hsjsbttR646WpHjd6uW4Sf3JHebF4StNPvEBq5aBT69WiJ6AoH_wfuGbeAo1FHRBuAH0LoaUS28wtkLbNNRd12Ip1szdT7_QUmBYZM5ntr60k1Q\" style=\"width: 546px;\" width=\"600\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo after a few questions from some amazing Final Fantasy fans and inquiries for more art, I am hoping to find a means to provide amazing art and get a little support in order to remove a few bills from my shoulders!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on keeping the mass majority of the fanart and original work that I create free for viewing. However here on Patreon, you\u0027ll have access to WIPs, NSFW artwork and sketches, finished and Patreon exclusive work not displayed on my Tumblr Page, chances to participate in the voting polls for a monthly round of who to draw next and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will help me out greatly in easing off a lot of the bills and hopefully allowing me to make the shift to full time artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar goes a long way and so I hope you can help with becoming a Patreon and spreading the word!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for helping me reach my goals!"
