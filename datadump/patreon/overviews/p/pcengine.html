Well, it\u0027s only partially true. As someone who lives outside of the US, i need to complete a form which shows I\u0027m eligable to taxed payments overseas or something. As you can tell, I have no idea what any of this means. I was never told before hand that this would be the case, and I thought it would just be a simple paypal transaction monthly. I guess it isn\u0027t all that simple then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo everyone who has already payed, I will be finishing off your sketches very soon!
