I even share weekly play reports for every session of my \u003ca href=\"http://www.paperspencils.com/on-a-red-world-alone/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epost-apocolyptic mars campaign\u003c/a\u003e as supplemental material. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTL;DR: I write a lot of stuff. Maybe it\u0027s stuff that you like? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like some of your money to become my money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to use it to hire a sculptor who will create life-sized gold statues for each of the creatures in my upcoming post, \"d100 Dickbeasts.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid that make you laugh? Patreon told me you\u0027re more likely to give me money if my pitch is entertaining. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is much less fun. I want your money for the same reasons you want your money: to pay the bills. To buy food. To put windows into all the window-holes in my car. Right now, I pay for these things doing jobs that involve a lot of exhausting physical labor, which prevents me from writing as much as I want to. But if my writing can bring in some money, I can spend less time working those odd jobs. That\u0027s time I can use for more writing, which hopefully will result in more money. My long term goal is to create an infinite loop of More Writing\u0026gt;More Money\u0026gt;Less Job\u0026gt;, eventually becoming an Internet billionaire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short term, I\u0027ll settle for being able to pay artists and editors and layout people. If I can offload some of that work, then I can spend less time doing things I\u0027m bad at, and more time writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOH,\u003c/em\u003e and I\u0027d like to make my minimum student loan payment each month. That would be \u003cem\u003eawesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why do you think you deserve my money?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI don\u0027t. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t owe me anything for reading my work. I put it out there for free, and you will always have my sincere gratitude just for reading it. I didn\u0027t become a writer to extract money from people; I became a writer to connect with people. If you read what I write, and it has some kind of impact on you, then I\u0027m already getting what I want out of our relationship. I will keep doing that no matter what. I just want to do \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that\u0027s something you want as well--for me to write more--then you can help make it happen with money. Because right now, the only thing preventing me from writing more is a lack of time, caused by a lack of money. This Patreon doesn\u0027t exist because I deserve anything more from you. It exists to provide you with an option: if you like what you see, insert coin here to see more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, though, I\u0027m hoping a good chunk of you will take me up on that option. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I know you won\u0027t waste my money?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I write this, I\u0027m unemployed after reaching the end of a seasonal job. Five days a week I am out of bed before 7 in the morning, working by 8, and I keep working until 10, or even 12 at night. When I\u0027m done, I crash onto my bed so I can wake up the next day and do it again. It\u0027s exhausting, and it can be kinda miserable at times, but I love it. I love it so much that sometimes it creeps into my weekends, which I keep telling my ladyfriend that I\u0027m going to spend with her, but then there\u0027s that one little thing I didn\u0027t have time for earlier in the week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t say that I\u0027m the best writer, or even the most efficient one. I know guys who can turn words around in half the time I can. But I am getting better. I would like the opportunity to focus on getting better still. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Why are pledges by month, instead of by post?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause I can guarantee my monthly output.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause I\u0027m not qualified to decide what you want to spend money on. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause rewards shouldn\u0027t cost you money. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027ll elaborate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I can guarantee my monthly output because I\u0027m currently working several months ahead. If I died tomorrow, Papers \u0026amp; Pencils would continue to update for 6 months. So when I say that I\u0027m going to make one blog post each week, that isn\u0027t a vague promise waiting to be disrupted by my next hangover or headcold. It\u0027s \u003cem\u003eguaranteed.\u003c/em\u003e And if I\u0027m ever NOT working several months in advance, I will suspend my Patreon until I get back on top of things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, when a Patreon campaign is paid per creation the creator is responsible for deciding whether each post they make will be billed their patrons, or not. My brain just isn\u0027t shaped right to handle that sort of responsibility. I would tear myself to pieces wondering if it\u0027s okay to charge you for the \u003ca href=\"http://www.paperspencils.com/2016/12/08/santicore-2015-dwarves-beards-what-are-they-for/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003erandom supplemental\u003c/a\u003e I tossed into the middle of the week. Or what if I post something \u003ca href=\"http://www.paperspencils.com/2016/07/11/lotfp-class-djinn-kin/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eshort\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"http://www.paperspencils.com/2017/01/08/what-i-need-to-improve-on-as-a-referee-2017-edition/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epersonal\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"http://www.paperspencils.com/2016/12/25/7403/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eoutside my wheelhouse\u003c/a\u003e? I take pride in everything I write, but I\u0027m not always confident other people will see it that way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy going the pledge-by-month route, I can rest easier knowing that nobody is stuck paying for something they didn\u0027t enjoy reading. And my patrons can rest easier, because they know exactly how much their patronage will cost each month. No nasty surprises if I\u0027m more active than usual, just the pleasant surprise of getting a bit of extra game content you weren\u0027t expecting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich leads in to my final point: rewards should not cost you money. If you\u0027ll look over at my goals, you\u0027ll notice that the more money I get, the more often I\u0027m going to post. If you were pledging by post, then reaching those goals would cause your Patreon bill to go up, since more posts means more money. I want to increase my posting frequency as a thank-you to people who support me, not as a way of milking them for more cash. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"If you\u0027re working so far ahead, why don\u0027t you just post more frequently already?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePart of the reason I maintain such a huge buffer is because I want Papers \u0026amp; Pencils to be stable and reliable, which my life isn\u0027t. For example, I was intensely busy from June-November 2016. During that whole 5 month period, I wrote maybe 4-6 posts, but P\u0026amp;P kept on chugging along as normal week after week. If I hadn\u0027t built up that huge buffer, the blog would have been dead for several months. Just thinking about that makes me feel sad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bigger reason, though, is that I need to start making money from writing. A man has gotta eat. And since blogging doesn\u0027t make money, I need to focus on \u003ca href=\"http://www.paperspencils.com/2017/01/15/nick-ls-whelan-project-roundup/\"\u003eprojects which might make money\u003c/a\u003e. The buffer gives me the opportunity to work on those larger projects, without worrying that the blog will fall silent in the meantime. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf, through this Patreon campaign, the blog does start to make money, then I can justify shifting some of my focus away from those larger projects. Which doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll ever abandon them, books are better than blog posts. But with the support of patrons, I could divide my attention more evenly between the blog, and the books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal with the goals?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to be realistic about what I can offer as incentives. We\u0027ve all participated in crowdfunding campaigns that promised the moon, then fell short. Since I already spend every ounce of my creative energy on writing, I\u0027m not in a position where I can do more just by working harder. But there are some things I can do to thank those who support me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe early goals, up to $300, are all things which can be accomplished with a minimal amount of adjustment to how I prioritize my time. After that, the next three goals are big, one-time projects. They\u0027ll each take a few months to complete, but won\u0027t represent a permanent change to my writing schedule. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that, the rest of the goals all represent a significant shift in how I\u0027ll plan out my days. This is appropriate since, by this point, Patreon would be my primary source of income. That being said, most of the latter goals will require some sacrifice from me, which I will be happy to make if we actually get there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most important thing about all of the goals is that they are things I \u003cem\u003ereally want to do\u003c/em\u003e. For pretty much every incentive on the goal list, I\u0027ve seriously considered doing it for free at one point in the last couple years. Each time, I rejected the idea because it would not be responsible of me to do extra work for free at this point. Not when the same time could be spent on something that makes money. But, if you give me money, I\u0027ll finally have an excuse to do all those irresponsible things I\u0027ve always wanted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Conclusion\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot just to those of you who give me your money--though you are my favorite. Thank you to everyone who wants to give me money but can\u0027t afford it, or who thought about giving me money but decided some other cause was more deserving. I appreciate your generosity with your time and your attention. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust not as much as I appreciate your generosity with your wallet. ;)\u003cbr\u003e"
