The PRmia Trance Art inspiration came, as an answer to a prayer. I asked for an inspiration that could provide an early retirement, and the opportunity to travel.\u00a0 It has long been my dream to travel and make my living off my creative talents. So, I requested that this new inspiration be something that I could do anywhere, anytime and with minimal supplies. The PRmia art, requires only a Sharpie, a piece of paper, and a laptop!!! How perfect! The idea came instantly and has turned my whole world around! I have already risked a lot to bring it to where it is now and am willing to risk even more because I don\u0027t think it wise, to waste an answered prayer. I am stepping out in faith and going for it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough my jewelry, and orgonite creations, are wonderful and fulfilling to create, the PRmia  trance art drawings are beyond amazing, in their ability to heal and create peace. The PRmia project is worthy of my best efforts, my commitment, and my dedication. I have seen the calming and clarifying effect it has on people. I have seen its healing and stress-relieving qualities at work. I have watched the way it delivers messages from Spirit, to those open and wanting to receive. I want to put the PRmia, as well as my other healing arts, in front of as many people as possible. I am intent on sharing it, far and wide, as a way to bless many and provide for my personal needs at the same time.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Impact my Vision Can Make\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am only one person, yet I have much, in the way of experience, healing tools, inspiration, advice and vision, to offer the people, who\u0027s paths I\u0027ll cross.\u003cbr\u003eI want to teach people about energy work and the power of Love and reciprocity, to heal and bring positive change.

Within the last few years, I began to see the therapeutic effects of meditative coloring.              For me, meditative coloring connects me with my inner child, and that is healing. \u2026               Each page has one or more primary image(s).

While coloring or meditating, you will notice shapes connecting together to form smaller images.In one drawing I found leaves, seeds, ripples of water, and even veins or tributaries.      The images and symbols you find assist you in your conscious and subconscious life.

PRmia Art is a 22 page coloring book. Pages are all one sided. The paper is normal thickness so you may need to add a piece of paper between the pages for bleed through. The pictures in this coloring book are very different and unique. I have never seen another coloring book like this one. I cant wait to be able to sit down and color one of these pages. A lot of coloring books look alike and or have a lot of the same designs. If you want something different to color than this coloring book is for you. Angie started drawing the art for these coloring books on Feb 12th,2015. She has already created 2 coloring books, PRmia Art for Coloring and PRmia Art for Coloring Book #2. She is starting on book 3 and 4 but isn\u0027t going to bring those out until the first 2 coloring books get up and going well but she says she is prepared for that. Angie has been married to her husband Kevin for 5 years. Between the two of them they have 6 grown children and (almost) 7 grand kids(one on the way). Angie has 2 pets, One is a Chinchilla named Ziggy and the other is a male Beta Fish named Rainbow. Angie is a Holistic Healer and she says she has people who buy her coloring books just to contemplate the art and seek out different shapes within it. Some simply like to trace the lines with their fingers and they say it has a peaceful effect on them. The healing aspect of the art is very important to Angie.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can find Angie on Facebook here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/perceptionsandreflections\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cu\u003ehttps://www.Facebook.com/perceptionsandreflections\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can purchase Angie\u0027s coloring books on Etsy here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/PRmia\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cu\u003ehttps://www.Etsy.com/shop/PRmia\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat I Need..... \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBy choosing to support my project, you would allow me to purchase the things I\u00a0need, to do business on the road.

Suddenly, there it was! Once I started to color the image, I found myself relaxing, my breathing slowed and became deep and regular. My mind focused on choosing the colors and finding the patterns, hidden within the picture, that spoke to my subconscious mind.
