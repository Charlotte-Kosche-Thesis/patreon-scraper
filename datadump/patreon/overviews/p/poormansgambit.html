Combining fiddle, button accordion,\nguitar, bodhran, banjo, vocals and dance, this fresh and energetic band thrills\ncrowds with their new take on traditional music. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThough initially formed as a pick-up band for some St. Pat\u2019s gigs, PMG\nquickly realized that their combination of musical styles was too good to\nignore. Achieving quick success, the trio was booked at most of the regional\nfestivals after releasing their first demo, and within six months, they were\nheadlining a tour of England and Ireland. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nPoor Man\u2019s Gambit\u2019s members\nhave had the honor of appearing as featured performers  with such internationally recognized acts as\nThe John Whelan Band, Danu, Haley \u0026amp; Dylan Richardson, and Ireland the Show.",
