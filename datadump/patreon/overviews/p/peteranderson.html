    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page. Most of what I do is related to automotive restoration, with a few \"How to\" videos thrown in. I\u0027ve been producing my video\u0027s since 2012 and expanded to include my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.chasingbrokencars.weebly.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.chasingbrokencars.weebly.com\u003c/a\u003e This has become an effective way of documenting past cars for my enjoyment in addition to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube channel began as a joke from my eldest daughter. When we weren\u0027t on family outings, parental duties were done for the time being and all the housework was completed, I\u0027d disappear outside and involve myself in lots of garage fun which normally meant tinkering with an old car. Where the kids would turn up for a chat, Alanah began filming me then showed me afterwards. I\u0027ve never liked my photo being taken and certainly wasn\u0027t keen to film anything, but she talked me into it and now it\u0027s something I enjoy immensely. Whenever I pick up a spanner I grab the camera, almost second nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who\u0027s enjoyed my videos, subscribed to my channel and/or commented. please also remember that there\u0027s certainly no obligation to fund what I\u0027m doing. I\u0027m appreciative for the growth it\u0027s enjoyed to date.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers and thanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeter Anderson"
