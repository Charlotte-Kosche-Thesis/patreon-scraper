    "summary": "Hey there! Proper Bird here. If you\u0027re reading this that means you\u0027ve taken the time to visit my Patreon, thank you! I\u0027ve been thinking about starting a Patreon page for a while now but the recent problems with Youtube have pushed me to actually get one going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should probably know I\u0027ve been sitting here for about half an hour now, not knowing what to write. I still don\u0027t, so I\u0027ll try and get to the point. Through Patreon I hope to be a little less reliant on Youtube\u0027s fickle ad revenue. I don\u0027t want to put mid roll ads on my videos, I don\u0027t want to take sponsor offers I can\u0027t get behind just to pay the bills. I want to create cool videos for you and hopefully entertain you in the process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you stumbled upon this page not knowing who I am or what I do at all. I create videos on Witcher lore, Final Fantasy XIV stories, Warcraft guides and opinion videos and honestly anything else that catches my interest. I don\u0027t tie myself to one game at this point because there are just too many games to love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said that, what does this get you? Well, the end goal is to be able to just remove advertisements from my Youtube videos entirely but that\u0027s longterm. I don\u0027t intend to paywall any videos ever but of course you do get some extras as a Patron. Like scripts I wrote with little side notes, pictures of undetermined things and you\u0027ll get to tell me directly that I need to make X video through either voting on polls or by saying \"please\" in a quick message. I get a lot of requests for videos these days so this is a good way to filter when I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sure I\u0027ll think of different ways to virtually hug you for your generosity but that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got for now. Know that I appreciate you no matter what, yes, even if you watch my videos with ad block on. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
