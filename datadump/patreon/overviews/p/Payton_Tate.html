    "summary": "Hello, I am an animator from YouTube, focused on reviving the long dead TF2 humor, creating several love-letters to the nonsense community on YouTube, whether it be an animation, a parody, or even an entire story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had about 2 years worth of Source Filmmaker animating experience, and overtime I\u0027ve never given up on the YouTube dream, tempting as it may be. And I don\u0027t plan to in the coming years, but making money as an animator on YouTube is nearly impossible, especially if one wants to rely solely on ads. So this Patreon has been erected to hopefully add to the trickle of incoming cash, and hey, maybe even make this my sole source of income a couple years down the line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support is, of course, greatly appreciated, and I thank you for any support you can offer me, it truly means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou see, I create irreverent and fast-paced videos in a relatively uncommon form, through the use of Valve\u0027s Source Filmmaker, a free to use, semi-professional animating tool. Which isn\u0027t often used in this field of comedy/animation. My most common video type is called a \"Smexual\", here\u0027s how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two parties to every Smexual, Party \u003cstrong\u003eA\u003c/strong\u003e, and Party \u003cstrong\u003eB\u003c/strong\u003e. (usually the boat I\u0027m in)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParty \u003cstrong\u003eA\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ecreates an audio file, that contains spliced/sentence-mixed lines of dialogue from various different characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParty \u003cstrong\u003eB\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003etakes this audio file and animates it based on raw speculation over what\u0027s happening in the video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere\u0027s why: Overtime, less and less of these videos have cropped up around YouTube, and those that do have a pretty big range of quality, from terrible to spectacular. And I see a gap that could be potentially filled, through hard work, dedication, caffeine, dehydration, and unhealthy doses of pure self-loathing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s your goal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy goal is simple, continue along with this YouTube TF2-Animation deal, keep a nice little set of \u0027classic\u0027 smexuals on standby, in-case I ever start losing relevance. All the while dedicating excess funds from YouTube toward the refining/finishing of a brainchild of mine, a video game, including commissioned final drawings, models, materials, et cetera. Eventually getting to the point where I\u0027m able to create several short films based on events planned in the game, in order to gain some feedback/support for the final product. And to refine my craft in Source Filmmaker, so that it may be used to attach animations to models with ease and familiarity.\u003cbr\u003e"
