    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003e\nHello and welcome! My name is William \u201cPapaKenn\u201d Damron, creator and owner of Papa Kenn Media LLC.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e***REWARD TIERS WILL BE UPDATED SOON***\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Papa Kenn Media LLC?\u003c/h3\u003e\nPapa Kenn Media started as a labor of love that began as a hobby, and has over time evolved into a business that I want to nurture and grow into a strong force for good. Though if you\u2019re wanting a less philosophical explanation: Papa Kenn Media LLC is a small business with a focus on entertainment and journalism through (mostly) video-based media where I will write articles and make videos that discuss and/or review topics including but not limited to movies, video games, television shows, computer hardware, books, politics, and mental health.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027ve created this Patreon page to serve as a way for supporters and viewers of Papa Kenn Media LLC to contribute if they so wish. All funds received will go directly to the budget for business necessities (equipment, the channel, internet, website). In addition to necessities, with an increased monthly budget, shows/movies/games that will be used in articles/reviews/videos can be more readily and easily purchased. Also, an increased budget would more readily allow me to pay for animators to create assets (ex: intro videos, thumbnails) for use on the website, channel, etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/h3\u003e\nYou can pledge as little as $1 per month (for however long you desire) through various means including PayPal and Credit Cards on the Patreon platform. In general, this lets you support Papa Kenn Media LLC as a business and improve in quality in the long term. Also, you\u2019ll have my eternal gratitude displayed through giant bear hugs (or a hearty fist-bump if hugs are not desired)! Most importantly, your subscription/pledge can be edited or cancelled at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(NOTICE: Pledging and then removing your pledge after accessing the patron content will *NOT* be tolerated and will result in an immediate block/ban. Also, deleting your pledge at the end of the month to avoid being charged will be noted and handled in the future should you decide to return as a patron.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor additional information on Patreon and how it works,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eplease click here to access the Patreon Helpdesk/FAQ\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eI HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS!\u003c/h3\u003e\nWhoa, calm down. You can feel free to send me a message via one of the social media links on the top of this Patreon page if you have any other questions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you decide to pledge anything or not, I want to thank you for your continued support of Papa Kenn Media LLC. From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate you watching the videos, reading the articles, and taking time to check out the campaign!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
