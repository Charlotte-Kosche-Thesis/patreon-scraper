    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eNote: As of May 2015, the P2P Connects Us podcast is on permanent hiatus. I am keeping this page up for posterity. A big \"thank you!\" to all of my patrons, your support has been invaluable and means a lot to me. Follow me on Twitter @lightcoin if you\u0027re interested in keeping up with what I\u0027m up to these days.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is John Light, and I am the creator of the P2P Connects Us podcast. I started the website p2pconnects.us as a blog to share my ideas about peer-to-peer (P2P) philosophy, technology, and culture, and have since expanded the blog to include a semi-weekly podcast where I cover relevant news topics and bring on guests who are working on interesting P2P projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do this in my free time as a labor of love for all things P2P, and could use your financial support to keep my production schedule consistent in the face of competing obligations in my work life. Total pledges of even a few hundred dollars per month will help me outsource a lot of the editing work that takes up a great deal of my free time, and will provide me more freedom to continue sharing the P2P news and interviews that I think are important for others to hear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Deal Sweetener\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor each episode of P2P Connects Us that I publish on letstalkbitcoin.com, I earn a sizable share of the weekly LTBcoin distribution (go to ltbcoin.com to learn more about that). In return for your pledges, I pledge to give away 20% of my LTBcoin rewards proportionally to everyone who becomes a Patron of this Patreon campaign. Just email me a screenshot of the receipt along with a Counterwallet address. I will do a completely public and transparent accounting at the time of each LTBcoin giveaway to show how much LTBcoin the P2P Connects Us show earned, and how much is being given away to Patrons. Do I have to do this? No. Do I think that it makes sense to share in the rewards with the people who help make this possible? Absolutely! And it can all be transparent thanks to block chain technology.
