Fools entertain and tell the truth, and they\u0027re sometimes the only people who are allowed to tell the truth, and comedy tells the truth, so that\u0027s good! I write books about how to talk to other people and be nice and make everyone\u0027s lives better. I teach people how to connect with each other and have fun times. I instigate silly conversations that end up changing lives, worlds, and trousers. I like music a lot and I like playing music for people, so I have a weekly webshow called Phoole \u0026amp; the Gang where I make you listen to my new and old favorite songs and I interact with tuner-inners from over 150 different countries. I also know how to say \u0027bad monkey\u0027 in 157 different languages, I\u0027m a published author who actually sells books, and I\u0027m pretty smart...for a girl. ;) I\u0027m married to a brilliant artist and sculptor named Tiffany, who is a proud TransWoman, and is the best hostess, best friend, and best whistler, ever in the history of everything.",

     "description": "Producing a live weekly interactive webshow, writing books, producing comic and inspiring web videos, making live happenings happen, and doing all of the other things takes time. As of July 2015, Phoole Industries are supported by me having a dayjob, which takes up a lot of time and a lot of energy. It delivers to me money that I live on, a tiny bit of which I use to pay for broadcasting and connecting with Phooligans. It also delivers my family\u0027s health insurance, which is incredibly expensive. I live in the United States, and my husband lives with a chronic health condition that requires durable medical equipment and an array of maintenance medications - our healthcare expenses are immense, and the time and energy I spend on my dayjob provides, in return, health benefits that keep us both alive. I am currently delivering the maximum amount of art that I can on the scant time-and-energy budget that I have - supporting this goal means that maybe, someday, I would have more time to write you more books, make you more videos, be with you in person for more adventures and salons and frolics, play you more live shows, and produce for you more live interactive web fun!",
