However the music that I \u003cstrong\u003ehave\u003c/strong\u003e created and been performing takes on a new meaning and my contact with ye is reinvigorated with the (however humble or heretic) learnings I\u0027ve inherited. I also had a recurring dream (three nights in a row!!!) of a hardcover square book entitled only \u003cstrong\u003eHEALING\u003c/strong\u003e on its cover, of which I was author apparently. I know my understandings would be of immense help, yet am intimidated to begin and attempt to encapsulate it all accurately and succinctly!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, as my best friend and confidante has been harassing me to get ALL my songs and creations OUT there (on threat of \"What if you\u0027d be snuffed next week? Then what?\" implied selfishness / laziness on my part) and I realise it is the higher knowing that is speaking thru him; agus t\u00e1 ceart aige (and he is correct).\u003cbr\u003eThe TOUR is the most exciting part ~ and probably the most wildly unrealistic part of this Patreon \"goal\"\u003cbr\u003eLike, to stop at the \u003cem\u003efirst\u003c/em\u003e two material ambitions (CD + book) is really and sensible enough.
