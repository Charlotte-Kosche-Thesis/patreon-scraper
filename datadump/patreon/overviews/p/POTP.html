We bring honest, unfiltered, conversations about politics,culture and philosophy that you won\u0027t hear anywhere else. All we need is a little help from you. We started Part Of The Problem because we are passionate about freedom, peace and liberty. \u00a0We have been working hard for a long time trying to do the best we can to spread the message of liberty to all that are open to listening. We always speak the truth as we see it, and we never ever hold back. We spot out the fake lying bullshit that gets served up to us by the mainstream media and the politicians and we call them out on it every week, twice a week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are obsessed with the ideas of Liberty and we want to be able to put more energy and effort in what we are doing. We want to make a better show for you. \u00a0Starting this page will help us do that. If we can generate more funds to our cause, we will be able to dedicate more time to improving the quality of our show, on marketing and adversing in order to grow the show and become a major voice in the new media space. If you are passionate abut the ideas of liberty like we are, help us grow and spread the message. Every donation will go back into the show. We want to see liberty in our lifetime. It can Happen, but we need your support. We don\u0027t want to be beholden to anyone but our fans. Donate what you can and Let\u0027s Make America Libertarian Again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
