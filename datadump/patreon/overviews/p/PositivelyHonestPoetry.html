I\u0027m a socialist, feminist, and environmentalist; as well as a BLM, NLM, LGBTQ, poverty and youth activist. Really though, I\u0027m just a nice dude who writes everyday and wants to do more art and music. I believe that as long as we make the right choices, we are likely to become eusocial superhumans who spread throughout the stars..... I love you!"
