If not, skip to the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePsyche Corporation Backstory\u003c/strong\u003e below...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, thank you so much for supporting me and my music.\u003c/strong\u003e It really means a lot to me that there are people (and unspeakable horrors) out there who enjoy the work I do. Although I like to use a lot of fantastical and science fiction-y themes in my storylines, the emotional lives of my characters feel very real to me when I\u0027m putting their songs together. Even though I am not a mermaid or a sinister corporate overlord of the dream manufacture industry (or \u003cem\u003eam\u003c/em\u003e I?), I still love to get into character when I\u0027m recording and experience a world refreshingly different (or \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e it?) from my own. Whenever I hear back from fans that they\u0027ve connected to the song or the narrative I\u0027ve put together, it\u0027s an amazing feeling to know someone else out there \u0027gets\u0027 me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNow, what is this Patreon thing? Why am I on Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 If this is your first time...here\u0027s a quick overview: Artists have been supported by patrons and sponsors for centuries, but usually only a few of the most famous ones. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, William Shakespeare.. all of them had financial support from wealthy nobility or clergymen of their times, who either commissioned large-scale art projects or simply helped with some living expenses here and there. Now, I\u0027m certainly not like them, but there still might be a few folks out there in the wide world who would like to see more of what I do. Those few folks might not be Popes or Italian nobility--they might only have a couple dollars to spare. But if you combine all those folks together through the magic of the Internet, they might collectively have enough for me to be able to up my game and production values. That\u0027s what Patreon tries to do: collect all the people who want to see more of my kind of art in the world, and put us all in touch so the magic can happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 If you\u0027re a fan of Psyche Corporation and want to support me in the creation of new songs and song-related art (such as music videos or more sophisticated stage productions of my concerts), Patreon is a way for you to do that. I\u0027m pretty new to Patreon, so as I put out more posts I\u0027ll be reading your comments and welcoming discussion and feedback so things can keep evolving to be better and better. I want to thank you in advance for helping me put a little more of my style of art into this world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow is this different from my Kickstarter projects?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 To paraphrase a well-known Patreon creator (AFP), \"Kickstarter is a like a serious date, Patreon is like getting married.\" I\u0027ve previously used Kickstarter to fund manufacturing costs for new albums, or production costs for particularly ambitious music video projects. These kinds of projects tend to be very labor/planning/time-intensive for me, so I realistically only get around to doing them about once a year or once every couple years. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0Patreon, for me, represents a way to have a steadier and more frequent connection with people who are interested in the long haul of nurturing the artist-patron relationship through actual art/music work arising from our interaction. I want it to be personal; I want us to care about each other; I want to be drinking coffee on Sunday morning reading a message you wrote me about an obscure song you found on the internet that elicits an emotion I haven\u0027t explored in my work yet but which you think I\u0027d totally love to try someday. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0Also, the potential of having a more reliable/consistent funding stream for music could open a lot of doors for me that Kickstarter isn\u0027t set up to do: it could pay for advanced voice training lessons, or for replacing second-hand music studio equipment with something newer and more current, or for adding accessories to the live show (such as light displays) to take my performance craft to the next level. These kinds of incremental improvements all cost money, and I don\u0027t always know if it\u0027s a reasonable financial risk to take because I don\u0027t know how much people really want to support and see more of..what I could do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I don\u0027t know if any of this will happen, but I\u0027m here, asking you if this sounds like something you want, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat THINGS do you get as a subscriber?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I\u0027m planning to put out songs (covers and originals) on YouTube or other streaming Internet outlets whenever I finish them. Unlike other people on the Internet however, YOU the subscriber will be able to download the mp3 of these songs (I\u0027ll charge Per Song, so you\u0027ll always get a specific\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003ething\u003c/em\u003e for your money), instead of having to stream them. (Also, a lot of these songs may only be available in a truncated preview format on YouTube. By subscribing, you are always able to get the whole thing!) Many/most of these songs will eventually be put together on whatever my next album is, at which point the mp3s will be available to the general public via iTunes etc when that album is released. But YOU, my subscriber friend, YOU get to buy the mp3s before they\u0027re available to anyone else, before the album even comes out! AND, if any of the songs get additional mastering for the album, I\u0027ll send you a free copy of the newly mastered versions when the album comes out, as soon as I get them back from my person who does the mastering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0Now admittedly these are more modest type prizes than what I offer on Kickstarter, since this Patreon relationship is for folks who want to commit to more of a long-term sponsorship rather than shorter and less frequent transactions. It\u0027s up to you whether you want that kind of relationship with me or if you want to keep things more casual and remain a non-Patreon fan.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat will I use this funding for?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nI\u0027ve sort of already alluded to what I\u0027d use the funding for, earlier in this description, but I want to be really clear here in case there\u0027s any confusion: \n\u003cstrong\u003e100% of this funding will go toward my music career-related expenses\u003c/strong\u003e. I appreciate that many artists depend entirely on income from their art to support themselves (pay rent, food, health insurance, etc), and/or many artists use Patreon as a way to move toward an ultimate goal of quitting their day jobs and doing ONLY their art as a way to make a living. I completely respect that. I really love doing the music work I do, and spending more time doing it would be lovely. But in my particular case, I also really enjoy my Other Job (which I\u0027m not going to discuss much here). My Other Job doesn\u0027t necessarily pay a lot, but it does take care of my personal living expenses (rent, food, health insurance etc). Therefore, I will not use my Patreon funding on things that aren\u0027t music career-related because (1) I don\u0027t need to, and (2) My ultimate goal is not to quit my day job -- I love doing music and I love the work I do in my Other Job* and my ideal life involves doing both things. I\u0027ve been doing both things for about 10 years already, and it\u0027s been awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*If you know about my Other Job and other life, please please don\u0027t talk about it on the Internet.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I anticipate that the funding from Patreon will be spent in 3 main ways (but mostly the first two in the list):\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e1. Paying other people who help on Psyche Corporation projects. \u003c/strong\u003eI know a number of artists and musicians who ARE trying to do their art/music full-time, and who would LOVE to work with me on a music video project or contribute a piece of thematic costuming or graphic design for a poster, but they are struggling to stay afloat financially as it is and need to be compensated enough so they can keep doing what they do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e2. Travel expenses for faraway music events that can\u0027t afford to cover the full cost of my travel. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve performed at a LOT of conventions across North America, but there are also a lot more conventions who were interested in booking me but didn\u0027t have enough travel budget left over to bring me to their venue. Having a little extra funding ear-marked as financial aid for Psyche Corp. shows in new parts of the world I haven\u0027t performed before would really help with this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e3. Studio or Performance equipment.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I use a second-hand MOTU Traveler preamp that has a broken Analog 1 channel, and have used this same preamp since 2008. Some day, it might completely break down and I\u0027ll need to buy a new preamp. Having some funding from Patreon would help me get something nice. Similarly, some day I might want to upgrade the quality of my stage performance by getting a nice set piece or lighting display. Patreon funding could help with that.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePsyche Corporation Backstory\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://psychecorporation.com/dreamportal/index.html\"\u003ePsyche Corporation\u003c/a\u003e is an NYC-based fairytale cyber/steampunk band fronted by a former Ladies of Steampunk model and programmer who combines dance with a powerhouse vocal range. The band is named after a dream manufacture group from a future where neural implants allow people to download dreams from the Internet. Songs deal in dystopian themes as well as more lighthearted filk works, such as \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT6yjrLe4_U\"\u003ePerl-Operated Boy\u003c/a\u003e\". The musical style spans genres of trip-hop, electro-rock, and world music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The band first began playing live in 2007, and over the years has included dancers, guitarists, and a cellist at various points, but the one constant is vocalist/producer/frontwoman Psyche Chim\u00e8re. Between 2006-2015, Psyche Corporation released 5 original albums (4 LPs, one EP) of strange stories set to strange music, most of which is available on iTunes or CD Baby or streamable from YouTube and BandCamp. During the same time period, Psyche Corp. has performed extensively across North America, with notable appearances at Steamstock in California, Time Traveler\u0027s Ball in Cincinnati, A-kon and Ikkicon in Texas, Drac\u0027s Ball in Philly, Steampunk World\u0027s Fair in New Jersey, FanEXPO Toronto, RuffleCon and Connecticon in Connecticut, AnimeUSA in Washington D.C., and many other events.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eElectronic Press Kit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://psychecorporation.com/dreamportal/press/epk.html\"\u003epsychecorporation.com/dreamportal/press/epk.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
