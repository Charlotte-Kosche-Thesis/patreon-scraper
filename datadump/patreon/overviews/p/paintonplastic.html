    "summary": "Hi guys and welcome! My name is Lincoln Wright, please call me Linc!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is to help make model making fun for you! You know, like it should be and when we did it as kids. How? By sharing what I have learned as a model industry professional in Japan. Techniques, Simplicity, Productivity and most of all, how to create stories and narratives with our projects and most of all, by having fun myself!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort intro, I\u0027ve lived in Japan for a little over 20 years and worked as a Modeller, Painter and Writer. I build and paint Studio Models for Kit Makers and various publications. Main companies have been for Hasegawa and WAVE for the Ma.K Maschinen Krieger property and for Hobby Japan and The Weathering Magazine with regular spots. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5821a74420099e79d2b2c701/t/5892a7b6c534a53f820c581c/1486006219851/?format=500w\" style=\"width: 623px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 we decided to do 2 things, first was to give our daughter a better life and future and moved to Australia. This is difficult to explain, Japan is a wonderful place but even though she was born there, she will always be a \"foreigner\". Now in Australia, she is \"local\" and very comfortable with many friends. \"Dad Win\" right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext was to listen to my friends and publish my own content and tutorials. Videos and experimenting with digital publication/magazine all via a membership site called Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a genius idea, like an ongoing kick-starter campaign and instead of needing a publisher or production studio I can produce and release content directly to the awesome people who make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you will gain access to my best, exclusive content, techniques, product usuage, hacks and tips.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5821a74420099e79d2b2c701/5ac3ea9ef950b7df308e1310/5ac3ea9e562fa7c2c7d09b08/1522789051447/BandaiK2SObyLincolnWright-2a.jpg?format=2500w\" style=\"width: 646px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5821a74420099e79d2b2c701/597576be414fb5f8aba83df9/597576c06f4ca31f256480b0/1500870410442/Ghostkeel_Lincoln+Wright-2.jpg?format=500w\" style=\"width: 646px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere at Patreon I\u0027d like to show you how I make and paint these models.
