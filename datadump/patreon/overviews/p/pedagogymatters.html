    "summary": "I am creating the #GoGreaterMN campaign. This campaign is designed to organize regions around the state into legislative campaigns focused on the fundamentals of government. My initial focus will be creating a statewide, grassroots\u00a0passenger rail campaign in the St. Cloud region and across the state. Overtime\u00a0I plan to build support on issues such as transportation, education, broadband (issues that create greater connectivity) and professionalizing traditional \"women\u0027s work\" fields such as childcare, after school care, direct support and care services for people from cradle to grave (veterans, people with disabilities and special needs etc.). I want to create an agenda that is\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\"by the people\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to influence our state legislature to work \u003cem\u003e\"for the people\"\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBy January 1, 2019 I hope to establish a non-profit to continue this work, with greater capacity to organize from the St. Cloud region. Ideally I would like to have 1250 people supporting this work with $5/month over the course of the year 2018. The eventual non-profit will be primarily \"member owned\". Larger and smaller donations are excepted, and while ongoing is preferred, one time donations will also be graciously received.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan and hope for a bricks and mortar institute that would be an eventual extension of the non-profit I will found in January 2019 will have its own fundraising plan via GoFundMe. The inspiration and vision for this eventual Institute was found in Denmark. Social pedagogy is a field not yet existing in any English speaking country. I intend to change that through daily practice with an early childhood center, and providing additional resources and training opportunities for early childhood and direct support/caregiving professionals and for parents and educators. It is my belief that an expanded understanding and practice of social pedagogy on all levels of our community has the potential to have a dramatic effect on our overwhelming mental health crisis.\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate all contributions. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
