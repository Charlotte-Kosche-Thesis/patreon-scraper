    "summary": "Welcome to the Pure Living for Life Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u2019t know us (because obviously, people go looking for random Patreons to support, right?), \u003cstrong\u003ewe are Jesse and Alyssa, a young couple embracing a self-sufficient lifestyle by building an off-grid home from the ground up, completely debt-free\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cem\u003eWatch this video to learn more!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur passion for practicing time-tested skills of self-sufficiency to build our own home is as strong as our desire to document the journey along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith our followers, we share videos filled with our highs and lows, and our laughter and tears. In the process, we hope to help them find the courage to chase their own dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Marketing Challenges of Keeping Our Content Free\u003c/h4\u003eWhile we didn\u2019t start this journey looking to be inspirational, our viewers quickly let us know we had a story worth telling. For this reason, we are striving to reach as many people as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe provide our articles and videos free of charge because we choose to rely on ad income from our blog and YouTube videos instead. This income funds our work and allows us to provide content without any direct cost to our followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately for us, most people hate internet ads, and some of our followers use software to block all website ads from blogs and videos. This doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but it makes a major difference in the income we can earn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, YouTube recently lost thousands of advertisers because of allegations by the media that ads were being shown on content that wasn\u0027t \"advertiser friendly\". Despite being a family-friendly channel, this loss of advertisers is negatively affecting us as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we sharing this with you? It\u2019s important for us to be transparent about the challenges we face in keeping our content free. We are passionate about documenting and sharing our story, but we can only do so if it makes financial sense for our family.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy We Initially Avoided Patreon\u003c/h4\u003e\nWe\u2019ve considered joining Patreon for a long time. At first, we were turned off by the perception that we were looking for handouts. We don\u2019t want our viewers to feel like they need to give us money so that we can \u201ckeep the lights on\u201d, because that\u2019s not how we feel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDocumenting our lives through video is expensive and time consuming, but we\u2019ve long assumed it was a sacrifice we needed to make alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we\u2019ve recently been learning that \u003cstrong\u003ewe don\u2019t need to go through this journey without a community of support behind us\u003c/strong\u003e. For that reason, we\u2019ve gained a fresh perspective on joining Patreon and have decided to give it a try.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eA Community That Kept Asking How They Could Help\u003c/h4\u003eWhen you work from home, it\u2019s easy to forget that the content you produce affects real families. Though we rarely think about it, the millions of views, likes and shares our content gets are from real human beings. Crazy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re noticing this passion from others in our personal lives, too. Walking through town and at our recent sawmill workshop, people have been approaching us to tell us that our journey has helped them find the courage to pursue their own dreams and work towards a more rewarding life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe take no credit for this transformation. All we\u2019ve done is demonstrate what happens when you follow your gut and accept some risk. In fact, we strive to be as open with our mistakes as we are with our achievements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re showing that \u003cem\u003ewhile self-sufficiency might not be easy\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eit\u0027s far from impossible\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s not uncommon for people to contact us directly with requests to support our journey. We\u2019ve always directed them to PayPal, but many people were asking us to get on Patreon as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here we are. We love helping people, so why shouldn\u2019t we give others the opportunity to help us as well?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy our content and feel compelled to support us directly, please feel free to do so in whatever capacity you desire.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eNo Matter How You Choose to Support Us, We Thank You!\u003c/h4\u003eWhile Patreon is set up to encourage tiers of support with special extras for top donors, the truth is that we are already stretched to our limit. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is it\u003c/strong\u003e. There\u0027s not another minute in our day available to give something more, even to our loyal supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we can promise is that so long as our passion remains strong and it makes sense for our family to share, we\u0027ll continue to provide the best content about our journey to self-sufficiency that we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support.  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmly,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJesse and Alyssa\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOther Ways to Support Our Journey\u003c/h4\u003eThere are \u003ca href=\"http://purelivingforlife.com/support/\"\u003enumerous ways to support\u003c/a\u003e us if you enjoy our message and content!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFollow Us Online!\u003c/h4\u003eWe publish our story on \u003ca href=\"http://purelivingforlife.com/\"\u003eour blog\u003c/a\u003e (you can sign up for our email list there), \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/purelivingforlife\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/purelivingforlife\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/purelivingforlife\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e!
