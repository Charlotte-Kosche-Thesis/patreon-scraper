    "summary": "Welcome, dear kindred spirits \u0026amp; fellow wild heart\nwarriors!\u00a0 I cannot express how much your support and\nappreciation for what I put out into the world means to me. Actually, I can! The\nonly way I know how: by continuing to share my creations, creative processes\n\u0026amp; life learnings with you while facilitating the growth of our incredible\ncreative community: freely and openly, wildly and passionately. As a visual storyteller, I find pathways to worlds of wonder we only dare dream about, and weave those dreams into our everyday reality. I want to continue to do this, which is\u00a0why I\u2019m creating this new space here on Patreon\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon\n - for those who don\u2019t yet know - is a\nwonderful way to support content that you love on a monthly basis. Taking its\nname and inspiration from the word \u201cpatron\u201d which means to support, invest, or back:\nit\u2019s a membership platform that makes it easy for supporters to invest and get exclusive access to content they love, and for the creators of the content to get\npaid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not interested in acquiring and\naccumulating. I am interested in Creating, Collaborating, and Contributing. \u00a0My strengths are my creative\nideas, visualisation \u0026amp; ability to focus and see these ideas through. My\nstrengths are also my capacity for creating authentic connection,\nand in opening space for communication and expansion in a big way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, there are two goals with this new space: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1. To build an open-hearted, no smoke \u0026amp; mirrors, real community that empowers!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e2. To produce the beautifully published books that I know you will love!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo by supporting me through Patreon to reach my first goal, I will be able to continue sharing what\nI do and so much more here via\npatron-only posts, build the creative community we\u2019ve all been craving,  and invest the time needed from me to produce beautiful new books. With this platform I can focus\non making the work that resonates wholeheartedly with you as well as share the\namazing processing as it flows through me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nknow with all my heart that this is what you want from me, and I want so much to\nbe able to deliver. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt\nthis stage, I\u2019m keeping it simple with two tiers which you can see on the right, but if I reach my first goal of 500 patrons, I\u2019ll be able to add a few\nmore middle tiers that will involve more rewards including mentoring packages, prints and studio\nstays with the help of a studio assistant.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve come here via another source (thank you so much to everyone who has helped spread the word!!) and aren\u0027t familiar with my work, please\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.piajanebijkerk.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evisit my website\u003c/a\u003e, it\u0027s all there!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much for taking the time to be here; please let me know if you have any questions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith\nlove always, \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPia\nxx\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePS I\u0027d love to make an intro video as they say it makes all the difference - if you make beautiful videos and are interested in an exchange to help make one with me, please please get in touch!"
