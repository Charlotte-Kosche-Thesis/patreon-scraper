I\u2019m the writer, creator and\npretty much god of the world of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSAMURAIDAZ!!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor those of you unaware of what \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSAMURAIDAZ!!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is, it\u2019s\na series blending golden age hip-hop culture, samurai cinema, and couples that\nwith themes of social commentary, revenge, and the consequences of harsh\nchoices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/qqb9jb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/8w9rnc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/34rizyu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/70ba6u.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/67ldhv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe first five pages of the one shot - check out the rest here on Tapastic:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/SAMURAIDAZ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSAMURAIDAZ\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe story itself revolves around Beat, who is the last\nof the Samuraidaz, a clan of enlightened people capable of harnessing and\nmanipulating a mysterious source of energy known as the Tempo. The world itself\nis in disarray, broken from an occurrence known as the \u201cDark Tempo Event\u201d where\nthe misuse of Tempo in bad ignorant music produced a cataclysmic effect that\nwrecked over 86% of civilization. After this, the Samuraidaz were vilified as\ncriminals and targeted for elimination by the government, and the people, left\nwithout their heroes, fell prey to the iron grip of the Black Order, who claim\nthey\u2019re here to balance the world when really they want power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nWhat do men with power want? More power.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBeat, being the last living member of the Samuraidaz\nis the only one with the sufficient knowledge of Tempo who can effectively\nstand against them. Yet he\u2019s not alone in this battle to fix the world; he\u2019s\njoined by a small crew of adepts who feel the touch of Tempo, as well as the\nBassment, the freedom fighting movement who endeavor to keep the culture living\nand breathing. It\u2019s light and darkness in hip-hop where everything stems from\nthe beat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf I had to call it anything, it\u2019s \u201cJet Set Radio\u201d\nmeets \u201cFist of the North Star\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon has been on my mind for a while now. I tried\nto make one before but I dove in without checking how deep things were.\nPatreon, believe it or not, allows us to support the artists we enjoy in\ncreating the things we love to see, read, hear, etc., by pledging some money\nfor each of their creations. They can focus on their craft with our help, guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn particular, in addition to SAMURAIDAZ!!! I\u0027ll\nwrite short stories on my blog, produce more poetry for my Instagram\n(@prodigious_dialect btw!) and do audio readings of them all to put into a\ncollection. People have told me I have a voice for an audio book so I\u2019m finally\ntaking them up on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m also planning on doing a Podcast and videos on\nwriting; I do teach writing to others and I feel it\u2019s time to really get into\nit, to improve my own craft and help others build their own styles.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I\u2019m starting this Campaign as I want to take this\nproject places (namely the animation studio and the convention table), and I\nhave other properties that I\u2019ve pitched to people that I feel should see the\nlight of day:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheshire,\n\u003c/strong\u003ea\nfun little romp of a series inspired by games like Super Mario, Kirby and Sonic\nthe Hedgehog that stars a pudgy catboy with an endless gullet and mad skills.\nThis series has the potential to be a multimedia endeavor as Samuraidaz, like\nan animation, a comic, and a video game.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHeat\nthe Soul, \u003c/strong\u003ea project where I sought to combine the earmarks of a\nShonen battle manga, a sport where you hit people in the face with fast moving\nobjects, and comedy. The series starts Kira Hartnet, a middle-school Little\nLeague slugger with a hell of a swing and dangerous lumber, forced to move in\nwith her mother in a sleepy little Japanese town. Yet, as soon as she steps\nfoot on their soil, she knows she\u2019s in for a wild ride, as this town is known\nfor a little game played by a select few \u2013 \u201cSoul Hitting\u201d, and her dangerous\nlumber is right at home! It\u2019s One-Punch Man meets Rival Schools: United by\nFate!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nThese three projects have been seen by various people\nand I want to bring more of it to them as well as to the rest of the world. I\u2019m\na writer who works freelance but as we all very well know, bills and various\nliving expenses takes away all of the funds I make. So this Patreon is to help\nme produce more of the content you all beg me to make (mostly SAMURAIDAZ but\nthe point still stands).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can pledge any amount you want! If you pledge $1 or more, I\u2019ll send you a personalized poem postcard to give my thanks (I\u2019m\nworking with limited resources so forgive the backgrounds!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe more support I can get from you all, be it a\nsimple donation or a page share, the more content I\u2019m able to dedicate my time\nto producing. Each pledge means so much to me; it shows me that you all care\nenough to help me make my dream a reality. As I inch towards becoming a\nfull-time writer and author, there\u2019s a ton of extra content I plan on loading\nonto this page as total pledge goals. It\u2019s things I\u2019ve been dying to do with\nother people. Lofty goals, but what the hell? Everyone\u2019s got dreams.\u003cbr\u003e"
