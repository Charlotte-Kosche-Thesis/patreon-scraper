I\u0027m a content creator, who spends his days creating Gaming Videos on YouTube, and doing daily live streams on TwitchTV. I\u0027ve been doing this for nearly 5 years now, and since then, I\u0027ve come to find one of the most supportive communities ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve opening up this Patreon for anyone who would like to support not only myself, but the community that I come to every single day. With funding from this page, I can not only continue to upgrade my set up to bring you guys some better content, but also open up some exciting opportunities for the community. These could include servers for our viewer game weekends, mass giveaways for the viewers, and MUCH more in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to find ways to bring the community together in fun and innovative ways every day, and with help from you guys, I could work on making that happen better than I ever could on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your consideration Champs and Champettes, and thanks for the amazing 5 years of support. I\u0027m looking forward to the many years to come! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-PBat\u003c/em\u003e"
