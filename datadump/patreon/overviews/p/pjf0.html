    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eHelp support me in the development of the CKAN\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, I\u0027m Paul, and I started the \n\u003ca href=\"http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-(CKAN)-Package-Manager\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCKAN mod manager\u003c/a\u003e project for Kerbal Space Program. Since our first release in October 2014, we\u0027ve indexed hundreds of mods, and have tens of thousands of active users. Hundreds of volunteers have contributed to the CKAN codebase and metadata. I am incredibly proud to say that the CKAN has been a huge success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe CKAN was founded on open code, open processes, and open data, which has allowed us to spread the load of managing a successful project. However as time has gone on, our open issues have increased, and our need to fix more difficult bugs has become more urgent. At the same time, we\u0027ve seen increased time pressure on our more experienced developers, all of whom volunteer their contributions to the CKAN in their spare time, myself included.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I\u0027ll always continue to work CKAN project as best I can, the reliable funding from supporters on Patreon allows me to mark off specific days for \u003cem\u003ecode sprints\u003c/em\u003e, which are designed to maximise productivity, and which allow me devote a lot of time and energy to resolving CKAN issues. These sprints follow the \u003ca href=\"http://www.personalhackathon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epersonal hackathon\u003c/a\u003e schedule, which involves a \u003cem\u003e12 hour day of extreme productivity\u003c/em\u003e, during which I\u0027ll be sharing my progress over IRC and github. At the end of each sprint I\u0027ll be posting a summary of what I\u0027ve achieved, and\u2014if warranted\u2014make a new CKAN release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaving reliable funding for these sprints mean that I can give up some of my work as a software consultant to concentrate on the CKAN\u003c/strong\u003e; that\u0027s a lot more rewarding for me, and it means I can work on a number of long-term improvements I wouldn\u0027t have the chance to otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow do pledges get collected?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSimple! At most once per month, if I complete all my stated goals, then I get paid. If the funding level says I\u0027m doing two sprints per month and I only do one, I don\u0027t get paid. This means \n\u003cstrong\u003ethe amount you pledge is the most you\u0027ll pay per month.\u003c/strong\u003e The intent is for me to be actively accountable to patrons, and for pledges to have a predictable maximum per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan I contribute with cryptocurrency?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes! While contributions via patreon are preferred (since I know I\u0027ll have regular funding to continue my development), you can also make contributions using one of the following addresses. To ensure transparency, I\u0027ll post a summary of cryptocurrency contributions each month as part of my patreon feed, and these will be used to \"top up\" pledges to the next milestone if appropriate.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBTC\u003c/strong\u003e: 12gvtpBTdDNaDni2qbPTzjkijZcLWojfje\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0110:  DLc8Pkb8pdma9S8v5VrQqpt7Ug5tPobAtw\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCoffee, co-working space, chocolate, and other productivity and living costs. This campaign means I can spend less time on commercial projects, and still meet my expenses.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhen is your next sprint scheduled?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnless otherwise posted, sprints happen on the \n\u003cstrong\u003esecond Sunday\u003c/strong\u003e of each month. If I reach my double sprint goal, a second sprint will happen on the \u003cstrong\u003efourth Sunday\u003c/strong\u003e of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow will you prioritize your time?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn general, priority will go to unblocking other contributors, and bugs which have the greatest user impact, or bugs which require specialist knowledge to fix.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat risks exist, and how will you manage them?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a professional software engineer and consultant with over two decades of experience in open source. I keynote at conferences, I present training courses worldwide, and I have clients that I assist with projects. When things get busy, they can get \n\u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e busy. The biggest risk is that my calendar will become too tight to work on the CKAN; indeed, this is why I\u0027ve started this campaign. To combat this risk, I\u0027ve tied funding to sprint completion; that means I have to plan and announce sprints in advance, and in the case that I can\u0027t keep my commitments I don\u0027t get paid, and you don\u0027t get charged. We\u0027re most likely to see this happen in July, which is my busiest time of year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s the really fabulous risk that the CKAN becomes the image of perfection and no longer requires any further work. In that case, I\u0027ll be asking my patrons for advice, but we\u0027ve got a big enough roadmap that I doubt we\u0027ll be \"finished\" any time soon. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
