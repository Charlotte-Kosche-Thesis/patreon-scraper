    "summary": "\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003eWell\u003c/b\u003e. \u003cb\u003eA lot has been said\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e about the plight of the independent musician and the struggle to continue producing art in the face of the current \u201ceverything is free\u201d business model. I, for one, will always write songs because I always have. I am deeply affected by music as I know you are (if you are reading this), and find a great deal of satisfaction, amusement, and catharsis in the act of creating a song. I\u2019d like to share that with you. I\u2019d like to be able to record these songs, all of them, and have the time and resources to do so. I\u2019d like to then upload these songs and share them with my fans, friends, family, and random strangers, so that they too can share in my satisfaction, amusement, and catharsis. And I\u2019d like to do all this for absolutely free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003eI\u2019d also like to have a fairy godmother who can turn me into a unicorn\u003c/b\u003e,\u003c/b\u003e but that\u2019s where you come in, my sweet potential Patrons. Now is your chance, collectively, to turn me into a unicorn. A songwriting unicorn. What a beautiful thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003eHere\u0027s how it works:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e Patreon.com is a crowd-funding platform that allows individual supporters to pledge a set amount to a creator (like me) per created work, which in my case would be \u201cper song\u201d or \u201cper video\u201d that I complete and upload to my private Patreon stream. Think of it like a tip. The amount is up to you, anywhere from one dollar to a zillion baht. (I don\u2019t know what that is in dollars, but Patreon will convert it for you.)\u00a0 The support is ongoing, and paid on a monthly basis. Of course, you can change the amounts or cancel entirely at any time. It\u0027s all controlled by you.\u003cbr\u003eFor example: if you were to pledge $5 per song, and I completed and uploaded three songs in a given month, you would \"tip\" me $15 at the end of the month. You can also set a monthly maximum, so that if I\u2019m extraordinarily prolific in a given month, you would still only be obligated for your maximum amount. In the above example, let\u2019s say you set a maximum of $10. I\u2019ve uploaded three songs, but you\u2019re still only in it for $10. Make sense? The maximum number of songs I can see being able to complete in a month is probably around four. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna shoot for, so that may give you some kind of idea of what you might be in for on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003eNow, since none of what I just said made any sense, just watch this video:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OTQ8zMH35wc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn exchange for your patronage,\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e you have exclusive access to my private songwriting stream, and henceforth a window into the inner workings of my feverish mind. You can give me feedback, if you want. \u201cMore zombies, PK\u201d, you might say, \u201cand less nuns\u201d. Or, \u201ccan you write a song about the Jamestown Cannibals?\u201d Done. Now I just gotta make a good recording so you can listen to it . . . In the end, with your feedback, many of these songs will make it on to a CD, and be available to the world. Now, don\u2019t you feel good that you had a role in all that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003eThere are other rewards at higher levels \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003eof patronage, like maybe a monthly Google hangout where we can talk about songwriting, the weather, what red tastes like, etc. Maybe I\u2019ll give you a songwriting or guitar lesson. I can try to give you some ideas for next weekend. We can have a virtual cookout! I don\u2019t know. The important thing to remember is that these songs are written and performed for free; your patronage is a gesture of support because you like my songs and want them to run free and mostly naked through cyberspace and into your ears. That\u2019s gonna happen a lot easier, and I\u2019ll be tremendously inspired to do what it is that comes most naturally, if I can count on a little financial incentive to see these songs through. \u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about Patreon, or what I\u2019m talking about in the above screed, just ask! And thank you so much for your support! I really couldn\u2019t do it without you . . . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd lastly, a little something \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003ejust for making it this far - here\u0027s me at the 2nd Annual Kudos Folk Showcase:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/VTWCd2pZfak\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n"
