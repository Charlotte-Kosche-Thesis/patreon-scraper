Good theater should teach you about something you didn\u0027t know, or ask you to look inside and consider the possibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creating a large bilingual musical theater piece about the lives of Afro-Cuban immigrant artists searching for success\u00a0in major cities of The United States.\u00a0This new production is called \"We Have Ir\u00e9\" named after the Lucum\u00ed tradition of asking for blessings (ir\u00e9) from the Orishas.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAs a Cuban-American artist, I also recognize how important it is to stay connected to the island of my ancestors and their traditions\u003c/strong\u003e. After many visits to Cuba over the last 22 years, I have developed a deeper understanding of Cuban immigration and how culture travels between countries and mixes with local communities. This is my effort to share what I have learned about being Cuban in the United States. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is also the story of Africans in Cuba, and how they brought their religious and cultural practices to the Caribbean, and then to the United States with a powerful influence on Latino culture today.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\"We Have Ir\u00e9\" highlights the real stories of Cuban artists, the risks they take in a new country, and the ways in which Lucum\u00ed, or\u00a0Santer\u00eda, manifests itself for its followers in times of greatest need. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy collaborators are highly accomplished Afro-Cuban, immigrant and Latinx artists, including the director of \u003cstrong\u003eHarvard\u003c/strong\u003e University Jazz Band, \u003cstrong\u003eYosvany Terry,\u003c/strong\u003e as well the first Cuban Female Hip-Hop DJ to play at the \u003cstrong\u003eWhite House \u003c/strong\u003efor President Obama,\u003cstrong\u003e Dj Leydis\u003c/strong\u003e, and celebrated contemporary Afro-Cuban dancer and choreographer, \u003cstrong\u003eRamon Ramos Alayo\u003c/strong\u003e.

As an an independent artist and producer with 20 years experience in the arts, I know that project funds can most effectively be directed when the lead artist has immediate access for project costs. Delayed funding due to a third or fourth party red tape can seriously impact the quality of the work. Your monthly contribution of $21 will help cover costs for artist travel to New York, California and Havana, for rehearsals and development. Your contribution will also cover direct artist fees related to paying Afro-Latino musicians and dancers for\u00a0rehearsal time and meetings. Other costs include visual production, video editing,\u00a0documentation and promotion so we can show our audience what we are developing.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCuba is a magical and beautiful place. \"We Have Ir\u00e9\" will bring you inside the lives of some of the most dynamic and accomplished Afro-Cuban and Cuban American artists today.\u00a0 For your donations we will \u003cstrong\u003ereward you with Cuban products, rum, cigars, music, clothing and other designs\u003c/strong\u003e direct from the island. We will provide videos and photos of our development process in Havana, Camaguey, Santiago de Cuba, as well as our development process in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
