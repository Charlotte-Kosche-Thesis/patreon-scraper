It started out as just a hobby to play around with graphics programs. But now, thanks to the support of my commissioners and fans from Hentai Foundry and Fur Affinity, it\u0027s on the edge of being a full time gig. Figured I may as well give it that last little push.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal through Patreon is to be able to produce content for my fans and ideally make a FULL TIME sustainable living doing so. I wouldn\u0027t have come as far as I have without the support of you guys and\u00a0 through this page, I\u0027m hoping I can give something back in exchange.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEssentially it will break down like this:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u003cstrong\u003eNew patrons are charged an initial pledge amount upon signing up. This is a security measure to make sure they are not spam bots and are sincere about supporting me. After that, cards are marked and then charged at the end of every month going forward.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e-You can set a monthly limit so you don\u0027t pledge over your budget and you can cancel at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-Rewards are sent out/posted on my feed as they are finished. But they will only be visible to those patrons who have successfully been processed for the preceding month. Please make sure your pledge is valid to ensure you do not miss new content as it is released.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-Patronage can be anonymous and hidden from public view via your profile settings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWork in Progress Content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy goal here is to not only give you guys a glimpse into my projects as they get completed, but also as a bit of a motivator to keep me from getting lazy. At least once a week, I\u0027ll post progress shots, renders and animations of whatever projects I\u0027m on at the time. These will only show up here and not be the same things I post on my public blogs elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFan Voted Animations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach flash I make (that isn\u0027t an outside commission) will be a 2-3 loop animation that patrons will get access to two weeks before the rest of the internet does. Higher tier patrons (10$ and up) suggest the characters featured (it doesn\u0027t have to be Puce :P) and everyone else will vote on the idea(s) they like the most in an online poll I post here. Original characters are allowed for these votes, just make sure you provide links to pictures so that other voters know what to expect.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe second highest voted character/idea will automatically go in the running for the animation that I do after that one is released.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain...these flashes will be available to EVERYONE, but Patrons (regardless of their donation amount) get access to untagged versions two weeks before I post them on Hentai Foundry and Fur Affinity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHD Video of Flash Content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe SWF format is slowly dying and I\u0027ve had a lot of peeps tell me that they can\u0027t view flash content on their phones/mobile device. So as an extra PATREON ONLY bonus for patrons 5$ and up, I will release standalone HD video of each loop that composes a particular non-commissioned flash or fan voted flash I am putting out. So for example, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/G33KT86y/purplemantis-commission-list\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eif you see my Trello page with my current project status\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e everything in the \"Personal Projects\" column on the far right will have accompanying video loops.\u003cbr\u003e"
