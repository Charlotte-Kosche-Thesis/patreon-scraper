    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Farhaan, the guy behind PoliticsOnTheMarch! I started using my channel seriously at the beginning of this year just after Trump got elected. Truth is that was the straw that broke the proverbial camel\u0027s back. I\u0027ve been frustrated with the world for a very long time, with regards to the economic realities that exist such as less than 10 people owning more than the bottom 3 billion, the geopolitical realities of the US destroying entire nations for the interests of an out of control military industrial complex and just the state of politics in general. So I took to YouTube to combat everything I feel has led to the problems that we have today. I attack establishment TV Media who have been a pied piper encouraging Americans to support endless foreign wars, who ridicule and attack those who can bring about real revolutionary change like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn and are the establishment\u0027s mouthpiece. I take on Republicans and their disastrous social and economic policies that are ruinous for everyday people as well as corporate Democrats who follow the same death cult ideology of neo-liberalism and the obsession with supply side economics. I want a system where the every day common man and woman can work full time and be able to live a comfortable life through policies such as single payer healthcare, free college and a green technological revolution, not work full time and be barely able to make ends meet for their family. I want a world where regions such as the Middle East aren\u0027t just seen as fishing waters for US\u0027 interests where secular Arab nationalist governments are overthrown for resources on the absolute lies that its for \"freedom and promoting democracy\" when every time it clearly hasn\u0027t. Its for these reasons that I come on YouTube and talk so passionately about these issues and I want my voice to be heard even more, YouTube is demonetizing my videos at an alarming rate and is hindering my ability to make revenue and expand this channel even more. Your contributions will go towards getting better equipment and turning this into a full studio based operation instead of what it is right now; one young man with an iPhone camera. Your contributions will also make YouTube a more viable source of income so I can devote more time to my channel and upload more videos a day and grow the channel. So contribute whatever it is that you can afford, from as little as $1.00 a month. It goes along way and is much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks\u003cbr\u003eFarhaan\u003cbr\u003ePoliticsOnTheMarch"

I talk about the big economic, political and foreign policy issues of today and try and shed some light on what\u0027s going on with my own opinions and perspectives. With economics I largely talk about the US and British economies and cover issues such as Medicare For All and Brexit and help show how the current system is screwing over the every day hardworking man and woman. With foreign policy I try and break through the propaganda we see on our TVs about Syria and the Middle East and shedding some light on the reality of the situation! I also cover the Trump White House extensively on my channel and due to the stupidity of the senile satsuma that occupies the Oval Office, there are quite a lot of hilarious roasting segments on my channel too! Help support what I do and pledge whatever you can afford to help me grow my channel to new heights and reach more and more people! Your pledges will go towards better equipment and will make YouTube a more viable source of income so I can put far more time into spreading the progressive message! Thank You!",
