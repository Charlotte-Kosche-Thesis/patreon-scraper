Short story about myself, I\u0027ve been doing art most of my life but the last five years my digital art has really taken off. I\u0027ve found myself a good crowd of people who appreciate my work and have gained some beautiful friends from there. At this point in my life I really want to work on developing my own style and finding the niche I fit in. Maybe one day I may be able to work up to actually doing a comic of some kind! For now though, I just want to share my art with the world."
