We try and get them out regularly, but it\u0027s A LOT of work, and you can keep us motivated. Just like our coaching provides you with someone to be accountable to, your help in this podcast makes us accountable to YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePER MONTH (but how many episodes?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, we guarantee approximately 2.5 episodes per month (we have commitment issues) on the Power Company Podcast. Patrons get at least one extra episode of the We Scream Like Eagles podcast each month. Normally, we do more. Sometimes far more. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs much as we love this, the money making side of the business continues to get busier, which leaves less time for podcasting, so those extra episodes will eventually fall away. Unless, of course, they make enough money to pay for the time spent putting them together. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou have my solemn promise that we\u0027ll never just put out trash. We take this seriously. You all are our team. We won\u0027t let you down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE FUTURE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027ve got plans. Big ones. We want to have panel discussions. Talk to several coaches at once. \u00a0A series with climbing couples on the challenges and benefits. Ambush the pros at the crags. We want to do a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLIVE TOUR!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Party style.
