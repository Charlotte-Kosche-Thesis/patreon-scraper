If you already know what a visual novel is, then just skip this passage.\u00a0If you have no idea what a Visual Novel is, don\u0027t worry, a lot of people are still in the dark about it, and even within the anime community, I find myself having to explain it to people.\u00a0Most people in the anime community can name various forms anime appears in. Manga in a comic format, Light novels in a serialized novel format, video games, and of course, animation. Visual novels however, are linked to the infamous \"Dating Sims\". And indeed, both visual novels and dating sims are almost synonomous with hentai games when most people hear them. But not all visual novels go down that road. Many great, heart warming and heart wrenching animes have actually stemmed from the visual novel genre. Clannad, Fate Stay Night, and even the recently airing this season anime, Rewrite. (That by the way has always been my favorite VN.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisual Novels actually came from the point and click adventure a long time ago, however they offer minimalist gameplay, and focus much more strongly on a written narrative. The narrative is accompanied with a synergy of visual artwork, immersive ambient music, sound, and in a lot of cases, voice acting. The player is given several options to make critical decisions in the story which will affect the narrative in a variety of ways. Which girl will the protagonist end up with? Does the hero decide to pick up a sword, or to into the gladiatorial pit with the shield? If this sounds very similar to a \"Choose your own adventure\" novel, you\u0027re right. And now adays, the explination brings up images of games like Life is Strange, and The Walking Dead. Right again. (Like I said, VNs developed from point and click adventure games, and modernized adventure games tend to be more narrative driven now, just like their VN counterparts.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if all of this ended up going straight over your head, I think the best way to show what a visual novel is is just to see one in action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWpaJYk3er8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWpaJYk3er8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c59/Rubberpenguin/Keepsake/Teaser/Banner-StoryS.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c59/Rubberpenguin/Keepsake/Teaser/6bdbfb1e-9467-4e3d-85ef-31f0ef359c7f.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Akiyama is the sort of town which doesn\u0027t let its stories die.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a town which has seen quite a bit of expansion in recent years. But the growing town still retains much of its small village charm. Its a town which remembers its stories and legends, with colorful histories and paranormal mysteries around just about every inch of the valley. Kai Tatsuya, a delinquent who\u0027s been immortalized as the poster child for delinquency in his school, knows all too well just how deeply held these ties go. He after all has been stuck with the name \"The Beast of Akiyama\" since his days in middle school. And just as it looked like he could finally put those days behind him, all it took was a faulty vending machine, a loss of temper, and a camera shot to slam his death glare into the school news paper, and back into the minds of his classmates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that became water under the bridge when he started things started to to get weird in his life. It seems that recently, Kai has developed a strange sleepwalking episodes, and has found himself waking up in strange places, and bizarre situations. As if that wasn\u0027t weird enough, lately he\u0027s been catching glimpses out of the corner of his eye just as he rouses from his sleepwalking misadventures in time to save himself from a near fatal experience. Elsewhere, a girl has found herself completely and inexplicably without a shadow after cleaning the heirlooms of her aunt\u0027s attic. Which is a problem considering she was already the type to jump at it to begin with. Now, with no shadow, she finds herself under a curse, where in her consciousness is tied to her spirit rather than her physical body, thus making it hard to keep her soul inside herself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the Kami of a long forgotten shrine has been noticing events like this occur in town for a while now. And they aren\u0027t isolated to just mortals. The northern village, long abandoned by humans due to a landslide, has always been populated with plenty of yokai beings. And something has been filling the valley with an abundance of a strange energy. One that he feels might be coming from one of four cursed gifts he entrusted with four prominent human families a long time ago. However, sworn to only operate indirectly with the mortals of the valley, and haven lost the purity of his shrine to vandalism, he has little power on his own to find out the fate of those lost heirlooms. What has conveniently fallen into his lap are the two humans, plagued with problems beyond their comprehension. A boy who should be given his fair share of community service, and a cowardly girl who just so happens to be able to interact with humans and spirits, AND has one keepsake heirloom already in her possession.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe themes at play in the story delves into a lot of themes from Shinto philosophy. Growth, adolescence, respect, eastern environmentalism, spirituality, balance, love, life, and death. While most of it plays like a light hearted, over the top supernatural slice of life romantic comedy, this feel good tone may find contrast in various episodic arcs where more fantastical revelations await discovery. As the characters dig up family secrets, work out metaphysical blood feuds, and deal with the manifestation of urban legends and town spirits, they may be occasionally thrown into real danger. And a lot more has been written about the setting than I ever expect will make into the final product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c59/Rubberpenguin/Keepsake/Teaser/Banner-Choco.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/Rubberpenguin/media/Keepsake/Teaser/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-09%20at%207.03.13%20PM.png.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c59/Rubberpenguin/Keepsake/Teaser/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-09%20at%207.03.13%20PM.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello there, my real name is Andric. I just float around a lot on various websites and forums as Chocopyro. I\u0027m the project lead for Keepsake: Orison of the Falling Leaves. It\u0027s a project I\u0027ve been working on for some time, and now I\u0027m in an awkward transition in my life where I have the free time for the first time in a while, a pool of savings that was supposed to get me to Japan and buy me a new computer until recently, and no income... Yeah. Don\u0027t worry, I was planning to be here eventually. So I\u0027m not detoured. I\u0027m taking the step forward, just as planned. I\u0027m finally at that stage right now where I can build a team, start tackling the demo, and hopefully generate community support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, my reason for being here is this. I\u0027m still a long way off from being able to put Keepsake into full production. I can focus on one area at a time, be it art, writing, music, or programming, but in order to make an experience like what I have planned here, its going to need to come together with the right synthesis and momentum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c59/Rubberpenguin/Keepsake/Teaser/Banner-CreditsS.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe core development team so far consists of:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChocopyro:\u003c/strong\u003e Project lead, original concept, characters, backstory, lore,\u00a0sometimes a writer, sometimes a coder, sometimes a photoshop asset editor.

A lot of it doesn\u0027t even require me to give credit, but I\u0027d rather not be that guy. Anyways, my point being, its actually fairly easy to produce rewards that really give a whole lot more back, if I\u0027m not dependent on assets I can\u0027t do myself.

Take a journey with the characters of Keepsake in a series of oneshot adventures that are not a part of the actual canon. From small extra feel good tales that will tug on those heart strings, to vivid nightmares, with darker themes and outcomes than you would expect from your usual cheery cast. Although most of these will come from my own head, I might make an exception and adapt well written fanfictions, should any be submitted, and the use of assets be ready or feasibly acquired. For any who aren\u0027t clear: These will be episodic kinetic novels, and mini visual novels. As in, playable.\u003cbr\u003e"
