My name is Max, aka\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://parororo.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eParoro (or ex-pyromaniac)\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ve been drawing as a hobby since I was a kid, but it wasn\u0027t till recently that I started taking things more seriously and I\u0027m currently trying to live 100% from my art.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing this for a couple of months, through commissions and small projects, it\u0027s a lot of work and I love doing so, but it\u0027s also very risky too. I came to Patreon seeking a more solid base and support to continue doing what I love, it will allow me to continue working on my own comic projects, characters and stories.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what many people have told me over and over, that they want to see more from my own creations, instead of just commissions,... but I lack the time (or sometimes the energy) for that since I\u0027m constantly busy trying to fulfill my work list.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really looking forward to this and I\u0027d appreciate just every tiny bit of support I could get from you, after all, if I\u0027m still drawing, it\u0027s because of the support and encouragement I\u0027ve received over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks a lot for being here, even if you\u0027re just a curious passerby!\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you pledge, THANK YOU : ), be welcome and hope you enjoy,\u003cem\u003e make sure to browse my past posts!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy the way! About rewards/access to posts~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards according to each month\u0027s tiers, are mostly the access to all the files I\u0027m constantly posting! : D What I mean by this, is, instead of submitting a big batch of files at the end of each month, I just have everything available here in the site, INCLUDING pretty much every file and post from the past months! I don\u0027t charge extra for accessing old files, they\u0027re there for you to grab, if you want, I appreciate all kinds of support, even if someone could technically take advantage of it? (By pledging, having access, and then deleting the pledge). I just have faith in you guys : \u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e"
