Many of you have asked how you can help us or how you can show your appreciation for our videos that we upload six days a week. \u00a0We finally decided that Patreon was the best way to allow YOU to do just that...to help us continue producing daily vlogs. But not only that, with your support through Patreon, we will be able to produce more dedicated videos like cooking, sewing, gardening, how-to videos, and share with you our financial freeing tips to living on less. We want to thank you if you feel so moved to show your support with a small financial gift. We understand tight budgets and low incomes and we do not want ANYONE to create a financial hardship for themselves by using \u00a0Patreon. But if you are able and moved to do so, we would certainly be appreciative and thankful for your support in our efforts to make encouraging, uplifting and informative videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I, Janelle, first started this YouTube channel, I had no idea where this would lead, who I would meet, and what a difference I could make in others lives. But as our channel has begun to grow, I have \"met\" some AMAZING people from all over the world. \u00a0You may say that you have been blessed by our content and the simple joys in life that we share with you, but WE have been blessed by your comments and support and hearing your stories. Our channel isn\u0027t just about us; it\u0027s about a simpler way of life and learning to love and appreciate this small things in life. Loving family, celebrating small victories, sharing our struggles, and encouraging you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your consideration of making a gift on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Art and Janelle\u003cbr\u003eand the rest of the Parsnips. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
