    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003eYou may call me PurpleLizard. I am a photographer, set builder, prop maker, and...I am here because I like to create. I never feel more engaged or content than when I am bringing something to life. It takes time, money, and space. Most importantly, it takes someone to appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to you. I assume you are here because you have that appreciation for the creative process, and/or its products. Maybe you like to see the world in a new and different way, or enjoy the wonder of contemplating what the artist was thinking. You could be more structured, and maybe what brings you in is the logistic side, wondering how the look was achieved, or the lighting was set up, or if Photoshop was involved. It could just be that you like to wonder, you like to think; you build the world up inside your mind as your eyes gaze upon the artists work. What ever it is that brought you here to me, about the only thing I can I assure you, is that in one form or another, you are going to get something different. Entertaining. Whimsical. Dark. Familiar. Normal. Creepy. Or just plain tepid stoicism. It\u0027s a big vast world with limitless possibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery contribution that you make, goes right back into bringing you the content you enjoy. You are the fuel for the fire of my creativity. We can grow together, warming the cold, lighting the night, or just setting the whole thing ablaze. What ever it is, I cannot do it with out you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne dollar is all it takes to show some that you enjoy \u0026amp; appreciate my work, and you will get access to my complete library of images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am excited, as I hope you are, to see what the future will bring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
