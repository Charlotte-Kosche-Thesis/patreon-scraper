    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://libregraphicsworld.org/images/articles/logo4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Alexandre Prokoudine and I\u0027m a journalist specializing on \u003cem\u003efree-as-in-speech\u003c/em\u003e software for creative professionals. In 2009, I launched \u003ca href=\"http://libregraphicsworld.org/\"\u003eLibre Graphics World\u003c/a\u003e (LGW) to deliver news on free software to a diverse group of users: photographers, graphic designers, illustrators, prepress engineers etc. Over the years the scope of the project got larger: video and audio editing, computer-aided drafting, 3D printing etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m using Patreon to fund my work on this online magazine and expand it, so that more people would get involved with writing in-depth articles and tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S SO SPECIAL ABOUT LIBRE GRAPHICS WORLD?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLGW delivers in-depth coverage of topics related to free graphics, audio, video, and CAD software.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNews posts on LGW typically go beyond a mere list of changes: \u003ca href=\"http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/gimp-2.8-understanding-ui-changes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efeatures get explained\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/krita-2.6-released\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edevelopers get interviewed\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eControversial topics like the \u003ca href=\"http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/whats-up-with-dwg-adoption-in-free-software\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDWG support in free/libre software\u003c/a\u003e are covered with input from all involved parties whenever possible.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHot topics like a \u003ca href=\"http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/the-complete-story-of-paris-8-university-going-for-krita-blender-natron\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhole faculty of a university moving to Blender, Krita, and Natron\u003c/a\u003e get an insightful interview with project initiator rather than a skimpy news post.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe website regularly features large above-the-fold banners for ongoing crowdfunding campaigns by projects like Krita, Blender, MuseScore/OpenScore and others, completely free of charge for the projects (hit me up, if you have an interesting campaign).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn a nutshell, I\u0027ve been operating Libre Graphics World on the principle that users deserve responsible, insightful coverage of events that matter to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHAT\u0027S THE PLAN WITH PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning Libre Graphics World as a one-man show in spare time is not sustainable at all. Moreover, while I\u0027m generally good at covering a diversity of topics as a journalist and tinkerer, I\u0027ll never be a professional architect or an amazing VFX artist. Hence I\u0027d rather be paying to people with lots of hands-on experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few years,\u00a0I privately talked to some prominent figures in the community like David Revoy, Pat David, and Guillermo Espertino about how this project could be funded. Basically, we all agreed that introducing a paywall would be a complete and utter disaster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m using Patreon instead. Step 1 is getting me to a point where I can give this project my full attention, and step 2 is getting more people involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also step 0.5 or maybe 1.5: redesigning and rebranding LGW. The project stopped being about just the graphics about 6 months into its existence. The name change has been long overdue, and I have just the domain name to honor the whole diversity of topics. The current CMS has to be done away with as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and one last thing. Since 2011, I\u0027ve been using AdSense to monetize the magazine. The income covered technical bills like the annual domain name update and web hosting. I mostly spent the residual for recurring donations \u2014 Ardour, Blender Foundation, the past Synfig Studio campaigns at Indiegogo, David Revoy\u0027s Patreon etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that my Patreon campaign is live, I pulled the ads altogether. However, I expect to continue supporting all these projects, and \u2014 with your help\u00a0\u2014 increase my donations. I\u0027m keeping the door open for sensible ads from vendors who are friendly to the free software community though. And the banners for interesting FOSS crowdfunding campaigns go free, same as usual.\u003cbr\u003e"
