We do not wish to depend on financial donations from the hard working and valued members of our communities. Part of this community project is bringing forth other ways to crowdsource projects like Plan B; why don\u2019t we do things to give back to our community supporters by offering packages? That is why we are using a platform like Patreon that offers us opportunities to give back to our patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you using any other source to fund Plan B?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn these early stages before we incorporate, there is not very many options to fund the smaller expenses like venue spaces, printing, artist or musician fees, application and processing fees, or even bus tickets and food. We are continually researching grants to apply to and have been collecting small funds through a change drive at any event we have. This Patreon platform is an addition to the many ways we are taking to make Plan B.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho has access to the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, our Patreon is hooked up to our PayPal account.

     "about": "We\u0027re under construction: we\u0027re developing into something big. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlan B in brief is an alternative queer community space byqueer folks for queer folks. We\u0027re developing our organization into a not-for-profit worker co-operative. We\u0027re aiming to merge three key elements in our day-to-day operations: part resource center and people\u0027s photocopier, part coffee shop and community event space, and part feminist sex toy store. We\u0027re aiming to provide sliding scale printing, a community zine library, alternative education and programming, and offer items such as binders and ethical harnesses for queer bodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe long-term strategic goal is to develop a strong membership drive that will sustain us as an organization and enable us to develop a foundation. The foundation\u0027s vision is to fund the unfundable; provide financial support to queer and trans folks who need to travel in between cities for doctors appointments, or even assist in legal name change processes, and even help medical coverage like hormones or surgeries for queer and trans folks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur community is one of the largest queer communities outside of Toronto. Even then, how do we have access to sexual health and resources that are anti-oppressive, anti-capitalist, queer centered and body positive? Especially for trans and non-binary persons; how can we access ethical, sex positive and gender affirming resources? The internet is a costly adventure and traveling to Toronto\u0027s own \"Come As You Are\" is often inaccessible. We have to either purchase things online or take entire days out of our lives to get access to things. These are huge barriers. Why can\u0027t we offer queer spaces here in Kitchener-Waterloo rather than sending our members away to other cities, spaces or communities?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is nothing like this that exists; all the more reason for our Kitchener-Waterloo community to foreground something spectacular. We aren\u0027t here to make money. We\u0027re here to help and support our queer community in big and vulnerable ways. The only way we can succeed is if we have your support. Your feedback. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who are we? We\u0027re queer persons. We\u0027re lovers, fighters, workers, drop-outs, failures, artists, feminists, poets, researchers, complainers, survivors, and so much more. Join us in making Plan B a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter @planbcoopkw\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eplanbcoopkw@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003ePlan B Co-operative KW\u003cbr\u003eOrganizing Team",
