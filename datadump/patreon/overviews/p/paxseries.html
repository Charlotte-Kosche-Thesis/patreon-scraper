They tell me I\u0027m supposed to do an intro...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Alex, a lifelong writer and multimedia creative, currently based out of New York City. I spent the last 2 years working on building the PAX universe, and writing \u003cem\u003ePart One - Legacy of the Keyholders\u003c/em\u003e. It\u2019s truly a labor of love, which currently happens in my spare time, with money from my own pocket. When I\u2019m not writing, I do graphic and web design for clients, travel as much as I can, and nerd out researching ancient ruins and languages! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePAX is my first big fiction release. I\u0027ve published a lot of copy, non-fiction, poetry, scripts and training materials in my day, but my secret dream is to write fiction full time. I guess that cat is out of the bag...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the idea for PAX first hit me, my goal was to create an experiential novel broken \ninto episodes people could read during a typical train commute. I wanted\n to connect with readers regularly, and include extras like \nillustrations, and music. I structured it to be delivered by email \n(which it still is), but I found Patreon, and I knew this was the place \nto connect with readers like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis series can only come to life because of readers such as yourself. If you are one of the wonderful humans pledging toward my passion, I pledge to return my gratitude in full force through the highest quality, fun content I can produce, using any and all resources I have at my disposal.

Each week, a new chapter will be released by email, and I\u0027ll put up corresponding posts featuring things like hi-res illustrations, soundtrack links, and snippets of working materials.

Through the subscription format, I could conceivably earn enough to give a raise to my illustrator and editor, cover costs of research, web hosting and software, as well as get out to bookstores, conferences and fairs. Of course, I keep a day gig to pay the bills, but if this grows to a reasonable level, I vow to write full time, and thanks to you, I\u0027d also be creating proper jobs for other creatives on the project!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eIt\u0027s a cool way to thank you for reading\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003ePatreon makes it possible for me to fast track episodes and extras into your hands, grow a community, and offer secure payment methods \u2013 without having to take away from writing time to invent that entire system. I\u0027m very thankful for it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, speaking of rewards, I\u2019ve started simple with 3 patron levels: Reader, Adventurer, and Influencer, all of which you can find in the rewards section. And... I\u0027ve stuffed them with as much content as I can on my current time and money budget. The more you put in, the more I\u0027ll reciprocate! For example, if PAX project hits its goals (check them out in the goals section), all kinds of fun stuff could happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, I\u0027m going to get back to writing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll step into the an adventure with me. At a dollar per episode, it\u0027s pretty approachable, and you\u0027ll keep the PAX universe alive (along with one writer\u0027s small world here in Brooklyn).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eAMV\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Influencers can vote on the order in which they get completed! Cards will include a profile and full body view plus the name, description, key episode appearances, and persona details for that character.\u003cbr\u003e",

This will include hiring a small cast of voice actors who will read one episode per installation, and arranging a brief guest feature which may include a discussion, reveal, or interview with creators of the art and music in the series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: Personally, I\u0027m super excited for this goal because I\u0027d like to make PAX available to people for whom audio delivery would be a better fit. Because nobody wants to hear these characters read by that robot dictation thingie. While I could read every character myself, I would much rather create jobs for some of the incredible voice talent out there! Plus, I promised you the highest quality materials I can create. Hitting $750 per creation would make this dream a reality, and bring the PAX universe to LIFE!\u003cbr\u003e",
