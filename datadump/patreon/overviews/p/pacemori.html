I go by many names on the internet (existential crisis, anyone?) depending on where you found me. I am, first and foremost, a writer who writes. Occasionally, I mutate into a writer who draws.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite books\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDraw comics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGo to college\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake people happy\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe able to support myself through my words\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may know me from AO3, AFF, Webtoons or Twitter. I am an author of these stories: \u003cem\u003eDefine Neverland, The Gravedigger, The Hand That Saves\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand so on\u003cem\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating things: stories and comics and occasionally videos. And I want to be able to gift these things to the world and to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many artists, my biggest fear is the idea of sacrificing between happiness and survival. So, I\u0027m asking you, as a friend and fellow human being, to help out an artist/writer/friend, and join this journey in creating amazing wonderful things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VBhF7Hx.jpg\" style=\"width: 298px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eIf you like what I do and want to help turn dream into reality, this is the time and place! Your heartfelt kindness and generosity are appreciated and will be remembered forever. Once you become a patron, you will of course be able to access these contents before anyone as well as have a say in what goes where. I love reading comments and feedback, and I\u0027m always open to suggestions! We can do a lot of fun things together, and I look forward to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that there are a lot of kind people in this world, and I want to meet them\u2014meet you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is my past lying bare before you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life, I have struggled with many problems, half of them have landed me in hospitals. For a long time, I was put on different sets of medication that turned me into a zombie. I couldn\u0027t think for myself, and any thoughts that came to me often slip through my fingers like water. I couldn\u0027t hold proper conversations because the medication made me forgetful. I would also often fall asleep and wake up screaming for no reason at all. That was how my teenage years went by, with grownups believing that my thoughts were dangerous and self-deprecating, and they found that it was better for me to exist without living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/79ZhbcU.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I was able to break free after five years. From seventeen pills a day to none at all, I no longer am a forced-medicated zombie living off anti-psychotics. Now, I have a lot to say, and the only way for me to be able to say them is through the words that I write. I want to change lives and give people hope and courage. For those, like me, who were told that they were born wrong, I want to give them a voice as much as I want one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople often speak of recovery, but nobody talks about what comes after recovery. The gap is too wide, how do people like me adjust to the non-neurotic world? I couldn\u0027t. For a long time, I didn\u0027t only struggle with getting back on my feet, I had to relearn how to walk all over again. Half a decade of my life had been stolen away by doctors and medication, and I can never get it back. But, I am far from bitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/g31oQ8a.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always have this darkness on my back, this fear of time running out. And even if social interactions are a gruelling task, I always do my best.\u00a0How do friendships work? Are these people laughing at me?\u00a0How should I answer this question? Is there poison behind this stranger\u0027s smile? I have come to love books because they help. They teach me how to act by simulating situations \u2014 dialogues, conflict, actions \u2014 and also consequences of each action. There is always a resolution, reasons that are clear. Books have helped me readjust to the normal world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I feel like I\u0027m droning on and on. I\u0027m going to stop now. This is my life so far. Now you know why I\u0027m here. I truly hope that you can relate to me. I want to help others, and I know that you do too. Because we are human beings, and we are born to care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eBoo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. Do support!\u003cbr\u003e"
