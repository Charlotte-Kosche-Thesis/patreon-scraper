    "summary": "Founded in 1965, \u003cem\u003ePoetry\nWales\u003c/em\u003e is published three times a year with\nan international reputation for excellent poems, features and reviews from\nWales and beyond. Emerging from a rich bilingual culture, \u003cem\u003ePoetry\nWales\u003c/em\u003e explores the diverse\nperspectives of Welsh poetry in English and its international relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIts interest in translation, and in local and\nnational identities in a global context, are at the forefront of some of the\nmost exciting developments in poetry today. The magazine is open to tradition\nand experiment, publishing poetry from a wide range of approaches. Against this\nbackground of dynamic contrast, it offers a lively and informed critical\ncontext for the best contemporary poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are looking at new ways to bring the magazine to a wider audience\nas well as providing our readers and supporters with something extra. We also\nneed to explore avenues of funding. We pride ourselves in keeping the\nmagazine as ad-free as possible so that the magazine is full to the brim with\ngood quality content and this is where Patreon comes in!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have many ambitions for the magazine but not enough funding with which to implement them. For example, we would like to upgrade our\nvery old website so that we have the capacity to be more dynamic with our\ncontent. We have very limited space within the magazine for reviews and there is so much good poetry out there. We would love to publish a weekly review online and be able to pay our reviewers. We would also like to take the\nmagazine on tour, create poetry events in Wales and beyond, attend festivals\nand create partnerships. It would also be great if we could afford to splash\nout on some advertising and afford some more staff time so we can produce\neven more content for our readers. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEssentially, we need your assistance to bring\nthese dreams to life! So that we can be a better magazine for you as an\navid poetry reader. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for coming here to support us, we hope\nyou will consider becoming part of this very special project. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith best wishes, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRebecca and Nia \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
