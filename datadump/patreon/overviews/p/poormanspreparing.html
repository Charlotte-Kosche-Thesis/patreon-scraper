Due to low income I always had to be creative and figure out how to use everyday items to find other uses for them, aka one mans trash....I also grew up loving to do things like fishing, hiking, and camping. All of this led me to create Poor Man\u0027s Preparing where I could share information, tips, product reviews, fishing videos, and how to videos as well. I have an 8 year old daughter who I am just trying to plant the tree that provides her with the shade she deserves in life while trying my best to help other be better prepared for all of the emergencies we all face in our lives. So join me on this adventure and help you and your family be better prepared today!",
