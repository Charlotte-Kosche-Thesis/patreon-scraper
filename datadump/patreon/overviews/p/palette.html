I can tell you that the answer is a resounding \"Yes!\"\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Palette Project\u003c/em\u003e is about a big idea - that losing sight doesn\u0027t mean letting go of a vision. My vision is to tell stories that change perceptions, raise expectations and make a difference. Every step of the way, it\u0027s an ongoing adventure - meeting people who challenge what it means to be blind, and who treat blindness as an inconvenience, but never an obstacle. Sailors, mountain climbers, entrepreneurs... these are the stories I love to tell.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0This is a journey that stands for much more than my story of being a visually impaired filmmaker. It has to, or I\u0027m not doing my job. I believe in being the storyteller, not the story, and there are just so many good stories to find and people to meet. \u00a0A story for each color in the painter\u0027s palette. And that\u0027s just the starting point! I hope you\u0027ll join me on this journey through, and beyond color."

As long as I\u0027ve been a photographer, an editor or anything else having to do with pictures, I\u0027ve also been living with a degenerative eye disease. In fact, it\u0027s possible I\u0027ll lose the rest of my eyesight while making this documentary and web series. But I love what I do, am still shooting what I can, editing, directing and working with a great team to bring our creative vision to life., I believe if you love what you do, you\u0027ll find a way forward, no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0Be the storyteller, not the story.
