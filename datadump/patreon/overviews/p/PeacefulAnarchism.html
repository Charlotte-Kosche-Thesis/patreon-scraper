    "summary": "Hello everybody. My name is Danilo Jeremy Cuellar. I am a\npractitioner of Eastern Healing arts with degrees in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal\nMedicine. I have always questioned the status quo, a path that led me to\nPeaceful Anarchism. Through my journey, I have worn many hats; that of a\nclassical pianist, avid chess player, amateur philosopher, stand up comedian,\nand now father of two little anarchists. My wife brands me as a Cultural\nCritic, but I am simply following my thirst for knowledge and passion for\nwriting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI make videos, podcasts, and write articles on Peaceful\nParenting, Attachment Parenting, Homeschooling, Unschooling, Austrian Economics,\nLibertarianism, Free Market Anarchy, Voluntaryism, and Stateless Societies. I\u2019m\na one-man team. I do everything myself. I would love to do this full time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am delighted to offer my content for free to all my\nfollowers and subscribers. This illustrates the beauty that is the spontaneous\norder of the Internet. Information that can be transmitted at lightning fast\nspeed online simply cannot compete with the dinosaur institutions of colleges\nand universities that, until recently, held an iron clad grip over the\ndissemination and free flow of information. We live in an epoch of\nunprecedented abundance and wealth. In the age of information, ignorance is a\nchoice. It\u2019s a beautiful time to be alive! :-)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough I do thoroughly enjoy offering my content for free,\nI do have inevitable opportunity costs, which must be sacrificed whenever I\ndevote time to writing articles, conducting interviews, engaging in podcasts,\nediting my videos, and posting my content. These are the realities of life,\nwhich I must contend with. If you derive some value or benefit from my content\nplease consider donating to me so that I can enthusiastically continue to produce\nthe best quality content my brain and soul can muster. There can be no monetary\nvalue placed on valuable knowledge and beneficial education so I leave this\npart up to you. Please feel free to donate whatever you feel I deserve for my\nefforts. My respect and love for the Free Market will always prevail. With your\ngenerosity I will always strive towards excellence in spreading what I believe\nto be the truth to those who are willing to listen. I don\u2019t recommend voting in\npolitics but voting with one\u2019s currency is one of the best ways to bring about\na better future. We financially support with our wealth that which we would\nlike to see succeed and flourish. That is the Free Market supporting quality! That\nis win-win!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you all for taking the time to visit my Patreon page.\nI truly appreciate your interest in what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPeace, Love, and Anarchy. :-)"
