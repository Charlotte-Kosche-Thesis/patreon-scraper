    "summary": "Hello Piggies,\u003cbr\u003e\nAs many of you know I make \u003cem\u003eadult hypnotic\u003c/em\u003e recordings with \u003cem\u003epig themes\u003c/em\u003e. I love what I do!  It brings me\nsuch satisfaction to see \u003cem\u003epiggies wallowing\u003c/em\u003e in the \u003cem\u003epig pleasure\u003c/em\u003e of \u003cem\u003eaccepting\u003c/em\u003e their \u003cem\u003edesires\u003c/em\u003e. I have made quite a few good friends and met\nquite a few interesting people from my \u003cem\u003ehypnotic\u003c/em\u003e work.  I would like\nto \u003cem\u003econtinue making hypnotic files\u003c/em\u003e for as long as I can. The one on\none work I have been doing regularly for the past couple months has\nreally \u003cem\u003eimproved\u003c/em\u003e my skills, and I would like to take my file making to\nthe next level and produce some really \u003cem\u003ehigh quality powerful hypnosis files. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you already know, \u003cem\u003esafety\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eethics\u003c/em\u003e are really important to me, so for this reason its really\ncritical that all subjects are over 21 years of age. Due to the \u003cem\u003elife altering powers\u003c/em\u003e of \u003cem\u003ehypnosis\u003c/em\u003e I do not feel comfortable working with\nsubjects younger than that. There are also some subjects I do not\nfeel comfortable putting out in a general release file, but that I\nmight feel comfortable doing one on one. One of my main requirements\nfor hypnosis is that it should not interfere with you holding a job,\nor living a normal life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith hypnosis it\u0027s really easy to get\npeople hooked on shelling out money for recordings, but ethically\nthat is like nails on a chalkboard for me. Even though I believe in\nthe concept that everyone\u0027s time has value, I don\u0027t really like the\nidea of selling my hypnosis. What I much prefer is the concept of,\n\u201cif you like what I do, and it improves your life, donate what you\nthink its worth.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not expecting to get rich off\nthis, or even make minimum wage for the time I put in to making this\nwork. However, donations will help me justify the time I spend making\nthese files, and will let me know that there are people out there who\nare enjoying them enough to support what I do. This is not a pay wall\nfor my work, everything I make will still be available for free, and\nmany of the benefits I mention here are available, even if you cant\npay for them, but this will help make it possible for me to devote\nthe time that everyone deserves. If you enjoy my work, please \u003cem\u003econsider supporting\u003c/em\u003e it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cem\u003epersonal goal\u003c/em\u003e is to put out at least\none really \u003cem\u003ehigh quality hypnosis file\u003c/em\u003e a month. In addition to that I\ndo \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of one on one \u003cem\u003epig training\u003c/em\u003e, mostly through twitter. If you\nhave an after dark twitter, and I see you moving towards your \u003cem\u003epig goals\u003c/em\u003e, I will give you words of encouragement. I am also\nexperimenting with using motivational image macros with hypnotic\ncontent on twitter, so far the results are promising, but I am always \u003cem\u003elooking\u003c/em\u003e for new \u003cem\u003etest subjects. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are worried that I will produce\ntoo many files at once there is a way to cap the payments so it only\ngoes out once a month, I recommend that for the higher donation\ntiers.  With the exception of the custom tailored safety net, or\nany other file where I use your name, if I make a loop for you, or an\nedited version of a file I may release it publicly. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessor Pig-\u003cbr\u003e"
