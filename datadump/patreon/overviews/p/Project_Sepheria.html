I know, right? You\u0027re probably thinking \"What? He doesn\u0027t \u003cem\u003elook\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0disabled.\" Well, this \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e what \u003cstrong\u003edisabled\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0looks like. In January, 2017, my life took a sharp left into the danger zone. I went from being able to work 40- 60 hour work weeks, in a warehouse and restaurant (and still hitting the gym once a week) last Summer, to my doctor telling me I needed to stop working and referring me to more specialists than I\u0027d ever seen by Winter. Slowly, I had to stop doing many of the things I loved--most of which involved high functioning motor skills and mobility. I love to cosplay and create, but I no longer had the energy for a full convention; my body only being able to go through one full day at max. I stopped being able to go out and enjoy myself with friends nearly as much. My friends and sister were worried sick. I was 180 in January and had dropped to 150 March. Even though I was (and still am) seeing multiple specialists, every one involved has been grasping at straws and putting out fires. Thankfully I\u0027ve been blessed enough to have had some of the most competent medical specialists on the east coast (even Ben Carson, before he retired) handling my case, but even then it was proving to not be enough. Many of the medications I needed to take conflicted with each other, I was allergic to, or simply didn\u0027t work. My body could no longer tolerate the side effects of over the counter pain medicine, and the weekly IV treatments that I needed had side effects that were very similar to chemotherapy. My days started with waking up at 5am with uncontrollable hiccups along with an inflamed liver and morning sickness. My body was weak. I was lucky enough to get sleep as the excruciating pain would keep my awake for days at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn top of my own internal and physical struggles suddenly I had been categorized into a whole other side of society. No one, and I mean really \n\u003cem\u003eno one\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0seemed to know how to handle a disabled person. I lost quite a few friends in the process as it seemed to hard to grasp that the same healthy and \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eable\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0Mason that they knew for so long would not be coming back after a few weeks; this wasn\u0027t the flu. My disabilities were constantly questioned, the validity of my symptoms doubted because I chose to suffer in privacy and strove to look and be as \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eable passing \u003c/i\u003eas possible. It appears to be very difficult for able-bodied individuals to cope with the failures of modern medicine. By that I mean, a stranger would rather believe that you simply must be taking care of yourself incorrectly and not doing enough than to believe that situations such as my own really happen every day. Suddenly all the self reassuring and ableist things said by my peers were now aimed at me and applied to me. Of course, the constant (and often accidental) invalidation began to take a heavy toll on my mental health.\u00a0Obviously something had to give.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn February I took up herbalism and holistic medicine, starting up an apothecary. Every day, since most days I was bed ridden or confined to my room, was spent researching my symptoms and conditions, consulting with my doctors about supplements and learning how to create basic medicine for myself from scratch. I have been pagan for many years and finally I had a productive reason to pursue wortcunning as well. I changed my diet and habits and soon my health stabilized and some of my symptoms could be temporarily alleviated or even managed by things that I was creating from plants and alcohol. Needless to say my doctors were ecstatic. They were also ecstatic when they found out I had begun smoking cannabis.\u00a0Cannabis was the most effective plant and medicine. \u003cbr\u003eNo really. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eLet me give you a list:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eComplex Migraines \u0026lt;--\u003c/em\u003eThese bad boys mimic seizures if I get too stressed out\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eChronic Pain\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eFibromayalgia\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003ePTSD\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eChiari Malformation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnxiety\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDepression\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eUncontrollable nausea and\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003evomiting\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eTremors\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eNeuropathy\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eTrichotillomania\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDermatographia\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDizziness\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoint Pain and Stiffness\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlpha Thalassemia\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnemia\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eInsomnia\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eInflammation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003ea whole lot of other wacky unexplained and debilitating symptoms\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nI had spent years trying experimental and mainstream pharmaceuticals like Lyrica, Gabapentin, Cymbalta, and Savella had proved to be completely useless or caused adverse side effects such as allergic reactions. Cannabis aided if not completely alleviated many of the symptoms I dealt with on a daily basis. On top of that, I could make extremely effective herbal medicine for just about any issue out of cannabis and its byproducts. \u00a0Now came the biggest issue: \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe most effective medication available for my conditions, praised by all my doctors, was \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eillegal.\u00a0\u003c/i\u003eIs \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0illegal in the majority of my home country.

My illnesses are debilitating, however I have the privilege of keeping a lot of my skills, talents and passions and I intend to use them to help not just myself but my communities as well.\u00a0In my home state I did a lot of activist and advocacy work, planning grassroots projects involving fighting ableism, racism, and classism. I unfortunately had to leave some of it behind, but I\u0027m determined to hit the ground running here in Seattle and it\u0027s surrounding areas. If we can get Project Sepheria to be self sustaining, these dreams will no doubt become reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI had been working with others to set up funding for community gardens that would contain medicinal herbs and free instructive classes teaching the general public how to make simple and effective medicine for just a couple of dollars--especially in low income areas. I dream of a world where people can grow a months supply of their own medicine in their kitchen for a max of $10, instead of choosing between paying rent or affording their $150 anti-inflammatory. I intend to team up with other local and eventually national organizations to do as much in my power to make that from an improbable dream to a practical reality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBlogging. Yes that\u0027s right, blogging. It\u0027s the most efficient way to communicate, network, and create a solid platform for my projects in the 21st century. I will be putting some of the patron donations towards maintaining a blog/website that will not only keep track of my projects and videos, but will be an extensive resource of information for QUILTBAG, PoC, and disabled individuals as well as our allies. No one truly wants to believe that their loved ones that don\u0027t understand their illness simply don\u0027t care, but unlearning ignorance takes work and accessible resources.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m a digital and traditional artist.

My, as well as the rest of the artists that I recruit\u0027s, creations will be available in reward tiers. I don\u0027t plan to just stop there. Soon, after my health is stabilized I will be returning to University to continue my education in Psychology and Media. My goal is to gain the means to create the kind of emotional and cathartic connections as well as provide the type of groundbreaking representation for minorities, mental illness, and disabilities that we\u0027re beginning to see more often in series\u0027 like \n\u003cem\u003eThe Walking Dead, The OA, \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e Sense8\u003c/em\u003e. I intend to gather a team of individuals like myself in order to make the difference we never thought we could in this world. There are many people like me that are not privileged enough to be able-passing or whose voices are silenced by the louder, more able majority. I am going to amplify those voices with your help.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhile I was on the East coast I took part in a monthly Japanese style host club known as \"Red Royal Lounge\" as a host. I\u0027m into harajuku street fashion. I do fairy kei, V kei, decora, ouji, lolita, gyaru/o, and host. This may surprise you but the cosplay and fashion community has been a haven for marginalized groups for a very long time. The Red Royal lounge, however, specifically employed those marginalized groups, shining the spotlight on some of the most beautiful and talented people you\u0027ve ever met while bringing awareness at the same time. Now that I\u0027m on the West Coast, I intend to work with conventions such as Sakura Con to start a sister club to Red Royal with a QUILTBAG/disabled staff. \u00a0A portion of the proceeds will go towards supporting the club as well as the staffs efforts to raise the public awareness of intersectionality. All of the updates and promotional artwork will be posted here, and the hosts, along with myself will be posting videos here for our patrons. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCooking is one of my biggest passions. Along with making medicine, I am also learning and crafting healthy and medicinal recipes that I want to share with the world. Herbal medicine does not just come in the form of tinctures and teas. You can turn candies, dessert, and dinner into part of your health regimen just by changing some ingredients and it\u0027ll still taste great. Chances are it\u0027ll probably taste better. A portion of the proceeds will go towards culinary research and the eventual publication of a recipe book that features vegetarian, vegan, and allergy sensitive options as well. I will also be releasing recipes here for my patrons, even creating recipes for specific patrons that hit a certain reward tier, and sending off those completed products to those at higher reward tiers.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlong with a cook book, I will be working on a recipe book for potions, tonics, tinctures, poultices and more to be eventually published.
