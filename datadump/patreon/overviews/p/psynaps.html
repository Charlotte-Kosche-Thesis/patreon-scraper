But I am taking what we have learned from others, and making it even BIGGER. It would mean the beginning of the Psynaptic Gaming House and Media Center (or better known as the Fiber Farm Taco Mansion)! I realized this was not a fantasy when I talked with the community (you), and I found we already have many of the things we need to make this happen. I plan to see you there.\u003cbr /\u003e",
