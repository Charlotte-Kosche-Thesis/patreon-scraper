What do you do?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy name is Bryan Hermus, although I also go by \"Purple1222119\" in various places around the web as well. I am the creator of a digital orchestra that specializes in video game music! I take classic video game tracks and re-imagine them for an orchestral setting. Some of my works stay very true to the originals, while others can have some creative liberties to give them that real orchestral flair. Check out my YouTube channel linked on my page to really get a feel for my music!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy Patreon? Why do you want my money?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nCurrently, I\u0027m a college student without a steady job, pursuing music education. I would love to be able to support myself by creating music, but unfortunately, it takes a lot of time and effort, which is sparse nowadays. I recently upgraded my computer and my sample library, and now I have to worry about paying those off as well. The money I get from my Patreon will help me cover those costs and it will also help me to be able to devote more time to making videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eHow does the Patreon work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nYou can contribute to my cause by choosing a small amount of money to donate each time I release an arrangement. This process is handled by Patreon automatically. In addition, you can set limits to how much you are charged every month, so you don\u0027t get overwhelmed in case my rate of arranging gets dense. You can also opt out at any time. Patreon gives you a lot of control over how much and how often you contribute. In exchange, I can offer rewards in exchange for donations, such as free downloads, early access, and more! This way, not only are you contributing to my cause, but you also get exclusive stuff straight from me as a thank-you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eBe more specific about your tools! Where is my money going?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nRight now, my Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) is Podium Free, and the samples I use are \u003ca href=\"http://www.soundsonline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEastWest\u0027s professional orchestral samples.\u003c/a\u003e The EastWest instruments have a monthly fee, and also require a very capable computer, which I just recently purchased. So the money from the Patreon will be put towards those and other things that will assist me in creating my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy don\u0027t you just sell your music, instead of resorting to crowdfunding?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI\u0027d love to! However, the issue with that is my works are derivations of creations made by other people, and I legally just don\u0027t have the rights to sell some of the music I make. Through Patreon, I can still have my creations support me while respecting the rights and properties of everyone involved!\u003cbr\u003e"
