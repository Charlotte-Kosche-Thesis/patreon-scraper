    "summary": "I simply cannot describe the joy it brings me to create episodes of the Pro Painted Podcast. This endeavor grew from \ndecidedly random roots and involved that amazing social media tool - \nTwitter.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs some of you will be aware, I have frequented the Podcast world as an \noccasional addition to the (fantastic) podcast that is The Black Sun (\u003ca href=\"http://theblacksun.co.uk/\"\u003ehttp://theblacksun.co.uk/\u003c/a\u003e).\n With the demise of the regular host format, and Chris churning out \ngreat weekly content I felt a little lost and specifically missed the \ncamaraderie element of podcasting as a group.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen came Age of Sigbrah\u0027s Gary Hennessey (\u003ca href=\"https://ageofsigbrah.podbean.com/\"\u003ehttps://ageofsigbrah.podbean.com/\u003c/a\u003e)\n and a small comment on Twitter where he suggested me, Rob Ellis and Ian\n Gilmore do a podcast. I liked the idea, laughed, put it from my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen some people commented on twitter. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou people\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e are the reason this podcast exists, the support, comments, feedback, conversations, questions, chats in person and online have encouraged and nurtured us to release our podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003eIt has now been 6 months since I first contacted Rob Ellis and Ian Gilmore to start the ball rolling on this adventure, we now have 7 episodes live on Podbean, and we are now following a 2 weeks schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the next step in our journey, we want to put out the best and most informed content we can, however it has become evident that there is a much higher cost to this than we expected. Games Workshops release schedule is so impressive that we simply cannot keep up. This is where we turn to our fans, we need your support to grow. However this is not the only goal, we aim to move into video content shortly as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to working with you all!\u003cbr\u003e"
