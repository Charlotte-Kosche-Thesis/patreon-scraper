Art\u0027s domain is the human heart, the last common ground in which substantive conversation can exist between people who might otherwise find themselves in opposition. Our effort is to support grassroots-level Literature, Visual Arts, Music, Theatre, comedy, as well as nonprofits, and to provide them an unprecedented\u00a0mainstream media opportunity at a time when funding for the Arts is at a critical low. This was always a community effort, which is why your support is so important.\u00a0To say thank you, the creators of the show, Kerri Kendall, Sid Yiddish and WC Turck have added some great incentives.. \u00a0\u00a0"
