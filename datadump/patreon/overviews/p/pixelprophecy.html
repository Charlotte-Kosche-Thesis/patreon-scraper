    "summary": "Hello there, ladies, gentlemen, and unicorns! My name is Phil but many probably know me under my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMFVcnkIM5L4V8fA24C51g\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e\u2019s name, \u003cstrong\u003ePixel Prophecy\u003c/strong\u003e, which is also my game-making label.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI live in Salzburg, Austria, and I am a restless creative soul with a very special place for everything games in my heart. But not merely playing games, I always found \n\u003cstrong\u003emaking games\u003c/strong\u003e even more thrilling. I started out with BASIC on the legendary Commodore 64, moved on to QuickBASIC, then Klik\u0027n\u0027Play, and after some detours arrived at Game Maker and Unity. Then I found out about Ludum Dare, the tri-annual global game-jam and have been hooked ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI not only enjoy making games in my spare time, I also have fun in putting lots of time and effort into \n\u003cstrong\u003emaking videos about making games\u003c/strong\u003e, such as my game-jam experiences. This is probably where you know me from, if you do. If not, here\u0027s how this looks like:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWWBb_Lzc9g\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy videos take \n\u003cstrong\u003emuch time and effort\u003c/strong\u003e, for example, on the latest Ludum Dare video I worked around 400 hours from shoot to upload. Also, I never shy away from neither effort nor money for a stupid little joke, even if that means buying a particularly stupid hat or doing intricate visual effects work. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to that, I also make \u003cstrong\u003etutorials and educational videos\u003c/strong\u003e on the whole indie-game making thing, like how certain things work, how to setup a Game Maker project, or what lens flares actually are, for example:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OaHVdA8KLtw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have plans for more formats, maybe a series where I look at a certain game from all angles, gameplay, mechanics, historical context, technology, and critical evaluation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy I\u2019m on Patreon\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u2019ve grown increasingly frustrated with how YouTube handles their content creators and how much unwanted ads I need to stuff into my videos in the hopes of getting a little bit in return. I want to continue \n\u003cstrong\u003emaking videos relevant to any aspiring game designer\u003c/strong\u003e, certainly not YoutTube\u0027s advertisers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I know that not everyone who wants to is in a position to comfortably pledge a monthly amount, I want to keep my stuff \u003cstrong\u003efreely accessible to anyone\u003c/strong\u003e, patron or not. I am positive that there are enough good people who want to support what I am doing and in the process allow me to make my stuff even better and more accessible for anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u2019s in for you?\u003c/h3\u003e\nSince rewards aren\u0027t \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0important to most patrons, and I don\u0027t want to lock my content away behind a paywall, the rewards I offer are more on a \u003cstrong\u003enice-to-have\u003c/strong\u003e basis but not essential to enjoying my content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can read about the rewards on right, but in general I am thinking about offering\u00a0polls about what videos you want to see produced next, little behind-the-scenes clips and commentary tracks to my videos, downloads to my music, Q\u0026amp;As, that sorta stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if that sounds good to you, then feel free to chip in. Every contribution is highly appreciated and if you are still reading this, you\u2019re bored apparently and should think about making a game instead. It\u0027s gonna be great, believe me! :)"
