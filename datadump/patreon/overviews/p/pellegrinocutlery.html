I take plain bars of steel and turn them into functional sculpture that transcend the everyday tool you have come to know in your kitchen, garage or even your pocket. My blades are made completely by hand, built to last generations, not to simply dull and rust in a drawer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bad2ce6b8f5b88ec35aa91/598f00232994ca79772fd036/5a12ebfce4966b5d537fb67b/1511189505620/frenchDP_cover.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am making videos to educate, enlighten and showcase my craft for the world to see. I am in the process of growing my business and your support will help me to continue making videos of new knife builds, cover new topics and bring you along as I dive into the macrocosm of knife and tool making.
