    "summary": "Disclosure: I HATE ASKING FOR MONEY AND TALKING ABOUT MYSELF.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that we have that out of the way, hi! I\u0027m Patrick Watson and I like to write about things I find interesting and amusing in astrology, occasionally in a ribald fashion on my site, www.bigfatastro.com. Low-brow humor meets high-brow content, funny on the surface, hopefully profound beneath. Improbably, it seems there are a fair number of you out there who are fond of what I put out. I\u0027m also really fond of putting out. Articles. Putting out articles. And videos now too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me tell you a bit about myself. I\u0027m a married father of three children, and I support us with my three jobs - my day job as a music teacher, my part-time gig as an accompanist, and thankfully, by fans of the blog who contact me for consultations. My wife supports us with her two jobs - as a full-time homemaker and part-time as the head of a performing arts non-profit organization. Despite our efforts, we have to stretch and hustle to make each month work. If it sounds like we\u0027re juggling a lot, it\u0027s because you can read and make accurate deductions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027How on earth are you finding time to write these articles or do...anything?\u0027 you may be asking. I literally do not know. And by literally I mean not literally. My wife is very, uh, patient. I have to do some of the writing in my head in spare moments so I spend as little time on the computer as possible, often very early in the morning or very late at night.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe articles that people seem to enjoy are truly a labor of love. Articles like \u00275 Ways to Deal With Having a Chart That Sucks\u0027 and \u002710 Problems Astrologers Have That Are Just The Worst\u0027 were possible because of sacrificing precious time and sleep. Nabbing celebrity birth times also take patience, money and time to find the right opportunities, as does making prediction posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes all of this is my choice - but if you like my articles and want to ensure that I keep coming out with new stuff, a dollar per article would grease the wheels a bit. Baste the turkey. Moisten the folds. Do you smell what I\u0027m stepping in? You are on Patreon y\u0027know, this is sort of the whole point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill not convinced? Well you\u0027ve left me no choice but to use the one ironclad argument that can never logically fail: Aw, c\u0027mon man!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell it\u0027s settled then! Support me with even just a dollar per article, and I promise to keep pulling the good stuff out of my ass. The ass of my head. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

Let\u0027s get real. I have a full time job as a teacher. I have three kids. I\u0027m running a performing arts non-profit. I LOVE writing the articles and researching astrological issues, but I\u0027m going to need some love and encouragement from some of my fans to keep this train going. If you wanted to put in just a dollar for each article I put out, I promise to keep pumping out high-qual stuff for everyone to enjoy.",
