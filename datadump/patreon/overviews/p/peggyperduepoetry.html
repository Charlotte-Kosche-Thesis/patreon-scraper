I wanted to create art and poetry. And Patreon believes in the things I do: That art is needed. It is valuable. And the starving artist is a myth that needs to be destroyed. I need TIME to do my work. I\u0027ve tried over and over and over to do something that paid for me to do my art, but it just kept cutting into my time.
