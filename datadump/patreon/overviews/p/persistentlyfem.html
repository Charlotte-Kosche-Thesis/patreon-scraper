I use the name \u0027persistently fem\u0027 as an online handle in order to present my various writings about the butch \u0026amp; fem identities. I am a \u003cstrong\u003e38 year old lesbian fem\u003c/strong\u003e (conventionally spelt \u0027femme\u0027) living in \u003cstrong\u003eSydney, Australi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ea\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elike most people, my journey through life has been complicated and often fraught. I\u0027ve had some eye-opening experiences and have plenty of wild stories to tell.\u00a0I\u0027ve \u003cstrong\u003ebeen a sex worker for twenty years\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and am currently transitioning out by \u003cstrong\u003eestablishing my own beauty business \u003c/strong\u003ein the wake of FOSTA/SESTA. I\u0027ve had \u003cstrong\u003ea sugar daddy who died very dramatically\u003c/strong\u003e, had \u003cstrong\u003etwo stalkers\u003c/strong\u003e, been a \u003cstrong\u003efamous costumed performer\u003c/strong\u003e and that\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg! I am \u003cstrong\u003ehealing from c-ptsd caused by severe trauma\u003c/strong\u003e. this healing process has led to a lot of reflection on my life and experiences and how they intersect with my identity. \u003cstrong\u003eas a result, I have found myself moved to give voice to my musings, and to share them with the global community of butches and fems\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THIS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein recent years, my sense of identity and self has experienced erasure in contemporary LGBT \u0026amp; queer community simultaneously alongside abuse and trauma. the need to reclaim space as a butch-exclusive old school stone fem lesbian has felt essential to improving my well-being and has provided rich motivation for my work. \u003cstrong\u003emy writing is dedicated to all butches and fems\u003c/strong\u003e who have found themselves alienated by these modern times - who need some of the old ways to live on still.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emy work\u003c/strong\u003e includes\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003epersonal reflections, essays, photographs, stories both true and fictional (usually inspired by truth), poetry and historical resources\u003c/strong\u003e - all of it on the \u003cstrong\u003ebutch and fem lesbian identities\u003c/strong\u003e. I write from my perspective as an old-school fem lesbian, \u003cstrong\u003ein loving appreciation of our history and with the desire to express what fem identity means to me, and the enduring value of butch-fem culture\u003c/strong\u003e. examples of this can be seen in pieces like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/the-old-butch-way/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe old butch way\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2017/07/04/old-fashioned-old-school/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eold-fashioned old-school\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/that-moment/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efine\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI bring a feminist, progressive, radically-left perspective to my writing and often cover topics that are absent from the modern discourse. examples can be seen in my pieces dedicated to the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2018/02/21/stone-and-what-it-means-to-give/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estone experience\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2018/03/25/hunger/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efem hunger\u003c/a\u003e, and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2017/12/12/on-claiming-fem/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunspoken challenge many fems face in our identities\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been active in butch-fem community for a long time and have devoted a lot of energy to \u003cstrong\u003ecollecting and curating resources, doing research and getting to know other butches and fems from different generations\u003c/strong\u003e. I bring my varied and vast experience to all my work and \u003cstrong\u003eseek to share with others materials and information that will help broaden and develop their own knowledge of our history and culture\u003c/strong\u003e. I believe that doing this is important and significant, as it keeps \u003cstrong\u003eour community alive and thriving\u003c/strong\u003e. with many seminal works out of print and the generation gap that separates us, many young butches and fems have difficulty accessing the resources that best speak to them and their experience. in addition to my original writing, I try to bridge this gap by providing as much guidance as I can to accessing the artefacts of our history. an example of this is a short piece on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2018/04/03/cunt-colouring-book/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTee Corinne and her Cunt Colouring Book\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentlyfem.wordpress.com/2017/08/09/bulldagger-of-the-season-honey-lee-cottrell/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHoney Lee Cottrell\u0027s Bulldagger of the Season\u003c/a\u003e.

I believe it is small measures like this that truly help our community to thrive, develop and grow - life under capitalism makes it challenging for queer artists to commit to our creative processes in amidst managing obligations. the more we help each other out, the more queer art gets made!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHATS IN IT FOR YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emost butches and fems will agree - there is just not enough raunchy content out there to suit our desires! a lot of it can be hard to get hold of, in out of print books, and what\u0027s online can be wildly varying in quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehealing has brought me back in touch with desire and this is a theme I explore a lot in my work. I believe the blatant erotic energy of the butch-fem dynamic is a powerful expression of lesbian desire and is a central aspect of our identities. all of my work is made freely available online for others to enjoy, however -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a skilled writer of explicit erotica and I want to show those who support me here on patreon a little appreciation! that\u0027s why those who contribute $5 or more per month will have exclusive access to hardcore authentic butch-fem smut, written to satisfy old-school desires and unstinting in detail and imagination.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eevery month I will publish a new erotic story available exclusively to my patrons. these stories will explore butch-fem sexuality in all kinds of erotic scenarios, from the romantic and tender, to the kinky and wild (and both at the same time!). I love to write explicitly, as I often find erotica for women can be skimpy on details. my stories are designed to make your thighs clench and your heart skip - they\u0027re hotter than hell and entirely focused on butches and fems enjoying every inch of each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ehelping with bills and necessary subscriptions and fees,\u00a0paying for supplies and equipment for my beauty business, groceries and anywhere else it stretches.\u003cbr\u003eas time goes on and I become more stable and build up my patron base, ideally it will also assist in paying my rent, as well as costs incurred by working on this project - such as purchasing materials for my own collection.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
